            "answer_text": "Almost every college has a mental health clinic comprised of psychologists, social workers, and mental health counselors; those very small colleges will still have professionals outside of the college that are \u201ccontracted\u201d with the school to see students. Many students do not even know their college has these free services. Unfortunately, they aren\u2019t \u201cadvertised\u201d much on campus. These clinics also are where clinical and school psychology grad students fulfill their training requirements. As such, if you go to your college\u2019s clinic, you may either get a licensed professional or a trainee. The trainees are usually very eager and well-supported by their supervisors, so I wouldn\u2019t be so uninclined to see one if I were a student in need of help. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, not enough. When I was in college, I went once to a psychologist at the student health center. I didn\u2019t like her much. When my elder child went to college, he had a long history of needing regular therapy. They only had short term therapy and a possible support group. He would have had to go off campus to get regular therapy, which he wasn\u2019t willing to do. It wasn\u2019t very satisfactory. ",
