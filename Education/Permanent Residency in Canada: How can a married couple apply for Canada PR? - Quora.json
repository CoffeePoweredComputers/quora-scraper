Get your educational credentials assessed by WES and (both PA & Spouse) appear for IELTS and obtain 6.5 minimum in each module. The more you score in IELTS, more will be your CRS score. Once both the above got done and you\u2019ve the Certificates in hand, you (Spouse having highest points can be PA) can register yourself into Express Entry pool. If your CRS score is more than 440-450, you are surely to be picked up by CIC in their draws which is being held twice a month.

Before you start all these process, go to Google and type CRS score calculator and you can find out what will be your approximate CRS score. ",
