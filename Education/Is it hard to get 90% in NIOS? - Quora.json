            "answer_text": "Well I wrote NIOS SENIOR SECONDARY Exams this year (APRIL 2019). I Opted for TOC , had to appear only for MATHS, English , ENVIRONMENT SCIENCE. Like you all I was also very tensed about NIOS grading trend and practice's as most of the answers here on Quora said it's very strict.. not systematic.. and what not!!!! I submitted my tma on time and wrote the practical exam for Environmental Science. MATHS - Yes like many of you I was very afraid of Maths. I started studying in the month of October (2018). I wrote the exam\u2026paper was not that hard but to my surprise when I asked for supplementary sheet they DENIED!!!!!\u2026..till then I had attempted for about 64 MARKS,when the result came out I got 62(as expected)English- The paper was tough especially the grammar part. I was pretty sure that I would be getting 85+ but less than 90\u2026\u2026.. I got a 97\u2026.!!!!!!!!!!!!!Environmental Science-I opted for this subject because I thought it would be easy and scoring. This was my worst decision. I Started studying for the exam 4 days before and when I opened the book I realized my mistake. The syllabus was so vast and confusing (upsc cse level).I was very sure that I would be failing the paper but I didn't loose hope and tried my best. I studied in a way that I could pass(optional module and 2 more units).In the Examination I knew only for 50 marks but I had in my mind that I would be attempting the full paper. My focus was on the presentation I wrote in blue and black ink underlined after each answer and finally attempted the full paper\u2026. When the result came out I got 93\u2026\u2026!!!!!! I was really happy and confused at same time(thinking how had this happened)I was not knowing that in NIOS We could actually enroll for 7 subjects out of which we need to pass 5 for certification\u2026\u2026KINDLY MAKE USE OF IT AND CHOOSE EASY SUBJECT THAT WOULD LIFT YOUR PERCENTAGE AND HELP YOU PASS!!! SUGGESTIONS- HomeScience, Data Entry Dont be afraid\u2026 Attempt all the Questions\u2026.. keep your presentation neat and tidy\u2026.. I am sure you will get good marks SOMETIMES BEYOND YOUR EXPECTATION!!!!\ud83d\ude01 ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think we can measure the hardness of any exam. What we can is to compare with other exams. It can not be exactly said how hard it is. It is just a personal feelings which differs for different persons. Here are some good plans to be a top scorer in NIOS: As nobody is there to guide you throughout your study you have to be a self learner.You have to invest more time than a regular students in a topic to understand it. So give sufficient time in your study.Collect all the previous year question papers from the official website of NIOS. Then make a seperate notebook in each subject and write the questions and the corresponding answers chapterwise.When you have done this, no need to open books thereafter, just follow the notebooks and practise more and more as many as you can.Also note that before doing the notebooks you have to throughoutly read the text books to understand the topics. Only then you will be able to complete the answers cently in the notebooks.Prepare TMA in each subject as 20% weightage is given in each subject for TMA in final mark sheet.Prepare your practical notebooks. For this you can seek help from the teachers of your study centre.Three marks are alloted in each practical exam for preparing notebooks. Most students don't do this. If you do you can get an edge over others.Study short questions and answers corresponding to practical topics for the Viva sessions of practical exam. Most importantly be quick and correct while answering Viva questions.Always follow the official website,specially student information section to stay updated and also you will find study materials, previous year question papers,model question papers,TMA papers etc.Also prepare for model question papers if you have time after doing previous year papers.For the subject of math a rigorous practise is needed.Lastly just keep in mind that \u2018 Success comes from hard work'. All the best.",
