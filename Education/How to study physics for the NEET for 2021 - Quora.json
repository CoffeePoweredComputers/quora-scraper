            "answer_text": "Hello The Physics portion is the hardest of all the sections and needs thorough knowledge of each and every subject. This segment contains 45 questions, with 180 marks, dominated by topics like Electrostatics, Mechanics and Electronics If you think this is the area in which you are not that strong then you need to do it daily. Make notes and study. The best way to score high marks in physics is to study each chapter with complete commitment and twice clear the whole concept. Formulas are Physics 's backbone. The most critical step in preparing NEET Physics is learning the Formulas. So, every day try to understand those formulas. Solve as many mock tests and past years papers as you can. You can refer to these books- 1. Concept of Competition Physics for CBSE PMT by Aggarwal\u2019s 2. NCERT- Physics Part 1 and Part 2 3. Concepts of Physics by H.C. Verma 4. NCERT Physics: CBSE PMT set of 3 Volumes by Anil Aggarwal The secret to your success in physics is practice and practice. You can follow Toppr- the better learning app for more information about NEET preparation. Keep working. Hope this was helpful:) All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello..so considering the rank inflation and many students scoring exceptionally well in biology and chemistry..it is very important for you to score well in physics..so coming to your question.. Know important chapters\u20261stly complete them..(80/20 rule)OpticsElectronic devices+ modern physicsElectromagnetism+ACRotational dynamicsCurrent electricity etc.2. SOLVE NEET 33 YEARS (MANY OF THE QUESTIONS ARE ACTUALLY FROM SAME CONCEPT OF PREVIOUS YEARS) 3. SOLVE AIIMS PYQ (IN CASE NTA WANT TO MAKE PHYSICS A LITTLE TOUGH) 4. Solve ncert exempler\u2026 5. Read the physics ncert book at least once to know some lines\u2026points to ponder and summary are must.. 6. Solve MTG NEET GUIDE as you have time left.. These are some of my tips to score well..work smart which includes hard work in right direction.. If u have problems..feel free to dm me.. Hope it helps\u2026!!\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17 ",
