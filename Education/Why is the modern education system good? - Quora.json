            "answer_text": "There are some definite indications that establish why the modern education system is quite better than what we had a couple of decades ago. Let us look at this question objectively, considering the factors that are applicable globally. The advancements in technology have had a transformative impact on education like every other sector globally. The role of modern technology as an enabler of education is indisputable. The increasing popularity of digital classrooms has enabled students to grasp difficult concepts with ease. For instance, compare explaining the pattern of planetary winds to students on a whiteboard with an illustrated video. The latter makes it easy to understand the phenomena that are difficult to observe and analyze with naked eyes. Second, the Internet provides access to thousands of educational resources - ebooks, scholarly articles, research papers, videos, presentations, recorded classes, discussion forums, and much more. Innovations like library computer management system have contributed towards enhancing the in-library experience for students while significantly simplifying the task of librarians. As a result, educational institutes are able to utilize their infrastructure and resources more efficiently. The modern education system has also lessened the physical burden on the students. They can complete their assignments using computers and submit the soft copies via email, a practice that is convenient for both teachers and students alike. There is definitely a downside of the modern education system too. For instance, students are becoming over-reliant on gadgets and the internet and digital distractions like social media and gaming are becoming prevalent in classrooms due to the availability of computers and the internet. While these are some of the undeniable drawbacks, they can be addressed easily without any drastic alteration to the system of imparting education these days. Solutions like classroom management software solution are being made available to empower teachers to facilitate education better. Such a software allows teachers to monitor every student without roaming in the entire class, allocate and check their work, engage them in interesting activities, and so on. So, yes, that is why the modern education system is good according to my understanding. ",
