            "answer_text": "It's actually very good if you are willing to struggle 24/7 without any complaints. I'll brief you out on how it works : 1)The college has a very tiring schedule, the college timings are from 8 to 5 varies accordingly 2)They try to segregate you based on how you perform in the \u201cWeekend exams\u201d. 3)Language is one problem when it comes to faculty, their fluency in English isn't that great. 4)You need to keep your performance graph a constant or they put so much pressure, you might end up loosing interest in studying. 5)If you are going there looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend it's the last place to go. 6)Sports if you are into it, you have to start forgetting it if you want to join here. If you no interest in other activities and only want to achieve your goal then chaitanya is the place you should be. ",
