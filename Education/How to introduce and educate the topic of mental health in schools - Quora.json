            "answer_text": "Mental health care professionals (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers etc.) have been remiss in their failure to inform the general public about mental illness\u2026its incidence, cause, signs and symptoms, treatment and prevention. As a consequence the concept of mental illness is mysterious and dripping with stigma (undeserved). Discussion of it is avoided. This is not the case with physical illnesses e.g. chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles and palpitations are well recognized as possible signs and symptoms of heart disease. There is no shame associated with admitting to the complaints and seeking help. Introducing mental health education in high school would be unquestionably advantageous, but convincing educators to do so would be difficult or impossible because it would be interpreted as \u201crevolutionary\u201d with possible unpleasant repercussions. Included in any mental health education would be instruction on \u201cproper (vs. improper) parenting\u201d which is the most common cause of psychic trauma in childhood and consequent neurosis. Imagine the consequences of a student going home and confronting a parent with the statement that \u201caccording to a talk at school about parenting today you were, in fact, not a good parent\u201d. Excellent question which hopefully will one day be addressed. For more on mental illness I would recommend my book entitled \u201cNeurosis Revealed\u201d written in lay language and available on Amazon. I have delivered PowerPoint presentations on this subject to adults with overwhelming appreciation. I\u2019m not sure how it would be received by high school students. Even one negative reaction would be disturbing. ",
