            "answer_text": "Yes you can,but i will suggest to first make a goal what u want to achieve in ur life.. after scoring, 80 % -90 % .. in which field you will try to go in.. does 80% -90% really matters what u wanna do in ur life\u2026 because in improvement you are going to drop your 1 year which you can invest at any other place. Taking from me\u2014 I scored, 70 % in my 12th boards which was not satisfactory for me, i choosed for improvement exam and dropped my 1 year, after droping 1 year and just a little more practise i managed to score 76%.. I came to know that these marks will not help me to take admission in delhi university after which i applied for ggsipu for whose entrance i worked really hard and scored good marks and got a good rank to get admission in a good reputed college (I realized for d first time , that my 12th marks doesnt matter in my future life, only hard work will matter).. Now college life started nd it was going very smooth, i secured good marks in 1st year,( i am pursuing BCA) now i am in second year, after coming here i came to know about ssc-cgl.. One day i started to solve 2016 tier -1 exam at home nd scored 92 marks, which was surprising for me\u2026 and i came to know that only thing i need for it is to work more hard and more practise.. and i choosed this path. Now with BCA , i am preparing myself for cgl 2019 ( second time i again realised that drop of 1 year of my life which i could have used in a different way , was wasted by the point of view in academics, otherwise i have no issue about it) So choose YouR carrier goal first , then take d step of dropping one year .. BesT of lUck for your future. Sorry for grammatical mistakes.. Enjoy life, nd dont take life so serious which destroys inner u, nd dont take it too easy which destroys ur future\u2026 HAVE A HAPPIE JOURNEY OF LIFE. ",

            "answer_text": "An Improvememnt examination is similar to the examination that u had earlier.I will surely recommend u to apply for improvement if u got 68% .Because your 12th board results may mattger in upcoming future(Depends on which field u choose).If ur preparation is better than last year then u cansurely score more.U can even score 90+ with good writing methods & writing Pointwise .U must apply for it .Even if u get lower than ur present score,68% will remain as ur permanent result. Good luck & Thanks!! ",
