            "answer_text": "I am sorry to say this, but i have encountered plenty of stupid people with a PhD and plenty of much more intelligent people without it. Average is likely to be somewhat higher than in the rest of the population, but not by much. 10 points maybe(*)? The difference between someone with PhD and without PhD is mainly in the level of work they were ready to invest in getting the title and in their interests. Intelligence comes distant third. Or to put differently: \u201cIt's 1\u2105 of inspiration and 99\u2105 of transpiration\u201d (*) I just noticed that @Peter Flom stated that the average is around 125. If that's true, then a number of people with average IQ or below and a PhD degree would be very low indeed. This is an interesting situation. Either IQ is an even less usable figure than I though as a measure of someones ability for independent and logical thinking or the average person (IQ 100) is much less intelligent than I thought or this statistics is somehow flawed. Ah yes, it's also possible that I'm just too critical when it comes to logical thinking and problem solving capacity. That would explain it. Curiouser and curiouser. ",

            "answer_text": "I would guess that the majority of Ph.Ds are between 113 and 138 on the WAIS IV in 2019, but with a high concentration of IQs between 130 and 135 in physics and math among those completing their Ph.D before 1980. Richard Feynman is thought to have had an IQ of 125, and that is probably about where half of Ph.D physicists have always been in terms of IQ (and that would include older figures such as Newton and Einstein) A lot of English majors who go on to a Ph.D have a 125 \u201cVERBAL\u201d IQ on the WAIS but they claim that their total IQ is 125, and as they pursue their careers as English professors they forget that their IQ is actually 112. It\u2019s probably not unheard of to get a lot of Ph.Ds who simply have a 110 IQ like everyone else. These astounding figures such as 160, 180, and 200, or whatever else is floating around out there on the net, don\u2019t really exist for the most part. My guess is that Einstein\u2019s IQ would be 134 on the WAIS IV in 2019. But his verbal IQ, although above average, would probably be below 125. ",
