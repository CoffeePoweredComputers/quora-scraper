            "answer_text": "The matriarchy is finally setting in. All men of the world, be wary. Personally, I've formed the AFMS, or the Alliance For Male Safety to keep me and all other men, young men, and boys, in a state of safety. We're under constant pressure, though\u2026\u2026\u2026there have been 6 attacks already on our headquarters, and the damage is skyrocketing. Female students are the most averse to our organization. As they are given more attention from the teachers, though, we luckily haven't been targeted by school administration, because we'd be dead if we were. Luckily, though, we are soon getting reinforcements from our main attachment, and an Apache Attack Helicopter is being included, so we will have the power to strike back if needed. Interested in joining our forces? Well, first we'll have to go through a strict entry process-any spies allying with the enemy have to be rooted out before they can deal any damage. Not only that, but we have to give our units strict discipline and training, since even the smallest leak of a secret could be extremely devastating to our operations. You'll have to be able to handle a standard issue AK-47, RPG-7, and you'll have to be armor-certified. You will have to be capable of piloting an Apache Attack Helicopter, and also operate a flak gun to down any enemy aircraft. Not only that, but you have to be able to use a flamethrower to destroy enemy bunkers and propaganda. We need more forces. We are in a rather desperate situation, as not many people are in support of the AFMS. If you are willing to join and go through our initiation process, we are in dire need of your services. In fact, the only reason I am able to write this message is my elite guards currently giving me security in my headquarters. Please, we need your help. Our soldiers will provide hospitality and comradery, as well as security. You will never need another organization. This message given by the leader of the AFMS, codenamed Scorpio. Keep on thinking, Joseph ",

            "answer_text": "As a girl I never got more attention from my teacher than the boys, I did however got more attnetion from some teachers than reat of my class and that had nothing to do with my gender. I got extra attention for several reason I was a sick child. I suffered from many diseases as a kid, and all were connected to one medical issue. I also had surgery, therapy etc, and the teacher that lnew about the issue paod mpre attention to me. They didn\u2019t give me any extra privilege but they were careful with me.My parents asked one of my teacher to help me in the class when I first arrived in U.S.A. The extra attention helped me get used to the education system of United State, which is quite different from the education system of Bangladesh.I was quite a bit of nerd, and sometimes acted like the teacher\u2019s pet. So, in general some teachers loved me, and paid more attention to me whenever I kissed their ass (not literally of course).So, if you see a teacher paying more attention to a girl student, that could have hundreds different possibilities that doesn\u2019t involve her gender.
