            "answer_text": "In the US, public schools are a target for a variety of reasons: Anti-government sentiment has fed gun ownership. So while most of the shootings aren't purely anti-government related, access to guns skews heavily toward parents with those leanings.The vast majority of kids attend public schools. As a result, statistics inherently make it far more likely that a shooting would happen at a public school.Public schools are required to offer education to everyone. Private schools aren\u2019t.Therefore, private schools can more easily get rid of students they think are a risk.Also, if a troubled kid is transferred to a private school for, as an example, a more rigid environment, the school knows the problems in that student\u2019s past.Private schools are generally built in such a way that there is less public access.Public schools are designed to also be public gathering places - many public meetings happen at public schools. So there is far more access to them.Finally size. The number of students in each public high school is generally far larger than the number in each of their private counterparts.In other words, it\u2019s simply an accident of each type of schools role in society. If Private schools were expected to fill the social role that public schools fill, then I expect we\u2019d see more violence at private schools. ",

            "answer_text": "Private schools are safer than public schools? Ha! I once went to a private school that was not so safe! Most of the schoolmates I had there were nutcases & maniacs! During my 1st year in that private school, this crazy brute I got into a bitter dispute with just manhandled me for Halloween! He squeezed my neck with his muscular arm & I actually had trouble breathing at the time! {You can read about my bitter dispute with this guy in 1 of my other Quora answers} And public schools aren\u2019t so safe either! My worst school, which I\u2019ll refer to as C.R.S., is a public elementary school where I was bullied all the time, even by teachers! In both public & private schools, there are bullies that beat up innocent students! These innocent students are targeted just for being extraordinarily intelligent or born male! Some kids refuse to find better activities to do that hurt nobody at all! And it\u2019s gotten so bad that guns & other mortal weapons are being brought to school, turning it into a war zone! Neither public nor private schools are safe! ",
