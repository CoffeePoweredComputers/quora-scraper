            "answer_text": "Not a movie\u2026a TV show.  I\u2019ve been teaching for 21 years, and a good chunk of those years were in \u201crough\u201d low-income schools. The most accurate depiction of what happens in those kinds of schools is from the HBO TV series \u2026The Wire.  While the show is a crime drama, and a damn good one at that, a good chunk of Seaon 4 revolves around a former detective who takes a teaching position in the Baltimore public school system.  Also pivotal to the story development is the interaction and character development of a group of neglected, troubled and sometimes abused young men.  My wife and I both have experience teaching in \u201cthose kinds of neighborhoods\u201d and teaching \u201cthose kinds of kids.\u201d This was the first movie or TV depiction where we agreed that the writers really took the time to understand what\u2019s going on in many American schools.

            "answer_text": "Definitely depends on the type of person one was in high school. My high school experience was like a mix of Dazed and Confused and Stand and Deliver, with a dose of Confessions of a Wallflower, from movies I\u2019m familiar with (as there was a lot of drugs, gangs, and weird music depression for me in high school). Other people had more of a Friday Night Lights or Varsity Blues type. Some people had more of a Lean on Me type experience, or even the Breakfast Club or Dead Poets Society. America is filled with a wide variety of high school experiences due to region, culture, socio-economic status, race, etc. ",
