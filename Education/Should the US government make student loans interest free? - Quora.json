            "answer_text": "I am sympathetic to the idea, and I think a person can make some plausible arguments as to why the interest should be zero, but I don\u2019t think it should be zero. First, what does loan interest represent? Interest represents risk and the time-value of money (or the opportunity cost of money). In addition, with student loans, the interest pays (for the most part) for the student loan system infrastructure. The thing is, by any lending criteria, student loans are the riskiest type of loan. Think about who is the borrower? You have an 18 or 19-year-old, with zero income, zero credit history, borrowing relatively large sums of money, and payments won\u2019t start for at least 4 years, and sometimes longer. No lending source would make that loan. Private student loans invariably require a co-signor now and even some federal loans require a cosigner (usually a parent). The interest rates on federal student loans are, already, extremely low (heavily subsidized) relative to the real risk of the loan. Even now, with all the payment options, forbearance, deferment, the combined default rate on federal student loans is 11%. No private institution could handle that level of default rate in a portfolio. The mortgage crisis was triggered by a default rate of 5%. Although this point is probably a difference without a distinction, the money lent is taxpayer money, not government money. Someone still has to manage, collect, and account for all those payments. To take the phone calls, etc. That costs money no matter how you do it. The current system is that it is outsourced to private companies. For the most part, the interest is what pays to have that necessary infrastructure. There needs to be some interest charged to cover that risk and pay for the management and collection infrastructure related to student loans. The problems with student loans are two-fold: Borrowers making poor choices in handling student loan issues. I disagree with Mr. Stagliano a little bit on whether interest is a problem, it is to some degree. However, the problem is created by the borrowers. Borrowers often reflexively put their loans in deferment or forbearance and leave them in that status for years (you get 3 years of deferment no questions asked). Interest accrues but no payments are being made. Second, students don\u2019t grasp that unsubsidized loans are accruing interest while they are in school. Lastly, that consolidating loans may not always be a good choice. When you consolidate a loan, any accrued interest is impounded as principle in the new loan, and the repayment period (amortization) is reset. In the early years of a student loan repayment period, nearly the entire payment is going toward interest. A consolidated loan resets that amortization schedule. College is expensive. This isn\u2019t an issue the government can fix and throwing more money at schools isn\u2019t going to solve the problem. The cost is driven by two factors, labor, and facilities. Professors in the U.S. are the highest paid in the world. U.S. campuses are oases compared to colleges in other countries. That all comes at a cost. It costs a private, non-profit college, between $70,000 to $100,000 per student, per year to educate that student. Even if a student is paying full tuition, room, and board, etc., they are not covering the actual cost to the school to educate them. I have been told (I have not personally verified) that the cost per year, per student at German colleges is $20,000. All that to say, the interest charged on student loans is not the real problem. ",

It is the Excessive Principal that they undertake. No student should ever start a college Believing that they should have to borrow more than $27,000 over the following four years (and Get that bachelors degree in four years or five if it is a special Co-Op program). If it will be more than $27,000 then find another college. Easy. Because then all you need is the current low interest rate of the Federal Direct Loan program. Loans entail interest. Part of the learning process. They are students after all. It is Not the Interest, it is the Principal. ",
