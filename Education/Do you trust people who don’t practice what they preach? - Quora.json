            "answer_text": "No one practices what they preach 100% of the time. When it comes to trust, you should really trust no one unless you have an emotional leverage, ie the person is a friend or relative who values your relationship But the short answer is - No, of course I dont trust em\u2019 but it depends on the level of delusion at play. For the most part, people may fail to practice what they preach usually just due to a lack of self awareness. It\u2019s a personal bias we all have towards ourselves. The proper term is \u201cDelusion\u201d Everyone has an inherent delusional quality to them. some worse than others. And for the most part I noticed the more delusion, the more hypocritical they tend to be. People who are too delusional, they will screw you over, and justify it to themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault they stole your money, it\u2019s your fault for just leaving it on the counter in plain sight!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly. I find that everyone lacks in some area of practicing what they preach\u2026myself included. In fact, some of the best messages I have given from the pulpit were times when the Lord was working some things out of me that weren\u2019t gone yet. I had to admit, during my message, that while I was preaching it, I certainly knew what it meant to try and fail at it. I have found that Christians, in large part, get a really bad wrap for being considered hypocrite. This comes from an ignorance in our society of what a hypocrite truly is. A hypocrite is an individual who plays a role with no intention of being the role they are playing. They are completely acting the part as a man with a mask on. However, most Christians I have met are simply well-intentioned people trying to learn, grow and change\u2026but fail at it at times. This is not hypocrisy. This is being human. ",
