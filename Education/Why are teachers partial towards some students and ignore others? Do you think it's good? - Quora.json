            "answer_text": "There can be many ways to see this - Teacher may not be partial but the students and parents may think so. Most good teachers are nonpartial and some are even kind. It could be that the students fail to understand the attention he or she gets due to his or her own lack of communication.Some students are good at expressing, thus many teachers think them to be better and more helpful than others. It is quite obvious that they would give them more attention in return.Some students are brilliant and the teacher hopes to get a thumbs up from his or her result. Everyone loves a winner and wants some credit from their achievements.Some students are naturally charming just like our siblings who gain more attention from parents though the parents love us all equally.Now your question - Is it good? NO, it is not good. It breaks the morale of some students who too love and respect the teacher. A good teacher will not appear partial to any students even if she has a few favorite students in the class. A fantastic teacher is one who pays equal attention affectionately towards weak students as well. I had a teacher who used to even bring nail cutter in classroom and students who came from a middle and lower middle class used to get privileged of having their nail cut by the teacher because some of them had careless parents. Some kids used to get even free tuitions too. But we never took it as partiality, rather we knew it was the need. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe it\u2019s not \u201cgood\u201d but such is life. Teachers are people who have their picks and chooses just like anyone else. Some kids are exceptionally smart or well behaved and the teacher likes them\u2014 and there are some who aren\u2019t too bright or are particularly lazy or extremely unruly \u2014and the teacher hates to see them coming. There are some students who might not do much of anything that is inappropriate and the teacher for whatever reason doesn\u2019t have a yen for them but the same rings true for a student who has a teacher they don\u2019t like. My daddy always used to tell me \u201cyou can either be really smart or really likable but you can\u2019t be a dumb jerk\u2026life will just be hard for you\u201d. There are some students who have glowing personalities but don\u2019t do much in the way of work\u2014 teachers let them get away with lots. Then you\u2019ve got the lazy smart alecks \u2014 the teachers will give them grief. And then there is a group who are quiet, cause little to no fuss, do like they are asked ,and get overlooked..not because they are unliked but because too much attention is paid to the raucous. There\u2019s no special formula that dictates partiality. ",
