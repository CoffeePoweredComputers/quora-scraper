            "answer_text": " Short answer: No. Long answer: See below Have you ever wondered why it is that these days it seems that a university degree is required just to work in retail, and even then it does not guarantee you decent employment? Well, if you have common sense like I do (congratulations!) you would know it is because university degrees have become so commonplace that their value is now worthless. Furthermore, let\u2019s get real about university: most people these days don\u2019t go to university because they actually enjoy it and want to learn something. They go there because they think it is an opportunity to get away from their parents for a few years and join some fraternity clubs with the expectation of a high-paying job waiting for them at the end of that tunnel.  Above: Six Figure Salary, Here We Come! Does it make any sense to place millions of people into a university programme because they feel financially and socially pressured to do so, when they would be much happier elsewhere. Critics of abolishing education might say that if we were to cut university funding, then children and teenagers would be subjected to a lifetime of unemployment and poverty. To that, I tell them to look at what is happening right now. Teenagers and young adults are racking up debts as high as $100,000 or more just so that they can be unemployed for years on end or receive an $8 an hour job that was, until very recently, the kind of job that children or seniors nearing retirement would have done.  Above: Today, This Job Might Require A Doctorate And An Arm And A Leg. No Benefits Included! These graduates would have been much better off having never gone to university at all, financially speaking. Time and time again, we hear about the false promises awaiting those who graduate from university. We are told that graduates will make over a million dollars a year more over the course of their lifetime compared to those who don\u2019t graduate. What they fail to address, however, is that such results are manipulated and look less promising when these factors are included: The years of lost work acquiring those degreesThe rising cost of inflationThe rising cost of university degreesThe majority of those receiving high-paying jobs come from well-connected families and backgroundsThe majority of those who were poor before going to university will remain poor, in addition to having tuition debts attached to their nameMany people who graduate from university become millionaires or even billionaires. However, the bulk of millionaires and billionaires were themselves descended from wealthier families.  Above: I Make More Money In My Time Reading Toilet Humour Than You Will In Your Lifetime! This trend is ubiquitous from Donald Trump, all the way to Bill Gates, who was himself a Harvard College dropout. A single multi-billionaire earning billions of dollars annually is going to be the equivalent of tens of thousands of ordinary graduates, as one billion dollars being earned annually would be the equivalent of a 1,000 supposedly average graduates over the course of their ENTIRE lifetime. Many billionaires, however, rack up tens of billions of dollars a year, and thus help inflate the overall average of university graduates. Bill Gates, who was himself a dropout, was earning 12 million dollars per day, which was approximately twelve times the average increase in earnings that an ordinary graduate would have presumably earned over the next sixty years of their lives.  Above: Better Hope That Covers Funeral Expenses! Taking the sample of a few hundred multi-billionaires and a few thousand multi-millionaires and throwing them into the equation with the average graduate and it would not take a math whizz to see how warped the statistics really are. Furthermore, the prediction that the average graduate will earn an additional one million dollars over the course of their lifetime assumes that wages will continue to rise at the rate they currently are. With social security in crisis, and tuition and credit in a bubble similar to the housing crisis, it is very unlikely that the rise in wages will be so promising in the future if the system we currently have is allowed to remain unmolested.  Above: The Best Way To Save Social Security Is For More Government Regulations! The economy is notoriously unpredictable, and it can be booming one day, only to stagnate the next without warning. In half a century from now, a million dollars is not going to mean a whole lot, as purchasing power per dollar is likely to continue decreasing overtime. Heck, in most major cities, a million dollars won\u2019t even buy you a broken house in some slum neighbourhood. And that is before the interests, utilities, insurance and repairs are included.  REALITY OF UNIVERSITY First, let me stress this by stating that university and college is NOT for everyone. That does not mean, however, that those who don\u2019t go to university or college are academically dull. In fact, it takes far more self-discipline to become a self-educated person than someone who relies solely on a \u201cprofessor\u201d to tell you what to read, what to write, how to think,what to say, and what to do. Education in itself seems to have become an oxymoron, as people these days typically equate education with the types of degrees one has been awarded with. That is pure hogwash, as the official definition of education \u2014 and not the modern hijacked version \u2014 is one who is both very knowledgeable and able to form their own opinions and arguments based on their knowledge.  Above: Self-Education In The Making, Folks! With the possible exception of knowledge, nothing within the official definition of education is to be found on campus, where students are taught to think the way their professor wants them to think. Even the term \u201cknowledge\u201d being a part of university life can be quite debatable, as professors will often times select books that conform to their own views and threaten students with deducted grades if their essays and answers don\u2019t align with what the professor tells them. Consequently, students often end up with biased minds, because their professors deliberately omitted certain facts from the topic to ensure that their students would grow up with their point of view intact and not the opposing viewpoint. And as a way to reinforce their students\u2019 confidences, professors will then grant their students a higher grade for effectively writing an answer where they state that they agree with what their professor has taught them.  Above: Woop! Woop! Woop! Woop! If what we as a society really want is a world where brainwashed students can tell the government to make it free for more students to become brainwashed, then I guess free university tuition is the way to go. I do not think that way, however. Below, I will explain the financial scam behind universities, and why this is likely to get even worse in the event that universities were to become as free as breathing polluted air.  UNIVERSITY IS A BUSINESS. PERIOD! When I was in university and college, I had my fair share of experiences where professors would actually expect us to buy the university edition of a book that could be bought for a fraction of the price in a regular bookstore. For instance, a book that might cost $20 \u2014 or even be free in a public library \u2014 would cost well over $100 in a university setting. And to ensure that you did not try to buy a cheaper copy, professors would routinely ask you questions during exams that could only be found in the university edition. These questions were seemingly unimportant, and it did not do a whole lot to inform students about a certain topic, but it was nonetheless a tool that professors used as a way to ambush students who had thought that they could simply get a next to free copy outside of university.  Above: Like Here, For Instance! To add insult to injury, many of these professors actually took home a large chunk of each copy of a book you were forced to buy from them, simply because they may have co-authored a book used for class. One example that comes clearly to mind was when I was taking a year long undergraduate course in Canadian law, and our professor had wanted us to buy two books for the course; the first was our \u201cmain\u201d book to be used, and it cost nearly $100. The second, was just some book used literally ONE time throughout the whole year to cover a single chapter, and it cost over $200.  Above: At Least You Won\u2019t Need To Pay Tithes Ever Again! That second book had been partially written by this professor, who had us read the chapter she had written with the intention that to do so would mean getting a portion of that $200 from each student who walked into her classroom. Some five-hundred students were in that class, and I was probably one of the few in there that had no interest in majoring in law. Needless to say, I ultimately managed to pass the course, even though half the class failed. Imagine what would happen if one day the government stepped in and said that they would be willing to pay for all of the expenses \u201cfree of charge.\u201d Do you really think universities would suddenly back down and offer cheaper and better services?  OF COURSE NOT! Universities and their faculty would interpret this as meaning that they can charge even MORE for the same services, because they would know that everything would be paid through, via taxes. As a general rule, when things are run and operated by the state, quality of services tend to go down. We can even see that in regular public schools where education is abysmal at best, and where the majority of teachers are unmotivated, lazy, and even hostile, because they know they have the protection of unions and the government\u2019s salary to defend them. This situation will only be multiplied in severity if we were to include professors and their staff members in the paid services of the state.  Above: Adult High School Of The Twenty-First Century Most professors don\u2019t even grade your work. They have some \u201ctrusted\u201d student do the grading for them. Whether it be your essays, exams or projects, a professor will usually \u201clecture\u201d you, but it is the students that they have assigned (teacher\u2019s assistant) that will ultimately decide what your overall GPA score is going to be. Therefore, your \u201cfeedback\u201d is not even going to be coming from a professor who likely has an agenda to brainwash their students into thinking their way. Rather, it will be a student that is likely only a year ahead of you who will deduct grades from you for not thinking THEIR way.  CONCLUSION I have so much more that I would like to say in regards to the destructive nature of university and its false \u201ceducational\u201d promises. I suppose most of what I have omitted from this post will have to be discussed at a later time on a different answer. Nonetheless, what I will state is that university degrees do NOT provide people with employment. If everyone and their cat and dog has a university degree, do you think that is going to make the degree more or less valuable? Not to mention, the diploma mill industry that is university and college have also hurt the poor by forcing them to spend years of their lives getting a degree that is likely going to result in them being stuck with the same type of employment that their forefathers had.  Above: To Be A Bank Robber Today, You Would Need A Major In Spanish. Otherwise, How Are You Going To Explain To The Mexicans You Mean Business? Only this time, they will have heavy tuition and interests to pay, in addition to the years of lost income sacrificed by going to university in the first place. A situation made all the worst by the fact that inflation is still skyrocketing and apartments and houses are at one of the least affordable rates in a century. Professors in general do not miss a second of sleep at night over their students and former students. Professors will tell you that it is a good idea to go to university because they make MONEY every time a student does so. Once you have paid your tuition and \u201cmoved on\u201d however, it is not going to matter to them if they lied to you by claiming that university would lead to a lifetime of prosperity.  Above: University Claim Employment Rate \u2014 Over 90%. I Guess He Was In The 10%. (Professor Snickering) Fortunately for me, I had already more or less figured this out even before stepping foot on university grounds, and I only had to attend university for a year before I became solidly convinced that I could do better at learning on my own than in a classroom setting. To claim that a university degree offers jobs is like saying that a job offers money. None of these claims are true. First of all, there is no evidence that a university degree alone would have given anybody a job. And the only reason why more employers are asking for university degrees is not so much because of the power that a degree has, but the lack of power that the job market itself has. When the economy tanked during the late 2000\u2019s, millions of people lost their homes and jobs. This resulted in there being far more people looking for work than vacant jobs.  Above: McDonald\u2019s\u2026 The Job That Promises Graduates Over A Million Dollars More Over The Course Of Their Lifetime\u2026 Or Not! Employers responded by decreasing the wages of their employees with the knowledge that another desperate person would take their place if they were not satisfied with the salary cuts. Furthermore, employers exacerbated the problem by increasing the standards needed to be considered for employment, knowing that there was now a pool of unemployed people with more than a high school diploma to choose from. Had the government been more responsible in the first place and not perpetrated a housing bubble, credit deficit or been spending so lavishly on military spending, it is unlikely that the recession would have began in the first place, and it is unlikely that universities would be currently holding as much power as they currently are.  Above: I Am Sure Professor Zoidberg Will Say Something Reassuring\u2026 In A Thousand Years! Government intervention in education is NOT the way to go about solving unemployment and poverty. As stated earlier, look at the joke of an education present in public primary and high schools and tell me with a straight face that the government is actually doing a good job at educating our youth. What the government really needs to be doing, first of all, is to loosen regulations so that people become LESS reliant on the government. For example, they can start by allowing children and even adults to sell lemonade, juice, cookies etc. without the fear that the government is going to send the police \u2014 another product of the state \u2014 to fine them and confiscate their belongings as a \u201cpunishment\u201d for trying to be financially motivated.  Above: That\u2019s What You Get For Wanting To Be Independent, Rather Than On Welfare! The best way to determine the quality of the workforce is not a mere matter of unemployment rates; the types of jobs available; nor even the average salary given by those jobs. It is a combination of all three. Today, I could claim to be offering a job where I will give someone ten dollars to spend all day repairing houses and mowing lawns, and by some statistics, this person would be considered employed.  Above: Get Up Lazy Pants! That $1.25 Per Hour Is Not Going To Work For Itself! Never mind the fact that ten dollars these days is hardly enough to buy food for a day, let alone, finding shelter and being able to save up. And if this person is someone who graduated from university and cannot find better paying work than the one I am offering him or her, does that mean that universities gave him a ten dollar per day job? Ultimately, what we as a society need when it comes to education is for there to be LESS government. Not MORE.  Above: Darn It! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question that though there are indeed many answers for when looked at broadly, in nuance its far more complex. Moving beyond the theoretical question alone to application, if you asked in some countries 'should the government NO LONGER provide free education?' - that would be seen as violation of a 'social contract' that is in place between the government and the wider population. Therefore, while there'd surely be nations like the USA where the notion of making all education free would perhaps be seen as financially irresponsible by the government, if you did the reverse and suddenly made all education a direct payment from the student upfront, then many folks in Germany would be aghast at such a change to their model. The advantage of the American system is citizens who don't wish to study are not left feeling via the tax system that they have to pay for others to do so. The trade off in this is many folks who would wish to study and be talented may not unable to afford to do so. The advantage of German system is that folks get free university - but there's often bigger taxes or higher costs across the community in other forms. All up, its perhaps a question of location as well as theory. In my country of Australia we had introduced free education around the early 1970's and overtime that has been changed to a 'not free, but pay interest free once you start working' to now many post-grad courses being full fee and upfront. Not everyone is happy with the changes, but also an argument exists the system and overall quality of education is better then it is not free. The debate continues in Australia as it does around the world.
