If the assignment is submitted after the due date, the subject of the email states Submitted Late: \u201c[Title of the Assignment]\u201d Even if you don\u2019t get the email notifications (I\u2019m not sure if you can turn them off), it shows if it was submitted on time, submitted late, or if it\u2019s still missing. One of my \u2018late\u2019 student\u2019s assignments was submitted at 12:04pm. (He won\u2019t be penalised for 4 minutes.) The other one submitted on time, but then, for some reason, resubmitted it after the due date, and it\u2019s recorded as late.  ",
