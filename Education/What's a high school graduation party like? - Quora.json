            "answer_text": "I think the great thing about a graduation party can be the good will that comes through. While high school should be a relatively and overall happy time - though true it remains sad and an issue to address some students find it otherwise - but its also true teenage years are a time of adjustment, awkwardness and Co. Around about 18 that often starts to change as people 'level out', recognize its a big world out there - so those who you grew up with and spent years with will always be a big part of your life - and accordingly graduation parties can be a bit surreal (but good). All up then, graduation parties are cool because its a special milestone to hit with your friends, celebrate with your grade as a whole - and even those folks who you may not yet have had a chance to meet and speak to all that much during senior year - you'll often find you end up speaking about plans for college, life after school etc etc. So, all up I would say definitely go, enjoy, but most of all just be yourself. Grad parties are great in that they allow you to reflect and 'wrap' a high school career; but also true too the day after shall arrive eventually. So, make the most of it but don't fret too much about making a huge deal of its significance; rather just enjoy yourself (and yes, maybe ask that girl you've a crush on out for a date in weeks ahead:) Ed Phillip Journalist and Author Read more from Ed in 60 Steps to College Success: from First Year to Final Year, Essays, Exams and More! available from Amazon Kindle (download for free until May 9 2017) ",
