            "answer_text": "\u201cMany students complain about how much homework they always have, but teachers often say that they are overreacting and need to just do the work. Students get a lot of homework every night and most have to balance their school work with the extracurriculars they are involved in. According to most students, teachers assign way too much homework. Teachers assign one to two pages of homework each night and that may not seem like a lot, but it is. Almost all of the teachers assign about that much homework, so when you add it all up, it comes out to a lot more than you would think. Maddie Miller \u201820 says that, \u201cI get home from practice at night and all I have time to do is eat and do my homework, and it\u2019s really frustrating that I don\u2019t have time for anything else.\u201d Teachers also encourage extracurriculars and sports, and a lot of kids participate in at least one, if not more, of these things. Ryan Holland \u201821 says that, \u201cI am involved in football and basketball and I am always in a rush to get my homework done because I have so much of it at night. I am always so tired from practice and games so I feel like I\u2019m not even understanding what I\u2019m doing when I\u2019m completing my homework.\u201d Taking part in these adds on to the stress of getting their homework done. A study last year, from http://Whitby.com,showed that the impact of excessive homework on high schoolers included high stress levels, a lack of balance in children\u2019s lives and physical health problems such as ulcers, migraines, sleep deprivation and weight loss. When students get home from practice or games at night, they still have all of their homework to get done before they get to go to sleep, and sometimes are up very late trying to get it all done. Something else that shows students are getting too much homework is that they never get time to relax. They get home and are doing homework for hours on end. Studies by http://Whitby.com show that students should spend 10 minutes per grade level per night on homework. That translates into 10 minutes of homework in the first grade, 20 minutes in the second grade, all the way up to 120 minutes for senior year of high school. Even though this is what is supposed to happen, studies show that students work on homework for way longer than what they are supposed to, which leaves them no free time. Students work on homework from when they get home until they go to bed, without having time to do anything else. \u201cWhen I get home from practice at night, I just want to go home, eat, shower, and go to bed because I am tired from my long school day,\u201d says Drew Wasson \u201819, \u201cIt is also hard on the weekends because I have tournaments or have to work and then have to do so much homework on top of it.\u201d Since students get so much homework, they don\u2019t focus as much on understanding the material, they just want to get it done so that they can do the rest of their homework for the night. By doing this, it defeats the purpose of homework. This is also a very interesting article about too much homework. Teachers assign homework so that their students get more practice, but if they are just doing it to get it done, it won\u2019t help them in the long run. When they do an assignment to get it done, it tells the brain that that is the way to do it, and they will keep having those mistakes on other assignments and tests, which causes frustration. Teachers assign homework for students to get more practice. This is a good thing for students if they are getting the right amount of it. When they are given excessive amounts of homework, it is causing them to have bad outcomes, instead of learning the right way of doing things. They get way too much and it is not benefiting them in good ways. If teachers want the students to get better at the things they are learning, they should still assign homework for practice, just not as much of it. A couple of problems, up to a page of homework per night, per class, would be a lot more reasonable for kids. Teachers need to focus on the kids getting better rather than giving them bucket loads of homework every night. Students do not need 20-30 problems for each class, every night. Instead, they should get a couple of problems assigned so they can get practice, and then move on to their next subject without having to stress over getting it all done. They will then have time to relax and spend time with their families.\u201d Source: Do Teachers Assign Too Much Homework? ",

            "answer_text": "You use the word nowadays as though students these days are being given more homework than they used to be given. I am not sure what country you are from and whether students are given too much homework where you live. However, where I teach, I do not think students are given any more homework than they were given when I was at high school in the early 1970s. Some students are given a lot less than I used to be at a similar stage of education. Students do different things with their time that students in the era when I was at high school. When I went to high school, I lived out of town and spent a fair amount of time each day on the school bus. When more students had got off int he afternoon, or before too many got on in the morning, I would use that time to read the English novel, or study my Physics text book or whatever. My sister and I would hear each other our French verbs. We did not want to waste the whole two hours a day spent sitting on a bus. When we got home, some time was spent milking cows and doing other farm chores. Then some homework. On Saturday, I\u2019d generally do a fair bit of study as well. No-one had jobs outside of the home as teens, apart from the occasional job babysitting the neighbours children. These days, many young people work a number of hours per week at fast food places, or supermarkets. They this have spending money. Many expect to go and socialise a couple of nights per week with friends, perhaps partying and drinking. Others do music or dance. One 16 year old girl is doing 36 hours of dance per week outside of school time. Now with all of these things competing for time, students need to carefully organise their time. Just as in the past, people like me organised time despite long bus journeys and cows to milk. I wish more of my students did as much homework as I did hen I was a teenager. They would come closer to achieving their full potential. ",
