            "answer_text": "Without getting into the political and ethical debates on it, here is my outlook on why education should NOT be free/paid. If college/higher education was free/paid it would essentially become worthless. High school is free. Everyone can go to high school, everyone is therefore expected to go to highschool. No one is majorly applauded when they graduate high school aside from within their family. Society expects you to graduate high school. It is a MINIMUM REQUIREMENT to function in the job market. This is because it is free and therefore it is reasonable to expect every child to reach this easily attainable goal. Now if college became free and accessible to everyone, it would essentially become equatable to high school. A bachelors degree would hold little more value than a high school diploma. Instead of being able to secure a job with a Bachelor\u2019s degree, an employer would now have THOUSANDS of applicants with the same degree (since its FREE and easy to go to college!!!) and therefore employers would begin requiring Masters or PhDs or more experience etc for jobs that used to just require Bachelor\u2019s degrees and would take freshly graduated college students. The unemployment pool would grow. More people would be on welfare. Essentially making college free to all devalues it. Every high school graduate would just go to college and while most would drop out, it would greatly devalue the levity of what collegiate excellence is today. Education is a right. K-12 is free. Higher education is not a right it is a privilege. Fortunately there are MANY MANY MANY financial assistance programs out there if you cannot afford to come out of pocket. I was stuck in the situation where my parents could not pay for my college (I am one of five kids. Almost all of us were in college at the same time. Parents could not pay for all of us so they paid for none), but my parents made too much money for me to qualify for government assistance\u2026. even though they did not pay for a single bit of my expenses after I turned 18. A bunch of BS. So I graduated college with of $40k in student loans and worked 40 hours a week all through college. But it was worth it because my degree has VALUE because it was not free and I had to work my butt off to get it. I got a job three months BEFORE I graduated college. I am working in my field and I love what i do. I would not be able to do that if college were free and everyone had a degree because degrees would be as meaningless as a high school diploma in the job market. Now I would certainly like for there to be more scholarship options or better repayment plans perhaps, but making college FREE across the board is ridiculous. ",

            "answer_text": "As a taxpayer, here's how I see education:   Elementary, middle school, high school, career school, and 4 year college should be free. I never want to have kids and I'm willing to pay tax so people can go to college for free. I know what's like to pay for your student loan. And I think if people can go do college for free, more people would go. And a better educated society is a better society for EVERYONE. There's no such thing as bad or useless knowledge, even those might seem pointless or harm the society. I studied art, for many people, art is pointless and useless. It's my passion, and why would you want to pay for my college degree so I can pursue my passion, which most likely won't benefit anyone but satisfying my own personal fulfillment? But where do you draw the line? Who can define which subject is most useful to the society? Sure medicine and engineering is useful, but what about comparative literature, how useful is that? how about art history? Is public relation useful? Is theater, music, perform art useful? Game design? Fashion? Jewelry Design? What about subjects that could harm or benefit the society, such as nuclear power, biochemistry, where does it end? Utilitarianism is not the only reason we want to learn things. And we shouldn't limit people's choices simply because we don't agree with them, even we're paying for it. We are, after all, promoting a free society and allow people to make their own choices. There shouldn't be private schools. All students should have the same opportunity to learn. I know this sounds dangerously like socialism, but rich people should pay more taxes on school, not just donating to their own private school for their own kids. I was talking to my friend (who studied in France) about private and public schools, she said the best universities in France are public schools. I was very surprised, since the best high schools and universities in the US are mostly private schools. Either you're extremely good and you got scholarship, or you're extremely rich. I don't think that's a good system. I think education up until 4 year college should be all public and all free.   Update: I see a lot of people having problem with my suggestion on private school. I really think having private school hurts our education system. Here's an article on Finland education system, and why it's better than Americans. Why Are Finland's Schools Successful? (or this one: What Americans Keep Ignoring About Finland's School Success)  Finland don't have private schools and yet their children perform much better than American kids. Private school system, high school and universities, do more damage to education than it contributes. ",
