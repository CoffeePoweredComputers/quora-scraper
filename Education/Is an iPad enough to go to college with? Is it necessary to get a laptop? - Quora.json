            "answer_text": "My son is a sophomore at California State University San Marcos in San Diego County California and he uses an iPad to take notes and keep busy while at school. Then he comes home and uses his Windows gaming machine hat he built to write his papers and other projects. The use of an iPad and his desk top system have worked out just fine and I think it should for you as well (though he is a business major). I would add that it all depends on how much writing you are going to do and if you need to use Office on a laptop at school. If you need office and you are going to need to do a lot of writing it might be a good idea to buy a cheap Windows laptop to use. I did that when I went back to school this summer because I need to use Office. I also have the option of using my iPad or my Chromebook as well.  Here is what I would do. Start the school year with what you have and put aside some money if you need to buy a laptop. If what you have works out fine, then use the money you put aside for a laptop on something else. If what you have does not work, buy a laptop and Office. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three main reasons why the iPad is better than a laptop for college. First, the college work flow is reading textbooks, taking notes, and generating documents. The iPad is better for all of these things especially with a stylus. Even for computer science students where they give you a bash shell login to do your work, the iPad is as good as any machine. The second reason is support and backups. If anything happens to your device it is easy to have replaced at an apple store with apple care. iPad can restore from a backup in minutes where replacing a laptop takes many hours to set it back up. The third reason is portability. In college you are always setting up in another classroom, or coffee shop, or study room, or shared dorm where you may need to pack up after every use. A tablet with LTE is ready to operate as soon as you pull it out of your bag. A lot of time is saved if you add up all the time you\u2019ve spent opening up a laptop, plugging it in, and connecting it to wifi. I used a laptop in college in the early 2000s but if I were entering college today I would buy the basic iPad with extra storage, Apple Pencil 2, magic keyboard 2, and apple care plus. ",
