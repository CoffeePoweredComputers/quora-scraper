            "answer_text": "No one really needs to teach you how to do taxes or write a cheque or take money out of a bank. Taxes always come with fairly easy methodical instructions. If you can read you can do your taxes and there is lots of online help thanks to YouTube. In certain programs, basic learners (grade 4 readers and gr 5 math) are taught how to do taxes. But the average child has all the equipment need to complete the tax form. Cheque writing is a parent job which kids learn by the time they are 12 yr old. They want to take money out of the bank to pay for something by mail they learned to write a cheque. If you think financial literacy like stocks, mortgages and student loans kids aren\u2019t interested. Some teachers in certain program do teach about scholarships and how to search for them and leveraging to pay off student loans but Parents object so administration follows the parent wishes and tells us to take that part out of the curriculum. but really students aren\u2019t interested. 16\u201318yr are still only interested in making money to spend on clothes and the latest girlfriend or boyfriend. That is in North America. Most people have been taught all they need to know about money from the minute you put a $2 in their 3 yr old hand to pay for that candy bar they want to give to the cashier to they are 12. They know how to use and pay for a credit card. They know how to save and spend. They know how to take money out of the ATM and deposit it. IT\u2019s not until they are 24 and 25 that when they have to pay the loans down and want to buy a house or need money to pay for a wedding or a parent funeral. We teach basic things when they are needed and at the right time of maturity. THAT is a PARENT JOB!! If parents don\u2019t do this then go to a library or ask an uncle or Aunt or older cousin. Stop thinking that school is the only place where you can be taught and that is where all these growing issues need to be taught. There is no time since parents don\u2019t want to teach their children to blow their nose or wash their hands after going to the bathroom or using a tissue to sneeze or cough into or treat others with kindness and to listen to others rather than yell over them because they want to be heard or being rather hostile and bullying. All of this belongs with Parents to teach not a school!! Teachers barely get enough time to teach what we are supposed to teach. Stop dumping more societal issues into the school system. Grow and be a parent and do the job that parents are supposed to be doing! ",
