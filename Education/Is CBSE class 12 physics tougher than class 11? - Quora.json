            "answer_text": "If you've worked hard enough in 11th grade, it'll certainly feel much, much easier! Eleventh grade is mostly mechanical physics, which, honestly requires a lot of attention and practice to fully comprehend. Also, since the students have just transitioned from 10th grade, where a few weeks of sincere efforts was enough to score decently well, eleventh grade physics comes as a serious jolt. The study load increases tremendously, and you start asking yourself- what the heck is integration and why is it soiling the pages of my physics notebook? Coping with the sudden increase in study material requires continuous attention, and slacking in Physics seems just too darn easy. Of course, if you're the sort who studies every day (which I woefully wasn't in eleventh grade) then you find the chapters comprehensible, and I daresay, easy. The great thing about twelfth, however, is that by the time you finally reach its hallowed classroom, you've already seen hell. If you enter the battlefield with plans ahead, it disintegrates into a mildly vicious tea party. Thankfully, Eleventh and Twelfth grade Physics aren't terribly related, and Twelfth has such interesting topics as Electricity and Optics(!), So it's a bit easier to digest. I, personally, found Twelfth friendlier than Eleventh, and certain strategies helped me I'm solidifying this friendship. Numericals: I vowed to solve ten (you can start with five) numerical every goddarn day, and I have to admit, they benefited me excessively. While solving a question on your own, you get to apply the concepts you learn, and this helps cement the concepts in your brain.Mock Tests: I actually used my elder brother for this one, but you can readily find topic wise question papers online (or in reference books). Every second Saturday, my brother would come into my room, armed with a question paper, and would make me solve it. Although this sounds like bullying, it's actually very helpful.Performing practicals: Even if your school does not take practicals seriously, go try and perform them. They give you practical knowledge (duh) and help you understand the applications of the stuff you study in school.Sample papers: once you're done with your syllabus, sample papers are your mantra for success!Alright, I'm sorry for the impromptu study advice. Long story short, Twelfth Physics = Nice(ish) and Eleventh Physics = Ehh. All the Best! ",

            "answer_text": "The physics of 12 the is very easier than the 11th. Because in 11th physics you need many concept in mechanics or waves. But in 12th physics you need only to learn the formula and you can easily solved the numerical. And electric current is main part of the 12th . And you can refer the DC Pandey for that because it makes your concept very clear and create your interest towards the physics. ",
