            "answer_text": "First of all, ask yourself which field you love the most? Either serving humans or caring to speechless creatures of this earth animals. When it comes to scope and salary- Scope in Nursing is vast and growing while scope of Vet. is quite low. Being a nurse you have a wide range of career options to choose. Nurses can even serve in indian army. Nurses can work in railway, defense or also in private sector. Even nurses are in high demand in foreign countries where you can even get permanent citizenship, if u belong to health sector. While Vet scope is high in Southern India or Northern state like Haryana. Foreign is also good scope for Vets. Vacancies of government vet doctor are very less in states like rajasthan. So if you are among these selected options for Vet, then u can seek the future in it.Coming to salary, u are paid a bit high in nursing sector. Also due to unavailability of doctors in rural hospital/CHC/PHC, government is bringing policies such that after 6 month certificate programme, Nurses can also prescribe medicines( refer to NMC bill 2019). If you are a nursing officer, your salary starts from 50k. No limits of salary in foreign (even upto 3lakh per month). Private sector always welcomes Nurses.Now coming to Vet, u are paid a handsome salary if you are in government job. Private sector has very less scope for Vets in india.I also had the option of Vet, but I gave preference to Nursing. Perhaps you may now know the reason. So think accordingly and choose what you find suitable. Any queries regarding nursing are welcomed. ",
