            "answer_text": "The most likely cause is fear - fear that your work won\u2019t be \u201cgood enough\u201d, that your topic is unimportant, that you aren\u2019t sure if your writing will be acceptable, if your reviewers will like your work, or other factors that involve external judgement of your work. There are other possibilities as well: you are not passionate about the work, for example, but that\u2019s less likely than just the fear of being discovered for something less than you think that you should be. Set aside your fear and start explaining your vision - your thesis - to yourself. Don\u2019t worry about how other people will respond. Convince yourself that your thesis is interesting. If you don\u2019t think it is interesting, you need to change direction. Find passion for your topic. Once you find that, you can then explain your thesis - just to yourself. Don\u2019t worry about anyone else. Just do it for yourself. Then revise it. Beat yourself up. Give yourself criticism, feedback, suggest changes, new directions, additional data. Pick the holes in it like you care, which should be easy if you are passionate about it because you do care. Eventually, you\u2019ll reach a point where you are happy with what you have written. Now start trying to explain it to others. Start with your dog. Then try it on classmates or friends. Listen to what they ask you back, where there confusion is. Then think about how you can present things more clearly. See if you can infuse them with your passion. If you can garner interest from them, so much the better. Use that to make your thesis better. Get feedback. Welcome it. But start by convincing yourself that you have something to say that you care about. That\u2019s the first step. ",

If you have a plan try to remember what was your point and complete it remembering all previous text. Also, find a time and make a small plan about left paragraphs and conclusion. If it still doesn\u2019t work - https://goo.gl/MXuaSn this source can help you with your thesis for sure. I used it also for my college works. Good luck! ",
