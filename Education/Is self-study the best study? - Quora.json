            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Vineet SHORT ANSWER: Self study is the best study as you know how your mind can understand things and you can make your mind learn that way only. LONG ANSWER Let's take an example Suppose you want to cook Dal Makhani but you don't know the recipe so you learn from YouTube and made it amazing and serve it to your family. Now after one month your family asks you to make it again and this time you think you know how to make it so you don't take help from YouTube. After making it when you taste, it is not as good as the previous one and suddenly you remember you forgot to add an important ingredient and then you curse yourself for not remembering it. SAME IS THE CASE WITH SELF STUDY. When you come from coaching, you remember everything you have been taught there. After one month, you think you know everything and in exam you forgot an important topic.Now you curse yourself for not studying it again at home.But if you have revised that topic again and again by self, you would not have forgotten it. That's why self study is best and important too. HOPE IT HELPS\ud83d\udcab ",
