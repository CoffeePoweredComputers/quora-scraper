            "answer_text": "Hey Priya BASLP is quite old program offered at KTR campus and it depends on you with which college you are comparing this program. SRM at one end having Medical college and students getting into BASLP would get the benefits as well. Again it\u2019s tough to get admission as they have only few seats available for this program. If you don\u2019t have any better option available than srm, I would suggest you to join srm without any doubt. Good luck. ",
