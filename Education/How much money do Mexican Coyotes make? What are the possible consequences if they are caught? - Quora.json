            "answer_text": "In Mexico, the term coyote applies to anyone who promise to help you make an otherwise free paperwork speedier and cut through the red tape. There are coyotes for getting a drivers license, construction permit, etc. It\u2019s part of the general corruption that occurs in Mexico. They don\u2019t really make that much money, because most of the extra they charge has to go to the people that actually help them expedite the process. It\u2019s not something that will make you rich. ",

            "answer_text": "How much money do Mexican Coyotes make? Apparently, on a good day, a well organized smuggling operation can net over a million dollars a day from a typical crossing fee of $1,500 to $2,500 per individual. [Link] Smaller operations can net almost a million dollars a year. What are the possible consequences if they are caught? Hard to say, since human smuggling is often merged with drug trafficking, but presumably big time operators will remain behind the scenes while employing low level coyotes to take risks. ",
