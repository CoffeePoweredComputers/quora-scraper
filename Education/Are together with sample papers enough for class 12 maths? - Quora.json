            "answer_text": "I doubt..!! We all know that class XII is an important class. Not only because it has the board exams but majorly because the entire career is based on your class XII. I personally never suggest, my students to rely on any one book or sample papers especially, for maths. This is because both Mathematics and CBSE BOARD exams are unpredictable and going with any specific book or sample paper may save your time, energy but then, you are at risk. If you didn't get questions from that X book then, you are GONE. Everything is Lost and you will be helpless in that case. You'll be left with only one option i.e. Random Guesses which we all know doesn't work every time. So, the better option is to be clear with the concepts, practice different sorts of books to increase your questions domain. I don't deny the fact that, it is a bit difficult to practice all the books but I believe that's the place where your mentors plays a BIG role. This planning and strategy should come from your Maths Teacher. This is the only mantra that I give my students and as a result, they complete all the books and all other stuff without even realising that pressure. So, the secret is revealed now. Just take this mantra and rock your exams. #No, only Together with sample papers won't help you. Best of Luck, my students. Regards The Maths Scholar 'You can find us on YouTube' ",

So, you have to study & solve full textbooks provided by the boards. Revise basic concepts & formulas daily. Hope this answer will helpful for you. Thank You. ",
