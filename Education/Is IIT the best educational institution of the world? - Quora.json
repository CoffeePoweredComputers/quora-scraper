            "answer_text": "No, not at all. There are so many institutes in the world that are way much more better than IITs.  Moreover, If you are admitted in a IIT, and are persistently scoring low grades and barely managing to pass, will any company be willing to offer you jobs? On the other hand, If you may not graduate from a well-reputed college but an average college supposedly with good grades and persistent performance, during the time of interviews you will have a much more better chance to qualify. The above, surely proves one thing clearly that your job and career is regardless of the college you have graduated from. I am not ocmpletely denying the worth of the name of the college, but at the end of the day,  it's your performance that matters.
