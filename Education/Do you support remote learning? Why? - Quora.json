            "answer_text": "This is an extremely \u201cit depends\u201d answer but, mostly, I do not. Are we talking about grad students or kindergarteners? There are profound differences between these two extremes. Kindergarteners and virtually all elementary students need in-person instruction. They need to learn how to function in the \u201csmall society\u201d of their classroom and that (in that age range) necessitates in person class attendance. Middle school is similar but for different reasons, most significantly puberty and its effects (see many of middle school teacher Matthew Bates answers). Some high school students would do well with remote learning but others would not perform to their potential (people are not grains of wheat, we are wildly variable as individuals). Additionally, courses in Biology, Chemistry and Physics need lab work and that\u2019s not reasonable to attempt to do remotely. College students should be able to deal well with remote learning and many could but inevitably there will be (usually less prepared or able) students who would benefit from the structure of regular in person classes. Grad students, however, have no excuse not to be able to deal with remote learning (labs excepted, of course). OP: \u201cDo you support remote learning? Why?\u201d ",
