            "answer_text": "pdf Vehicle Powertrain Systems 1st Edition  The powertrain is at the heart of vehicle design; the engine\u2013 whether it is a conventional, hybrid or electric design\u2013 provides the motive power, which is then managed andcontrolled through the transmission and final drive components. Theoverall powertrain system therefore defines the dynamic performanceand character of the vehicle. The design of the powertrain has conventionally been tackled byanalyzing each of the subsystems individually and the individualcomponents, for example, engine, transmission and driveline havereceived considerable attention in textbooks over the past decades.The key theme of this book is to take a systems approach \u2013 tolook at the integration of the components so that the wholepowertrain system meets the demands of overall energy efficiencyand good drivability.
