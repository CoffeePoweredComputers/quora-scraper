            "answer_text": "In the US? Teachers are not paid by the week, but usually a set amount for the school year. What Is the Average Teacher's Salary in the U.S. in 2019? The average, average is probably around $50,000 a year, for a work year of about 180 days. (Full-time workers generally work around 240 days a year.) If they received a pay check every Friday, it would be around $1,000. There\u2019s a range: Elementary school teachers in the bottom 10% of income only made around $37,340, while those in the highest 10% could make as much as $92,770. High school teachers range from around $39,080 to $95,380. Alaska takes the top slot among states with the highest annual wages for high school teachers, with a mean annual wage of $85,420, while New York is a close second at $83,360. Connecticut, California and New Jersey round out the top five, each topping $76,000. These all contrast very starkly with states like North Carolina or Mississippi, where the mean annual wage for high school teachers is just $46,370. And even these states are in slightly better shape for teachers than South Dakota ($41,980), Oklahoma ($41,880) and Puerto Rico ($35,120). ",

            "answer_text": "Teachers don't get paid weekly. Their salary is paid once a month. Each teacher receives a different amount for several reasons. First, they work for school districts. Those districts negotiate the salary for their employees. The unions are always trying to get more money and benefits and they use the salary scale of nearby districts as a bargaining chip. Even within a specific state salary scales vary widely. Also, some districts pay year round, so the salary is reduced to cover the summer or periods when teachers are off. Some districts pay a ten or eleven month salary and teachers do not receive a check for a period of time during the year. So, the next factor is time of service. That is tied to two things: 1) your level of education and 2) the number of years you have served. At some point the salary scale maxes out and you only receive cost of living increases as the contract allows. Contracts last from 3 to 5 years, but with negotiation, that can drag out. As teachers who work in public schools, our salary is public record and you can go to a state's web site to look up individual teacher's salaries. Those will factor in all benefits. To find the real salary, you would go to a district web page and search salary scale. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no easy way to answer that. If you are a public school teacher with 30 plus years experience in an affluent community, you can make $80,000 to $100,00 a year. That also depends on how many paid \u201cextras\u201d you do. (i.e. coaching, clubs. etc.) These pay extra. Now, if you are a first year teacher at a Catholic school, you will be lucky if you start at $25,000!! The salary range is enormous!! The first year I taught, which was 1985, my salary was $10,600. On the day I retired, my salary was $45,000, but that was after 30 years at a Catholic school. In addition, i have a pension of $600 per month for the rest of my life. Now, had I been at a public school, my retirement salary would have been double and my pension double!! Salary also depends on level of education. Each higher level results in an increased. Salary at a private or religious school depend on enrollment. Continued enrollment and increases in pay in a public school depend on the tax base. There is no definitive way to answer this question. It depends!1 ",
