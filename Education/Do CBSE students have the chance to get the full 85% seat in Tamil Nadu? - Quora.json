            "answer_text": "Yes, considering the situation right now, many cases are being filed in court by CBSE parents. They will argue against the reservation for stateboard students. So finally, if this case brews into a bigger issue, the state will be forced to take in students according to their state NEET ranks only. Because according to Supreme court\u2019s order, atleast around 1000 seats should be allocated to CBSE /other boards students. But TN has decided to give only 391 seats. This means that stateboard students scoring the least of marks would get into better colleges than CBSE students. Also since, TN has decided to follow NEET, it is not fair that in the other states, the 85% state quota is applicable to students of all boards,but in TN there is a seperate reservation. This reservation is totally not needed. In fact, stateboard syllabus and CBSE syllabud is more or less the same. Even the top scorer of NEET this year is a stateboard stduent. Many stateboard students have scored well above 400 and even a few above 600. Besides, it was announced last year itself, that no state would be exempted from NEET in 2017. So this is pure injustice to CBSE students. Let us hope for the BEST! PS- I am not sure about the stats. ",

Not all state board students are dumb. In fact many are way more intelligent than you can imagine- trust me, i shifted from CBSE to Matric and was astonished) And don't forget there is a board called ISC whose syllabus is exponential when compared to CBSE. So, the probability for this to happen is almost 0. ",
