            "answer_text": "No, schools should not close. Why? Because first of all, preliminary evidence suggests children are rarely affected AND they seem less able to spread it to others. Second of all, we need to ask if the cure if worse than the disease. A recent report by Axios finds that the result of educational disruption on this generation, particularly minority and low-income and limited English-proficiency students will be HUGE and continue the rest of their lives. So we are sacrificing an entire generation, increasing income inequality and racial inequity, and hurting women in the workforce (more women are dropping out to care for children not in school) to protect people who are generally quite old (average age of victim =80) and, most importantly, protect people who are generally out of workforce, don\u2019t have children in school, and can easily socially distance. (As a case in point, my in-laws are in their late 70s. They are retired and so can easily avoid other people; other than going to the grocery store and having socially distant outside visits with us and some neighbors, they are staying at home and can easily continue to do so. So ending the lockdown does not increase their risk, as they have already mitigated the risk.) That doesn\u2019t mean that some younger people are not at risk, but for people who are at-risk but have school-age children, we can easily offer homeschooling and distance learning options. The goal should be to offer high-quality distance learning for all families who need or want it, while keeping schools open for families who don\u2019t thrive with online learning. (As an additional data point, my friend who teaches ESL for Fairfax County said that typically only 1\u20132 students of her 25 person class joined online classes. Many students did not have computers in the home, or only had one computer to share among a family of 5 or 6, or they had to care for younger siblings who were at home because of school closings while their parents worked.) To those who would say that this means the virus will spread\u2026 Consider that Taiwan, pop 80M, has only had 7 coronavirus deaths\u2026and never closed schools. Instead, they enforced nationwide mask wearing and had AMAZING testing, contact tracing, and isolation protocols. Ditto for Vietnam and South Korea. Vietnam claims to have zero deaths (seems unlikely, but the hospitalization numbers seem to bear that up). We need to hold our government accountable for the deplorable lack of testing and contact tracing, and increase mask wearing. But closing schools hurts children, women, and working families while exacerbating inequality and racial inequity\u2026and, clearly, even with school closings, the virus has continued to spread! ",

            "answer_text": "Reasons why they should not be closed: Because there is little evidence that doing so will make much difference to the rate the disease spreads.Children seem either not to get infected easily, or they show no symptoms. If the former then it matters not if they go to school or not. If the latter then they shouldn\u2019t go out at all as the may inadvertently spread the virus. Nobody knows which it is.If they go home they will still go out and play with their friends. Infections will still spread.If schools close then parents will have to stop work to look after the children. Some will be essential workers.If their parents cannot look after the children then their grandparents may have to do it. Exposing the most vulnerable to infection.Surprisingly, the UK government seem to have hit on a good solution. They are closing the schools to all but children of essential workers. ",
