            "answer_text": "The symbol ^ denotes exponentiation, or raising to a power, or multiplying by itself, in which the N is more commonly written as a superscript (without the ^). The symbol ^ is used in place of the superscript whenever typing the superscript is either impossible or inconvenient. a^N is read as a to the Nth power, a to the power N or simply a to the Nth or even more simply a to the N. Mathematically it just means multiply a by itself (N-1) times. So in your case, 2^2 is 2 to the power 2, which is multiplying 2 by itself once, which is 2 x 2 = 4 Note that: (1) 2 is the only number N which satisfies the equation N + N = N \u00d7 N = N^N (2) in the equation a^N = x, a is called the base; N is called the index (or exponent) and x (the result of exponentiation) is called the power, just like the result of multiplication is called the product. (3) in particular, the second power is commonly called the square, and the third power is commonly called the cube. Thus 8^2 is 8 square/squared and 4^3 is 4 cube/cubed, both equal to the same power 64. (4) a^1 means multiply a by itself 0 time, and that simply gives a itself. So a^1 is always equal to a. In other words, the first power of any number is equal to that number itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of other people have commented with the answer \u201cto the power of\u201d, or \u201cthe exponent of\u201d. However, I believe that this misses the point of the question, which further alludes to the fact that language in text and language in symbols mean the same thing but in different manners. The \u201c^2\u201d does actually mean \u201cto the power of 2\u201d, but what does this mean? This means that we multiply the number of the left of the \u201c^\u201d by itself, exactly once. Say the number is called \u201cx\", then x^2 would be identically x times x. Two x's appear there The thing in the right hand side of \u201c^\u201d is the number of times that one should multiply x by itself, minus one: x^3? That is x, times itself 3 minus 1 times. I.e. x times x times x. Which is x times by itself, twice. Such a definition is counter intuitive to people that have studied mathematics, but the \u201cminus 1\u201d is key for the novice. It also means that x^1 is x. That is the ultimate definition of the \u201cexponent\u201d that others have talked about. Happy hunting. ",
