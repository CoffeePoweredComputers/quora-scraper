            "answer_text": "Interesting.. First of all, i want to clear notions ( read Misconceptions) about criteria for choosing Medical College in India. Unlike your Engineering friends where Tag matters a lot, it is not that significant in Medical, Atleast in MBBS. Criteria to choose a good medical college: Patient Load: Practice makes a man perfect. In New AIIMS (except Patna), patient inflow is low (around 2000). Some will say, as a student, you won't have to deal with patients, so why to care(Again said by mostly by Non-medicos who don't know how system works).Infrastructure: This should not be confused with Building. First of all, you need equipment . New AIIMS definitely have better buildings, LTs, Auditorium as they are recently constructed. But they still don't have necessary equipments for PGs. Infact seats for all clinical PGs haven't opened yet. All haven't started DM and M. Ch courses. Regarding mention of some equipment like Gamma knife, Most of old reputed colleges have them and they have more equipment than new AIIMS.PG coaching: After UG, student face another intense competition known as NEET PG/AIIMS PG/PGI/JIPMER/NIMHANS. Big cities hold advantage as most of coaching are located near by. In this case, State Govt college of Kolkata holds more importance than AIIMS Kalyani due to accessible coaching institute.Internal PG: Most don't understand as they say if one can crack UG exam, surely they can crack PG exam. True. But its better to have bird in hand than two birds in bush. People argue that AIIMS provide world class faculties which will make your PG exam a smooth journey. But I just want to you, you are going to compete with students having similar background and aspirations like youFaculties: Though I bet there are excellent faculties in AIIMS but they were news New AIIMS have dearth shortage of faculties. And faculties in old state college are not bad either. Remember MBBS is mostly self study. Its more on you than your faculties once you join clinical years. And in clinical years, Professor won't be teaching much as they would be busy in Clinics. Ultimately PG students will teach in Night wards. Again new AIIMS don't have required number of PG students as they are in inception years. Also since there is less patient load, you won't get to see huge no. of cases either.Research opportunities: In this case, people say AIIMS offer better opportunities. True. But there is no hell and heaven difference. Remember its not Delhi, secondly anyone from any MBBS college prior to internship can associate with ICMR-STS project. So its upon you if you want to associate with it or not.Peer Group: AIIMS does hold upper hand having better peer group as most rankers are under 2000 whereas in State Colleges some people do get best state college after 10,000.Funding: AIIMS being central institute receives higher funding compared to state college.Bond and Rural Posting: Its major reason to chose AIIMS. AIIMS being a central institute doesn't have Bond and won't impose Bond. Also there is no compulsory rural posting for few years after MBBS which is major advantage.Internship period: Its more of double edged sword. Internship in AIIMS is Waterlight. Though it gives sufficient time to read for PG entrance but it also restricts to grow more of skillful and practical doctor. Remember your patient is your best teacherRegularity of classes: in state govt college, there are more holidays, strikes compared to AIIMS. Also cancellation of classes in AIIMS are way lesser than State Government CollegesBrand: Though it doesnt matter in India that much, but AIIMS has big brand value outside India. AIIMS will boost your CV if you aspire to prepare for USMLE/UK-PLAB",

            "answer_text": "I think I have the same question in my mind about 8 month ago :-) \u201cshould I go with state medical College or with aiims other than delhi coz at my rank delhi isn't possible\u201d First of all if I have to suggest I would say just go with aiims because the name \u201cAIIMSONIAN\u201d is a itself a brand but if you think practicle then you have some thoughts like what was the infrastructure , quality of education etc etc so buddy am not sure about infrastructure but I assured you if you being in aiims then qualify is must there ,listen am talking about any aiims Many people's says aiims other than delhi is just same as any state college but it's not, like if you take an example the funds of aiims comes from Central government so they take care of all these infrastructure activity . Being a bio student you must know that if any things just start developing then progress rate must be high n graph should be directly proporstional while those who achieve highest point then the graph should be asymptotic (am taking about new aiims and well developed state colleges) You must know that if you in aiims you have less number of holidays as compared to state colleges and yes there is no system of mass bunking (particularly in aiims Nagpur ) which very often in state colleges So in my opinion if you have chance then just go with AIIMS All the best Thank you ",
