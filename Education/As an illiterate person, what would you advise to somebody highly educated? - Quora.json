            "answer_text": "What is the use of your high education if it is not giving any dividends to the society that you share with us.Remember the amount of money and time invested on you by the Government to bring you to this level. It is the tax payer\u2019s money and you are responsible for giving back something positive to the society.All your support services are taken care of by people like us and if you want to lead the life of your choice you need to reciprocate. Don\u2019t forget our role in shaping the society.Through education you can manipulate the rules, the legislation, morality, ethics and even truth. But we are illiterates and we depend on the above to lead and value our life. Hence please consider our plight when you involve in such actions.At the end stages of our lives when we hang out together for our internal assessment, I may have less worries than you as the manipulations you did will weigh heavily on your negative side and make you regret. Therefore be conscious.",
