            "answer_text": "I see a lot of SAT vocabulary here, a lot of flowery description of the cinema.  Something's missing, though: I don't see much of you anywhere in the essay.  I get a brief glimpse, a squirmy feeling of anticipation as the lights dim--and then you're gone, replaced by a movie screen and an impartial \"we\". The college admissions officer has your SAT scores.  They're not asking about your vocabulary.  They want to know who you are--and whether you know who you are. I know writing college essays is very difficult and stressful.  Introspection is not something society typically demands of high schoolers...until suddenly it's a key determinant of your college destination.  I remember how unpleasant that was for me, how bad at it I was.  So I'm going to use your choice of cinema to give you some advice on introspection.  It should help with the essay; more importantly, it's a valuable life skill.  I'm still learning it; maybe I can help you learn too. Please don't take any of the following as implying judgment of any kind.  You like going to the theater.  Let's break it down. You arrive at the theater.Are you with friends?  Family?  By yourself?How often do you go to the theater?  How regularly do you go to the theater?How do you choose the movie?  Did you pick out the movie days or weeks ahead of time, did you look up the previews and reviews and ratings?  Do you go not knowing what you'll see, picking on a whim once you get there?  Do you go along with the suggestion of someone you trust, or a group vote? You're through the doors.How much time do you have?Do you rush to get a good seat?Do you head for the arcade?  The snack stand?  The bathroom?Do you browse all the movie posters on the wall?  Will you choose one of them to keep an eye out for later? You reach the auditorium.Is the theater packed, anticipating the latest blockbuster?  Did you wait a few weeks after release for the crowds to die down?  Did you choose a less popular film, to avoid the crowds entirely?Do you sit up front, as close as you can get to the screen?  The back, to get the fullest view?  2/3 of the way back, where the audio engineers sit when they balance the sound?  Wherever you can sit with all your friends? What do you do while you wait?  Is this texting time, chattering time, reading time, popcorn time?  Do you talk to the strangers in the row in front of you? The previews are finally over.  Movie's starting.Do you watch all different kinds of movies?  Do you have a favorite genre?  Do you have favorite actors, actresses, directors, studios?Are you watching for an immersive setting?  Intense plot?  Deep characters?  Amazing CGI?  Thrilling action?  Humor?  Themes?  Soundtrack?Do you watch other people watch the movie?  Do you whisper to your friends?  Shout something on impulse? Movie ends.  Credits roll.Do you stick around for the credits, get the full experience?  Are you already in the parking lot?Are you thinking about the movie's message?  Wiping away tears of sadness, or laughter?  Slapping your friend on the back as you get up?  Placing the movie on a 1-to-10 scale?  Heading to the bathroom?  Look back over that--that's what you do and experience at the theater.  Think about what you feel at each point during the experience, and why you feel that way. Now you've reached the big question: Why do you go to the theater?  What do you get out of it?  Is it social, intellectual, emotional...or, for that matter, a place to put all that aside for a couple hours?  This is your introspection.  This is your essay material.  This is you. Tell me about yourself. (Discounting this line, the above answer is exactly 650 words.) ",

            "answer_text": "Strange elongated sounds, an auditory slow motion whooshing.  \u201cThis is the end, my only friend.\u201d The chopper blades blend, morph into the fan spinning above the man\u2019s face, upside down, eyes staring, empty and scared, at us. Napalm beautifully unfurls, setting palm tree fronds spinning, slowly, into the smoke and sand filled air in his mind, in ours. The Doors\u2019 song competes with the sounds  and images of the imagined, of the remembered, of the future apocalyptic fire\u2026 \u201cSaigon,shit.\u201d   A great essay, like a film, has a beginning, middle, and an end. An admission essay should have a narrative arc, but it can\u2019t follow a feature film\u2019s storyline. Why? Choppers dot the beach, large, dark insects. Mortar rounds toss sand into split second castles that cascade down around the men. Everyone except Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore grabs their helmets, hunkers down as deep as they can into the sand.  M-16\u2019s and AKs exchange debate. The waves curl high enough to make it worth surfing.\u201cThis LZ\u2019s still pretty hot sir. Maybe we should surf someplace else.\u201d\u201cWhat do you know surfing Major, you\u2019re from god damn New Jersey.\u201d\u2026\u201cI love the smell of Napalm in the Page on morning\u2026.it smells like (pause) Victory.\u201d  These two snippets attempt to capture a bit of the tone, verbal and visual, of the film Apocalypse Now. Each is only a few second\u2019s worth of a long film. When I talk to students about writing admission essays, I often say that they often think of the task as similar to creating a major motion picture called: The Story of my Life. But thinking this way is misleading. A film has hundreds of minutes to unfold character, plot, setting, sound etc. The amount of time it takes to read a 650 word admission essay comes in at about 2 to 3 minutes. Instead of major motion picture, a student has the time to fill a short Youtube video. Should you attempt to get years of your life into such a small temporal space you may end up with a series of filmic long shots. To get a long shot you need a wide angle lens, and it means that there will be wide open spaces, a landscape, and maybe some people, hard to see, moving about on the horizon. In a feature length film the long shot works to set up everything to follow, but in 650 words you need to use, more often than not, close ups and you need to cut to the chase. You\u2019ve asked whether the words you\u2019ve written have set the stage for the rest of the essay. The 177 words you have leave you, still, a fair amount of room to create an essay that makes the cinema a perfect place for you. Before I make any comments about your words let me share something I have found is pretty typical when people ask me to look over their essays. Given my 30 years of reading admission essays, let me start by saying I have read untold thousands. Some have changed the way I think, read, view the writer and the world. Most don\u2019t. It\u2019s incredibly hard to write something that stands out. Most novels are not great. Most films are not either. Most anything is not great which is why great is hard and rare.  More importantly, when students ask me to look over their essays I always ask what they are really looking for. By this I mean do they want me to put on my bad cop hat and beat up on the poor defenseless words in hopes of coercing a confession that gets at the real story underneath a web of abstractions and half truths? Or do they want me to don my Glinda the Good Witch costume and to the sound of a swirling musical score wave my wand and say \u201ctap your heels together three times and think to yourself there\u2019s no place like home, there\u2019s no place like home\u201d and all will be well?   I should stop here. I have already exceeded the 650 words you will get to write your essay. And yet I have not even begun to address the words of your essay. Compared to a blank screen 650 words may seem like more than enough to tell a good story or a bad story well.  On the other hand, to go into depth on any large topic, like a life, or how to write, it\u2019s far too short to add much that is all that specific and helpful in the sense of both showing and telling.  I often tell students who\u2019ve already picked a topic to consider constructing a small pyramid instead of funnel. Many don\u2019t know the tip of some pyramids were covered in gold and that is what you need to think about when constructing an essay. The tip is what sticks out and draws our eyes, even from a distance of the place you are writing to the place, perhaps across the world, of the person reading. In an admission essay (or most any essay), you have to grab our attention from a long way off. The eyes of admission readers glaze over quickly, they read and read and read, day after day, month after month. Coffee buzzed, sugar shakes, they crave a hit: \u201cI DON'T WANT TO BE A PRODUCT OF MY ENVIRONMENT. I WANT MY ENVIRONMENT TO BE A PRODUCT OF ME.\" Frank Costello (Jack Nicolson) The Departed.This first line of a film immediately challenges us, let\u2019s us in the wide open door of the character\u2019s house of being.  Journalists call an attention getting first line a hook. Whatever the term, it isn\u2019t a wide angle lens approach, but something personal, specific, close: \u201cRosebud\u201d.    A pyramid essay begins with something specific. It paints or hums or runs. It\u2019s something we can see or hear or feel. Pretend you are a director, cinematographer, editor, writer and you have a paragraph or two or three to create this film that will play in the screen inside a reader\u2019s head. It\u2019s what all the guidebooks talk about when they say show instead of tell. But that is not where the essay should end. It should also tell up about what this film we\u2019ve just seen means. The telling part becomes the base of the pyramid. It\u2019s what might have philosophical weight to hold up the gleaming tip. It\u2019s at the end that abstractions, if needed at all, appear. Donald Justice, a Pulitzer Prize winning poet, in a class I was in a long while ago, told us that we had to earn our abstractions. I agree. In admission essays, abstractions don\u2019t do much unless there are concrete nouns and active verbs that have given them flesh and bone.  Funnel essays approach topics the opposite way. They start out with a grand thesis, often far too wide, and pour it down the page trying to add some paragraphs of support and a few examples. Funnel essays often lose the readers attention by the end of the first paragraph, especially those who spend 10 or 12 hours a day reading applications. Funnel essays can work well, but they are not nearly as dramatic or as risky as pyramids. For those with writing talent pyramids often work. For those who want to write a clear essay a funnel can work but it won\u2019t often be nominated for an essay Oscar. If you don\u2019t believe me here are 10 first sentences of essays that helped students get into Stanford: 1. I change my name each time I place an order at Starbucks.2. When I was in the eighth grade I couldn't read.3. While traveling through the daily path of life, have you ever stumbled upon a hidden pocket of the universe?4. I have old hands.5. I was paralyzed from the waist down. I would try to move my leg or even shift an ankle but I never got a response. This was the first time thoughts of death ever cross my mind.6. I almost didn't live through September 11th, 2001.7. The spaghetti burbled and slushed around the pan, and as I stirred it, the noises it gave off began to sound increasingly like bodily functions.8. I have been surfing Lake Michigan since I was 3 years old.9. I stand on the riverbank surveying this rippled range like some riparian cowboy -instead of chaps, I wear vinyl, thigh-high waders and a lasso of measuring tape and twine is slung over my arm.10. I had never seen anyone get so excited about mitochondria. If this entry were a film then it would now be time for the climax. What about your words? I\u2019ve bee withholding my comments in part to be able to say some things that might apply to you but also to other readers too.  I am not quite going to transform into a bad cop or a Glinda but I do think I should make my own confession. I feel the need to quote Jack Nicolson again, this time a line from A Few Good Men, \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth.\u201d    This is my somewhat feeble attempt to insert some humor in what has been a too serious set of words and references to apocalyptic or blockbuster films. I think you your first line works well. It the fragment puts us in the space you intend to discuss What follows, however, is at least to me, a mix of genres that does not succeed in giving me a voice tha I think is yours. You have said that you are trying to be poetic and I understand what you are attempting to do. On the other hand, some of the words you use do not work for me. For example, the word ingenuity seems forced and does not really define what I think you are trying to say. But rather than go word by word I think it might be helpful just to underscore that your voice in the essay seems poised between two different and in some ways contradictory registers. You attempt to describe the place but you do so in such abstract ways that it ceases to draw me in.  If we could have a conversation about this I would ask you some questions. What are your favorite films? After you have named one or two I would ask you why. I would try to get you to draw out details and then I would ask you to write them down. No order, not yet. I would ask you lots of questions about what films mean and how they mean. I would probably talk a bit about the role of the viewer and invoke Hitchcock\u2019s Rear Window as an allegory for the way people watch films. I would also ask: Do you want to write about films or do you want to write about the space, the chairs, popcorn stand, the screen etc. that make the place? You sort of do this a bit and this too could make a great essay. But your opening sentence leads me to believe it is the magic world we enter into once all the lights cell phones etc. are off. I think either approach could work but I would think that your invoking a few of the great images or words from films that have changed you might be more evocative and also reveal more about your aesthetic tastes. If you wanted to attempt a pyramid essay I would tell you to describe a scene or two at the beginning of your essay, then move out wider to reveal that the world you have just created comes from a film and then move further out into why these films and this place means so much to you. I would hope that by the end of the conversation I would know which films meant something significant to you, why you think films are important to you and to our culture and probably a lot more. I would hope this would take hours. I love films and I know I would learn from you. After that, I would ask you to write down the things you have said, again in no particular order, and then, after that, to start to shape them into a scene that will unfold clearly and speak to us, maybe shock or surprise us, or maybe make us laugh or cry, or maybe even both. We love stories. The story you have begun to tell has potential but potential won\u2019t get you in. You have to film your words, firm your words, work your words, and then do it again. After that, I think you\u2019d be ready for the red carpet premiere. Best of luck  ",

I can imagine a reason for this being intentional, but I don't think it works. Also, a silence doesn't really ensue. That's the wrong word there. Perhaps try settle? When you describe the movie as a vision of life, what does that mean? Are you saying that you project yourself into the lives of the characters? Do you enjoy films that aren't easy to relate with? \u2026hard to believe if it really is only a simple illusion. The middle part of this is weird. It's better as hard to believe that it is really only a simple illusion. Also, here you're saying that the illusion is simple. Is it really?Perhaps it\u2019s the thin line between the intangible nature of what\u2019s presented before us and our own view that things are graspable. What about it? What is the point of the \"perhaps\" at the beginning of this sentence? This ends too quickly, and doesn't feel like a complete sentence. Also, I'm sure you know graspable isn't a particularly common word. It's fine, but then you use it again later and it seems odd. When you say expands the horizon of our experiences, I would recommend pluralizing \"horizon,\" just for fluidity's sake. And it works as a play on alliteration, which would be beneficial because you mentioned striving for a poetic style.I wasn't satisfied with your ending of graspable for the time being. Not only does your reuse of graspable seem out-of-place and repetitive, but I really don't like the phrase for the time being. It seems so uncharacteristically business-like. It doesn't fit with the rest of your piece. I don't like the way you start the piece. It's too obvious. You're walking out in front of a crowd and saying \"Today I'm going to talk to you about the cinema,\" and it feels too rehearsed and too tell-not-show. Just describe your scene and trust the audience to figure it out. This little excerpt is taken from an answer I wrote to the Quora question Is \"show, don't tell\" a meaningless word game?  Showing rather than telling is the writer acknowledging that his or her readers are not idiots. It is engaging the reader and forcing them to think, make logical conclusions, and get involved. Showing makes the story real. Think of your life. In a normal course of events, you see something and jump to a conclusion. A voice does not descend from the heavens to tell you how a person feels, you observe them and know, intuitively, what they feel. Human brains are wired to do this\u2014we're social creatures. No one has to tell you that a grimacing person holding their side is in pain. You know that. So why should the writer have to tell you? That said, I do like the way you describe the journey from film to screen, and the language you use when doing so. It is remote enough that it could be some alien technology, for all we know (if you hadn't announced what it was at the beginning, that is). ",

Does anyone talk like that? a calm silence ensues within me, Silence ensues?  This is unusual word choice. Is English your second language?  a squirmy feeling that is a mix of excitement and benign ingenuity towards the vision of life that will soon stretch out in front of me.  What is the feeling of benign ingenuity? This makes no sense. By this point I'm checking to see if you come from a place where they don't speak English at all.  To overturn the state of serenity,  Wait, I thought you were squirming with excitement and ingenuity? the screen suddenly becomes infused with a complex ray of lights A ray is singular. And rather simple. Maybe you meant array.   that originally belonged to a tiny envelope of film; There was an envelope which owned light? Film is flat, not an envelope.   what were thin scraps of plastic suddenly receive life, visible in form and matter that makes it hard to believe if it really is only a simple illusion.  Film is a long continuous strip. Not scraps of plastic. The second part of the sentence needs grammar fixed.  Perhaps it\u2019s the thin line between the intangible nature of what\u2019s presented before us and our own view that things are graspable.  Perhaps what is the thin line? Whether we like or dislike what we have in front of us, it\u2019s comforting to think that there\u2019s a window we can look through other than our own, and that it expands the horizon of our experiences, triggers unfelt emotions,  An unfelt emotion is not much of an emotion is it? and puts us inside a reality that is graspable for the time being. Is a film a reality? I suggest you write and rewrite this a few more times. Examine each word. Make sure they actually mean what you think they mean. Try starting with a single sentence that is precisely what you want this essay to say. Put that in front of you. Then start writing. Each word, each sentence should support or further define that sentence.  If your sentence is I love the cinema because it allows me to see another point of view, then toss out all that stuff about complex rays and scraps of plastic. Describe the tension or release of self that YOU feel.  Be consistent and don't say you are serene and squirming at the same time. Write about you. And again, fix your grammar and word choice problems. What you wrote is nearly gibberish. ",

            "answer_text": "The Rise of the Outsourced Admissions Essay If they wanted to, colleges could simply use test scores to rank students and send acceptance letters to the top ones. However, the universities choose not to this, instead preferring admission essays. Why? Ultimately, there are various biases that can limit a student\u2019s performance in test scores, including personal emergencies and financial backgrounds. The admissions essay is a chance for everyone to have a fair platform to prove that they are the best fit for the institution. It is meant to be a true reflection of the student\u2019s skills and talents. However, in the recent past, admissions officials have had a new issue to deal with, the growing popularity of the outsourced admissions essay. With so many students turning to professional writers for help with their applications, knowing who deserves a chance can be challenging. Let us explore this recent phenomenon in more depth. Why the Growing Popularity of Online Writing Services? One of the reasons why so many students are turning to online help for their admission essays is the unrealistic expectations by the education system. From the moment students enter high, it is impressed upon them that everything they do is meant to help them get into college. Given the significance of the admission essay towards achieving this goal, most of the applicants doubt their ability to get it right. To them it only makes sense to allow an experienced professional to help with completing a superior document, boosting their college prospects in the process. Another reason that students give for outsourcing their admission essays is lack of time. Most colleges have strict timelines during which applications are to be received and reviewed. Afraid of missing this critical deadline, most candidates choose to get help. Furthermore, there are tons of responsibilities and emergencies that can limit one\u2019s ability to work on this paper, including illness. The most notable reason that international students give for turning to online services is language barriers. It is hard enough dealing with the various formatting and citation requirements without having to worry about grammar and syntax. For those who use English as a second language, effectively communicating ideas in flowing prose can be challenging. It helps to know that they can turn to online editing and proofreading services for help with finetuning their texts. Are the Online Writing Services Legit? Well while there are many legit writing services our there, there are some whose only intention is to dupe unsuspecting students into buying plagiarized papers. Here some pointers for identifying a legit admission essay writing service: Terms of service must be included on the website;Samples of previous work;Responsive customer support;Reviews and feedback from customers;Strong policies and guarantees.The undeniable truth is that the trend of outsourcing admission essays is on the rise. While the debate on its ethical implications is bound to persist, it is time another perspective was considered. How can education systems address the challenges that push students to think over such services? ",

            "answer_text": "There have been a lot of great points already made, so I am basically rehashing others' ideas.The first sentence (fragment) should be expanded and turned into a good thesis.  Yes, you are answering the question correctly but it is conversational.  Make it formal by simply reiterating the question with your answer:  \"I find comfort and contentment in the cinema,\" would be a very simple thesis, or you can expand on it with more descriptive words. Check each sentence independently for simple syntax, for instance \"...and the audiences slowly come...\"  \"Audiences\" is a plural noun, and you are a singular person...how can you (a singular person) be involved with multiple audiences (a plural noun)?  \"...the audience slowly comes...\" or \"...the people of the audience slowly come...\" might be better choices. In my own personal opinion, I would avoid \"we\" and \"us.\"  You are being asked to describe your feelings and your experience.  Be self-centered, it's okay. Finally, draw more on the overall thesis.  You have done well in explaining how the cinema affects you.  But from where do these feelings arise, or why do these feelings arise?  Try to think back to your first trip to see a movie.  Did you have these same feelings, or did you have perhaps a little fear when the lights went down?  Was this a special treat with you and a parent or sibling or friend?  Did the first film you ever saw inspire you in some way? You have a good thought process going, but it leaves the reader wanting more.  Have a brainstorming session with yourself and try to remember when you first felt the delight of being in a cinema or experiences special to you that occurred in the cinema.  Make a list of words which this invokes or memories it stirs.  Turn this list into the \"why?\". And congratulations on reaching this milestone! ",

I don't think I can improve on the other answers but will just say I agree with much of what they have to say To me, it seems too verbose and there doesn't seem to be much of YOU in it. It's the sort of writing I've often come across in applications where candidates are writing to a brief and trying to show their language skills. I would prefer it to be a little less formal and flowery so I could see more of you in it ",

Look at each one out of context and make sure that first, it's grammatically correct (which means the opening sentence needs a verb at the very least) and second, that it expresses something necessary to your point. It would help if you clarified your point in your mind. Why are you content in the cinema? You've described the experience physically, but not why the process makes you happy. Also, I'd lose \"graspable\" and go with the traditional \"within our grasp\", but that's me. And do you really mean \"ingenuity\"? Thanks for asking me, good luck! ",

While everything else may seem to be difficult, we\u2019ll make it easy for you to understand how colleges evaluate applications. There are certain skills that B-school looks out for in an applicant. Some of the major factors of consideration are academic abilities, communication skills, leadership and team skills, and the clarity of goals and their contribution. While the academic abilities do help a student get a good score in the entrance exams, a student\u2019s attitude, mental outlook, commitment, ability to learn something new, think creatively and the mental soundness of an applicant are some of the qualities based on which an institute analyses an application. The passion and the thought clarity of an applicant can take them closer to their dream of getting into a business school. Communication holds the key to convince the admission panel about your ability to pursue business management which can become the deciding factor. Emphasizing extra-curricular activities is laid on for an applicant who has taken up while also checking up on their leadership and team skills which sheds light on the creative skills of an applicant.
