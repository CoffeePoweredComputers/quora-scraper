            "answer_text": "Thanks for this question but do you know these are all medical colleges and started operations in 2012 roughly with 50 students (which is 100 now). Look into the ranking its father Delhi AIIMS stands still in the ranking being one of the oldest institute teaching western medicine. Last line was to tell you that it takes years of effort to get ranked Higher Delhi AIIMS or any other college in the Top 25 list did not emerge overnight. AIIMS Bhopal and other AIIMS are still in the very nascent stage.(pravachan samapt) The main reason is Their first batch is yet to be graduated and none have PG seats yet. Although it started hospitals in 2011 and College in 2012 but the infrastructure is still not complete. The institute's have various criteria of ranking and these areas are under development for the cited institutes. These factors decide ranking after academics. So they can't actually qualify properly in next 3 years as well. As MBBS takes 5.5 years so let these youngsters mature a bit for atleast 8\u201310 batch graduates. Being a student what you should look is library, accomodation, faculties. And if you know AIIMS Raipur is ranked one of the best medical library. Faculties of all these AIIMS are top notch moreover they are headed by AIIMS Delhi. If you are not a student then wait for the fruit to ripen first Edit 1 : Presently all the AIIMS are having Post Graduate Courses, though not in all the specialties. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. First of all do not go by rankings. Secondly, AIIMS ND was founded in 1956. Was it the best institute then? or within a few years of being functional? NO! Getting to the top is a gradual process. The other AIIMS started in 2012 and just developing. The infrastructures, equipment etc of newly formed AIIMS need massive boost to even compete with the state run government medical colleges. Speaking about ranking, they take into account a lot of factors to consider and finalize the list. It will take time in years, but the other AIIMS will come up in rankings as well. For aspiring MBBS, aim to get a good rank in AIIMS to get into MBBS, or a good rank in NEET as well. College rankings don\u2019t create a good doctor, it\u2019s you, yourself, who can become a good doctor!! Good Luck! ",
