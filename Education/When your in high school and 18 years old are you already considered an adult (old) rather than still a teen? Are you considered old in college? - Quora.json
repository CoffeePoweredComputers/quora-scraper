            "answer_text": "Well, when I started college I was 16. I never felt so young and inexperienced in my life! When I was 18, I felt like I was an adult and ready to do adult things. When I was 21 and got married I really realized I was not an adult at 18. Now at 41 I laugh that I thought I was an adult at 21. Life is about learning, growing, and evolving. I would say it depends on your circumstances. I was a spoiled rotten only child who never had to do anything for herself growing up. But there are some people who I graduated with that were a lot older inside than 18. Life forms you, it's not an exact thing\u2026 When you are 18 you're an adult. You are an adult when you realize you don't know everything, and that you start to make mature decisions. Doesn't mean you can't still have fun, but one day you will wake up and realize you are now an adult. ",

            "answer_text": "As others said, in college you're definitely not considered \u201cold\u201d. You're relatively normal, if not on the baby end of things so to speak. And as for high school\u2026. There seems to be a divide between freshman and the rest of the school on this topic. Freshman tend to think more along the lines of adult, while the rest of the school still thinks of you as a teen. That small age difference does really matter, I suppose. ",
