For DP, easily you can get the past papers in the links mentioned in rest answers however in case of MYP, IB never disclose their e assessments, neither they make it public. But, IB educators can access those papers and can refer them to make their summative assessments. I am MYP-DP Physics Facilitator. For any assessments related queries, feel free to contact me. ",

            "answer_text": "Schools usually keep the most recent past papers for mock exams towards the end of your second year.  You can find everything you want online, evidently; but you really shouldn't look for them.  At the end, you need to trust that your school is preparing you in the best possible way and one of those ways is to put you under near-realistic exam conditions with a recent set of exams in the few months leading to the exam.  Remember, in IB, you're competing against the whole world not just your classmates. It is only with that mentality that you can achieve your maximum in May. Best of luck, an IB Diploma is the best choice you can do for your future. Cheers. ",
