The strange thing is; it may not be something as general as\u2026 English. Instead, you may find you're interested in modern American Literature. Or, perhaps there's something about hockey that interests you even a bit. You do some preliminary research and you find that pre-expansion jerseys interest you, or even pre-NHL professional hockey! The point is; stay aware of possible tangential relationships that may flourish for you. Even something as benign as music can stir curiosity. Classic rock has a great sound. You start digging into some bands and you become interested in how many musician were part of multiple bands! There is an infinite amount ideas in the world, there's something bound to garner your attention. ",
