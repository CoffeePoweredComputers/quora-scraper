            "answer_text": "There is no restriction about nationality when you enter a medical-related school. If your diploma is qualified as graduation from Japanese high school, you can take entrance exams for medical schools. Even if it doesn\u2019t, you can take \u9ad8\u5352\u8a8d\u5b9a\u8a66\u9a13 and get a diploma by passing it. Answering your question, technically you can. According to a statistical report by the government, there are about 2,400 foreign medical doctors in Japan.[1] The question is if you are TRULY fluent in Japanese. I assume you are not because if you are, it\u2019s a 30-sec work to google in Japanese and find official information. Not just N1, not just being able to watch anime without subs. True fluency at a perfect level. You need to take entrance exams for medical schools including interviews all in Japanese. You compete with native Japanese students.Classes are taught in Japanese at medical schools. There is no point in teaching in English or other languages because of #3.To practice in Japan, you need to be licensed. To get the license, you need to take the national exam all in Japanese.After becoming a doctor, almost everything you deal with, documents attached to medicine, co-medicals and such, are in Japanese. The exception should be patients. Even about them, you can\u2019t be picky about your patients (it\u2019s illegal to select who to see and who to not see in Japan).I guess said most if not all of those foreign doctors are native Japanese speakers who were raised and educated in Japan with a foreign passport (there are lots of such Chinese and Korean here). Unlike the other majors, there is no what they call \u201cGaijin privilege\u201d in the medical field because it\u2019s human lives you deal with.

            "answer_text": "in addition to Ms Watanabe's comment , your Japanese medical licence will likely not be recognised or accepted overseas and you either have to repeat medical school or re-take the licencing exams. I have heard of a Chinese woman practing medicine in Yokohama but like Chiaki says, her Japanese is close to native most likely she treats foreigners using her native language. As long as you have a valid medical licence you can practice anywhere in Japan. Whether Japanese will go to a foreign doctor is another matter entirely. ",
