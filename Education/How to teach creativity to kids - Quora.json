            "answer_text": "Playing games is a good way\uff1aGames are the predominant activities of young children. In games, children develop from simple imitation to creation. They gradually develop game plots creatively, play game roles creatively, make game props creatively and so on. You can provide children with enough handmade materials, such as paint, crayons, cut and paste, various boxes and glue, etc., but don't put a lot of things in front of him at once, because the child will not know where to start.Music and painting are effective ways to cultivate children's creativity\uff1aBecause the concert promotes the development of the right brain, and people with developed right brains often have extraordinary creativity. Like Einstein, Edison, and Picasso are all developed with right brains. In the beautiful sound of music, young children are excited and happy. At this time, its creativity is in excellent condition. Similarly, painting can also promote the development of the right hemisphere of children's brains, enhance children's imagination, image thinking and creativity. The evaluation of children's drawings is not mainly measured by the appearance of images, but by whether he can use his imagination to create a beautiful image. Every image they draw is a creation for them, and we should strongly encourage children's creation.Tell a story to a child\uff1aFictional scenes, characters, sounds, situations and smells for the story. This kind of imagination is very constructive for children. Compared with tape recorders, parents tell stories to their children, which is more intimate and communicative.Stimulate children's curiosity\uff1aToddlers are particularly curious, and everything must be moved. Parents should encourage their children to do more. In actual operation, on the one hand, you can exercise your child's hand-eye coordination and exercise the development of small muscles in the fingers, and accordingly promote the development of these small muscles in the corresponding parts of the brain.Make the most of nature\uff1aMom and baby can collect some leaves of different colors and shapes to take home, wipe the leaves clean with cotton, and clamp them in a book to flatten. Then prepare the baby with tools such as scissors, glue, white paper, etc., so that the baby can create his own work under the guidance of his mother.",

            "answer_text": "A child is full of curiousity. To them, ideas come from everything. For the complete development of a child, creativity is as important as literature. A child has a different way of looking at things and situations. Their way isn\u2019t just simple, many times it is innovative. The minds of children are not contaminated by logic or what can be done and what can\u2019t be done. Their imagination is wild and free. Hence it is crucial to foster creativity in children because the beauty of creativity is that you cannot exhaust creativity. The more it is used, the more it is created. \u00b7 One of the most effective ways to fostering creativity in children is to provide them with all the resources they would need. It is a must that parents don\u2019t create a hindrance in the child\u2019s creative process by scolding them about how they are making a mess. What may seem like a mess to parents is a child\u2019s creative way of expressing himself/herself. Give them all the art supplies, costumes, a small camera, building material, coloured clay. If possible take them to the art store and let them pick their supplies. A trip to the art store won\u2019t just be a fun outing but children will see all the types of supplies available and they will begin thinking of how to incorporate them in their art. Don't point out which ideas are not good enough and which aren\u2019t feasible. The focus of creative activities should be on the process: generating ideas. Let them make mistakes and let them fail. By this, they will not just learn from their mistakes but also learn to not let their failure affect their ability to try again. \u00b7 Ask your child to create something from waste. Give them old toys, newspaper pieces, straws, to use them. \u00b7 Allow the child\u2019s curiosity to determine the speed of learning. \u00b7 Encourage the child to follow his/her interests. Enroll them in art, dance, drama or singing classes. They will look forward to going. \u00b7 Share your love for learning or your interests with the child. This will encourage him/her to be more vocal about their interest. \u00b7 When children ask questions, do not get irritated or annoyed. If you don\u2019t have the answer, inform them that you will get back to them once you know. Take the children to visit zoos, aquariums, museums, technology centers and give them plenty of time to learn about different types of animals or things, asking questions about them. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot teach creativity. CANNOT. Creativity is a capacity you are born with, not something you can learn. In some poeple it is stroger, in some not so much. However, like with anyting, any trait, any quality, etc., you can do many things to develop it, enhence it and let it grow, or just let it whither\u2026 In my observation, there is no need to \u201cteach\u201d or develop creativity of any kind, be it skills with words, music, visual arts, action, problem solving, math, whatever \u2026 in children. Why? Because human beings are naturally creative. Children naturally possess great creativity. Just don\u2019t ruin it. Don\u2019t inhibit it !!!! So a better question to ask would be what to do to allow children express the natural creativity they already have. The answer is banal and simple. Don\u2019t thwart it \u2014 that is what most education and most parents do \u2014 often in the best of faith. I can tell you about one thing I have some experience and knowlege of, and that is visual arts, drawing, painting, using clay, plasticine, modeline, playdouh or anything like that\u2026 The basic thing is to let children be. Let them be playful and enjoy playing with these things in anyway they like. Abandon any ideas, expectations and judgements about what is correct and not, what is \u201cthe right way\u201d and \u201cwrong way\u201d. Do not try to show them how to do things, but let them do things anyway they like/want. Don\u2019t force any anything on them. Don\u2019t direct them to anything. Do NOT interfere, do not tell them to do this or that. Never tell them how things should be. \u201cYou draw a cat like that\u201d \u2014 kills creativity! You can say, though \u2014 if a child pesters you about drawing a cat for them \u2014 \u201cI do it like that\u201d and do it \u201cYou do as you like to do it and your way of doing it is perfect\u201d. Don\u2019t push your ideas on children. Just give them metarials and let them be. NEVER EVER tell them to be sparsam with paper, paint, materials, ect. NEVER tell them they should do something in some way. ALWAYS be approving and accepting, but do not rant and rave at how great things are, either \u2014 unless something is like that in your true feeling \u2014 then express it. You must put up with some colateral demage of breaking tools and wasting metairials. I don\u2019t mean lettting cildren destroy things in a crazy frenzy of childish madness, but I mean the broken tools and wasted materials in clumsy attempts to use them to create something, or using them not like an adult would. That is ok. WIth drawing, painting it is especially important not to ask/admonish children to finish their artwork \u2014 sometimes and only sometimes you can very gently suggest it, and not as an admonishing but as a friendly remainder \u201cIs that peace finished? Do you want to do soemthing more with it?\u201d would certainly enough\u2026. and let it be then. Let them start as many drawings/paintings on as many pieces of paper as they want. Again, I am not talking about letting children fall in frenzy of semi-destructive action, but about letting them learn in their own way, at their own pace without being told, corrected, interurpted etc. Just let them be. Yet, it is also important to be with a child and help them, sit with them, especially if the want you to do that \u2014 just follow their lead then, Be with them in an open, not directing way\u2026 If they want to work on their own \u2014 just provide the envioronment and express your joy at that. That is all true about children 0- to roughly 11/12 yo \u2014 after that time their minds are more like the mind of adults and if they like, they can start more formal training in visual arts under the guidence of a suitable and comptent art teacher \u2014 whose main goal is to help such a child develop and discover their own potential and how to best use it and enhence it and NOT to push some fixed iadea of their own on a child. Creativity is freedom. If you want someone to be creative they must be free and safe. Cutting a tree or uprooting a seadling is way easier than helping it grow. How can you grow a tree? I can\u2019t grow a tree as such. All you can do is provide sun, water and other condition necessary for and supporting plant development. WIth creativity it is just like that. For children doing visual arts as I just described is of enormous value for their overall develpment, whether or not they will make any use of that in future. Just like learning to play music, do sports \u2014 body awarness and develpoing physical capacity and strenght, studying math, history, science, reading poetry, books, etc is all essenstial and doing it is worthy enedevour in itself \u2014 not means to gain someting. Art helps you \u2014 sometimes in a very sublte ways \u2014 to get in touch with your inner self and thus to be happier and more fulfilled \u2014 it is a value in itself, not means to achievieng success. That is how it should be viewed. To recap, Don\u2019t thwart it. Provide loving, accepting, safe and open enviroment for children to experiment and play in. Your only concern should be their health and safety. Other than that let them be free and just support and gently stimulate them with propossing some thing they could do, but never tell them how to go about it\u2026. And that should extand to all areas of life Study, Summerhill by Neil Study attachment parenting Study Free education, especially Jesper Juul (family therapist) - Wikipedia \u2014 all his books Read the Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff best of luck ",

            "answer_text": "Whenever a child in my pre-K class is doing any type of artwork, it is not uncommon for them to ask me or my co-teacher if we like what they drew or painted. They seem to feel the need to have approval from us. (This happens at home with parents, too.) I often say that only one person has to like what they did. Every year, I ask the children if they know who that one person is - one year, a child\u2019s response was \u201cMy mommy?\u201d While this response was very cute, I explained that THEY are the artist and THEY are the only person who has to like their artwork! I purposely avoid making judgement statements, like \u201cYour painting is beautiful!\u201d As an alternative response, I may say a statement of fact about how they have been working on their art for a very long time or that they used many colours. I frequently say that I like how everyone\u2019s artwork is DIFFERENT! This helps to minimize the likelihood that a child will feel the need to copy what their friends are doing. I will also ask them if they can tell me about their picture, rather than saying \u201cWhat did you make?\u201d Sometimes, they didn\u2019t make a specific thing, but rather a design or interesting pattern. I will also interject if another child tells a classmate that their artwork is \u201cScribble scrabble\u201d. I will say that this child is the artist and they get to decide how their picture looks. Many years ago, I once had a substitute teacher make the grave error of saying to a child that she loved the horses that this child drew. I knew that she had the best of intentions, but this child looked at the educator with an extremely sad face and announced \u201cI didn\u2019t draw horses, I drew my mommy and daddy!\u201d Boy, was that child insulted! Let each child explore the many different mediums that you provide in your class or home and make sure that the workspace is protected with an old plastic table cloth or shower curtain liner so that making a mess is not an issue. You should also provide smocks with sleeves. When we have orientation night for our new parents at the beginning of each school year, we make a point of telling them to dress their children in comfortable older play clothes - and even if it has a stain on it from a previous activity, we will not judge them! We provide smocks for all of our messy activities but the children frequently get dirty anyways. Art should be creative, varied and fun! (And age appropriate). Let the opportunities for exploration begin! ",

            "answer_text": "I believe it\u2019s a critical question. Children (and adults) will need creativity and innovation skills more and more, to face the challenges of our fast moving world. Their future jobs, the technologies they will be able to leverage and the complex communication that will be required in a globalized world will necessitate open and creative minds. I\u2019ve been teaching creativity to kids, parents and teachers for more than 20 years, as well as to my own 3 kids, and I can definitely say this is something that can be taught and made into a thinking habit. What works best is providing them with practical and relevant tools they can apply to real world situations and challenges. Although you may think \u201cHow can tools and methods enhance creativity?\u201d, I can tell you that too much \u201cfreedom\u201d of thinking is actually not helpful and can be confusing and frustrating. The human (and the child\u2019s) mind needs a frame of reference. It needs a starting point to help it start, and then it can soar to new ideas and imagination. So tools such as SCAMPER, Six thinking hats, Mind Mapping, Multiple Intelligences activities are the ones that I use to teach creativity to kids. It helps them generate new ideas, handle complex situations, develop diverse points of view and more. I create an online course on how parents and teachers can teach creativity to kids with exactly these kinds of tools.

            "answer_text": "So many shrewd answers so far and all point to one general notion: Children have innate creativity and curiosity and our job as adults is not to curb it. Yet more often than not we fail at doing this job. Hence, adults would learn a lot about creativity by watching children, rather than the other way around. The bigger idea is this. A short film \u201cLa Luna\u201d by Enrico Casarosa, which is a DISNEY PIXAR production will help you understand how we all (adults) curb the innate creativity and inquisitiveness of our children. To help you grasp the idea behind this story I partly refer to the description which can be found on the La Luna web page. La Luna is the timeless fable of a young boy coming of age in the most peculiar circumstances. Tonight is the very first time his Papa and Grandpa are taking him to work. In an old wooden boat they row far out to sea, and with no land in sight, they stop and wait. A big surprise awaits the little boy as he discovers his family\u2019s most unusual line of work. Every night the men pull a huge ladder out of the boat and climb it up to the moon. Once at the top, they begin to sweep the stars that fell on the moon illuminating it. After they\u2019re done with this job the moon is visible in the sky as a lit croissant. Should he follow the example of his Papa or his Grandpa? Will he be able to find his own way amidst their conflicting opinions and timeworn traditions? At first glance, the boy, his father, and his grandfather they are cut from the same mold. They wear overalls and hats; they carry brooms. But the contrast between them reveals their characters. Covered by the signs of age, the two adult men\u2019s eyes cannot be seen. Nor can they see as clearly and widely as the boy, whose large eyes are unobstructed and clear \u2013 his eyes symbolize openness, lack of limitations of and better ability to perceive the world. They on the other hand see the world in a limited way and through the prism of assumptions that have arisen over the years. While still in the boat the adult men are arguing, how the boy should wear his cap \u2013 the grandpa way or the father way. Both men symbolize the years spent performing this one duty \u2013 doing the same thing over and over again, as Albert Einstein would say. The grandfather moves his traditional broom with precision; the father wields a push-broom for increased efficiency. Both are arguing in front of the timid boy \u2013 they both want to have an impact on him. Suddenly, a huge star drops on the moon. The adult men cannot cope with it. It turns out that it is the young boy who finds a solution to this problem and thus the work could have been finished. From now on each of them sweeps the stars his own way. And as soon as they returned to the boat the boy takes his cap off and puts it on again, but this time he does it his own way. What this short story can teach us, parents? Often we argue, how something needs to be done. By doing so we care less about the outcome, but rather we want something done our way. We were taught certain patterns, certain ways, certain methods (and now we keep repeating them day in and day out). Somewhere in the process of growing up we lose the ability to question status quo and authority and thus critical thinking is out the window. Or we think we know (we invented) the best way to perform a certain task, etc. We do not let the other person try out his or her own methods, thereby reducing (or eliminating) chances of coming to creative solutions by this person. Our focus on the preferred method takes precedence over concentration on the outcome. This often results in a typical ego duel. One person believes that the task can be performed properly only in a certain (her) way and therefore she knows that the other person has to do it this way), whereas the other person does not want to blindly subordinate to anyone\u2019s whim. Let your kid be like Christopher Columbus. Let him or her try things out and discover new ways. Our  tendency to curb the innate creativity and inquisitiveness of our children starts very early on. We take all those preconceived notions and limitations that already reside within us and, without even being aware of it, we pass them on to our kids. And every time we do it we kill Christopher Columbus in them (we kill him because he innately is within each and every one of us). \u201cYou keep a knife in this hand and a fork in the other\u201d\u201cPeanut butter isn\u2019t good with scrambled eggs\u201d\u201cThis is how you should sweep the floor\u201dThe list goes on and on. Of course some caution is advisable \u2013 we don\u2019t want our kids to perform tests that could be life-threatening. But let\u2019s be honest \u2013 is eating peanut butter with scrambled eggs life-threatening? And parents often act as if it was, while they should let their kids explore. ",

            "answer_text": "One afternoon, my family was out grocery shopping and we passed by a shelf of stuffed animals. My baby sister Angie couldn't take her eyes off of an adorable little plush horse. It was black all over, except for a white star on its head, and it whinnied whenever you squeezed its stomach. \"Please, Mommy, can we get it? Look, it's so cute,\" Angie begged, but we already had plenty of stuffed animals at home, so the verdict was no. So went on with our shopping as usual, and after we put all the groceries in the trunk, we were left with an empty plastic bag. On the car ride home, Angie played with that plastic bag. She blew into it until it inflated, and then tied its two handles together so that they formed a bow. \"Look, Hannah!\" she said happily. \"Now it looks kind of like a horse. See, the bag is its body, and the handles are its two ears.\" \"Really long ears,\" I pointed out solemnly. \"Hmm. They look more like antlers,\" she mused. \"I know! He can be a moose. I'll call him Mister Moose. No, Mooster Moose!\" And so Mooster Moose was born. Every time we rode in the car for the next few days, she'd take him out to play with, and I'd happily play along. She built him a persona (characterized primarily by his deep voice and inability to process sarcasm), and also gradually wove him a background story (apparently he'd lived a long and interesting life in the grocery store before being adopted into our family.) Throughout this process, I was repeatedly amazed. Using nothing but a plastic bag, and motivated by nothing but the lack of a real plush horse to play with, my six-year-old sister had created something so childishly, naively, brilliantly imaginative.  A second example of her creativity happened a couple of weeks later. At that point, we'd ended up buying that plush horse for her, because she'd always gazed at it with so much longing every time we went to the store. As promised, he whinnied every time he was squeezed, and Angie happily translated each whinny for us when we asked what the horse was trying to say. Unfortunately, the poor horse suffered a terrible accident a few days after his adoption into our family. One day as we were all getting into the car, the little horse somehow fell out the door, and we backed out of the parking space before Angie realized he was missing. When she did, she cried out and made us stop the car, and then ran back to pick him up. She clutched him to her chest and refused to let go. Disaster struck later when she tried to squeeze him, and instead of whinnying, the little horse only made an empty-sounding clicking noise. After trying over and over but only ever getting those hollow \"click-click\"s, Angie looked horrified and her lower lip began to tremble.  But eventually she said with a teary smile, \"Maybe it can be the sound of his hoofbeats.\" And from that moment on, the little horse became a little less talkative and a lot more athletic.  The point I'm trying to illustrate with these anecdotes is that my baby sister tends to be incredibly creative when the situation demands it. That's something I love about her, but it's also something that's true of almost every kid I've met, taught, and played with. Kids are born thinking out of the box. If you want to see a kid get creative, my suggestion is to give them a handful of toys or other materials, along with an interesting problem to solve, and plenty of time and sincere attention. They might just surprise you with how easily they can stretch what they have to create everything they don't.  ",

            "answer_text": "There is a saying by Confucius, that a good teacher would tell only one corner and a good student will on his own find the other three corners. This is like a text book with a very little theory, more of exercises. It is in solving the exercise, one understands the theory behind. Spoon feeding or revealing all the four corners, is the worst thing a teacher or parents can do to kill the creativity of children. Referring study guides is a bad example for problem solving, which kills the creativity of the kids. They tend to get biased, which goes against being open minded or creative. Every kids must be made to understand that they are unique and are incomparable. When they are so convinced their thinking also becomes unique and differs from all the other kids. Creativity is not a gift of the selected few, one can practice and become creative. Creative ideas in most cases begin with an urge to solve a problem or simplifying a cumbersome process. Once an issue is identified, the mind goes into a processing mode with the available data.  The processing is based on some of the following traits. Have flair for Details.Be Imaginative.Be Unbiased.Be Open.Be Positive.Question Assumptions.Simplify.Practice Serendipity.Accumulate Ideas(pool of ideas leads to fresh ideas).Be clear in expression.Handle challenges.These traits can be taught with examples, to ingrain these habits in them. These habits, ingrained in them, they will exhibit a creative approach in dealing with problems. The creative approach could be checked by giving various exercises. These could be toys, tricks or puzzles. Toys Lego Toys, building some thing different.Rubik\u2019s Cube..,.Puzzles Given three sticks, how will you form a square or 4 triangles?Suppose you, drop an apple and a feather at the same time which will hit the ground first, in a medium of vacuum?..,.Looking at the way the kid has approached the problem, one can assess his creative trait, whether he looked at the details, whether he raised any questions, whether he was clear of the problem and whether the kid exhibited any of the other traits. By repeating the above steps one can reasonably bring in the creative attitude in the kids. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't teach creativity to your kids.....it is inbuilt. However, here are a few steps that may encourage creativity: 1) Avoid over exposure to television and the internet. If young children are given too much exposure to these sources of information, they might end up with the habit of searching for answers using these before even thinking about the possible answer to any question. Furthermore this can also hamper the child's ability to create as in this day and age, creations of a child will start from something which is already present in a better form. Now a child who watches television regularly or is an internet buff will easily find methods to create better versions of the same thing. Now over-exposure to mass media always inculcates the habit of finding ways rather than thinking of them. 2) Never spoon-feed a child. For the exact same reasons as given in the 1st step. It is all about inculcation of habits at an early age that will later benefit a child. 3) Always encourage a child if he indulges in any creative art or academic field. If he/she wants to enroll in some class teaching any of these, please support him/her. Never force him/her to do something which he/she does not like. Parental and peer pressure can really demotivate the child. It can discourage the child from pursuing what he wants to, which results in a loss to not only the child but the country he lives in as well. This is because it is a well known fact that a person can contribute his best to the field that he is the most passionate about. 4) Implement the Montessori teaching system and principles. Because it best promotes the creative instinct of a child. 5) Discourage cramming. In the case of academics, strongly discourage cramming. Even if it comes at the cost of a really low percentage of marks in school. Make him/her understand the thing first. 6) Realize the fact that creativity can't be forced. Don't make him/her sit with the objective of drawing something or writing a poem. Wait for the creative spurt or instinct which comes naturally to a creative person and I ensure you that he/she will create magic. Pure magic! ",

Those tasks can't be done every day. I know that. But I always encourage her to do both of those. I encourage her to study a lot of storybooks. Stories can generate new thoughts. I asked her regularly which picture or story did she drew or wrote. It is for that, dad does not forget about those tasks. I also encourage her to try new things without afraid of being wrong. I don't give her pressure. I always to make her understand what are the utilities of those. I exampled her as. If anyone exercise on a daily basis then his health will be better. He muscle will be better. Now we have to exercise our brain daily. So that our brain also becomes healthy. Those picture drawing and story writing are the exercises of the brain. This build-up our brain strong. It is my way to teach my daughter. Thanks for reading a common man's answer. ",

            "answer_text": "For the most part, creativity is inherently available in children. This stems from the overflowing curiosity for the world that each child is born with. But somewhere along the line, creativity gets buried by rules and regulations. As a father of a 15-year-old, and someone who indulges in creativity every single day as his livelihood depends on it, I am probably one of the best people to talk about this. But first, here\u2019s some information:- George Land, an author, and scientist conducted a research study in 1968 to test the creativity of 1,600 children ranging in ages from three-to-five years old. He re-tested the same children at 10 years of age, and again at 15 years of age. The results were astonishing. Among 5-year-olds, 98% of subjects passed the test. But as they progressively got older, the number decreased to 30% among 10-year-olds, and 12% among 15-year-olds. Among 28 lakh adults, only 2 percent passed the test. Therefore he concluded that \u201cnon-creative behavior is learned.\u201d So yes, creativity can be learned, but not by conventional learning processes. Creativity can only be learned by learning and applying creative thinking. As an example, I\u2019ll use my own experience. My son was the epitome of curiosity at a younger age. He had a passion for everything around him, his curiosity burned bright like a flame and he asked questions about everything, interacted with everyone, showed an interest in everything\u2026 It was truly amazing to see. My son enjoyed a little bit of everything. He learns the guitar, takes karate classes, loves football (and had lately started showing an interest in motorcycles and automotive pursuits in general, takes after his dad I guess!) Things changed, however, in his last school. The school I previously had in him was taking a toll on his ability to think clearly, it was easy to tell. Ever since the last couple of years, all his interests were dying out to be replaced by books, books, and more books. I\u2019d come home to see him just buried in homework and assignments. I\u2019d go through these assignments, and they\u2019re honestly nothing original. Research and rote learning based on their fixed academic curriculum\u2026 that\u2019s it. I was not satisfied with what I saw and I knew I had to take action. Which I did. So we pulled him out of that school and put him in a new one. A school I felt was better aligned with not only their approach to education but my beliefs as well. And now in this school called Excelsior American School in Gurgaon, he\u2019s seen significant improvement. Two years in and the frown on his face is now again upside down! He\u2019s pursuing all his interests (Surprisingly out of which, academics have become one of them.) He enjoys his subjects and the learning process and gets ample time to pursue his extracurriculars just as he wanted to. So yes, I believe that when it comes to teaching kids, what educational systems need to do, is simply, promote curiosity and creative behavior. Even go as far as to encourage it and nurture it. Modern education curriculums and boards understand this. As an example, schools such as Excelsior American School in Gurgaon is a proponent of this belief as well. Modern schools such as Excelsior have helped me understand something that I originally didn\u2019t think was possible. Which is \u201cCreativity and Academic pursuits need not be on opposite sides of the spectrum, if the innate ability of children is nurtured, then they will be creatively successful in everything that they do, with their creative tendencies actually acting as an advantage!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Most children are naturally creative. From the time they start to bang things together, or draw on a piece of paper, they are creating something, even if you see it just noise or scribbling. So long as parents and other adults around them encourage them, and don\u2019t restrict them other than for safety methods, children won\u2019t lose their creativity. Of course some are naturally more talented than others, and this will emerge as they develop. But everyone is creative, if they dig deep enough. Sometimes it can be well hidden if a child\u2019s life is too structured, or if they start formal education too young. But in a free learning environment, with plenty of safe tools and resources, a child will explore many kinds of creativity. You might sometimes need to redirect creative attempts: if a child is about to draw on a wall, you might want to pin up a large sheet of paper, or suggest they draw instead on some paper. If they are about to bang a glass table with a hammer, you probably want to swap it for a plastic table and plastic hammer. But don\u2019t discourage the child\u2019s wishes to create something new. If a child does not seem to be showing much creativity, you could try demonstrating it yourself. Start painting, or doing origami, or playing some percussion instruments, or building with Lego, and invite the child to join you. Never, ever criticise or try to make the child do something differently (unless it\u2019s for safety reasons). If a child wants to colour hair purple and give someone two mouths and six eyes, that\u2019s fine. Creativity doesn\u2019t have boundaries. ",

What we can do is we can help them to discover their inner creativity. How to unleash your kid's Creativity? Find what your kid likes if not allow them to explore different creative activities.You can try drawing, singing, painting, arts and crafts, origami, and more.By introducing your kid to various creative activities, your kid will find what interests them the most.Encourage them in their desired creative activity and make sure they never feel down.As a parent, try to spend more time with your kid, eventually you know your kid's creativeness.If you want to introduce your kid to various creative activities you can try exploring the Learner Circle online learning platform, I recently came across this platform and I found this very beneficial for my daughter and she too enjoys learning there.

            "answer_text": "Creativity is something that everybody has, and it's a sense that tends to get diluted over time as you grow up. I'd generally attribute this to the sensation of realizing that while you're an individual, your individuality doesn't always factor into the world at large as you think it might. With that in mind, I think it's possible to channel creativity in kids by fostering more chances for exploration and utility of that creativity. You can teach kids to write, draw and build all day, but until they understand what the use case of it in the world is, they'll never tightly couple it to themselves in a way that carries forward in life.

That means there is no model to copy, no correct way to complete a task, no way to win. Doing those types of activities develop particular skills but they are not creative. Creative materials are: art supplies, music instruments to use with prerecorded music (drums, shakers, tambourines , etc. ) materials to build with, writing materials, mechanical objects that can be combined to create different structures (erector sets), problem solving challenges. All offer kids the chance to create and invent, imagine and visualize and problem solve, tapping into their creative mind. These are only suggestions I am imagining while I am sitting here. Use your own imagination to develop activities that can be completed in multiple ways. Think diversity and divergence and you will be on the right track. ( I am right now sitting with my two granddaughters who are out of school today. Guess what they are doing? They are decorating store bought cookies for Halloween. The kit came with different colored icing and candy trim. My girls are having a ball\u2026.who cares if we eat them ? If not eaten I will let my chickens enjoy a cookie feast!) ",

As far as teaching creativity I would say that the major rule is that there are no rules. Kids rarely are encouraged to ignore rules so perhaps by simply pushing the idea that creativity comes from opening your mind to any possibility kids would be drawn to it. Creativity comes in all forms too...its not just visual arts or music or dance. It can be science as well...being able to create complex mathematical equations requires massive amounts of creativity. A creative mind, then, is perhaps one that sees beyond what is obvious or easily seen and into the potential beauty that surrounds us all. ",
