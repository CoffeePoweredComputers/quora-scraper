            "answer_text": "It sounds to me like you are a procrastinator. I can relate. If I am right you need to learn to work smarter, not harder. Fortunately this is not difficult. I can sum up the process in two words: Flash cards. Most text books follow the 80 - 20 rule. 80% background, explanations and examples. 20% facts. Happily it\u2019s the facts that provide the knowledge you need, both for the test and the application of the subject in real life situations. So, once you have reviewed the background and understand the explanations and examples you are finished with the 80%. Now you focus on the 20% by reviewing the material and moving the facts to 3x5 index cards for later study. You can use other card formats but 3x5 is absolutely the best. You will need to experiment with how you structure your cards but the basic approach should be question on the front, answer on the back. If the subject is complex you break it down to manageable elements and use more cards. LIMIT the amount of information on each card. Keep in mind that the human brain can only absorb small amounts of information at a time AND it needs repetition to create strong memories. You will find the best levels for you as you perfect your style. Once your cards are ready arrange them in a logical order and starting with the top 10 review them, question and answer, until you know the material absolutely. Then mix up the 10 and go through them again. Do this a few times to overcome sequence queuing. Then start with the next 10, and so on. If you are like most of us, you will remember using flash cards in primary school to learn the really basic stuff. Unfortunately as we progressed in school the teachers seemed to rely less and less on this basic learning technique. But flash cards work at all levels, and all subjects, and you can rely on them to shorten the time you need to study while they improve your learning. By the time I finished grad school I had boxes and boxes of cards. Mostly they just stayed in the closet, but I would drag them out from time to time and review a subject just to see how much I remembered. I never remembered anywhere near everything, but I seemed to always remember more than I thought I would. Two words: Flash Cards. Good luck,,, PS\u2026DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS USING A COMPUTER. THIS IS STRICTLY A PEN AND PAPER PROJECT. ",

If you do this religiously you will make it a habit, learn to get it done efficiently, and have time for enjoyment before bed. ",
