            "answer_text": "Because the world is full of uncertainties whose dark alleys are out to fool you and take your money. You want to be neither too risk averse nor too risk seeking. You don\u2019t want to put all your money in just one company\u2019s stock but also don\u2019t want to own it all in fiat currency to avoid the market entirely. You don\u2019t want to play a repeated game with a deterministic strategy, but your strategy also cannot also be completely random and devoid of strategy. Statistics and probability help decide on the extent of the moderation from extremes required for optimal decision-making. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two big reasons: Many of the phenomena in nature appear to follow statistical distributions. By understanding these distributions we can come to know and describe those phenomena.Our uncertainty about the world can be described with statistics. That means we can quantify our knowledge, we can put a number on how certain we are and point to why. We can use statistics to test that knowledge and further it. This is the essence of science.",
