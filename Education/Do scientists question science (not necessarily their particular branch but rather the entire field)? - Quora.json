            "answer_text": "To answer your question we would need to first define what is 'science' and what is the entire discipline. Science nowadays does not completely adhere to the original philosophy, but if we restrict ourselves to that origin we may be able to define science. Originally, science was the application of the scientific method which was simply a rational and methodic approach to discover anything, coming from empirism and positivism. A simplification of the method would be: 1- Assume you don't know anything about how something works2- Try to interact with it in a repeatable way and measure the response (experiment)3- Repeat the interactions and see if results are repeatable. (consistency and repeatability)4- Propose an explanation of the responses with respect to the interactions you did (hypothesis)5- Try to look for corner cases of your explanation6- Predict the outcomes using your explanation7- Reproduce the conditions of a corner case and measure the response. (if it doesn't fit, the hypothesis doesn't hold, so back to #4) If your prediction was correct, your hypothesis holds. Now you should share your data and hypothesis with other scientists so they do the same experiments and validate your results, try to find other cases and check your hypothesis' validity. If they do, then it appears to be true, it's a Theory. Scientists will check your methods, your data, your experiments, your conclusions, reproduce and alter the settings, look for variations, check internal consistency of the hypothesis, try to disprove your hypothesis and look for contradictions with other hypothesis and Theories. So, do scientists question Science? They should from within Science.  Do they question it from outside the framework? Well, they did. It really is part of philosophy so it was criticised and reviewed for a long time and was improved. Since then, minor adjustments were made to include other branches of science and transform into a generalist definition of the method instead of an empirical one. Finally, questioning the Discipline from outside would be to question the philosophy behind it, which would be a philosopher's job, not a scientist's. ",

            "answer_text": "Every scientist should have had some training in the philosophy of science, and also epistemology, which is basically the theory of knowledge (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology). Honestly I think in some countries, for example in the US, it's not a requirement to become a scientist but it should be. At the very minimum, scientists should of course have thought long and hard about what constitutes valid knowledge, and how it is acquired and revised.  All scientists agree that using the scientific method (with modifications according to the specific field) is the most reliable way that we have of learning about the natural world, and all scientists agree that the truths science deals with are provisional as new data may bring on revisions to the current state of knowledge. If a scientist were to think that the scientific method is flawed to the point of being useless, then it would be hard for that person to continue working as a scientist, because she /he works run into problems getting data that other scientists would consider reliable. But it's not like we sign some sort of pact that we cannot question certain things or we have to return our PhDs. Is actually very interesting that distinguishing science from non-science, in other words the demarcation problem, is very easy at the extremes but there are disciplines and fields that do get questioned because they do not use or cannot use the \"classic\" version of the scientific method. Philosopher of science and evolutionary biologist Massimo Pigliucci wrote a very nice book on this subject called Nonsense on Stilts : how to tell science from bunk (http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo5812109.html). I highly recommend it to scientists and lay people alike. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes.  In my opinion, not often enough. This is noticeable when science starts spilling over into discussions involving policy, politics, religion, and philosophy. To be clear, by \"question,\" I mean asking what science is, where it starts and where it ends. The evolution-creation debates are by far the most obvious example.  In my (probably naive) view, the entire thing can be ended with some philosophical discussion, rather than the usual mess those arguments devolve into. A lot of the debate is basically about how life came about in the past.  By virtue of it being historical, it's never going to be fully testable, at least not without some assumptions.  The \"assumptions\" held by an evolutionary biologist studying it scientifically vs. the assumptions held a creationists are completely different.  Neither side is going to win over the other in those separate frameworks.  In my view, you miss this separation if you don't question what you're really asking and assuming as a scientist.  I see it missed by scientists all the time. ",

I doubt it, because it's proven time and again that it's the best method we have for building predictive models. If it wasn't, there's no way we'd have rovers on Mars or flu vaccines.  Do scientists question whether or not there are better ways to build predictive models? Some probably do, and it's a good question. But we have no answer to it. Our only choice right now is to use the best tool we have, and luckily for us it's worked in many situations.  There's an odd (and false) idea on Quora (and in popular culture) that most scientists are philosophers, studying science itself. Most aren't. They're too busy to think about that stuff. They've got a lab full of 1,000 samples in petri dishes, and they're making notes on each one, seeing if any of the samples turn green instead of blue. ",

If a scientist was to question 'science' he would be questioning the method with which the infomation was acquired. Maybe he didn't control all the variables and they can design a better experiment. As far as questioning the validity of our knowledge goes, the answer is yes. Scientists are highly motivated to question knowledge that we take for granted. The more fundamental the idea the scientist proved to be wrong, the bigger the boost to their career!  If you could prove evolution to be wrong your name would live in history forever! ",

When a theory is questioned and tortured and tested, but is still standing, then there is reason to believe in it. But we must keep questioning them anyway. \"Or do you HAVE to start from that framework to stay in the scientific community?\" Look, anyone who seriously rocks the foundation of any science, establishing a new foundation, is hailed as a saviour, used as an inspiring example, and is more welcome than anyone else in the scientific community. But when you question the established theories, then you have to have some well-prepared arguments ready, or you won't have a chance. Only fair, I think. ",
