            "answer_text": "Physics is a subject that requires thorough understanding of the concept. For that, you have to understand why the concepts were needed, how were they discovered and why they are important. For example, newton discovered gravity because he was curious why do we remain bonded to the ground, why do it objects fall , why planets rotate etc. Then comes the formula part. There is a derivation behind every formula,so try to derive them. Trust me, there are only a few basic physical quantities in physics. The formulas are just derived from earlier known concepts. Once you understand how the formula has been made, then you will not have to memorize them. When you see a question, read it thoroughly. Every line contains something. Every line will give you some quantity required for the question. For example,\u201d a ball is thrown down from a building.\u201d Here you are provided with two things, the first is initial velocity =0 , and acceleration due to gravity, which is +9.8m/s^2. Write what is given yo you, and then what is to be found. Proceed step by step. That think how can you arrive at the answer. If you have any difficulty, re read the question and see what do you need , what is missing.Practice is the key. Now coming to theorotical questions, visualise them. You will see the problem becomes much more easier. If you are familiar with the type of questions, then you can easily do it. Hence, practice more and more problems. ",

You must have the formulae at your fingertips, which will be achieved through rigorous practice. If at all you get stuck, just flip through your notes/books while you can (obviously you won't be allowed to peek into your book during your examination!). Be confident and overcome your fear - that's the key. Good luck! ",
