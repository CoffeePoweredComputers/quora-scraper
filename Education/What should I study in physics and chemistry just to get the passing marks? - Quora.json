            "answer_text": "It's a common question among students in science stream , that in some certain subjects they have some issues or problems and in some of them they have confidence. If it has also happened to you , well don't fear. I also got through this problem. I had confidence in Biology and Chemistry , and didn't love to study Physics or Mathematics. So I'll suggest you what I did in that situation. To get the passing marks , first take an overview from every chapter of Physics or math. Then go through the Theory part (in your copybook) with attention (Remember you have to get passing marks , not to be fail) . Just read on and try to write them down in an exercise book (in case of Physics) without seeing the copy. Now you just take a look to the most common questions coming in previous years from that chapter. And you're done !! Now for maths , You also just practice some easy problems from those chapters (in those particularly you have problem . eg -> Calculus \ud83d\ude02). Now you just get through the problems which have already come in previous years , from some Reference books. You can consult your Teacher for that . You'll understand the pattern of the questions and will easily be able to get the passing marks. Hope my suggestion helps. Please do upvote if you like this answer. Thank You \ud83d\ude4f ",

            "answer_text": "You do not say at what level and in which country you are writing from. In the UK GCSE and \u201cA\u201d level exams may be delayed in 2021 because of Covid 19. Last year exams were cancelled. Who knows where the country will be in 2021 on the pandemic? To get pass mark in GCSE you need to obtain grade 4 or 5. Grades 3, 2 and 1 would be fail. That you are asking about Physics and Chemistry as separate subjects means you are not being entered for the thinner GCSE general science. Physics and Chemistry is denser as a result for which real study is necessary. If you are working from a plan agreed with your school you should get the necessary practice. You tube has many tutorials which are very good at explaining concepts. If you feel you need more help, you might want to consider private tuition to get more practice. This way you would know the areas for which you have mastery and want to be ready for in the exam. I made index cards with succinct notes as a memory aid. This way I had a minimal level of subject knowledge under my belt about which I was confident. Doing all these things means you will gain the most from your educational experience and done your best. You might surprise yourself as I did when I took my physics and chemistry. I paced myself not do much more than obtain a pass. I got my best grades in physics and chemistry! ",

            "answer_text": "First stop wasting time on quora and start studying. For chemistry every chapter is important(there are only 4 chapters you can atleast do those). For physics do light,magnetism and electricity all these are very important. Do bio thoroughly if you wanna pass by just studying limited topics as cbse has changed paper patterns making in depth understanding important so paper is really unpredictable ",
