            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been 40 years since I went through the process, but I don\u2019t think it has fundamentally changed in that time. Other folks here have given good answers, so I won\u2019t repeat what they\u2019ve said. I do have a couple of things I\u2019d like to emphasize, however. In order to be considered for appointment, one has to have a nomination. Congressmen and the Vice President all have a limited number of slots available at any given time. In order to get a nomination through one of these sources, you essentially have to convince the person that you deserve to have one of their slots. Politics can play, though I was aware of only one classmate that appeared to get his nomination through pure political connections. I was fortunate enough to be the son of a retired Air Force officer who owned a small newspaper in the district of one of the most powerful men on Capitol Hill at that time. And I single-mindedly pursued that appointment from elementary school. If you can\u2019t make that work, and you are the child of a retired military member, you have an automatic Presidential nomination. One of my classmates was the son of the legendary USAAF/USAF ace, Gabby Gabreski. There are a number of other categories, including children of deceased, missing, and disabled veterans, Medal of Honor winners (that\u2019s essentially an automatic appointment if you can pass the entrance requirements), and their are nominations available for Air Force enlisted personnel and ROTC students. One other avenue that isn\u2019t talked about a lot is a sports \u201cscholarship.\u201d If you are particularly good at a sport, the Academy will go to great lengths to recruit you and get you in. I don\u2019t know exactly how far that extends (I wasn\u2019t an athletic recruit), but the Academy has some highly successful sports teams, and that\u2019s no accident. One last point. I didn\u2019t have perfect grades, I wasn\u2019t the best athlete, and I went to a very small high school. As it happens, admissions emphasis changes from year to year. My year, they emphasized extracurriculars. The next year, the pendulum swung in favor of academics. I also had a hard time finding anyone else among my classmates who had planned to go to the Academy years in advance - some hadn\u2019t considered it until a few bare months before entrance. So if you feel like you\u2019re a little late in the process, don\u2019t despair. I didn\u2019t make it on my first try, and did a year in college and ROTC before I got my appointment. Personally, I\u2019d say persistence and focus are great assets. ",

            "answer_text": "Without knowing where you are in life (high school, college, enlisted, etc), it\u2019s difficult to give you an answer specific to your situation. This is a generic checklist of things you can do assuming you\u2019re coming straight from highs school. I can\u2019t speak to the other entry paths. Start taking steps freshman year of high school. Make your goals known and get yourself on the radar of influential people. You\u2019ll need these people to write you letters of recommendation when the time comes.Develop relationships with local politicians. If you do things right, this will just happen naturally. Again, you\u2019ll want letters of recommendation from these people when the time comes.Find a grad or an LO to mentor you through the process. This will not be fun. Asking people for help when they get nothing in return is a hard sell. Do it anyway. You need someone to keep you on path over the years.Your highest priority is to get your grades as close to a 4.0 as possible. Bs should be considered unacceptable. A perfect 4.0 might be unattainable but it doesn\u2019t matter. Make it your goal anyway. You\u2019re going to be competing against people that get As in their sleep so you might as well get into the habit of high academic performance. You\u2019ll need these habits if you get an appointment.Play a sport. Doesn\u2019t matter if you make varsity or not. The point is to increase your physical fitness. You\u2019ll have to play some sort of sport out there anyway so, again, it\u2019s good to get into the habit now.Do something that demonstrates you have leadership potential. Join a military youth leadership organization. JROTC, CAP, Young Marines, Sea Cadets. Branch doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t have access to these organizations, you have options. Boy Scouts are usually everywhere. There are also civic youth organizations. School clubs are also useful along with student government. Make sure you rise in these organizations. By the time you apply, you want to be able to show that you\u2019ve already lead people.STUDY FOR THE ACT/SAT. Most of the sections will depend on your upbringing and quality of your school district (exposure to English, literature, and science), but the math section is straight up memorization. You just have to practice. Start taking the standardized test junior year. You can take them more than once. Speaking of junior year\u2026.Junior year is when you really need to step it up. During that year, you\u2019ll want to apply for Summer Seminar. This is another \u201cget on the radar\u201d step.This is a bonus step and not everybody can or even needs to do it. But if you are interested in flying, start taking flying lessons and try to at least solo before graduation if not fully gain your pilots license.If you join Scouts or CAP, make sure you make Spaatz or Eagle Scout by December of your senior year.When senior year finally rolls around, start the process as soon as you can. The application process is long. It takes months and has numerous steps that have to be coordinated over long distances and you\u2019re one file in 10,000. Once you do, stay on top of things. I don\u2019t care how good the tech is now. This is the military. There is an almost 100% chance you\u2019ll fall through the cracks on something.Finally, as a general rule, no matter what you do, be awesome. Sounds cheesy but, if you land an appointment, you\u2019ll be going to school with literally the best this country has to offer. You\u2019re going to need to stick out from the crowd in some manner.",

In fact be a leader, be in the top 10% of your class in every field. 4-Athletic ability. Get on a team. Be in really good shape. If you can\u2019t pass the PE requirements, you won't get in. Work out every day. How fit? can you run 3 miles in 12 minutes? 5-This is VERY Important: Find out who your congressman/woman is. Volunteer to work in their district office. Then when you are ready to apply, you can ask for a letter of recommendation. Better that you are not a stranger, that way you will get a good letter that will be more personal than a form letter. Extra credit: show some desire, focus and dedication; see if you can join the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Corps or if available at your school, JAFROTC. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a USAFA graduate, class of 1984. Many of these pieces of advice are correct but some are not. Yes you must be well qualified as an applicant, that's first and foremost. But the involvement of the congressman or senator isn't a letter of recommendation, it's actually an appointment to the academy. While they do have the power to simply appoint anyone of the proper age, almost all the politicians make a list of 10 or more applicants and let the academies themselves rank them and make the final choices. I didn't know anyone who \"got in good\" with their representative to garner one of these appointments. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's not the norm at all. Focus on being the best candidate, the political angle will solve itself. I think playing politics isn't worth the time. You will have to pass a physical fitness test to get in, but it's pretty easy. Later you'll have much harder tests to pass as a cadet/midshipman. If you're serious about USAFA I'd be glad to answer further questions. Scott Hypocrophobe@gmail.com Surgery@usa.net ",
