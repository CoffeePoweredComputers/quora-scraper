            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to paraphrase a quote from one of the great contemporary philosophers of our time: Oh look, ANUTHA ONE. This is quite a commonly asked question so I\u2019ll just get right into it. Simply put, you can\u2019t compare them if you\u2019re asking \u201cWhich is harder\u201d. Why? Well because they\u2019re two very different curriculum that aim to develop very different students at the end of the 2 years. I personally did IB and I can tell you that QUANTITATIVELY, IB has more work. I mean on top of having 6 subjects to study for, you\u2019ve got coursework for each of those subjects. Tell you what, here\u2019s a link to a similar question that I took a part in answering. You\u2019ll find some detail in there too: Is doing IB as hard as A levels? IB has the 4000 word EE, CAS, Theory of Knowledge and it\u2019s associated workload and much, much more that would turn this answer into a damn novel. Does that necessarily make it harder than A levels? I mean if you\u2019re excellent at time management and balancing your life with work then probably not. However, most IB students aren\u2019t like that and immediately go for an elitist attitude towards other curriculums. Some don\u2019t but believe me there\u2019s a lot of students who would put themselves above AP and A levels students purely because IB has more work. Is that work hard? Again, this depends on who you\u2019re asking. The argument of \u201cA levels vs. AP vs. IB\u201d will always exist because you\u2019ll rarely run into somebody who has done all 3 and can attest to which is harder. Until you run into someone that\u2019s done all three, it\u2019ll be hard to justify which is more difficult. NOW. A levels focuses more on developing students to \u2018specialize\u2019 in a certain field of study. It\u2019s rigorous in it\u2019s own right in that it will prepare students ONLY for the study, career, or university major that they have chosen. IB on the other hand focuses on creating a \u2018rounded\u2019 student that is equipped with a variety of fundamental skills that are useful at university. Skills like good essay writing with citations, critical thinking, and an ability to take the initiative in any scenario, whether voluntary or academically. So that being said, it\u2019s up to what you prefer. If you ask me, I\u2019d say both are difficult regardless of workload. An IB student will always know what it was like to be an IB student and will have gotten used to the deadlines and coursework. They\u2019ll never know the A level type stress. Similarly, an A level student will only know what it\u2019s like to stress about perfecting their work or study in a narrow range of subjects. They\u2019ll never know the IB stress of having 6 subjects with different types of coursework. They are also seen as equal in the eyes of university admissions officers. So why would you pick one over the other? That\u2019s up to what you want to do in life. Do you know what you want to do at university or seek to excel at only a few subjects? Then A levels is for you. Do you just want to get into university for a course you\u2019ve chosen without any other work? Then A levels will your besties for the nest two years. If it\u2019s developing yourself as a student and learning some useful life skills as well as developing yourself as a rounded student in 6 subjects then IB is for you. If you know you\u2019ll probably be moving country and need a curriculum that will allow you to pick up where you left off no matter where you go, then IB is for you. BUT I DIGRESS. You see that\u2019s what happens when you ask which is harder. You can\u2019t really justify. IB students will say IB and A level students will say A levels. Anyway sorry I dragged that out for so long. Just trying to give you perspective. Look, nothing comes easy in life. Education is a learning curve no matter which curriculum you choose. There will be challenges in both curriculums and university isn\u2019t a walk in the park either. So before I shut my yap because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re bored to tears reading already, I\u2019ll just say this: They are both hard. You\u2019ll learn tons no matter which one you pick and you\u2019ll get your pick at a huge variety of universities no matter which one you do. Aight hope that answers your question. Good luck if you\u2019re deciding on a curriculum and remember. You won\u2019t go wrong with either one. ",

            "answer_text": "No, certainty not. Anyone who tells you that doing an A level is harder than an IB subject is wrong. The process of A levels is simpler and less stressful and it is very unlikely you will do 6 A levels. The IB Diploma requires a lot more of you psychologically, and while the content is less for some subjects, the preparation for university is the same. You will likely not struggle with A levels if you enjoy your subjects and work hard to deadlines while the IBD requires you to take subjects you may not like, complete activities you won\u2019t enjoy and spend unreasonable amounts of time on things that don\u2019t matter. You\u2019re well prepared for university but it\u2019s a lot more straining and not helpful if you\u2019re doing an apprenticeship ",
