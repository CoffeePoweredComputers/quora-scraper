            "answer_text": "The 7 I mention aren't the full list. But I recognize them as characteristic for every highly organized person I've ever met. 1. Stop and Think. You may have even the most brilliant system to manage your stuff and tasks, but it will fail without this first step. Part of the Getting Things Done system- the most hardcore (and effective!) system to organize one's time - are time slots dedicated to reflection. There are weekly reviews, one-year reflection, and so on. Often, you need to understand why you want to be organized to be truly organized. Otherwise, you can have everything folded neatly, but you fail to accomplish your objectives. You climb the ladder only to discover at the top that it is leaned to the wrong wall. 2. Plan. Planning a complex task saves about 20% of the time needed to finish the task. If you want to write a book, it can take you 10 months or eight months - assuming you will plan for it. 3. Write It Down. OK, there are some prodigies who can be organized without writing things down. My wife is one of them. She juggles everything in her head. But usually there are some boundaries. You can be highly organized in one area because it's easy for you to keep things in your head. Or you can do the juggling act assuming there are only so many items to juggle. Add one more layer of complexity and your whole organization falls like a house of cards. 4. Break It Down. Practically every single task can be further broken down. Atomizing a task or project into smaller parts keeps you away from being overwhelmed. Part of the GTD system is identifying the next task/item you need to perform/deal with to move the project forward. 5. Have a System. Usually, all the above four habits are somehow integrated into the organizing system. It's not enough to do those things regularly. You need to do them in some coherent order.  (my \u2018system\u2019; can you guess I\u2019m not highly organized?)) Otherwise you are left alone with bits and pieces. I know; that's why I'm not highly organized. 6. Follow the System. Having a system is not enough. You need actually to commit to it. It's great to know that you need to identify the next step right after you finish the current step, but if you don't do it this knowledge is impotent. 7. Keep Yourself Accountable. Stop and Think serves that purpose to some degree. But you can hire someone to keep you accountable or delegate this activity. My wife acts as my calendar manager. I communicate to her all my calls and appointments and she reminds me about them. Without her, I wrote those items down and then forgot to check my calendar. Go figure.  The above habits are for super-organized people. If you aren't one, don't try to embrace them all at once. I encourage you to start in the order of appearance. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Using the 2-Minute Rule. Overcome procrastination and laziness by making it so easy to start taking action that you can\u2019t say no. If it takes less than two minutes, then do it now. 2. Achieving Inbox Zero. It is a rigorous approach to email management aimed at keeping the inbox empty, or almost empty, at all times. Don't leave the email client open.Process email periodically throughout the day, perhaps at the top of each hour.First delete or archive as many new messages as possible.Then forward what can be best answered by someone else.Immediately respond to any new messages that can be answered in two minutes or less.Move new messages that require more than two minutes to answer, and messages that can be answered later, to a separate \"requires response\" folder.Set aside time each day to respond to email in the \"requires response\" folder or chip away at mail in this folder throughout the day.3. Making Lists. Oh, I don\u2019t have time for it. This is one of the most common excuses I hear people say to me when I ask them why they don\u2019t exercise, why they don\u2019t write, or why they don\u2019t build a business. But the fact is, you have time, I have time, and Barack Obama has time. We all have time. And just to remind you, we all have 24 hours a day no matter where you live, how much money you make, or how successful you are. You have the same amount of time as everyone else. 4. Prioritizing. So how come some people excel and some don\u2019t? The secret: you must make peace with the fact that you can\u2019t have it all. You either master one thing, or you become mediocre at many things. You can\u2019t have both. \u201cYou must make peace with the fact that you can\u2019t have it all.\u201d When it comes to prioritizing, one of the most effective methods is making lists, especially hand-written lists because they make your brain believe that these are the only things you need to focus on. Once you start working on something, you will be bombarded with distracting thoughts and excuses. Don\u2019t panic. Instead, write these ideas and distractions down to your \u201clater\u201d list. This little trick makes your brain think about it as a completed task making you stop thinking about it and focusing on your work. 5. Saying No. No \u201cyes.\u201d Either \u201cHELL YEAH!\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d 6. Meditating. I\u2019ve been meditating inconsistently for over a year now. Inconsistently means I\u2019d meditate 5 times in some weeks and only once or twice in some. However, after spending 10 days in silence in the mountains of Northern Thailand, I started meditating at least 5 times a week for at least 15 minutes. It really helps me to calm down, accept the things happening in my life, get in peace with the present moment, become more grateful, and relaxed. According to a new research from the Shamatha Project at the University of California, Davis, mindfulness and meditation help lower the levels of the stress hormone, cortisol. I\u2019ve been an active mindfulness advocate for the last year and I suggest that if you haven\u2019t tried meditation yet, do it and try it for at least 3 days and observe how you feel. I recommend starting with Headspace or Calm app and spend at least 10 minutes a day focusing on your breath and relaxing. The world is buzzing with many things are happening all around you. This busy-ness makes you unaware of the world around you. The sadder thing, however, is we become unaware of our inner self, too. Do you know that humans can think of 60,000 stories and feel 300,000 emotions every day? How many of them are you aware of? 7. Defining the most important task (MIT) of the day. Most of the time, I\u2019d just write a to-do list of some random tasks I want to do during that day and my over optimistic to-do list would go unfinished every day. Now, I focus on one major task, the most important task (MIT) of the day that will help me achieve my vision and contribute the most to the future I want to build. I wrote a piece on Forbes about decision fatigue and its consequences which are all about making a limited amount of decisions every day and consuming a certain amount of willpower for each and every decision. Defining and focusing on my most important task helps me get the most vital task done and move closer to my main goal. If I still have energy left for other tasks, I\u2019d work on the secondary and tertiary importance level tasks to run errands, ensure the cash flow, and work on improvements for my business and life. 8. Batching. It\u2019s simply a form of time management that allows a person to maximize concentration and decrease distraction. As a result, it increases your productivity, creativity, and mental sharpness, while decreasing fatigue, procrastination, and stress. Batch processing is the grouping of similar tasks that require similar resources in order to streamline their completion. 9. Achieving To Do List Zero. Just like Inbox Zero, you try to get to zero by delegating, removing and completing tasks in your to do list. 10. Setting Reminders. People forget quickly even if it\u2019s extremely important. I set reminders for myself when to stand up and take a walking break when to go to bed when to follow up on an email when to call a bank when to cancel the free trial software and so on. ",
