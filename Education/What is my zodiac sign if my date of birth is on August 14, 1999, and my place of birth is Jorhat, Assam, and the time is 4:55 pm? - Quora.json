            "answer_text": "According to Western tropical astrology, your Sun sign\u2014what many call your \u201czodiac\u201d sign\u2014is at 21 Leo 15. Your Moon is at 28 Virgo 56 in the 8th house, and your Ascendant (lagna) is at 5 Aquarius 38. The Ascendant is the first impression you give others when they meet you. But what strikes me most of all is your Mars in Scorpio at the apex of the chart, conjunct (considered within reasonable orb of 0\u00b0) the Midheaven. Mars is the traditional ruler of Scorpio, and Pluto is the modern ruler of Scorpio.  Your chart shows a Western 3rd quadrant above-the-horizon dominance which tells me you want to know how people think and/or feel about decisions you might want to make, and you take their opinions seriously. You tend to be willing to show how you feel about events as you become aware of them, and you value your long-term relationships. While you have that need for others in your life, others would be wise to understand that you need breathing room so you can explore the world as you need to You have what\u2019s called a fixed angular Grand Cross: Your 7th house Sun opposes your first house Uranus and both are on your Nodes (Sun at the North Node, or Rahu, as you might know it, and Uranus sits at the South Node, Ketu.). This opposition squares that placement of Mars at the Midheaven which opposes Saturn in the 4th house. You also have a perfected (0\u00b000\u2032) opposition between Mercury at its conjunction to the 7th house cusp from inside the 6th, and Neptune conjunct the Ascendant from inside the 12th. This opposition also forms a T-square to Jupiter in the 3rd house of communications and day-to-day events. It seems to me you tend to have a pretty full load of responsibilities in your life. I would expect you have an enormous amount of compassion and truly like to help others but you value the time as well to expand your knowledge in areas where you have some serious interest. (I\u2019d be inclined to say astrology is in that list of interests.) Try to balance your life with enough \u201cme\u201d time to allow yourself the privilege of avoiding burn out. Without that kind of release valve, you could act impulsively and get in deeper than you\u2019d like, which can result in accidents or inadvertent arguments from the things you really might not have intended to say. Hope that helps. ",
