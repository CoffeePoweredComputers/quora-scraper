            "answer_text": "I'm exactly the same. I think it simply comes down to taking advantage of whatever time you feel most focused. I watch the TV at the end of my bed from 6 am after I first awaken and its several minutes before I can even understand the news captions running along the bottom of the screen so I dont bother trying. By 10am I'm fairly coherent but I wouldn't describe myself a being sharp as a tack until around 8 pm in the evening when I can produce my best work. I dont see how responding to your own inner clock can be bad for you although I have found I was going to bed later and later at night and I had to correct that. I don't think that behavior is good for anyone. ",
