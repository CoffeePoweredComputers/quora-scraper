            "answer_text": "Well to be brutally honest, if you have not studied at all, these four hours can do nothing. Just trying to read through previous years papers/ important questions and answers will be a gate-pass to a fool's paradise. But yes, if you have studied decently enough since quite a few months, if not the whole year, these four hours can be of good use. Utilize two hours in reading rapidly through all the study material that you have already done pretty well , just mentally underscoring the main points-- like the reactions/ formulae /theorems, going through the solved examples etc. spend 1 hour in reading the summary of the chapter. And the last one hour in not reading anything but swirling whatever is already there in the brain, reflecting upon it and calming yourself. Remember NOT to read/ cram  till the last moment. Because then the brain always works on 'LIFO --Last in, first out' principle which many students call as 'going blank'. All the best! ",

Also go through questions in the book itself for each chapter. Scan through all the chapters starting from very important chapters that can carry questions in exam. Next time study through out study year, all chapters and be prepared with taking some mock exams yourself. ",
