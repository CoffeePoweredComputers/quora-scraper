            "answer_text": "It seems like someone asks a question like this every day on Quora. But this is the first time I have received an A2A about it, so I\u2019ll bite. First, you have to ask yourself a very tough question: Is your teacher not teaching you, or are you not learning? This question is usually phrased implying the former. I highly doubt there is some epidemic of teachers who literally refuse to teach their classes. Let me illustrate a few potential scenarios and my recommendation for how to approach them: If your teacher is actually refusing to give any sort of instruction and sits at his or her desk staring at the class with a vacant expression then you should first check for a pulse. After you have determined that your teacher is alive, you should definitely make a recording of this. If your teacher is literally not doing any teaching and staring blankly into space, there shouldn\u2019t be anything stopping you from making a recording. Then you should show it to every possible authority figure at the school. I have to warn you that this is a very unlikely scenario. What is much more likely is the following: Your teacher is providing many forms of instruction to your class. You are struggling to learn in this situation. The reasons you are struggling most likely come down to one of two possibilities: Your teacher is instructing in a method or style that is unfamiliar to you and you are having difficulty following the format of the lesson.The topic is more challenging than you expected.This could either be because:it\u2019s one of your first times being academically challenged, oryou could have a long history of being academically challenged.In either of these situations, the first thing you should do is reformat the problem in your mind. Instead of asking us How should you deal with a teacher who isn\u2019t teaching you anything? You should ask yourself How can I learn something that is challenging and new to me? Or How can I study best in a class that operates differently than I am used to? Or How can I get on track academically after having fallen behind a while back? Each of these questions could have their own answers and there are some intricacies to each of them. But first, you should focus on the difference between your actual question and the example questions I posed. Your question absolves you (the student) of any resposibility to take charge of your own learning and places blame upon your teacher. The questions I posed place you in charge of your own learning and suggests that there is a solution to your difficulties. The most important thing you can do is think about the situation differently. Stop blaming your teacher for your struggles unless your teacher literally is providing no instruction. I suspect you know what you could do in a situation where your teacher actually refused to provide any sort of instruction. What you are really struggling with is something about your ability to learn; not your teacher\u2019s ability to teach. The good news is that there are probably many things you can do to learn more in this scenario if you have the right perspective. The first step is placing yourself at the center of your own learning and not your teacher. Next, treat your teacher as a partner in your journey rather than your adversary. If you ask your teacher for help, in and tell your teacher that you want to work harder and achieve more in your class, I think your teacher will want to help you. But you will probably have to do some more work in this situation. You may have to relearn some things you didn\u2019t learn properly or completely earlier in school that you need to know now. You may have to study more at home. You may need to get help during break or lunch. You may need to see a tutor. You may need to just practice more on this subject. You may need to work with a classmate. You may need to transfer into a different class that is more elementary. But I recommend looking to your teacher for guidance first rather than asking about how to deal with your teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you mean by \u201cwho don\u2019t teach ?\u201d If you meant \u201chow do I handle a teacher who just sits silently in class and doesn\u2019t explain something or deliver a lesson to his/her students?\u201d Then my answer would be :You should report this issue to principal as soon as possible. Or an alternative way would be to make the teacher aware that he/she gives nothing to his/her students. However, this takes a courage to do so. Another way to interpret your statement \u201cwho doesn\u2019t teach ?\u201d is by picturing a situation when a teacher just keeps focusing on his/her explanation rather than engaging students into the topic. Explaining a subject is a part of teaching process but student engagement is also essential and indispensable as a part of teaching. Students engagement can be in any forms : to excite students with an interesting topic, to engage students to discuss more by presenting an interesting topic, or to create a group/pair work that necessitates students to being actively participated in the lesson. If your definition of \u201cdoesn\u2019t teach\u201d is similar to the issue ascribed in my second point, then the solutions would probably be : Keep focusing on his/her lesson while taking notes on some important points.Distract your focus from your teacher\u2019s boring style of teaching to pondering on the significance of the subject ( e.g. I think the lesson about algebra is important because I can enhance my problem-solving skill as well as aiding me in understanding the next math lesson even though I am aware of my teacher who just keeps talking non-stop)3. Tell to teachers directly that his/her teaching style is tedious for your friends and you. However, doing this may cause harms to you if the teacher can\u2019t accept criticism from students. When I was in 1st year of high school, my civic teacher taught me in tedious way,in a way that he just focused on explaining the subject while writing down what he was saying. One of my female friend bravely condemned his teaching style amd we were shocked for a moment for my friend\u2019s bravery criticising our teacher\u2019s teaching style. Fortunately the teacher was willing to accept the criticism and he refrained from using his old method for the next class meetings. Hope my explanation helps. ",

            "answer_text": "It would be important to have some context for this question. What is the age group of the students? What does the asker mean by \u201cnot teach?\u201d Is the teacher sitting doing nothing? Is the teacher setting up assignments and then releasing students to get to work? Is the teacher having students explore topics that he/she announced but did not teach? The reason I say context matters is as an school administrator, I find there is a big difference between types of learning activities for different age groups and different topics. If the teacher is sitting and doing nothing each day and refuses to engage students beyond maybe telling them to read chapters or complete worksheets\u2014I would agree that the teacher is \u201cnot teaching.\u201d I believe Saleem gives good advice if the teacher truly is \u201cnot teaching.\u201d However, I would advise the question-asker to consider whether his/her definition of teaching might be the issue. If the teacher is designing learning experiences where the student examines an idea alone or in groups and then presents their ideas to the class\u2014that would be teaching (even though it might seem like the students are doing all of the work). The teacher\u2019s work, in this type of learning environment, is the planning of the learning activity, the asking of questions that help students to uncover their misconceptions, and the prodding of student thinking. In this case, I would advise the question-asker to give the learning time, notice what you might be learning through your engagement with the activity, and take note of whether you actually know more at the end than you did in the beginning.

            "answer_text": "A2A It is not a student\u2019s job to \u201chandle\u201d a teacher for anything. I ran to the office about a high school teacher for a required subject that made no sense many times as a student. A family friend who also worked at the school caught me in the hall and told me to stop being stupid. He told me in no uncertain terms that if the school administration had to choose between me and her, they would choose her. I got some concessions for myself and several other students, but I risked being kicked out of school First, you study the textbook and any other materials as if you are teaching yourself. Get a group together outside school to study if you all need to help each other. Second, keep giving your parents very specific facts about what is and isn\u2019t happening in class. If the teacher is indeed failing to do what the school has assigned them to do, (See some of the other answers about schools under philosophies that say the teacher has to provide you the opportunity to learn then sit back and let you do it for strange things happening some places that would not make the teacher in trouble.) your parents deal with it. They should start with school administration and work their way up the ladder if the situation is bad from an adult perspective and nothing is done. And, it should not matter, but if anybody in the class has a parent who sees the school superintendent at Rotary meetings, that may be the person who will get results. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a big, interesting topic. The current fad (close to being the current dogma) is that teachers should not teach. In many situations they are forbidden to teach. That\u2019s when a fad (a dubious, counterproductive gimmick) has been taken too far. Constructivism says that teachers must be facilitators; they must be guides at the students\u2019 sides. For example, if the question is what\u2019s 2+3, I can tell you it\u2019s five. But this would not be acceptable in our public schools. I have cheated. I have given you inauthentic knowledge. The only knowledge that\u2019s real is the knowledge you find for yourself. As a theoretical matter, I'd say, sure there must be instances like that if you\u2019ve got a couple extra days. But look how long it took me to tell you the answer. Seconds. Now, if you want to reinvent arithmetic, you can figure out the answer for yourself, no matter how many extra hours it takes. The problem is that Constructivism is not practical in any subject with many pieces of information. I've written a lot of articles condemning Constructivism, for example, The Con in Constructivism I\u2019ve recently read things by teachers that suggest to me that students are starting to think of Constructivism as a hoax; and this is suggested by your question. Students assume that the teacher knows the facts. Why hold back? Notice that the question has a sort of surly tone as if the teacher is doing something both silly and mean. Some students are starting to feel that they are the victims of a practical joke. In a way, that\u2019s true. The Education Establishment sets up something called a \"school\" but then paralyzes the central function of a school. No teaching, no way. That\u2019s why students are reaching college with seventh-grade educations. Finally, for me, the most offensive thing about Constructivism is that it\u2019s just a little ragtag bit of sophistry, which is then treated as holy writ sent down from heaven. The sophist defines how a child learns, the sequence of events, and then concludes that if the sequence doesn\u2019t occur as described, the student has accomplished nothing. Piaget based his work on two-year-olds and he wasn\u2019t talking about learning as in learning at school, he was talking about developmental sequences going on inside the child's head. But as the wise have always understood, there are many ways to skin a cat. The Constructivist says if you don\u2019t do it in just the right way, then the cat still has his skin! That is the power of sophistry. As for what to do about this annoying teacher, you might consider a polite, serious query as to why the teacher uses the method used. Sir, do you have a reason for the way you conduct the class? Is there some theory\u2026. I might be a teacher some day and I want to understand this. Then shut up, and let him talk. Or her\u2026.. He will probably explain or defend his methods. A few sentences will tell you everything and at some point he will say: \u201cYou don\u2019t think it works?\u201d And you say, I like hearing new information. Or whatever your objection is. ",

Sometimes you are put into situations that you have no control over, and just have to endure it, and ask what lesson in life is this trying to teach me?

You can have some influence with the help of parents to complain to the administration, but trust me, are you this teacher\u2019s best student? Have you mastered the instructional material, and are you in a position to judge? Go for it you think you are. Bring your parents along for support, but I don\u2019t think from my many years of experience dealing with great teachers and poor teachers and everything in between your action will be fruitful or the best use of your time. Hunker down. Do your best. Remember we are all teachers and we are all students at any given time. What is the situation trying to teach you? Sometimes it is nothing more than coping skills, tenacity, diplomacy, life is not always fair, and humility lessons. Even these lessons build character, and the next great teacher who comes your way, the next great teacher who understands and appreciates what an amazing student and person you are, take notice because now you have something to compare them to, and want take them for granted.

Each course, every level is like a rung on a ladder. If you miss a rung, or it breaks under your foot because of a bad teacher, it just makes it twice as hard to reach the next rung on the ladder. Miss a couple in a row (I can give you plenty of examples of that happening), and you\u2019re totally screwed. You\u2019ll be forced to repeat the \u201cmissing\u201d rung, and suffer the stigma of being \u201cheld back,\u201d or thrust onto the next level that you are wholly unprepared for, and then you\u2019ll get to suffer the humiliation of being behind and probably failing. Get the hell out of that class!! Call the Principal, the Superintendent and complain. Bad teachers (most likely protected by the idiotic tenure system) don\u2019t usually give a rat\u2019s ass about how bad they are, nor do they care about the harm they are inflicting on students! ",

Ask if you can work at an accelerated pace and take on more complex projects.Realize that teachers always have to cover the basics - even in advanced courses. The reason for this is that some students may be missing knowledge that will be essential in upcoming lessons/projects. Also understand that teachers must follow prescribed curricula and teach and assess information that is dictated by federal standards, state standards, local school boards, and individual school leaders. Some teachers (especially mathematics teachers) have very little flexibility in course content or in how they instruct classes.Enroll in advanced placement courses, and communicate with your teacher. Ask them to help you challenge yourself.Ask your school counseling department to evaluate you for an Individual Education Plan (IEP). These plans can help gifted students just as easily as they can help disabled/struggling students.",

Everyone encounters a less than stellar teacher at some point. Now\u2019s a good time to learn that you can overcome such an obstacle. Learning isn\u2019t just confined to the days and years that you attend school. It\u2019s a lifelong adventure. You obviously have access to the internet. Read as much as you can and teach yourself. Wouldn\u2019t you do the same if you were interested in a topic that your school didn\u2019t offer? ",

A good teacher can only help you to learn. There fore ,interact with your teacher for clearing doubts. The relation between a teacher and student is not to be limited to the four walls of the class room. Seek their help and guidance whenever you want ",
