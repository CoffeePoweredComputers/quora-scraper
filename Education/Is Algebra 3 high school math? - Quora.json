            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t even know what a high school level Algebra 3 class would entail or what the hell that is. Every high school likely offers Algebra I, which involves just learning about basic things like using variables, \u201csolving for x\u201d, doing basic word problems, solving quadratic equations, solving a system of linear equations, etc. Then to follow this course, every high school offers Algebra II, which expands upon the concepts covered in Algebra I. You\u2019ll cover factoring cubics and higher degree polynomials, complex numbers, exponent and logarithm rules, sequences and series (a light introduction here), and elementary counting problems, and other topics. Usually after this course one takes a course in Pre-Calculus to prep them for AP Calculus AB or AP Calculus BC, or they\u2019ll take a course in Euclidian Geometry/Trigonometry to prep them for a senior year math course (which might just be normal Calculus). Pre-Calculus courses seem to cover not much different material than a Geometry / Trigonometry course, but maybe end with getting into Limits or Differentiation (if you\u2019re in Pre-Calc BC). I suppose one could have a class called \u201cAlgebra III\u201d and have it teach some of the stuff above but that would seem like a misnomer. After Algebra II, one could maybe get into Linear Algebra, though this would be better studied in college in my opinion. Usually after a course in Linear Algebra, one gets into Abstract Algebra, but this is definitely not a high school course. So to conclude, my thoughts are that a course called \u201cAlgebra III\u201d likely means something other than Algebra and is a misnomer. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I\u2019m not sure how other schools are, but it was offered as at my high school to prepare students for college algebra and the math placement exam. People who took the class did poorly in Algebra 2 or absolutely crashed and burned in Trigonometry. Looking back at it, I probably should\u2019ve taken it myself, having gotten a high C in Algebra 2. Reading over the syllabi of other high schools, it seems that other high schools which offer the course have it available for similar reasons. ",
