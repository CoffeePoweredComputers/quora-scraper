            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t help loving Dhaka. I\u2019m raised in a small district of Bangladesh, Brahmanbaria. Then passed my colorful 4 year undergrad period in Chittagong. I love my home town and Chittagong too, but Dhaka is subtly a lascivious one, like Khuswant singh reckoned Delhi in his novel. Why I love Dhaka? Living a very common life here I discern \u2018The Life\u2019 more closely,lively than any other cities. Life is very fast here, everyone is struggling hard for his/her bread. (Just don\u2019t recall now the Super high class tycoon type people, they owe a ubiquitous nature, Dhaka-life matters little for them). Say, the canvasser in a local bus, he tries to convince you how effective his balm is. And you\u2019d just loose your mind by his rhetoric, attractive expression. People are cynical here too, they remain conscious always. What if they get be-fooled by their aggrandized words? Let a person buy his product, others would start to think he/she needs it too. In a minute the elixir will adorn many pockets! Canvassers, beggars, patients of incurable disease ; everyone works assiduously to make as maximum profit as possible. Think about there hope, if he can sell his product a little more, he might take his wife in the night show to see the latest local blockbuster movie. People always say bad words to Dhaka, sometimes me also. There are numerous reasons for abhorring her. Her overpopulation, suffocating traffic jam, less greenish look, dust, polluted air,water, ugly drainage system and lot lot more\u2026.. Being the center of almost everything, people lives here for their livelihood mainly. Students, job holders, newbie learners, jobless adults (It\u2019s me!) here struggle much to climb up a little higher with their baby steps. After some days, may be years, they\u2019d get settled, give birth their progeny, rear them. Time passes caring none, but the struggling-time memories merely rub off from one\u2019s mind! They are the beloved ones, lives in our heart like our unfinished love stories! ",
