            "answer_text": "We are governed by the influence of within our evolutionary development. If you cannot understand anything, it is not something to be emotional about. Humans exust in various levels of existence that their understanding is also on different levels or stages. But, it does not mean you will not learn. Learning is a process, too. If your physical and intellectual development do not jibe, it is normal in the environment you were existing. Everything has reasons, or purpose. We cannot make compariosns. It is normal to be included in an environment not equal to your learning, intellectually. But experiences in that same environment could teach you, and make you learn, step by step. It is never an impacted kind of learning. It is a alow process if we are to use our chrnological time as our reference. So, what ever influenced you to compare yourself, or to make you feel you are not learning, or what makes you learn fast, is dependent on your capacity to discern, presently. And it does not mean it will not change. Photo credit: pinterest.com  ",
