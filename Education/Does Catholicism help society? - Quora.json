            "answer_text": "A five-part response to Guzel: 1.  A quote from Peter Hoffmann's \"History of German Resistance\": \"[The  Catholic Church] could not silently accept the general  persecution,  regimentation or oppression, nor in particular the  sterilization law of  summer 1933. Over the years until the outbreak of  war Catholic  resistance stiffened until finally its most eminent  spokesman was the  Pope himself with his encyclial Mit brennender Sorge ...  of 14 March 1937, read from all German Catholic pulpits. Clemens  August  Graf von Galen, Bishop of Munster, was typical of the many  fearless  Catholic speakers. In general terms, therefore, the churches  were the  only major organizations to offer comparatively early and  open  resistance: they remained so in later years.\" 2. The Church  not only teaches refrain from artificial contraception but also  advocates NFP (Natural Family Planning) and abstinence and is committed  to providing education in the Third World that jives with Catholic  thought. An admittedly very loose parallel is a Jewish deli that would  probably refuse to serve bacon even if society said that patrons were  inevitably going to consume it and instead promote the Kosher items  already on their menu. 3. The Church sex abuse scandal is  terrible. There is no way to minimize the damage done by sinful men.  Statistically speaking, the population of priests is no more likely than  the general population to be pedophiles (Page on newsweek.com). 4.  The Catholic Church is irrefutably the single largest charitable  organization in the world and provides life saving aid to the poor and  vulnerable every day. In Matthew 19:24 Christ does in fact note the  difficulty of the rich attaining salvation with the \"eye of a needle\"  reference, but responds to the amazement of his disciples two verses  later in Mt 19:26 that \"what is impossible with man is possible for  God\". Sts. Nicodemus, Zacchaeus, Joseph of Arimathea and Mary Magdalene  were all people of means canonized by the Church as saints. 5.  There is no condemnation for inclinations, temptations or instinctive  desires, only for actions of the will committed in contrast to the moral  order. I believe you don't understand what the Church really  does beyond an atheistic manifesto spat back out from generic agnostic  apologetics. ",

            "answer_text": "The Catholic Church is the world's largest charitable organization. The World Health Organization estimates up to 70% of all health care infrastructure in Africa is faithful-based. In the US alone the Church spent 98.6 billion on health care and another 4.7 billion on other charities, in 2014. That's one year, 100 billion. Catholic Charities USA, only one charity within the US, alone, serves more than ten million people annually. According to Forbes, they came in third in the largest charities in the US, behind United Way and the Salvation Army, at $4.4 billion a year. Cardinal Dolan, archbishop of New York, is estimated to be Manhattan's largest landowner, when everything that the Catholic Church owns is added up. The Catholic Church provides and operates 18,000 clinics, 16,000 retirement homes, and over 5,500 hospitals, according to Wikipedia, totaling over a quarter of the world's health care. The Catholic Church has also been leading the way in new fertility research, finding safer alternatives to medicines that induce miscarriages and infertility. 7 of the US's top 25 pre-law programs are at Catholic universities. 25 of the top 100 universities in the US are Catholic.
