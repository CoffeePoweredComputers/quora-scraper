            "answer_text": "Right\u2026 so here's the deal. When students complain that \u201cI'll never need to apply this\u201d in math class, guess what: they probably aren't saying that because they've completely evaluated their lives at age 10 in order to know which skills they need to learn for their Life Plan and which ones they don't, and concluded that Mathematics is entirely in the \u201cdon't need\u201d bucket. No. Kids have absolutely no idea what will be applicable to them in life, directly or indirectly. There is no way that they could know that. I'm 35 and I still don't really know what information might be most relevant to when I walk into work tomorrow as a software engineer. What I do know is that I'll be excited to learn it, the moment I figure out what it is. Let's apply Occam's razor here. Do you think most kids are omniscient about the future and know exactly which skills they will need to learn? Or is that most kids are whiny and lazy, would prefer to be hanging out with friends instead of learning math, and will come up with any excuse they can to rationalize their laziness? As a former teacher, let me give you a protip: trying to teach kids HOW TO FILE FREAKING TAXES is not going to suddenly solve the problem of kids being bored, lazy, and apathetic about learning. ",

            "answer_text": "Simple tax returns, like the ones a young person may have to fill, do not require more than reading and following instructions. For a high school student who works, doing that can be very rewarding. The money that was withheld for taxes from the student\u2019s part-time work, will probably be fully refunded, so it pays to file your own taxes. The instructions are written so that you will be able to do the calculations. It is simple arithmetic. Why you are doing what the instructions say (for example multiplying by a factor given in the instructions), and what it all means is not explained, but if you understand math, you may figure it out. Maybe you can teach yourself, from the instructions in the IRS website for the federal taxes, and from state and local government sites for the state and local income tax returns (if you need to file those where you live or work). Financial terms and strategies are another story. While a student who works but is a dependent may have a simple income tax return, some people's taxes get complicated as they get older. You may get to deduct certain expenses. Some income may be excluded from taxation. Social security benefits is an example. Some income may be taxed at a preferred rate. That is the case with capital gains. Having dependents, or being married result in different tax dues. Your level of income affects the tax rates. With preferential treatment for certain kinds of situations, the number of pages to fill with calculations increases. ",
