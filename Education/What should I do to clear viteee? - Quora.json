Time Management: VITEEE is not about solving all questions, but it is about solving decent number of questions in a given time frame.

            "answer_text": "To clear the VIT examination u should go through the previous year questions of different-different private examinations like Bits,vit itself.For vit you have to clear about theory and some different topics are also there in vit examination  then the other exams.At the  same time there also some topics are not in vit examination syllabus as compare to mains or other exams syllabus.So my advise is that u first go through the syllabus then do your theory part best and then focus on conceptual questions.
