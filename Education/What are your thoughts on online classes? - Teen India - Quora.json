            "answer_text": "Honestly, I don\u2019t enjoy online classes but since there is no other alternative, I have gotten used to them. The amount of actual learning is way less compared to the time we spend. Either the teacher or the student faces connectivity issues or problems with the audio and mic. People keep interrupting each other, others conveniently forget to mute; giving us the privilege of listening to their parents screaming at them, heavy machinery, requests for extra cheese on sandwiches and rap songs. Most of the teachers aren\u2019t used to teaching online, and I appreciate that they\u2019re making so many extra efforts in this regard. However, the pace of learning is either too slow or too fast. Most of the times the teacher gets carried away in answering doubts and there isn\u2019t a continuous flow of learning. And of course, it\u2019s easy to get distracted and do something totally unrelated to academics. I usually end up watching videos on YouTube or try (and fail) to complete my never-ending math homework. In my opinion, the worst part of online classes aren\u2019t the classes themselves, but the ridiculous workload. Seems like the school management thinks we\u2019re all enjoying a vacation here. I barely get time to study or do anything apart from completing assignments and the competitions I was forced to sign up for. Looks like the school is trying to make up for a lack of learning by piling up homework, which is incredibly frustrating since we have so many other things to do. Now I\u2019m not a huge fan of school, but things were much easier when we had regular classes. However it\u2019s obviously the worst time to reopen schools\u2026I just wish we got a break from online classes ! ",

            "answer_text": "Ah online classes, most probably the bane of my existence. I am most probably a really talkative person and sitting in classroom on mute not being able to talk much is definitely not an easy task for me. I have a really short attention span and my mind keeps diverting every now and then so it's hard for me to focus when I am one button away from browsing the internet and since my phone is always with me I'm always texting someone or doing something else. Also can we talk about the major problem with online classes- technical difficulties? How on earth can you pay attention in math and learn how to divide polynomials when your teacher's voice keeps breaking every second? And this one time, my biology teacher wasted 35 minutes of a class just because she didn't know how to share a screen. But I do think online classes are kinda effective. Teachers don't spend a nice number of time in settling down the class and cover the portions much faster. PS: there is a possibility I am writing this answer during my math class ",

            "answer_text": "A2A, I love u too lolz  Today after my lunch, I thought I would make an excuse (to mom) that I have extra classes, plug in earphones and chill cos I had less homework. I opened digital portal (in case my mom enters so I switch the screen) just to realize that I REALLY HAVE EXTRA CLASSES TODAY  {rant alert, skip to pros and cons if you\u2019re willing to skip this noice story} I threw my ass of the chair and almost broke my earphones (I am an epic gamer, if u kno wot i mean). In real time classes in Allen the classes last for 2 hours out of which 60\u201380 minutes are wasted in copying down notes and solving questions. The online class duration started with 1 hour and slowly evolved. Today we experience classes with duration of more than an 2 hours. That means they are teaching at 2x speed. In the middle, we have to pause the video and copy notes and solve questions so it takes over 3.5 hours for an average kid to complete a class. And then there\u2019s another class waiting for you (2 classes per day). Our teachers told to watch and learn through the classes spending one whole day and the next day solve it\u2019s questions (we have classes only on mon, wed and fri). But then when the hell will we revise previous topics?! And its a big trouble in life of a JEE aspirant. Plus now you have started to put extra classes! We are not bots b!tch! Itni kitni jaldi hain syllabus khatam karne ki bc!! If we go on this speed it gets over till Independence day duhhh (irony).  Pros: I can rewind the video and deeply understand concepts, I feel I am learning better than irl classes.Tho its the only pro it is a big one.Cons: FacultyUsually it changes with topics but sometimes a teacher is really bad and boring. I even complained against one of them and got supported by my mates.When it changes and its a stranger it takes time to get adapted to them.TIME!Prolonging lectures and making them so fucking lenthy that it beats pandas.Also, this is why I ain\u2019t answering these days, and some people are unfollowing me duhhhhhhh.EnvironmentIt feels too much like home. I didn\u2019t even attend school classes. There are no discussiond with friends in middle of lectures, no race, no mockery nothing. EVeryone misses it I guess.ExamsA mere formality. While giving my school exams I cheated and completed tests in 20 minutes. I later came to know that everyone did it.Not in Allen tests cos they are smart people oof! (Plus there\u2019s no point of cheating there).I also miss cheating with friends through SOS and washroom tricks and cell phones and everything.It\u2019s like school without friends and you\u2019re forced to study. (Though organic chemistry in littt). Vs ",

I was among the favourite students of the teacher who teaches me this subject(physical chemistry) but had an argument with him before lockdown . Thus I was not comfortable with asking him.(It is not just me but many others) Now here is the fun part. If I am stuck at something I can't move on. Also I left all my books at my P.G. in Kota. Thus I spent the whole day searching the web watching YouTube videos and calling all I could refer to. Everyone started from \u201c Yes, let me explain\u201d and ended at \u201cYeah, you are right . I have the same doubt.\u201d I also texted physics H.O.D and he suggested me some vedios from you tube but the same title refers to different things in physics and chemistry. Thus the day was spoilt. I had literally watched 12 YouTube videos ,read 4 articles and called 11 people in total.Finally I decided to visit my mama's place as he was an University lecturer for the topic few years ago. I this had happened before lockdown I would have just collected the ones in my support and walked straight into the Directors room. To be mentioned that I am so sure about it as there are some confirmed mathematical errors in his derivations. ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays , online classes trends are increasing at greater speed , many companies are investigating more to get higher returns in future by conducting online classes in low prices . Due to lockdown across the globe , colleges, Universities and schools are closed , so online classes are only option for continuing studies. Now every subjects are being taught daily through this. But this trends can not replace the actual class studies , and also it is not effective . There are some demerits also :- Teachers are not trained how to use this modern technology for providing the daily online classes.Many students belong the rural areas , so they haven't reach the high speed data connections.Many students haven't smartphones to study through online.Most of the educational institutions are providing online courses just for formality because they can get the fee further.The teachers can't teach well as they haven't experience of this.But after all these demerits , everyone are trying to give their best , teachers are learning the modern technology to provide online classes, parents are now also have understood that classes can also be conducted in this way , so they are buying smartphones with high speed internet connections for this sons' and daughters' . Despite all this obstacles in this way ,I can say that in future it will become best option for studies . ",

In my opinion,online classe are not worth taking.Even the toppers don\u2019t study at that time!(i know this because i am in a topper\u2019s group coze i am kinda good in studies). There are some reasons due to which i have this opinion. Sometimes teacher gets out of class because of network issue.At times,student\u2019s connection is lost so he/she can\u2019t hear anything.The student can\u2019t enter the class on time because of connectivity issue and the teacher ultimately blocks the class.There are many irritating background noises that disturbes the whole class.I have encountered all these problems.\ud83d\ude12 After facing these problems, the teacher says\u201dYour syllabus for 1st examination is complete\u201d. The so called teacher\u2019s obsession doesn\u2019t stop here; so they take ridiculous extra classes by the name of story telling, nature\u2019s week, dance and aerobics,etc. Only a legend can listen to the teacher during these classes(atleast the extra ones). I use my laptop so it is really easy for me to switch the screen,so I usually watch memes and videos during those 2 hours!!\ud83d\ude0e(everybody should try this) Thanks for scrolling!!
