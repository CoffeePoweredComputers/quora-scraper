            "answer_text": "Wow, taking algebra 2 in eighth grade is quite impressive if I say so myself, as most students don\u2019t take it until their sophomore or junior year of high school. But none the less, I\u2019m going to give you the same advice for anybody taking a math class in general. Do the homework! Can\u2019t stress that one enough. The homework is your best and most readily available study tool. Do as many practice problems as you need to before you feel comfortable with the subject at hand, and a few extra.Make sure you understand the subject. Do your best not to just memorize how to do everything. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m great at that myself, but I do my best. But math in general up until calculus is memorization and practice anyways.If you need help, ask your teacher as soon as you get the chance. Falling behind in math is brutal, since topics are constantly building off one another. If they aren't available (shame on them), aren\u2019t willing to help (shouldn't have become a teacher in the first place), or they don't help you approach it in the way you can understand it, then use other resources such as asking a friend, getting a tutor, or checking out awesome online materials like Khan-academy (not sponsoring me, just love the website and it has helped me tons).Show up to class to make sure you don\u2019t fall behind.I know these all seem like very basic rules, but as someone in a collegiate math course, these are the rules I live by and I\u2019m understanding math better than I ever have before. Best of luck to you for your algebra 2 class. It\u2019s MUCH easier than Geometry :) ",

This cheer is the mnemonic from a teacher from TV: \u201cSine, Sine, cosine, sine, 3.14159\u2033. Find out if it's related to any of the equations. What mnemonics can you create? Get to know your calculator well before the first class. Buy or borrow the most advanced one you've allowed. Start your problem sets in front of your faculty but don't get dependent on them for solutions or to get you started. You need to do your own work on your frequent exams. Inquire just how much geometry you should know. some schools teach Algebra 2 before geometry m I took geometry thrice before Algebra 2. ",
