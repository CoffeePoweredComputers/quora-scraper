            "answer_text": " Dr. Hardial Singh Sainbhy from Jagraon, a town in District Ludhiana, Punjab (INDIA) is the most educated person on the planet Earth. Born in village Akhara, district Ludhiana, on 10th June, 1942, he has to his credit 35, yes, as many as THIRTY FIVE degrees, including 21 (YES, TWENTY-ONE) Post-graduation Degrees, a list of which is as follows - 1.\tMA (English) 2.\tMA (Punjabi) 3.\tMA (Economics) 4.\tMA (Public Administration) 5.\tMA (Philosophy) 6.\tMA (Gandhian and Peace Studies) 7.\tMA (Political Science) 8.\tMA (History) 9.\tMA (Defence and Strategy) 10.\tMA (Ancient Hstory, Culture and Archeology) 11.\tMA (Sociology) 12.\tMA (Sikh Studies) 13.\tMA (Religious Studies) 14.\tMA (Women Studies) 15.\tMA (Hindi) 16.\tMA (Journalism and Mass Communication) 17.\tPost Graduate Diploma (PGD) in Gandhian Studies 18.\tPGD in Adi Granth Acharya, 19.\tPGD in Population Education, 20.\tPGD in Mass Communication 21.\tPGD in Human Rights and Duties 22.\tLLB 23.\tDiploma in Guru Granth Studies, 24.\tDiploma of Office Organization and Procedures 25.\tDiploma in Civil Engineering 26.\tAMIE 27.\tAMISE 28.\tShiksha Visharad (Equivalent to B.Ed.) 29.\tDiploma in Medicine and Homeopathy (Gold Medalist) 30.\tRMP (Homeopathy) 31.\tRMP (Arurved) 32.\tAyurved Rattan (Equivalent to BAMS) 33.\tGyani 34.\tVidwan 35.\tJunior Management Course And, the short courses, or the other degrees/certificates earned by him, and the awards won, or the feats attained by him, during his service as a Colonel-rank officer in Military Engineering Services i.e. MES, are not part of the above list. They are separate. He has not only 21 Post-Graduate Degrees to his credit, but also 14 degrees of Graduate level. It deserves mention that to be a top-notch bureaucrat i.e. an IAS or IPS officer, one has to have only Graduate Degree, and to be eligible to get the job of an expert or Professor in a University, one has to have one PG Degree. But, to have 35 degrees in his kitty, is not a child's play, especially from a person, whose parents have been uneducated, and who has to face the ire of his parents for daring to go to the college. Having rural background, and very humble economic condition, the superhero in Dr. HS Sainbhy earned degree after degree to be first the maximum degrees holder in the district, then in the state of Punjab, then his country India, and then the World. He conquered the world of degrees by dint of his sheer diligence, consistent focus and daring attitude. He not only succeeded in adding so many educational feathers to his turban (nay cap), but also earned the livelihood by becoming a Colonel-rank officer in Military Engineering Service. He literally rose from rags to riches, and attained degrees, status and a rank. Today, he is living a happy retired life with his children and grandchildren. His daughter Dr. HK Dolly is a professor in a college, while his elder, middle and younger sons are a PCS (A) officer, a DM (Oncology) i.e. a super-specialist in the field of Cancer disease, and an Advocate respectively. Their names are HS Dimple, ETO, (also a renowned author), Dr. HS Darling, and Adv. MS Dazzling. ",

            "answer_text": "what are your educational criteria? does autodidactic count? or must it be college degrees? Statistically speaking i'm one in five million for IQ and approaching one in a hundred million or better for Education, but i haven't got any actual credentialed degrees. I read 3000 textbooks at or above the masters level between the ages of 9 and 18, depending on how you could degrees in equivalency, say we go for 100 textbooks per degree, that would be 30 of them. I have met some folks in mensa with some pretty amzing skills which really bring the point home tho, because for instance i met a girl who could speed read a textbook in under 30 seconds, and then quote it word for word back at you by page number. Fantastic power and skill, and potentially one of the most well educated people in the world.. rotely speaking.. She had zero comprehension of what she read, just phoneme streams, like a parrot. So there are some interesting bellcurves its a much more complicated issue than most people think, it really hinges on what your criteria are for \"education.\" ",
