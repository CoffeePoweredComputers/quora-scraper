I don't mean to denigrate the meaning that the concept of Abraxas has for an adherent of any Gnostic belief system or any mystery religion, but none of this has any importance in Christianity. Christianity is not a Gnostic belief system or a Mystery religion. This question would be similar to asking about the significance of Freya to Christianity. There is none. ",
