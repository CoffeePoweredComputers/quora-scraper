            "answer_text": "It depends on what you are planning to do after your 12th. If you plan to go for engineering or graduation with physics as a subject involved in it, it would be better to complete your class 12th physics syllabus before November starts. But if your focus is only on 12th boards exams, then you can stretch it to end of December. You will have plenty of time to revise it in next 2 months. ",
