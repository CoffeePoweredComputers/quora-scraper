I think you may be referring to job opportunities in particular. This depends on what you study, how you study it, how well you grade, and how much in demand the qualification and experience is and what you plan to do with your qualification. Naturally, if you study a subject that is commonplace and not in deamdn you will find it difficult to find a job. The immigration department puts out a brochure which suggests which skills and qualifications are in high demand. Other such opportunities are in sports, games, arts, talent quests, singing competitions, travel, fishing, photography, farming, hobby gardening, buy/sell. family outings, swimming, mountain climbing, skiing etc. The list is endless. Each one is an opportunity to do something new and may not be easily available in your home country. international students normally form groups and do some of these things or all of these things. In the process you make friends, go places and take memories with you. Thousands of international students come to study in New Zealand. LOst of them stay back and build new lives here. The government is supportive of them. You are allowed to work 30 hours a week to support your living and accommodation. You gain experience working in an environment which can set you up for moving overseas to another country with similar standards. You can also take your qualifications to your country where it will be in high demand. New Zealand qualifications are world renowned. In short all kinds of opportunities in anything, you want to do. Just take your pick. Thanks for asking. ",
