            "answer_text": "Dear Student Assuming that you have entered the class 12th recently, you have 1 complete year to study and appear for CBSE Boards. In this time duration, your efforts can make a difference making you score 98%. You might even score a perfect 100 in 1 or 2 subjects. So let's discuss the approach:- Maintain regularity in studies. Study for limited time, but study daily. Prepare a good time table.Focus on conceptual clarity as much as possible and revise it multiple time. Suppose you study a particular topic, let's say Demand in economics.. so the next step should be to write all the theoretical portions two to three times and revise it. Then solve questions based on it. These can be assignments given to you from tuition or past year questions from CBSE.Make three notebooks for every subject, one should be a notes copy, one should be a practice copy and one for making summaries of all chapters. Making summaries help to consolidate the chapters and revise it at the last moment.Make sure you do a lot of practice and this practice must be written, not orally.Try to finish your syllabus by October 1st week so that you get enough time to revise the entire syllabus and practice mock tests.Revision should be done from past year questions and summary notebook.Attempt as many as mock papers possible because these help to analyse the preparation and identify mistakes.After every test attempted, make sure you do the analysis and corrections.Every week, solve 1 paper each for every subject. In these papers, manage your time well and present your paper very well. A good paper is like icing on cake.Don't go for too many Books or unnecessarily follow Youtubers advise. Just stick to what CBSE has prescribed. If you follow some teacher on social platforms like YouTube, see to it that relevant content is shared.Take care of your health as well. Try to balance it. Harmony must be there between Studies and other activities. Spend some quality time with your family also. Always remember \u201cIf anything happens it's for betterment and, if not it's for excellence.\u201d #Apna100Aayega Best Wishes Vevek Sir Art Of Learnings ",

            "answer_text": "First of all you have to be very much determined   right from the start of your class 12 .Also if you are a regular school going student then it is a plus point but not the only factor. Then comes the matter that which study material you should follow and as you are aiming 98% so you can't afford to have any weak topic in any subject so be very much selective in the books you choose . I would suggest the following study materials:-                                        (1) PHYSICS:- one of most tough subject of the board . For this first you should complete your ncert textbook and after completing each chapter solve all its questions whether they are interesting or not . Then make a short and concise formula booklet for that chapter and after that solve all questions of that chapter from arihant chapterwise previous year paper and then move to next chapter and so on till the end . And whenever you are lagging behind remember your aim.        CAUTION:- don't ingore chapters on semiconductors , communication, earth magnetism, em waves as they will lower your percentage drastically.                                              (2) CHEMISTRY:- One of the easiest subject.. for this target a centum .follow the same guidelines as that for physics.                                    CAUTION:- dont ignore chapters on polymers , carbohydrates,  chemistry in everyday life  and particularly organic chemistry this will be disastrous to leave organic and don't revise it regularly as in the case of me.                                   (3) MATHEMATICS:- for this follow the same order and don't just cram formula try to learn their application in varied situations as cbse maths paper toughness is going sky high every year.And if you are left with any time then try Rd sharma...                                                   CAUTION:-Don't ignore chapters like sets and functions , lpp, matrices , determinants.                 (4) ENGLISH:- For English read whole ncert and solve all its intext questions and backside question and for reading , writing , novel buy a bbc and don't make compendium for this subject and practice a lot of reading and writing section as they are very time consuming in actual exam.                                        CAUTION :- Don't ignore novel and reading and writing section ..                                                 (5) 5th subject :- stick to same ncert , previous years and formula compendium.                          Caution :- don't try too much study materials as this was my biggest fault .                                             P.s:-I have just completed my cbse 2016 exam and telling you my drawbacks I am expecting around 87-90% . So you can see how wrong choices take you no where .the biggest mistake I did was choosing too many books so stick to ncert , formula compendium and previous years chapterwise.      ..........for any queries comment below or mail me.........all the best $...",

            "answer_text": "Sleepless nights, dreadful dreams, baffling questions, piles of notes and so on all these things accurately describes the conditions of a student preparing for board exams. Students must always keep in mind that irregular and a non-systematic study can lead to loss of marks in the exams. Believe and Motivate yourself Self-belief and motivation are the greatest and the unbeatable weapons that you have in yourself. These two things, when combined together, will strengthen enough to broaden your limits and achieve your aspirations. Self-belief and motivation can make a profound impact on your life in a better way, not on boards alone. Practice and solve 10-year sample papers Next important thing that you must do is practice and solve past 10 years sample papers By solving these papers you will be able to understand what type of questions is asked and accordingly you can prepare for them. The other benefit it has is that most of the important questions are repeated almost every alternate years, so solving these papers will automatically give you an idea of which topics are important and which are not. Work on Improving your Weakness You should never run away from your weakness, instead, try to overcome and win over them. You just can\u2019t declare yourself weak in any subject without even giving it a proper try. Study Daily If you study every day, your brain will not forget things and this will surely help you at the examination. Hence make a routine of studying at least 4-5 hours a day before the board exams. Time Management You might have heard it from your elders and almost everyone that don\u2019t waste your time. You can utilize your time by dividing it in a proper way for everything, fix your sleeping and waking time and fix a time for each subject. While preparing, make sure that you divide a day into several phases with an equal amount of time. Avoid studying for a continuous period of about 16-18 hours. Ensure you keep an interval in between every 3 hours of your study times. These are some basic tips one should follow to score 95%+ in their boards. Always have a positive attitude and study smart. All the best! ",

I never studied at home or anything at all, although I used to go to tuition classes and to be honest it didn't really helped me. Yeah, if you have a weak subject and your college teachers or you can't improve it on your own then I guess you should join some classes. Avoid well-known expensive classes, they only want money and they'll overcrowd the class with anyone who's willing to pay and trust me it's impossible to concentrate in that environment. Try new classes, you can clear your doubts well. Study well and don't leave a thing that's in your book, read textbooks over ready made material because this year because of that mistake I lost a major chunk of my marks. They'll give you anything from any corner of the book, also reading textbooks will help you in entrance exams too. If you want 97\u201398% percent you don't need classes, you need determination and focus. Avoid cellphone and social networking apps, that'll just waste your precious time. Good luck ! ",
