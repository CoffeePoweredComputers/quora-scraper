Don't be panic.take it easy .Keep faith on your self and believe on you which help to study well and do your best.Keep in touch with family and some friend and keep playing.. Thanxxx ",

Considering the fact that you gave your pre boards seriously, 15 days of strenuous efforts can fetch you more than 80%. Just divide your time slot for Previous year questions for each subject. This is very important. Do not skip this step.Mock test papers of each subject - Solve as many mocks as you can.Analyse each and every question. This will provide you the brief of your weaknesses and strengths.Thorough revision of important formulas (I hope you have pasted them on some conspicuous place)Revision of your notes.Just keep practicing and keep revising. All the best. P.s - you need to give some break to social media. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer would be in CBSE perspective. A good way to start your board exams preparation would be 1.Buying Books 2.Actually reading them I was in the same situation when i had to give my board exams, so i could share my experience. I bought All in One books for all the subjects (except physical education), didn\u2019t try to make short notes on such short time, read the summary first, moved onto the questions. Made an actual time-table for 2 weeks, followed it to the brink, first preference would be the last exam and then move in the reverse order to the first exam. I was preparing for competitive exams so, my physics and mathematics was good, i need just a brush-up (if you haven\u2019t done anything such, make a list of the formulas chapter-wise and solve the problems ). Don\u2019t buy a hand-book for any subjects, they are boring. Mathematics paper will always be lengthy, so make sure you solve fast, practice more. When you are done with All in one, move on to NCERT books (if you have time). Most important part- Do not panic!, trust yourselves, i scored a 90 with that attitude :) ",
