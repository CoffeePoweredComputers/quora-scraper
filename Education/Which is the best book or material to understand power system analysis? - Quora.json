            "answer_text": "Well it depends on student, whether they want books for just merely pass the exam or to gain real knowledge from them. From my point of view, for passing the exam , a book named \"A Course In Power Systems - J.B. Gupta\" is good. Its language is very simple, even a student from non-electrical background, can understand the concpts of electrical energy. But if you want to aquire knowledge, then go for \"Modern Power System Analysis - D. P. Kothari,I. J. Nagrath or Electrical Power Systems - C. L. Wadhwa\". Its my request to all the students that go for books written by Indian authors,as they use simple language with more clarification. ",
