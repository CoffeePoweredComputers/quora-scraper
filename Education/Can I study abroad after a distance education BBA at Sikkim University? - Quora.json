            "answer_text": "It depends on what you're wanting to study now. There are thousands of programs around the world that cater to whatever you're wanting to study, which is what is so amazing about education. I recommend that you start narrowing the scope of what you're wanting to study so you have a solid game plan in mind when you begin your college search. Be sure to look at www.SchooLinks.com when you are trying to find colleges to study at. You can easily search with keywords, such as the location where you're wanting to study or a program that you're interested in applying for. ",
