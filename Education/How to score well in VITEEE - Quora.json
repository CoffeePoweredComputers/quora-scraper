Viteee won't be as easy as 12th board exams\u2026.but it won't be as tough as Jee (Main). U have to solve 125Q in 150mins\u2026. Mathematics: Starting with my fav subject, Ques in maths were conceptual and formula based \u2026learn NCERT well..( if u r preparing for JEE mains\u2026then this exam will be easy for u) Physics: Ques in phy were conceptual and formulas based like maths .Ques were not very complicated but they were easy to solve .Read NCERT well and HC verma for done chaps Chemistry: 85% Ques were direct\u2026.without any calculation\u2026.some ques from electrochemistry were calculative\u2026and overall chem was easiest. No other book excerpt NCERT can help u score the best. English : Only 5Q \u2026they r paragraph type and parts of speech identification (simile, personification, metaphor etc) . So learn them. Hope this helped. ",

Practice as many problems as you can because it increases your speed very much which is very important in facing VITEEE .(First prepare the problems in NCERT and go for other books this will help you in other competitive exams also.) As VITEEE has no negative marks make sure that you attempt each question. While attempting the exam go for chemistry first followed by maths and physics (which our teachers told to follow) . This is because chemistry can be completed in a very less time so that you would get a relived feeling that you have completed a subject which gives a great boost while  while attempting others with much time left. ALL THE BEST ......... BE COOL ...... Hope this helped you bit .  ",
