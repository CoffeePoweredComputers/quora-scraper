            "answer_text": "At IISER Mohali, indeed, the biology courses continue for 2 years, as we do not have a pre-major system. Nevertheless, while the biology in the first year is pretty basic and even boring for people who had biology in 12th grade, it would be entirely new for a PCM student. Sure, it does get boring at times, and you may not like it at times, but overall the first year is pretty manageable, and you shall score straight As if you don\u2019t let the fear of biology overpower you. In the second year, the first course in biology is Evolutionary Biology and Genetics, and I am sure that as a PCM student, you shall love this course (this is the course most cited to sway people into bio majors, even if they did not have it in highschool!). It would be more difficult though, as it is not just direct stating of facts, as is mostly the case in the first year courses. The last course of biology in your core years is the Animal Behaviour and Ecology course. This course too is quite interesting, and if you like being outdoors, the accompanying lab course would be quite fun for you, as you shall be going around campus for birdwatching (involving proper noting down of number, location, time, species, etc.), to spot the 85+ species that are found in campus. Overall, thus, the biology courses are not going to be too bad, unless you stress too much about it and surrender without attempting to try it out. Like others have pointed out, there are a lot of students who do not have biology in highschool, but take up biology majors in IISERs, simply because they enjoy it. Perhaps you could be one too. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "In IISER-K, it is only 1 year. (As of now) You can opt out of bio from second year by choosing any 3 pre majors not including bio. Now. Coming to business. It's not difficult for a PCM student to learn bio for a year. The level of bio is very rudimentary and basic. Anybody with interest can ace through the course. With help of friends and teachers you can enjoy the bio course sooo much that some PCM people this year are opting to have bio as their pre-majors!!! But there is 2 sides to every coin. For bio people the course is too simple and not challenging at all. The topics might be interesting but they have done 80% of the syllabus before in hand. It all becomes an act of revision. All of the course was done in 9\u201312 classes. You'll see majority not the bio people from 12th not attend the classes as it is not worth their time. Currently, it's really easy for PCM students to study bio in IISER(as per current curriculum). ",
