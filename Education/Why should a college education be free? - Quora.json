            "answer_text": "Several reasons\u2026 Nothing is free. You have to take money to pay for this\u2026 whether in taxes or debt.Most people do not need a college education. Only about 20% of the population is employed in professions needing a college degree.It wasted four years of people\u2019s lives. This is four years people could be working, or getting a trades diploma. That is four years of people not contributing to GDP, taxes, getting actual work experience, etc.It is a waste of resources. You now need colleges able to house 2\u20133x more students, more professors, buildings, etc. 80% of which won\u2019t be used.It encourages colleges to just keep charging more and more. (As per student loans). If people had to actually pay for education, they wouldn\u2019t be paying these $40k, $80k, or $100k a year prices. If the government is paying it\u2026 what is stopping a college from charging double?It reduces the quality of your education. If you fill all your seats because the government is paying for them\u2026 why try to be the best law school? You don\u2019t have to compete for students.It encourages employers to ask for degrees for jobs which don\u2019t need them. Need a janitor\u2026 fine\u2026 I want a four year degree. That will really hurt anyone not able to get a degree.It doesn\u2019t direct the people into meaningful professions. Nothing stopping anyone from taking a major in basket weaving vs. engineering. It isn\u2019t like you have to convince a bank that you\u2019ll be able to pay them back with a basket weaving degree.It gives the government more control over your life and that of your children. Besides the massively skewed political make up of universities, terrible freedom of thought, etc. it means young people are denied all sorts of opportunities \u2014 military, working, starting businesses, travelling, etc. \u2014 which give real work experience, fill vital roles, give you a broader perspective on the country/world, etc., etc.It is going to make degrees worthless. If you have three times as many people with engineering degrees\u2026 its kind of hard to imagine that the quality of engineers didn\u2019t go down.Almost certain that colleges and employers will then start putting things in place to weed out the mass of degree holders \u2014 hire foreign degrees, only hire the top third of any graduating class, cut the salary of engineers dramatically, run them through their own tests, etc.etc. ",

            "answer_text": "You are asking for Professors to teach for free\u2026 how would they eat? Why should everybody pay for college too? Might as well extend high school at that point. Instead, make taxpayer dollar go further by making high school worthy of an accomplishment. Not the beginning of more training\u2026 for some it just is, but in today\u2019s culture we are educated fools. Doctors don\u2019t do surgery for free typically. There is pro bono and volunteering in third world\u2019s but the volunteers are beyond human. If we take this to it\u2019s extreme why shouldn\u2019t every service be free? Why not tax everyone at 100%? No one owns the fruits of their labor\u2026 and let the government decide what you drive, eat, where you live. No snacks because you are on a government mandated diet. It sounds too controlling and abusive to me. Someone would have to control the amount of resources a person gets\u2026 some people would take way more than others. Greed doesn\u2019t go away. Also, if college were free, there would be one less benefit of going into the military. It totally ruins earning something. Then, it also ruins the degree value and we are stuck with a modern high school diploma that took an extra 4 years. The only reason I would want college to be free is if I didn\u2019t do anything to pay for it, and run a guilt trip about how it would feel to fall behind. You are not entitled to have a professor tell you about stuff, or a doctor to fix you (luckily they have an oath), it\u2019s up to them. Money is a very good trade. It\u2019s sort of I saved up and really want this. It feels better saving up and working towards a goal, than to be just given something\u2026 and when something works out unexpectedly you don\u2019t get this attitude the world owes you something. It\u2019s like the one friend who spends all his money on weed and gets jealous about the other friend who saved up for an Xbox. I\u2019d like to be able to keep money and spend it on what I want. The weed guy did but just chose to get high, he smoked his Xbox. If you are actually disabled or something then it\u2019d be different. Like a rare genetic disorder or PTSD. It\u2019s sorta the cost of being a society. Not everybody and anybody. It\u2019s like saying everyone should be able to get into the NFL. ",
