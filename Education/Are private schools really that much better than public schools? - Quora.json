            "answer_text": "As someone who went to private school from k-8 and switched to public for high school, I would say that private school and public school both have pros and cons. If you can afford private school, I would definitely recommend giving it a try just to see if your child likes it. Private School (K-8) Class size Pro: Most of my classes were only made of about 15 kids which really let the teacher get to know you as an individual and give you as much help as you needed whenever you needed it.Con: If for some reason your class had a certain kid you didn't like ( I had a few of those) you are most likely going to be stuck with them for almost every class. At my school, the kids who were at the same academic level where all placed together and had all 8 classes together every day.Rules and dress codes/uniforms Pro: Disciplines kids and teaches them authority and to respect adults (works for some kids but of course there are always some rebellious ones) Also dress codes where very strict, only allowing 12 inch inseam for shorts and tucked in shirts with belts which were enforced to \u201cprepare\u201d us for future jobs and uniforms at work. Only collared shirts in 5 different colors and navy and khaki pants were allowed. Sometimes I miss the uniforms because it was so easy to get dressed in the morning and I never had to worry about wearing the same outfit as someone because everyone was wearing the same thing anyways.Cons: Rules wise, there wasn't a lot of freedom. No cellphones or tablets of any sort were allowed to be used or even seen at school, which of course wasn't a problem when I was younger because no one had phones, but now with every age having them, it might be a little hard to enforce and keep kids off them. Certain teachers wouldn't even allow any candy, food, gum, or even water in their class because it was too much if a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Talking out of turn or not tracking and tapping when you read would result in getting points off (a system my school formed for punishment, like detention) Moving onto the dress code side of things, there were many limitations on to what you could wear. No bright nail polish, dyed hair, peircings, certain hair bows and scrunchies, bracelets, hats, brightly colored shoes, etc. There were not many ways to express yourself which put a damper on some kids creativity and self confidence. And they were just plain ugly\u2026Education Pro: Direct instruction. Classes were structured and aimed to challenge students. Rigorous learning exercises and techniques were used to make sure the material was being obtained and would be remembered. Teachers were very skilled and experienced with what they were teaching and seemed to have a passion for what was being taught (not saying public school teachers aren't). Spanish and Latin were both parts of the curriculum and allowed them to dip their toes into different cultures.Con: As you stated above, you do not want your daughter to be brought up with a certain religion. This may be an issue for certain schools you consider because mine was not advertised as a Christian school but most if not all teachers taught from a religious perspective and encouraged children to adopt their religion. Due to the small amount of children who mostly shared the same religion anyways, this teaching wasn't really oppossed or questioned. Also dealing with the small amount of children, there wasn't a large variety of classes and clubs to take. Only two languages were offered and most clubs were either aimed towards science and engineering or technology. There was also a considerable amount of homework, sometimes I would have 3 essays all due on the same day or hours of homework in each class. You had to have amazing time management to survive.Close knit community Pro: Everybody knows everybody. You know who's friends with who, everyone's parents, almost everything about them. It created a lot of friendships and a great environment to grow up in.Con: Gossip, because no one spreads it like teenage girls. You will have this wherever you send your daughter, but since noting new happened too often, new drama spread like wildfire.Year round schedule Pro: Breaks\u2026.all the time! Every nine weeks you get three off, what could be bettter. Right when you get bored from school you have a break. Creates a lot of vacation time and allows your family to travel when it's less busy.Con: The summer. My school only gave us 5 weeks off which wasn't a lot of time to do much of anything. We also never got teacher work days and never had snow days built into the calendar.Other things to consider Tuition - As you probably already know, a large sum of money is going into your kids education. Tuition just by itself is expensive, but so are most uniforms, textbooks, and school supplies.Carpool - No bus transportation is available so if possible, carpool would be a great gas and time saver.Diversity - Most of my school was full of rich white kids. I knew maybe 10 black kids from k-5 and rarely had foreign students. I didn't have a male teacher until 6th grade and didn't have a teacher of color until 7th. New kids were rare, 10 new kids if we were lucky per grade each year.Special ed - My school did not provide any learning accommodations to anyone with learning disabilities. Children who's parents hadn't taught them or exposed them to kids different to them weren't taught at school how to treat them. Most kids that were enrolled that had Tourette's or ADHD were often picked on and view as weaker and stupid.Friends - We had about 500 kids k-8 so there was only a limited about of people to make friends with. Like I said before, there weren't many new kids and not much variety in students, teachers/staff.Overall, my experience with private school was excellent k-5. The education was amazing and I really loved the environment and what I was learning. But with that being said, I really hated middle school as most kids do. The education was still excellent but there were just so many cliques and drama going around, I just couldn't deal with it. My bad experiences in middle school have definitely influenced my opinions on private school and having switched to public, I would never go back. My parents send me to private school for k-5 was the best thing they could have done for me, but I would have switched to public for middle if I could have. If you can afford it, I would definitely recommend trying it out. *I have written all of the information about my years at private school based on experiences and opinions. Mine could be the polar opposite of someone who attended the same school, but I wanted to be completely honesty so you could have more information when deciding which school to send your child to* Public School Class size Pro: Larger classes, somewhere around 25\u201335 kids, does make the class more interesting. Hearing from so many different people and having students with all different learning styles creates a really unique learning environment.Con: It gets loud. Having all those kids talking at once can be kind of annoying, definitely for someone who is used to a class being silent. Also the size does make it more difficult for the teacher to help everyone and make sure there are enough supplies to go around.Rules and dress codes/uniforms Pro: Freedom!!! There is flexibility in rules and dress code. Not having uniforms eliminates a significant amount of rules and opens up a vast selection of what to wear. Of course there is still the no spaghetti strap rule because shoulders are sooooo distracting and no crop tops and short shorts but you can dye your whole head if you want to, have as many piercings/accessories as you want.Con: Less rules and more freedom does have its cons though. Kids don't listen as well, some don't respect adults, others skip class. It takes a lot longer to get ready in the morning. I find myself doing a lot more shopping and spending what would have been tuition money on shoppin trips.Education Pro: Only having four classes compared to eight makes it a lot easier to manage time and focus on your work. But since block is only in high school, I can't really compare the k-8 classes schedules. The curriculum is standard, academic, honors, and AP classes are available so the intensity of work and learning is up for the student to decide. I would say having received the education from private school then switching to public, all of my classes were easy. I was placed in all honors and received two credits from middle school. Prodigies are born in both environments and really depends on if your child applies themselves. The homework load is less which is absolutely something to be happy about.Con: Common core. It might just be me coming from a more structured way of learning but I hate common core. There is a common format and plan teaching, hence the name, and the teacher can then put their own spin and style of teaching on the subject. For other students though it works just fine and they've grown up with it .Close knit community Not that this isn't at public school, just with having a close knit community with a constant cycle of new kids, it's hard to form as close of one at a larger school. Coming from a 500 kid school to 2000 kid school, the transition interesting\u2026.Traditional Schedule Pro: I love summer break so much!!!!! I never knew what I was missing out on. The teacher work days and random holidays I've never had off before is great. There are snow days built in and just a really well planned out schedule.Con: Riding the bus in the morning to be able to make it to school by 7:25 kind of sucks but it's not unbearable. Christmas break this past year was only 10 days which was kind of short but the long summer makes up for it.Other things to consider No Tuition - Saving some money never hurtsCarpool - Bus or carpool, whatever you choose, you've got optionsDiversity - White, black, yellow, purple, you've got a little but if everybody from everywhereSpecial ed - Students with learning disabilities are included in all activities and are always involved in school activitiesFriends - With tons of clubs and different classes you can take, your always meeting new people and making new friendsOverall, my freshman year at public school has been amazing. I took all honors classes and got straight As. I love the diversity and amazing group of people I get to be around. There are so many classes and clubs available to join and there's something for everybody. If there is a good rated public school in your area, I would definitely consider it. *I\u2019ve only been at public school for a year so I don't know much about it. I've tried my best to explain the difference but there is still a gap I missed from not going to a public school for K-8* All in all, my apologies for writing a book, if there is a good public school in your area, I would send your daughter there. And if money is an issue, I would strongly recommend public school to save that money on tuition. But if there are no decent public schools in the area or if money is not an issue, private school is the way to go. Best of lucky to you and your daughter :) ",

            "answer_text": "My cousins Chris and Maya graduated from arguably one of the best high schools in the U.S. It\u2019s a private institution and the cost of attendance is higher than my college tuition. At their high school 100% of students graduate. The average SAT score is pushing 1400 and every student is proficient in math. The student-teacher ratio is 6:1 and class sizes are regularly single digits. I attend a run of the mill urban public high school. It\u2019s mostly white, economically stratified, and academically average. My school graduates slightly over three quarters of its students. The average SAT of my school is 1100 and 43% of students meet the state standards for mathematics. The student-teacher ratio is 20:1. A class of less than 23 or 24 is a rarity, and classes pushing 30 are commonplace.  My cousins received the objectively superior education. But more than that, they were surrounded with people who pushed them towards excellence. Chris and Maya went to Princeton and Dartmouth. Their best friends went to Stanford and Penn. I would bet money that every student who attended their high school chose to pursue higher education with many of them attending the top institutions the world has to offer. These kids are set up for nothing but success. And perhaps more crucially, they\u2019re avoiding the pitfalls of the public school student body. An eye-opening experience for me was listening to Maya talk about how the biggest troublemaker at her school was put on disciplinary prohibition for being rude in Instagram comments. Whereas at my school, I can name fifteen people off the top of my head who sell drugs. A senior was taken away in handcuffs for running a revenge porn ring of underage girls. A freshman was taken to the hospital after having his head slammed into the corner of a locker for talking to someone\u2019s girlfriend. A sophomore was sent to juvie for buying a gun and threatening to murder his pregnant girlfriend after assaulting her in public. My school isn\u2019t some dystopian hellhole - it\u2019s average at worst. We\u2019re lucky that there isn\u2019t much of a gang presence, and that we have administration that takes threats to student safety seriously. But that\u2019s the sort of thing that shows how low the bar is. We\u2019re lucky not to have too much gang violence in our place of education. Chris and Maya\u2019s high school experience had them a long way from any such concerns - rubbing shoulders with the future global ruling class. Kids from rich and influential families who live in a world where police don\u2019t show up at school to collect students for committing felonies. I\u2019m mixing with gifted and well-connected people also. But I\u2019m also in an environment with kids who are on a life path that will leave them dead or in prison. Put simply, my cousins probably didn\u2019t know a single person like that, let alone have to try and sit through Spanish 1 with them. Instead, my cousins get a college prep education I can only dream of, go to Ivies, become doctors, lawyers, and world leaders, and send their kids through the same system that made them. It\u2019s possible that they might experience some rudeness in Instagram comments. But they can guarantee that other students won\u2019t knock their daughters up, beat them senseless, and threaten to shoot them. I\u2019m content with my public high school experience, but it can\u2019t hold a candle to the private one that my cousins got. ",

There are some really terrible hot dogs and some wonderful hamburgers and some wonderful hot dogs and some awful hamburgers. Public schools have the advantage of funding. While some private schools enjoy enormous funding through the generosity of alumni donors, many operate on a pretty tight budget. And public school budgets may also become subject to the whims of the elected officials. Private schools may offer greater opportunity for better networking and contacts through alumni and parents. On the flip side, public schools often can do the same. It would depend upon the school. Private schools often have a board of directors that oversee and monitor what is happening at the school. The activities and work at public schools frequently are subject to approval of an elected school boards and as such the voters within an area. Public schools historically have had a diverse student population thus preparing the students to interact with a broader group of people as they become adults. School vouchers have introduced a greater diversity of students to some private schools. With the diversity of students in any school, there is the problem of what that diversity may bring. Private schools have greater control of the ideology under which they operate. If it is important to a parent that their children be educated under a certain ideology this could be an important issue. On the flip side, schools may limit their curricula based the ideology under which they operate. An excellent example of this would be human reproduction. One very conservative private school completely excluded any study of human reproduction and genetics in their high school biology classes. Private schools enjoy greater parental involvement. This writer recalls a shooting at a private school in my community. The line of cars to pick up students blocked traffic on the streets near the school despite the fact that no student was ever at risk and the students at the school are typically have a bus that takes them to and from school. Because of the student population and the atmosphere in which they are working, faculty and staff at private schools report greater job satisfaction, but may often feel constrained by the school\u2019s ideology and, even the whim of the school\u2019s principal. Faculty at public schools generally paid better and, in the case of at least one private school here, staff and faculty reported that they did not receive any pay for the last month that the school was open. Security at public schools is better as many have on-site school resource officers (police). The smaller size of private schools, especially when the school requires a uniform make it easier for some one who is not supposed to be on campus to become evident. There are pros and cons to each side. Much would depend upon the schools. Stanton college prep, a public school in Duval County, Florida has historically been ranked upon the best college prep schools in the US while another public school in the same area had failing grades as a school for almost five years. The students at one private school in Duval county had the opportunity to observe open heart surgery while students at another private school discovered that the school\u2019s accreditation was not appropriate for them to even enlist in the military. So, it may be a cop out of an answer, but it depends. ",

            "answer_text": "I want to start off this answer by saying that I have never attended a public school. I've been at the same private elementary school from pre-kindergarten until this year, my eighth grade year of high school. Note: I was held back in Pre K,  so I am a year old for my grade. Some private elementary schools hold students for a year. My experience at private school:  The teachers: Every teacher I've ever had has been enthusiastic and happy to be teaching my class. They try to make class interesting, and try to make sure everybody understands what we are learning before they move on to a new topic. My relationship with my teachers extends beyond the classroom. I talk to them about current events and other topics, and I say hello to them when I pass them in the hall. These relationships have taught me etiquette and manors I don't believe I would have learned without them. Teachers won't hesitate to offer help. The students: At my school, every student is incredibly motivated. We all put effort into our assignments and projects, and we all believe we have potential. Any student who starts to coast will be talked to and encouraged by others to try his or her best. We have no problem asking a teacher for help, and no problem asking a question or raising a concern. As a student, I feel like I have a voice that will always be heard. The facilities: In my experience, private schools have more money from donations and tuition to expand, supply, and create better learning environments than public schools. That said, I believe that a private school's facilities are much less important than many other factors. A school might have an incredible science building, but the students still won't learn anything if they have a bad teacher.  The classes: My classes are detailed, thorough, and most importantly, interesting. We cover similar topics as public schools, but usually with different material and depth. For example, in my American History class, we  study primary sources instead of a textbook. The homework load is usually fairly high compared to other public schools. As an 8th grader, I typically have 1.5-2.5 hours of homework a night. With study halls, the work is usually pretty manageable. We are never assigned work just for the purpose of doing it, our homework always teaches us something.  The opportunities: At private school, I believe that students in general get many more opportunities to go beyond the ordinary than they do in other school settings. We can elect to play interscholastic sports, do community service projects, and join clubs, all in elementary school. I take a photography class, a cinematography class, a woodworking class, and a class on mindfulness. Every few months, we will get to listen to a speaker that the school brings in. Although it isn't universal for all private schools, some schools offer independent study programs. In Independent Studies, students get to create, research, and execute a project of their choosing. At my school, recent projects have included the construction of a drone/quadcopter, construction of surf board, construction of skis, dress making, ceramics, and more. Cons: I do sometimes have a harder time meeting people in my town because I don't attend the local schools. Although I have a perfectly fine, normal network of friends from my private school, I wish I had met more people from my community. My grade is also only about 60 kids. There are many benefits to a smaller grade, but sometimes I wish that it was bigger.  This may sound like marketing, but I promise that it is genuine. Although it has its flaws, I believe that I am incredibly lucky to attend the school that I do and would recommend applying to anybody.   ",

            "answer_text": "This is a long answer, so if you don\u2019t want all the details, you can just read the TL:DR at the bottom of this post. I think I\u2019m in a relatively unique situation to answer this because of the variety of schools I\u2019ve gone to over the years. Also, just as a preface, I\u2019m probably coming from a more privileged standpoint considering I grew up and still go to school in New York City, which gives me much more options than other places in America. For K-3 I attended an average public elementary school in the \u201cGifted and Talented Program\u201d (though I\u2019ll talk in my summary why that really doesn\u2019t matter). Then, in fourth grade I switched to a private school that was new in New York, but well known as a charter school on the west coast. I stayed there until the end of eighth grade where I was posed with the problem of picking a place to go for high school. There were a myriad of possibilities such as staying at my current private school, switching to a more well known private school, going to a public school, and even going to boarding school. Later in this post I\u2019ll tell you the pros and cons of each of these choices, but I\u2019ll tell you now, that I ended up choosing to go to a very well known and selective public high school. K-3 For K-3 I went to P.S.217, a public lower school on Roosevelt Island in NYC. The main reason I (more like my mother) chose to go here was because I was selected for the Gifted and Talented Program that\u2019s available in some NYC public lower schools. There are some that are better than others, but I went here because it was closest to my house. Pros: Very diverse community of students where I got to experience many cultures that I hadn\u2019t been exposed to before.Honestly more accepting than my private school (I\u2019ll talk about this later).Good ratio of boys to girls.It\u2019s Free. Enough said.This was a while ago, so there were probably more things that I liked, but I mostly remember the reasons why I decided to switch schools in the middle of elementary school, so sorry if I missed anything but those were mostly it. Cons: Only taught things one way, never more material. Let me elaborate, they had to stick to the material and teachers could never deviate. Always had to teach Common Core (I literally failed 3rd grade math because I did long division instead of Common Core division).Not very challenging. This can be different for others, but I had already placed out of all reading levels for the elementary school by the end of second grade.Teachers hated it if you were ahead of the class, and the school couldn\u2019t do anything if you were.The Gifted and Talented kids took the exact same curriculum as the other kids, at the same exact pace, so there was no real difference.The arts were severely underfunded and I am more drawn to the arts, so that was a drawback.That\u2019s everything that I can think of, but remember that I don\u2019t know how this would work for older public schools, I\u2019m just giving my experience. 4-8 After my public elementary school, I made the decision to go to a Pre K-12 private school in Brooklyn called Basis. Basis is a network of schools globally that share a curriculum and basic school structure. This started out on the west coast as a network of charter schools, but when they decided to move east, the first school being the NYC one I attended, they couldn\u2019t get a charter school permit, so they just made it private. Pros: Very fast paced learning environment. In fourth grade I had about three hours of homework a night and this only increased as my time went on at the school. I personally liked this because of how different it was from my previous school.Wide range of curriculum. I took many \u201cweird\u201d or out of the norm classes. Here are my examples. Grade 4: Took Mandarin and an hour and 45 minute Humanities seminar (Instead of English and History). Grade 5: Took both Mandarin and Latin. I also took Classics (Instead of History). I also had two science classes: Physical Geography and plain Science. Grade 6: Here\u2019s where things started to get really wacky. I took Latin and skipped a math level to Algebra 1. I also started taking three science classes, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, which I all took until the end of 8th. Grade 7: Took an entire class about Logic. Grade 8: Took Microeconomics first semester, took Macro second. I also took AP World History.Really flexible curriculum. Although the actual curriculum itself is not the standard anywhere, this is something most private schools are able to do. If you\u2019re ahead in one class they can just move you up to the next grade\u2019s class. I did this in 6th grade. The standard for my school was to take Pre-Algebra, but I skipped it and took Algebra 1.Small Class Sizes. You get to know your teacher really well, and they are open to helping you.Although I didn\u2019t stay for high school, you have to take 6 AP\u2019s to graduate. Most kids take around 10. This is something most schools can\u2019t even begin to compare to. They also have a 95% pass rate.Cons: You literally know everybody. By the end of eight grade, I literally knew everyone in the high school, and most kids from the middle school.Not a lot to do. This might have been just my private school, but because of how little people there were there were only so many clubs to join, and most were academic based, not for fun.Bad boy to girl ratio. In fourth grade there were 18 kids in the entire grade. 12 were boys, 6 were girls. This 2:1 ratio basically stayed the same the entire time I was there.Not a lot of socialization. I was honestly sick of my classmates. I\u2019m still friends with a bunch of them, but I didn\u2019t want to only see them. My school was extremely small. The largest my grade ever got was 60 kids. That was in sixth grade. By the time eighth grade rolled around there were only 45 kids left. Only 28 kids stayed for high school.Money. My school was on the lower side of private schools, around 35k a year, but that is still a lot.As you can see, I loved the academic aspect of my school and hated the social part. That was the main reason I decided to leave for high school, along with the money aspect. My mom said that any money saved from going to public school would go to college, and I\u2019d rather have less college debt. Before I get into my public high school I\u2019ll give you a quick rundown of the other two options I had for high school. Catholic/Private High Schools: I probably could have easily gotten into a decent one, and if I tried I could have gotten into a good one, but they are so expensive, and when looking at the academics they didn\u2019t even begin to compare to my middle school, so I decided not to apply. Most of the things they offered compare to my public high school, but at the price of 50-60k a year. Boarding Schools: Generally, the consensus with these is if you go to a top 20 boarding school, you are bound to get the best education in the country. While I agree with this statement, I got deferred to my top choice boarding school, so I couldn\u2019t go until 10th grade. I had already settled in at my HS, and honestly my HS had even more clubs than the boarding school I was considering, so I chose not to go. I also sat in on some of their classes, and I already learned the physics curriculum in middle school. Their Sophomore english class compared to my Freshman english class at my HS. For most, I would say that boarding school is the best education and the best for EC\u2019s that they could get, but for me it wasn\u2019t. They are also really expensive. (FYI, I was considering a top 5 boarding school) High School The high school I go to is Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, New York, and it\u2019s literally amazing. Pros: Take all the pros of my middle school except the small class size and AP thing, and put them here. More pros: Large student body. There are 950 kids in my grade and I love it. I meet new people every day.So many EC\u2019s and clubs. There are 250+ clubs at Stuy.Most kids take a few AP\u2019s before they graduate, but it\u2019s required to take at least 1.It\u2019s Free. Again, enough said.Cons: Large class sizes. There are almost always 34 kids in my class, and teachers have a lot of students. Unless you make the effort to make sure they know you, they will probably only remember your name.You need to be independent. You won\u2019t get a lot of help.Again, bad boy to girl ratio. My school is 60% boys and 40% girls.Conclusion/TL:DR If you have access to a top 100 public high school, I\u2019d 100% recommend going. You\u2019ll get amazing academic and EC opportunities and meet a very diverse group of students along the way. If you have the money though, and don\u2019t have access to one of these public schools, a top 30-ish boarding school or one a private school is the way to go. Lower rate boarding schools aren\u2019t worth the money, so if you can\u2019t get into one of the top ones, I\u2019d suggest going to a private school, higher ranked the better, and going there because of how personalized it is. If all else fails, going to a normal public high school is fine, but only if you\u2019re willing to make the most out of it. You can still do great, but you might have to work more to get the same opportunities that you can get at the schools I mentioned before. ",

            "answer_text": "I went to a religious private school from Kindergarten to Senior year. And I really must say that it depends on what you want for your child. My school being religious, many parents wanted to protect their child in a small (my grad. class had 60 students), predictable, and controlled environment. They also wanted them to learn religious material. However, unlike most secular private schools, the academic scene was cut out for one type of student. This is the student that is a goody goody student, goes to youth group every night, makes A\u2019s, and is in a ton of leadership programs. They aren\u2019t extremely passionate about a particular subject or area of study. And they aren\u2019t \u201cwoke\u201d per se on like politics and social injustice. So, you can see how this would put students out of this circle at a disadvantage. For example, our school was really focused on STEM as this is apparently, the way of the future. We had tons of STEM electives, but our art classes were all taught by one teacher. Our theater was in a modular. And we had no clubs for ethnic groups, women, special interests, or any other art interest. I did start a literary magazine my junior year, not without the tug of war with administration who gave us NO funding. Also, we had no special needs programs at our school. So kids (and teachers!) with any disability could not be allowed in our school. To make matters worse we did not have an elevator which made us key targets for a civil trial. There was also very little diversity beyond Blacks. Most of my classmates were upper middle class republican whites. I could go on and on about the flaws of my school, most of which start with the hard headed, traditional administration who leave no room for new ideas or thinking. This may not be the norm for all private schools, but with a larger school, you get more opportunities, diversity, and it is more probable that a student with find their niche with so many options.

            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s largely a matter of selection. Students that generally go private schools are better off. Private school students might come across as smarter even though they really are not. They have more experiences, like travel, open to them. They have parents who are better off than many public school parents. This affords a whole different upbringing where the feel better about themselves and express themselves better, hence they don\u2019t feel shy about talking in class or writing on paper. If you are not as well off as others then your upbringing suffers especially during their younger years, 3 to 8 years old. If you have a body of better off students then they will tend to realize what they need to do to do well in school. If you grow up low-income, or in poverty, chances are that your daily experiences do not develop your intellect. Music lessons, dance lessons are great for intellectual development. Horseback riding, skating, and other experiences are great for intellectual development. The poor and low income kids don\u2019t have access to those experiences. Even playing chess is good for intellectual development. It much a matter of being efficacious. If you feel that you are smarter and can affect your environment, like the better off are and can, then you come across as smarter. Also in private school teachers can hold their students to a higher standard. If a teacher has an entire class of students with limited experiences and limited perspectives then he/she might not be able to hold his/her students to a very high standard. I urge you to see the movie THE HATE U GIVE. The main characters go to a private school since their parents feel that they will do better in that school since the local high school doesn\u2019t have such high expectations as it\u2019s more difficult to enforce high expectations with a study body that is difficult to work with.

            "answer_text": "Yes. But it\u2019s not really a fair comparison. It\u2019s like asking if a limo is really that much better than the subway. The limo is going to be a better experience for those that can take it, because not everyone can take it. It\u2019s better by virtue of the fact that it\u2019s not designed for the masses, but for the select few. Private schools have three key advantages: Selectivity. They can always say \u201cno\u201d to enrolling a disruptive student. A single disruptive student can ruin a lesson for an entire class. Private schools don\u2019t have to deal with as many disruptions.Parental support. The parents are the paying customers, after all. Private school parents, unlike public school taxpayers, can easily take their business elsewhere if they don\u2019t like the product they\u2019re getting for their money. And, the very fact that they are willing to pay extra for their child\u2019s education means that the child has above-average levels of parental support at home. The best teachers can\u2019t do anything to motivate a student whose own parents don\u2019t care.Teacher freedom. Private schools tend to have fewer curriculum coordinators/assistant administrators/department heads/other people telling the teachers how to do their job. Teachers are free to teach the way that they know works best for the students who are in front of them.Where I live and teach, Chicago, the selective enrollment (magnet) public high schools are some of the best schools in the country. Public and private K-8 students are allowed to apply for positions in those schools. In the dozen years I\u2019ve been teaching, they\u2019ve changed the selective enrollment high school admissions criteria twice, both times because a disproportionate amount of students from private schools were getting spots in those schools. They\u2019d set quotas if they could, but they can\u2019t. Parents of students in private schools are taxpayers, too, so their children have a right to apply to selective public schools. ",

The people running the school are fundamentally more interested in education than the educrats typically are. I\u2019ve read 15 or 20 of the answers below. I recommend you do the same. You'll see that the schools described in these answers are two different worlds. Consider just this comment: \u201cWe had a no tolerance bullying policy, and we never had issues with it. I met all kind of kids with different religions, and we never had an issue.\u201d That, of course, is exactly how it should be. The ideologues running the public schools use every problem to make more problems. I always think that public schools basically follow the philosophy preached by Saul Alinski and Obama: everyone should be a community organizer (i.e., meddler). My theory is that these people love dysfunction and failure; and they make sure we get a lot of it. Then they can ask for more money to deal with the problems they make. Politicians can point to the friction and fighting in the society, and blame that on their political enemies. John Dewey and his followers believe that public schools exist for social engineering. Education suffers greatly. I'm always trying to explain how and why public schools are bad. It's difficult to explain to people who accept the blas\u00e9 spin presented by the media, Everything's okay! The Education Establishment is trying really hard! They mean well!\u2026 That's the biggest lie of all. They don't mean well. They want to drag the whole country down by first dragging the school system down. You see in the comments below how it's done. On the other hand, if the people in charge of public schools were sincere, as opposed to being socialist \u201cchange agents,\u201d public schools could easily be just as good as private schools. Everything depends on the smarts and sincerity of the people in charge of any particular school. ",

            "answer_text": "Public Schools in the U.S. are based on district, and that district cuts their own curriculum within (rather loose) State minimums. For California alone, there are over 350 different school districts. So, some school districts are GREAT, most are OK, and a GREAT school district (in an expensive neighborhood) can be sandwiched between a really lousy school district right next door. The better performing school districts are either rural (a brand new district), or are augmented by a self-imposed tax by the citizens of that district. The popularity of \u2018some\u2019 private schools is simply the escape they offer for those citizens living in a lousy public school district. So\u2026 if the child is going to a great public school, that would be the choice to take. If not\u2026 then Private may be the best choice. Private school tuition for minors is not tax deductable (however private religious schools can offer a substantial tax deduction when they \u2018bless\u2019 the tuition as a tithe). Lastly, the public schools are \u2018better connected\u2019 perhaps to the University queue (AP testing performance, etc.) then smaller private schools, but that certainly is NOT always true. Some private HS tuition is the same price as if the student were attending a University, but their teaching is sometimes just 5 students per class, and good performance guarantees acceptance at Ivy League schools, or in some instances West Point. It is common for Private school kids to transfer to public school after middle school into the first year of the public HS (9th grade?)\u2026 because they are coming in typically a year ahead of the other students in the skill set, and easily maintain a HS GPA of 4.0+. Coming in at the beginning also makes them less of a stranger to otherwise existing cliques. ",

            "answer_text": "They can be. Theoretically, they ought to be benefiting from the free market where their value and success is determined on how well they serve their clientele. That said, I had a few mentor teachers tell me to stay far, far away from such employment on my end as a teacher. While exceptions exist, private schools are notorious for paying teachers very little. I find this strange, as public school teachers are often told to go to the \u201cprivate sector\u201d if they want for money\u2014I can only assume they meant the private sector for non-education fields. I do know one teacher who is doing comparatively well income-wise in his private school job, having found that magical unicorn position, but his income still isn\u2019t all that impressive and he admits his is a rare position. Also, some private schools tend to ride on the coattails of their private school nature\u2014the free market ruthlessness is drowned by fawning impressions of \u201cOh, look! A private school!\u201d A mentor teacher taught for some years at a private school of this nature, and reported misbehaving children, incompetent faculty, and general disorder\u2014but no one cared because it was a mystical and magical private school. There\u2019s also that the myth of private schools freely expelling any student who stick a toe out of line. With more and more private schools accepting federal money to help provide for IEP students, expulsion is becoming a vague memory. Another that said, I think in theory and ideal execution, private schools can be better than public schools. A private school has the choice to be selective of its students, allowing a more fast-paced and focused curriculum. I as a teacher in a public school simply can\u2019t do that ideally as I deal with a greater range of students and abilities. But ah, it\u2019s not just programs for gifted smarty-pants. Private schools can also more completely meet the needs of Average Joes and yes, even students with learning disabilities if a private school wants to conquer that niche. So, while I think many individual private schools are overrated and overblown, the concept when well-executed is a good one that can give parents and students the option to find a better fit for their student.

            "answer_text": "They can be, it depends. The main thing I want to get across with my answer is how much the answer to this question depends on the local options available, and your kid and their needs. I am from a rural part of Wisconsin. I went to public schools for K-8, and a Catholic high school. Here are some thoughts based on my experiences. My public school was quite good. We had no major discipline problems, and classes were reasonably sized. My family is not Catholic (we are Lutheran). I attended my high school because, at the time, it had a very interesting math/science magnet program that enrolled about 10% of the school (the rest had a more typical Catholic school education). I had three classes a day in this program, where all my teachers had PhDs. Otherwise, I took regular classes and participated in activities like a regular student. Had I continued in public school, I would have been attending classes at the local technical college instead by my junior year if not earlier. I took Algebra II at the high school when I was in 8th grade, and I was also a year ahead in English (which continued at my actual high school; I took Senior English as a junior, and then AP as a senior). My parents did not want this for me. They wanted me to have a more normal high school experience, but with appropriate academics for my abilities, and my high school made this possible. I would have still done a lot of what I did in public school, but having to travel half an hour one-way for classes would have made being fully-integrated into the student body more difficult. Now, I am a bit of special case. What more general conclusions can be drawn? First of all, I don\u2019t think I got the highest level of benefit out of the school, relative to some of my friends. Several of my friends from growing up also switched over to my high school, and they were average students. For one of them in particular, I think going to our school versus public school probably put him on a far better life trajectory. There were two areas in which our private school was far superior to our local public school: Troublemakers could be kicked out. In public school, we didn\u2019t have any major troubles with violence, no gangs, minimal drug use. The main avenue for delinquency is drinking. However, many students were not terribly interested in learning or doing homework. At my high school, students who disrupted things were kicked out, including the son of school officials in one case (I knew him and liked him, but he sadly wasn\u2019t really a fit, and later went to prison.) Being able to get rid of the troublemakers is a huge benefit to the culture of the school, which leads us to the second reason.The student culture approved of being a good student. In my class at least, and most other classes as far as I could tell, the popular students were mostly also the best students. (OK, I was only middlingly popular, but I was also barely in the top 20% by class rank because I was lazy.) Our valedictorian was widely loathed, because he was a whiny grade whore, but otherwise there was a very high correlation between your grades and popularity. Not really a causal link, but being a good student was respected, and especially, not caring about school made you an outcast and a loser. We did have a guy who didn\u2019t do homework, etc., and he was almost more like a pet or a zoo animal than a classmate. In contrast, my sister went to the local public school, and while being a good student wasn\u2019t going to get you bullied or make you undateable, it wasn\u2019t considered cool.Now, some other observations. First, the public school paid better. Our teachers (even the PhD-holding ones, once you account for their other opportunities) were paid nothing. The main benefit was free tuition, so the teachers that were long-tenured tended to have multiple children in the school (hi Catholicism!) or be religion teachers. Accordingly, the teaching was at times a bit of a mixed bag. The weakest areas were math and science, which I avoided due to my magnet program. However, our school got a lot of capital funding from a local businessman who was an alum. So we were very ahead of the time in technology, at least for the area (we had a T1 line in 1995). Very few families paid full tuition, and we had a true mix of income levels, from very wealthy for the area (multi-millionaires, not billionaires), to frankly dirt poor. I gained new admiration for a classmate when I learned that he, with the approval of administration and his parents, took maybe 4\u20136 days off from school every year. On these days, he worked a full day at his normally part-time job in an auto body shop, and used the money to pay his tuition. So, if I had to make a list of strengths for the public school, they would be: A more consistent quality of teachingA requirement to serve all students. My high school had some limited help available for weaker students, but if you had true special education needs, you were going to have to go elsewhere.Access to vocational education. My high school had a strictly college-prep syllabus. Virtually every student went on to higher ed, although many don\u2019t finish and for maybe 40% higher ed meant technical school.If we were comparing to the public high school in the town where my school is located, the list would also include more course offerings and activities. My local public school is roughly the same size as my private school, but the private school is located in a bigger town that has a public high school maybe three times larger. This was not the choice my parents faced, though.So, my broad generalizations would be: Private schools are often better, because they can kick the problem students out, and aren\u2019t forced to spend resources on the high-need kids.Public schools can often offer a wider range of stuff compared to a particular private school.What decision is best for your kid depends mostly on where you live. If you live in Chicago, you wouldn\u2019t have asked (you would already know you\u2019re sending your kid to private school). So give us more details if you want a better answer.Finally, I should mention that I think in my case my parents really made the best choice for me. I ended up attending the University of Chicago for college, and I don\u2019t think that would have happened had I stayed in public school. Being a Chicago alum is probably the biggest external factor that has shaped my life. ",

            "answer_text": "As you can see in the many answers from all over the world, experiences vary wildly with both public and private schools if you look worldwide. Even in the USA schools vary considerably. This is why: Private schools vary greatly depending on where you live, how much you can afford to spend, and what you are hoping to gain or avoid.Public schools very greatly depending on where you live and what you are hoping to gain or avoid.Measuring education is a big mess depending on what you are hoping to gain or avoid. In the USA public school effectiveness is mostly measured by test scores. Test scores might not be your idea of what makes a school good or bad but it is the leading indicator used when you read about \u201csuccessful\u201d or \u201cineffective\u201d schools. It is possible to attend a school with a great deal to offer in terms of variety of courses, diversity of students, background and enthusiasm of teachers, reasonable class sizes, and if test scores are lower than other schools without those things, your school will be called less successful. Private schools (and many charters) may choose to take these tests but are not mandated to do so. So if you wanted to rank student achievement based on tests, you would not find much conclusive data. Studies that have tried to compare students across private, charter, and public schools have varied results because the measuring sticks do not have equal units of measure. In many cases researchers have found that if you compare children from a similar economic and cultural backgrounds, the private and charter school students do no better than public school students and sometimes worse. HOWEVER, I would argue that the variants between private and charter schools, in particular, are so large that these broad studies are rather useless. It would be like comparing animal speeds across continents. The cheetah speed would be averaged out with the sloth and your data would be silly. Charters and private schools offer much more variety than public schools. In terms of teacher education, elite expensive private schools often have teachers with higher credentials or degrees, however many religious and less affluent private schools have teachers without teaching credentials and without higher degrees, it all depends on the school. Many private schools have amazing resources from donations, however I have also boxed up old textbooks from my public school because a local private school has purchased them. Bottom line, know that US private and charter schools vary greatly. Private and charter schools are all over the place in terms of what they offer and how good they are at it. US public schools are more consistent in terms of staffing and resources, although this varies from state to state. Public schools will most often be ranked specifically through test score results. Ask yourself what you want your child to experience in school. Make a list, prioritize your list. Then visit your local schools, public and private, and see which are most likely to give her the experiences you want for her (and that you can afford). ",

            "answer_text": "I attended a public primary school and attended a public high school for 2 years whilst hating every second of it, so after 2 years of begging, my parents moved me to a private school, which I still attend! For me, this was quite a large change in my life. For starters, my current (Private) school is A LOT bigger and more green (more trees and plants, grass) while my public school looked small, old and dull. The homework was a very big thing as well. I was used to be given homework only a few times a week, but in this private school I\u2019m being given homework every single day for almost every single subject. Not to mention the work is hard and we learn A LOT. I found that teachers could also do their job a lot better in this school. Assessments would be hell. I was used to getting straight A\u2019s and I expected myself to do the same when I moved, but I ended up being a straight C student. Although the teachers do their jobs better, they do it too well and mark very hardly. In my public school we\u2019d only have 4 assignments at the same time, but I was very shocked to realise that I had 10 assignments at the same time in just the first term of school! Same goes with tests- tests in my public school compared to private school were like kindgarden tests. You will have tests and assignments, sometimes on the same day or right after the next day. It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep track of unless you keep a little school diary (which was given to us) or schedule. Uniform rules are super strict in this school. We will be sent on Tuesday afternoon detentions (yes, they\u2019re allowed to do that here!) if our dresses are too short, our hair isn\u2019t tied up, we wear the wrong socks, we wear too much jewellery. The school have actually brought in this new rule saying that we must ONLY use black or dark-blue hair ties now, and I\u2019ve already gotten in trouble for my lovely neon hair tie. Not to mention, the uniform costs A LOT. We have a summer and winter uniform along with compulsory blazer, school bag, school socks (for the 2 different seasons!) and so much more junk. It cost over $1000 for my uniform which is A LOT over my public school fees. In fact, that\u2019s almost the cost of my 2 years of education in that public school. The cost of my school was about 20 times more expensive than my public ones and they increase over each year. They\u2019re about the same price as university fees at the 2nd best university in Australia! Luckily my family are over-average income earners, but obviously other families aren\u2019t. The students would be about the same. You\u2019d have the \u201cpopular (bitchy)\u201d people and the \u201cnormal\u201d people. Luckily there is a lot less bullying in our school and no discrimination unlike my public school, but there are some students in my class who are VERY badly behaved towards the teacher and super annoying and loud. Overall, do I think private school is a lot better than public. I definitely got a better education and learnt more in one year than I have over the past 2 years in my public school. The teachers are better and the school grounds are 100% better (not to mention we got lockers in this school). So yes, I would definitely send my child to a private school and I definitely recommend it. However keep in mind (if you are a low income family) that school fees are a lot more expensive than public school fees, and those fees don\u2019t include textbooks, uniform, camps and possibly some excursions. There are also many strict rules, and if you break them you will be on a detention straight away, not to mention, HEAPS of stress. So to summarise it all up: Definitely send your child to a private school, but only if you\u2019re certain you can pay ALL the fees, your child\u2019s organisation skills are PERFECT and they can handle stress very well.

            "answer_text": "No. Private school is just school-er than public school. If you like that, that's fine. But most kids don't, and that's what this is about.The best school is, hear me out, the opposite of school.Here's why: our school system is mandatory. Strict. One may even say totalitarian. Tough rules, boring classes, and no actual learning. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. Similarly, you can teach a student but you can't make them learn. Because they aren't interested. Because school is seen as this hell-like prison, and rightly so.My idea of a perfect school is based off of anarchism. If you don't make the students learn, we'll get bored and decide to learn. And then, you help them. If it's optional, and tailored to help them rather than make them think alike (or recite alike), it will be much better.______So how exactly would my anarchist school work? Students have to attend for at least four hours a day and at least 25 a week, anytime between the hours of 8:00 am and 6:00 pm. They can choose how early to get up and how late to leave. You could come at noon and stay till four. You could come at eight and stay till noon. You could do more than the required hours, from ten to five. They still have to come, but they don't have to spend six and a half hours a day from 8 to 2:30. They feel freer.The classes, then, would be 55 minutes long, with 5 minutes in between, to make scheduling easier. Teachers would teach one class at a time, alternating between two classes. For example, a math teacher could teach algebra from 8-9, geometry from 9-10, algebra 10-11, geometry 11-12, and so on. This part isn't too different from our current school system. This would allow kids to attend whichever classes they like, based on what they were curious about that day. It would inspire them to learn, by choosing what they learn.Now, we have the obstacle of mandatory classes. Get rid of them, mostly. Have each kid take two years of math, two for English, two for social studies, two for science, one for foreign language, and one for health. That is ten. Seeing as all classes are an hour, and students need 25 hours a week, they can have that finished in two years. They need to take at least three years, with a fourth and fifth optional. This will leave them elective classes. They can take extra classes in a subject, or classes in a completely different subject. This way, they still get their basic education without trying to loophole.Also, if they miss any classes, there will be question time in all classes where they can review past or current material (or future material, or material that's only partially related). This will make up the last 25 minutes of class.Homework will be optional. No homework grades. Teachers can give them 'extracurricular guidance' which would be similar to homework, but would be more of a review than a practice. They don't have to do it, this is just to help point them in the right direction if they decide to try more outside of school, which I think would be much more likely in this environment.Tests? All oral, non-formal tests. This will be more like a debate. They bounce around concepts and ideas, challenge what they are being taught, and expand their curiosity. They will then rate themselves and each other on how well they understand, and if they don't feel like they understand, their classmates can explain it to them. This will allow for varied viewpoints and different ways of thinking about/understanding a topic.Foreign language will be changed to foreign culture. Not only will we learn, for example, the Spanish language, we will learn about Hispanic history, traditions/customs, and we will analyze the language, looking at how it developed from an older language, in this case Latin, and compare it to similar languages as well as our own. This will help students have a greater appreciation for what they are learning.Classwork will be short, usually in small groups working through problems, learning more as they go. This will, again, open them up to each other's ideas, and build friendships. On occasion, students will be challenged to work on a problem individually, and to explain it to the group, rather than just saying the answer, they will help others understand how they arrived at that answer, and if they are wrong, can understand why.Students will be required to enroll in classes, though not in our understanding. They will choose courses at the beginning of they year that they want to attend most days, to keep up with their requirements and to stay with the class, rather than jumping into geometry halfway through the semester, no idea what's going on. There will, however, be 'condensed classes', which will be no more than five people, and will be on a designated subject, mostly for people who want to learn a part of that subject without enrolling in it. For example, one could be in a condensed history class, and ask the teacher about the Trojan war. The teacher will then explain the Trojan war, and answer any questions, as briefly as possible while also giving you the most prominent information. The teacher will then move on to teach about other people's inquiries, giving you the chance to satisfy your curiosity without the parts unnecessary to what you want to learn, as well as letting you see what others are interested in.And last but not least, what will the classrooms look like? Something like this:http://www.goodworksfurniture.co...orhttps://uttoransen.com/wp-conten...(I hope that worked, I don't have much experience inserting images on Quora)Yes. Outside, with a roof for rain and possibly tarps in case the rain is getting blown by the wind. The walkways will not be covered, but umbrellas will be provided in the same way as the give/take a penny at some cash registers; you take an umbrella from the stand when you leave class and leave it at your next class. Students need fresh air, and many have philosophized that the less connected man is with nature, the less connected he is with his own humanity. Besides, it is much more comfortable and casual to be outside. And just look at that. Students can use their physical energy, and can just go around the gardens during a free hour, if they choose to take a free hour on any given day. Of course, there will be indoor facilities for certain STEM based classes/projects, as well as for weather emergencies or just projects that are better inside. And for security, there will be a gate around the facilities that all students and staff will know the code to, so they can enter/exit whenever they must. Imagine going to school and being able to smell the flowers. Also, it make physical activity easily accessible. There will also be large fields for sports, as well as basketball courts, etc.This would be somewhat expensive to keep up, but after the initial payment, it would be easier. Government funding may not cut it, so advertising may be necessary, but will be limited, and only in certain places, perhaps along walkways.No uniforms, casual dress.https://media.buzzle.com/media/i...______So that is my idea for a change in the school system. Right now, no school is better because the system is wrong. My idea is a work in progress, but I would like to someday test a version of it, and perhaps replace the current system. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it's interesting that you asked Adam and Charlie to answer the question...as, at least in Adam's case, he went to what is arguably the best private school in the US, so he should have some interesting thoughts on the matter. First off, it's only fair to answer this question in an aggregate/statistical sense, as every individual will differ. Overall, I would argue that a good private school is DRASTICALLY better than a good public school. Granted, there are many caveats to this. First, you didn't say \"the best\" private school vs. \"the best\" public school (in which I think there is much less discrepancy). Second, this is a very difficult thing to measure due to the confounding factors usually involved. For example, more affluent families are more likely to send their kids to private schools than more impoverished families. Thus leaving it hard to tell what was the main cause of their success later on in life, the initial affluence or the schooling. Third, you didn't define what metric you really mean when you say \"better.\" Does this mean \"a more worldly experience,\" \"more likely to keep someone out of jail,\" \"measured by future income,\" etc....so I'll just presume we mean a general notion of what's best for the student. Lastly, we should note that there is drastic variation among cities (e.g., in parts of Connecticut the best schools ARE the public ones vs. parts of Los Angeles in which the public schools are more reminiscent of jails). In general, if you look at any one of the MANY longitudinal studies comparing public vs. private across America you'll find that the students going to private schools have much higher incomes, higher levels of happiness, longer life expectancy, lower criminal rates, etc. It's quite possible all of these are due to confounding factors, but just in case they're not, I'd send my kids to private schools (if money was no object).

Private school isn't like that. At all. I was even correcting the teachers when they got something incorrect. Boring. My grades suffered at the end because\u2026 bored. Did I really need to know that crap existed? I don't think so. I finished hs with a poor outlook on people in general. I realised they were mostly awful.

            "answer_text": "Public school teachers are, for the most part, paid fairly. (< $100k is not a king\u2019s ransom in NYC, LA or Chicago, though it will get you by in decent style. Ditto for $50k in rural America where a nice, spacious, 3BR home can be had for less than $150k, and in some regions A LOT less) Given the fact that Mr. Bates and I have had our differences (so much so that he's opted to block me from commenting on his posts), I'm loath to rip private school teachers a new one for fear it'll come off as petty (or worse, insincere). But since, as was pointed out by someone I suspect Mr. Bates greatly admires, \u201cthe facts don't care about your feelings\", here are a few facts: 1: The bar rests pretty high for a teaching position at the vast majority of public schools, and it applies to all applicants. To wit, though a good connection will frequently serve as a tiebreaker, it doesn't provide any actual points. Though a battle between two identical candidates might - nah, will - often be settled by the fact that one has more (or more influential) friends in high places, those friends won't be enough to propel the applicant with a Bachelor's ahead of his rival with a Master's. The faculty at the public high school at which I taught boasted two PhDs and four EdDs among its staff. Of the remainder, 100% either had, or were actively pursuing a graduate degree. Conversely, the total number of PhDs and EdDs at the two private schools at which I taught was zero, and the majority neither had not were pursuing a graduate degree. To be fair, when the first school implemented a tuition reimbursement policy there was a stampede to the nearby college. Hey, post graduate degrees are expensive, and of limited value to a teacher at a private school. (As best I can recall, teachers with a Master's earned a little over 10% more than their counterparts - i.e., enough to pay for your morning trip to Starbucks, assuming you chose a basic coffee, not one of their exotic beverages) * * The bar for a teaching position at all but a select few private schools is for all intents and purposes nonexistent. Please note: I have no cause to doubt that the vast majority of teachers at private school teachers are highly credentialed; my point is that the few that aren't serve to all but guarantee that salaries will be far lower at private schools than at public ones. (\"Your C.V. is extremely impressive, and your salary request is wholly in line with your credentials. The thing is, I just interviewed a candidate who'll do the job for half what your seeking. Sorry\".) Supply and demand coupled with a rigid \"nobody worse than \"x\" works here policy is why private school teachers earn less money than public school teachers. Or, we can borrow from Mr. Bate's analogy and label public school teachers \"limousines\", and private school teachers \"the subway\". If you've ever been to Europe, Canada, or Asia, you know that the bottom rung of the limo ladder is inferior to the top rung of the subway ladder both in terms of opulence and convenience. That said, he typical limo blows the typical subway out of the water. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that education is a human right and that quality education should be provided by the state to every child in the world. In developing countries where 68 million children do not have access to education, it should be the responsibility of taxpapers in developed countries to pay for it.  That said, our current system of what we call state education is one of indoctrination to serve the interests of the state and large corporations, not to serve the social, emotional and intellectual developmental needs of our children.  I feel equally critical on many levels of private schools. These large private institutions listen to a board of advisors that pressures administrators to get children into Ivy League Schools, overemphasizing test prep and academic rigor over supporting the child's natural development.  The ideal system would be where state funds would focus on a) recruiting and training exceptional teachers who were free to use their best judgement to support a child's development, not through common core or other misled state guidelines to assure a base line of mediocrity b) to provide nurturing learning environments for children to learn with these amazing teachers and c) to provide tools and resources to parents to be active members of their children's educations.  The current system is too limited by misguided goals and private interests.  It is many cases nearly impossible to determine what is private and what is public education when public schools in rich neighborhoods are often highly subsidized and those in poor neighborhoods suffer, when public charter schools are corporations that help a few individuals get rich, with little regard to the children. An especially disturbing trend is a certain's company efforts to privatize education in the developing world to what amounts to trapping 60 children at a time in an unwholesome environment and hiring a teacher to lecture at them off a scripted curriculum.  Luckily, our love of our children is stronger than this folly and more and more parents and teachers are saying halt, dropping out of the system all together and starting small, inexpensive schools where children's needs come first.  These children are doing extremely well, far better than the mean at traditional private or public schools and providing a shining example of the kind of education that can take place when it is child-centered. In brief, private and public education are currently owned by large corporations and its time for us to stop footing the bill through our pockets or our tax dollars.  ",

Does this mean the instruction is \u2018better\u2019? Not necessarily. That\u2019s the sell, though. And most everybody buys it. Do these kids score higher on the SAT? Probably, yes. Is all this academic success the fault of the school\u2026ehhh\u2026.no. These kids probably make more in allowance than I do right now. Their parents either don\u2019t work, and can therefore structure their lives around the kids and they can pass down these perspectives and ways of thinking, or the parents work like a motherfucker and are never around and are constantly pushing their kids to do more and more work so the kids have nothing better to do than study and occasionally be bored and do drugs and have sex like in the movie Traffic. Do they get one on one tutors inside or outside of school? Sometimes, yes. They also get to pick like Harvard grad students taking a sabbatical because the parents can pay for them. So they learn how to study and how to think. Some of them have people who they pay a bunch of money to wash their clothes, clean their rooms, buy their groceries. The way some of these schools work is that the teachers give an assignment that is due at the end of the month/quarter/etc and all the information to finish this assignment is in the book, so then what is class time? The teacher reviews the book. But if you\u2019re good at reading and writing then you just read the book and do it and watch porn on your school-provided laptop on mute the rest of the quarter. So how do these kids all get into the ivy league? Smarter? Better brains? More drive? No no no. Grooming. Culture. Money. And then the good high schools are paying these guidance counselors a pretty penny to help the students get into college and game the system, which by the way rich kids already have a boost up because universities want their money and their future patronage. Sometimes they admit minorities. Good publicity. Helps keep the students focused and hungry. Good to elevate these kids. Makes a better experience, probably. ",

            "answer_text": "Edit: Damn it. Will people stop changng the question after I answer it? This new question makes my answer off topic! There is really not much difference between them if they are both day schools \u2014 schools to which you go in the morning and return home each afternoon. There is less time lost in discipline in a private school, so you will have more time for instruction. There are more choices in a public school. They are generally larger with more classes and activities offered. In very expensive private schools one might have some really expert teachers and better equipment and more supplies than in both public and more average private schools. Some magnet public schools and many private schools will require uniforms. Both might have a military presence\u2014 JROTC. The year of construction will have more influence on the architecture than their being public or private. I doubt that the amount of homework would differ. A private school may rely on a nearby public library than an internal library, whereas most every public school has a school library. There are many more parochial schools than private schools. Charter schools are a kind of odd step-child \u2014 private dirctors, but public funding and oversight. There are also differences due to the grade level. Two elementary schools, one public and one private, may have more in common than two secondary schools, one public and one private. I was a public school teacher who attended a parochial elementary and a private secondary school, so I have divided loyalties, but from talking to teachers who are still in the public school, I hear of many more problems than I ever saw when I was in the classroom. If these same problems are in the public schools in your area, a private school would be a better choice, as students in a selective private school will be free of the disruptions caused by obnoxious or insolent students who are usually quickly dismissed from a private school (unless their tuition payment is more important than their disruption). On the other hand, you may not be able to play the sport you want to play or take the advance placement class you want at a smaller private school. There is more of a chance to get to know everyone else in a smaller private school than in a two thousand student public high school, but there will be more chance to find friends like you with more choices. Now if you wish to weigh a public day school with a private boarding school, I can only tell you of my experiences, but I must also report of my shock when a neighborhod parent told me about her son's experiences of a private military boarding school in California a few years ago. His experienes made the school all but incomprehensible to me. There are many influences on schools, but a good teacher is a good teacher wherever he is, and if you are a good student you want the good teachers. There are no doubt good teachers in most any school, so the question may come down to this one: in which kind of school will a good teacher be allowed to teach instead of wasting his and your time in discipline, enforcing silly school rules, and being harassed by administrators and their p.c. / progressive attorneys?

Private schools who administer tests do tend to have higher test scores. However, this does not mean as much as you might think. This is because private schools can expel students who do not do their coursework, are disruptive, or whose parents refuse to be involved. This means that the students who would tend to have low scores are just not there in the private schools. This raises the average test scores in the private schools (and lowers the averages in the public schools where those lower scoring students end up.) The best scoring students in the public schools score just as well as the best scoring students in the private schools who administer tests. In fact, if you control for socioeconomic level, the scores are pretty much the same. Also, notice my disclaimer above\u2014some private schools do not administer the state or national tests. On national test such as the SAT and the ACT, students could register to take them on their own at another school, but the school will not provide any support for such testing. I know of several highly respected private schools where the state tests are given. I also know of several other private schools, such as ones which eschew any curriculum that disagrees with their religious beliefs. The schools do not give the state tests, saying that they are irrelevant. The other thing I will address is more difficult classwork. A student I know transferred from public school to a respected private, religious school. I asked him if the work was harder, and he replied, \u201cNo the work is about the same, but I get lower grades for the same work.\u201d Another student transferred from that same private, religious school. He told me the school had given him and his mother a choice. If he stayed enrolled with them, he would flunk third grade. If he transferred to public school, they would promote him to fourth grade. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Private schools and charter schools are not generally better than public schools. The range of quality of all three vary greatly. The best private schools are, typically, the prep schools in urban areas (some affiliated with universities) and the handful of elite boarding schools. Tuition and fees ranges from perhaps $20,000 for lower grades at the least expensive school (which will be in a cheaper city; you can\u2019t exactly price-shop) to more than $50,000 if you are living at a boarding school. A quick sample indicates that $30\u201335,000 is typical. Parochial schools (mostly Catholic) are much less common than they used to be (even a few decades ago), but they have historically been the cheapest private schools. When they were common, their quality ranged drastically from poor to excellent. These schools almost invariably have religious requirements; students must participate in religious worship and learning, but you don\u2019t necessarily have to be Catholic (or even Christian). Between the two, there\u2019s a range. Many of these schools have extensive financial aid. More public school systems have choices than in the past. Part of this is due to charter schools. I\u2019m not a supporter of corporate-run charter schools, but I won\u2019t condemn charter schools entirely. You can\u2019t compare public vs. private at the K-12 or college level. You have to look at individual schools. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no answer to that question. It\u2019s too broad. Some public schools are amazingly good. Teachers are able to teach and the kids excel. Others are not so fortunate. Some private schools are excellent. The kids get the best education possible while they are taught to think, not just memorize answers. Some other private schools don\u2019t teach modern science or accurate history. Their requirements are just to show up to get a diploma. Many private schools in my state of Texas are not accredited. A non accredited school has no real standards to meet and the diploma isn\u2019t valued much by college admissions officers. But, some public schools are rat holes. They are grey, miserable and depressing. Teachers get burned out quickly and the kids learn how to take advantage of the situation. Some private schools are not really schools at all. The teachers don\u2019t know their subjects and the kids are not expected to accomplish much academically. My cousin, who had very poor reading and writing skills, was hired by her church school as a teacher. None of the other teachers had skills that were any better than hers. I\u2019ve found the main difference is money. If a parent can pay 25K a year for a private education, they are very in tune with the goals the children are expected to meet. Public schools in affluent areas are frequently light years better than schools in the urban inner city. There are exceptions, but I am talking generalities. States that support their educators with funds usually have higher educational standards and kids perform much better than states that starve the public schools. In my state, Texas, education isn\u2019t universally respected. Sometimes it is the exact opposite. The state government mandates rules and regulations but then doesn\u2019t provide the funding to make them happen. Parents can get so caught up in making a living that they don\u2019t have the time, or sometimes the ability, to supervise homework. Employers don\u2019t like to let an employee off in the middle of the day to go to a meeting at their kid\u2019s schools, specially if that parent has a low paying by- the- hour job. Therefore, the parent doesn\u2019t have a clue about how their child is learning or what they are learning. No parent involvment is one of the main complaints of public school teachers in general. So, the answer is \u2018it depends\u2019. Parents have to investigate the school they are sending their children to everyday very, very carefully. ",

As per the National Center for Education Statistics, 5 million (around 10 percent) of understudies in the U.S. go to tuition based schools. Understudies and guardians may go to non-public school for an assortment of reasons, including religion, the want for single-sex training, and additionally simply encountering a more adaptable educational modules, which is something tuition based schools are known for. Since non-public schools are autonomously subsidized, guardians and watchmen of non-public school understudies pay educational cost, which goes toward financing the school notwithstanding different comforts. Be that as it may, dissimilar to government funded schools, tuition based schools can outline their own particular educational modules, which can be both favorable position and hindrance since this autonomy can encourage bring down measures. Besides, tuition based schools don't need to have ensured educators, which can likewise be hazardous, and if a youngster has uncommon requirements, unique needs programs aren't generally accessible by means of private foundations. Be that as it may, tuition based schools nearly ensure littler class sizes, since they are select and require extraordinary confirmations. Also, as indicated by Niche information on resistance, tuition based schools will probably be tolerating of understudies from minority gatherings and more arranged to battle tormenting with hostile to harassing efforts. Besides, private secondary schools are known to create higher government sanctioned test scores. Public Schools:  About 50 million understudies enlist out in the open rudimentary and optional schools in the United States, as indicated by the National Center for Education Statistics. A great many people may accept that tuition based schools would be hands-down superior to state funded schools in view of their one of a kind offerings and littler classes, however that is not really so. Indeed, some state funded schools, similar to contract schools, offer the advantages of non-public schools (adaptable education al modules, direction exclusion) without the cost of educational cost. Correspondingly, magnet schools are government funded schools that have high scholastic measures and focused affirmation like non-public schools. Be that as it may, not at all like their private partners, government funded schools have bigger class sizes and very little adaptability with regards to educational modules. In addition, they are under more bureaucratic formality with regards to directions and standards. The greatest liven of going to a government funded school over a non-public school is sparing cash. Government funded schools are free\u2014no educational cost required. Additionally, not at all like tuition based schools, government funded schools have an arrangement of norms to hold to, with instructors that are state-guaranteed and custom curriculum programs for understudies that gain uniquely in contrast to others. What's more, notwithstanding Niche clients announcing tuition based schools as additionally tolerating, state funded schools are outstandingly more different, so non-public schools could be estimating resistance on a littler, less exceptional scale.

            "answer_text": "The schools are not run by the government so much as regulated by government. However, the issue is whether public schools are more burdened by bureaucracy than their private school counterparts and thus less efficient. Many private schools pay their teachers less, but are able to reduce class-size and thus the teacher to student ratio. More importantly, private schools benefit from a more homogeneous mix of students, in terms of socio-economic and academic excellence. That is because most students come from more affluent and thus better educated homes, although there are exceptions to that paradigm. The concern is that most students cannot benefit from that private school environment, because tuition costs are out of reach, even if largely subsidized through government assistance in the form of tax breaks and vouchers. While vouchers, in particular, would allow more students to attend these nominally better educational experiences, that is only true for some families, by no means all - not even most. Further, the current state voucher models are not regulated by the states at all. They are not compelled to meet the same standards, meet the same overall student achievement goals and thus can say, \u201cOur traditional students (those originating from more affluent homes) are doing fine, it\u2019s only \u2018those others\u2019 (students from poor and lower middle-class backgrounds) that are failing.\u201d That is precisely the challenge we are trying to satisfy. It is elusive, though. When a child comes home to an empty household, because Mom and/or Dad is out working that second (or even third!) job to make ends meet, who is encouraging and reinforcing the student\u2019s commitment to earnest study? Who is there to help the student tackle thorny math or English homework problems, even if the parent is home, when the parents were not particularly accomplished students themselves? The truth is the private school model explodes when students come with widely diverse backgrounds - even with developmental or physical challenges with which even the best private schools are ill-equipped. This isn\u2019t a knock on private schools, but rather the practical realities of the public school experience. What makes the move to private school supports questionable is it diverts scarce resources away from public instruction, when that instruction serves, in effect, as the \u201ceductor of last resort.\u201d If we are taking away from the public schools, we are further eroding the eductional experience of many students and thus taking away from a large segment of the generations that follow ours.

I believe that the average private school is better than the average public school, but that comes with some important qualifying information. There are many excellent public schools. Unfortunately (and regardless of the criticism from people like Betsy DeVos), adequate funding is essential. Poorly-funded schools have larger class sizes and poor instructional materials. If a student needs even a little bit of individualized attention, it will be difficult for her or him to receive it in a large class. This is exacerbated by the methods used in most states that emphasize local funding. The per-pupil funding in my states is at a 6 to 1 ratio between the best- and worst-funded school districts, and the gap is even wider in other states.Private schools have varying agendas. Many people applaud private schools for their independence and that fact that they are unencumbered by government bureaucracy, but freedom from bureaucracy also means the freedom to pursue goals that, to an objective observer, are not compatible with free inquiry, independent thought, and other goals seen as essential to a quality education. It is important to look at what agencies are used by schools to gain accreditation.Ultimately, it comes down to the teachers. I have many friends who are public school teachers, and I see how hard they work on behalf of their students. There are, I\u2019m sure, some who just mail it in, but people who are motivated to teach in the first place do so out of a desire to make a difference in students\u2019 lives; anyone who isn\u2019t fully dedicated has become discouraged.",

            "answer_text": "The world of education is ever changing but opinions about private versus public school will always be at odds. It is a common assumption that private school education is of a higher quality than public school education, but in my opinion the point of discussion must be your suitability, for which, go through the list of benefits of both Private Schools and Public Schools and decide yourself: Private School Benefits: Class sizes are usually smaller; one-on-one time with students has been proven to improve academic achievementPrivate schools often have a good reputation in global higher education institutions, with many schools boasting a 100 per cent rate of students attending their first choice universityExcellent extracurricular activities or special programs\u2013e.g., arts, sports, clubs, musicChildren who are less assertive or different may miss out on social and leadership opportunities with larger school sizes in public schoolsPublic School Benefits: Like private schools, some public schools offer specialized courses or programs\u2013e.g., math and science, special needs and the artsPublic schools don't usually require prospective students to undergo entrance interviews or tests in order to attend the school, so students may be exposed to a wider range of peopleStudents in public schools are typically grouped according to geographical area, which can be an advantage in terms of out-of-school socializingAlthough there are more ways and financial aid to manage the costs of private school, private schools may not be affordable for some families.Whether you choose a public school or a private school, most critical is finding a school that will provide your child a solid educational foundation for future academic, career and personal success. Ensure that the school emphasizes the well-qualified teachers and smaller class sizes that cater best to students' unique academic and personal strengths and weaknesses. Finally, realize that there are good public schools and good private schools. In the end what matters is choosing a school that best suits your child, as well as the entire family. Once you have done your research, relax! No decision is irreversible, and if the school turns out to be the wrong fit\u2013 geographically, financially, academically or otherwise\u2013 there are plenty more schools to choose from. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the private school and the public school. The thing about the education system is, you can only compare institutions by their outputs if you have equivalent inputs. You almost never do. What most private schools have going for them is almost all the students have family support. They have subtracted the least stable, least nurtured, most-disadvantaged students. Also, their parents tend to be wealthier, which correlates to better outcomes. However, there are plenty of private schools that have underpaid teachers, dogmatic staff, outdated facilities, and parochial (in the pejorative sense) curriculum. Public schools run the gamut. Yes, there are schools that struggle to educate highly diverse populations (very difficult), very disadvantaged students, and make up for big achievement gaps.I went to schools in Silicon Valley that were some of the best in the state. The private schools in my county didn\u2019t publish their average SAT scores, AP test results and such because they would have been worse than some of the public schools nearby\u2026which were free to attend.They were not bad private schools.Charter schools, on average, seem to have worse outcomes than the public schools they draw students from, if you compare students with similar demographics. Some are noble experiments. Some demand a lot more of their students. Some are depraved attempts to plunder the public trough. Most underpay their non-union teachers.The worst try to buy school land at below market rates, then sell it off for massive profits a few years later.",

We do mentally handicapped education very well. We don't do as well with kids on the spectrum and are terrible with kerning disabled kids. My son was in a very exclusive private school because daddy worked there. I pulled him out after 3rd grade because I felt we could do better in public school. He thrived there and was much happier. Daddy also quit, he was happier too. If a kid could win a seat in the International Baccalaureate program in the district, they bailed out of that private school. We have programs for technology, criminal justice, medicine and a wonderful vocational program. We have an excellent economics education program for elementary kids. We have a building exclusively for it called Enterprise Village. I doubt any private school can match us for diversity of programs. That said, some of our individual schools need a lot of work. And we need more moneybut thelegislature in Floriduh would rather cut corporate taxes. So there is my answer\u2014it depends. Side note\u2014when my teaching partner and I took our mentally handicapped kids from a self contained center to the elementary school, three kids were so accepting. No pointing, no insults, just acceptance. And every kid wants that. ",

One needs to find a school district that cares and whose residents support the schools. We live in the suburbs of Boston and our high school, in the early 2000\u2019s was rated as one of the top 100 high schools in the USA (public or private). It had everything that our sons wanted or needed and was about a 1.2 mile walk from our home. It doesn\u2019t get much better than that. Except for me, I attended a brand new public high school with caring and professional teachers a mere 0.5 mile walk from my home and then went on to MIT. And that was a small city in upstate NY and a random school district. Public Schools are Fine. However, some people are stuck in poor school districts to be close to their jobs and if they can get into a not-too expensive Catholic high school they will be OK. The people who send their children to Private high schools, especially Private boarding schools, merely have too much money and need to find things to spend that money on. And then they don\u2019t have to deal with their children until vacations and then they send them to private camps in the Summer anyway. I have seen that over and over again. Public schools are fine as long as you take the time and energy to find a good town/city with a decent school district. ",

The short answer is that they don\u2019t perform as well in general, though there are some private schools that do perform well. The effects of socioeconomic status persist, even within private schools. Not everyone is rich, and that still matters. My own experience was horrid. I attended a small, private, Lutheran school in Texas for two years in third and fourth grades, awaiting transfer to a much better public school. An utterly incompetent, newly minted teacher assigned busy work so that she could write love letters to her boyfriend serving in Vietnam, and had a nervous breakdown as that relationship faced . Not only did they punish me (corporal punishment) for not doing assigned work that was pointless and actually below the appropriate grade level, they taped me to my desk, and falsified my standardized California Achievement Test scores to match their grade book. I learned a great deal about the Bible, to be wary of anyone in authority, and almost nothing else. The one great benefit was that I met a life-long friend, who loves to tell the story about the day I got taped up in class. I wouldn\u2019t have sent my own child there, knowing what I know now. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends upon the schools you are specifically comparing. But, generally, private schools will offer smaller classes and better teacher to student ratios. They are not held back by general \u201ceducation\u201d test criteria, don\u2019t tend to teach to government tests, and in fact, tend to provide better curricula and a better education for their students. I have attended both K-12 and undergraduate and graduate level institutions in both the private and public sectors. At the undergraduate and upper education levels, it really should be a case of choosing the institution with the best program for your area of study - THAT could be private or it could be a public institution. It might be a large and famous university or a small obscure one. But in K-12, if you can get into a private school, your odds are far better in getting a good education than you will find in public education. I would stretch that to cover the first four years of higher education as well (when the student is learning foundational curricula they were not exposed to in K-12. An undergraduate education in a private institution will provide a far better foundation). Here locally, we generally can tell the educational background as per private vs. public of professional workers just by reading a sample of their writing. Private schools and universities tend to focus far more on building basic foundational skills than one sees in public institutions. As we say in my own private university, even engineers and computer science majors learn how to write very well\u2026 Public education does tend to not measure up compared to private forms of study in K-12 and even undergraduate degrees, on the whole.

Socially - they provide wealthy people an opportunity for their children to run shoulders with other wealthy people, these contacts remain important in later life. In the sense of 'who you know'. Looking for a job in a law firm? - hey I went to school with a girl whose dad is a partner in Schuster and Leeming.. Physically - due to private and public funding the facilities are often a lot better at private schools , emmaculate enormous libraries , sporting fields and theatre and musical facilities. They often have amazing exchange programs and excursions to other countries . Money provides more opportunity. Behaviourally - less issues , bad kids can be kicked out. Parents are paying for attendance so there is some added accountability (of course this can be exploited in the opposite way - parent can exert control with money, but I don't think that happens much here) In public schools we manage bad behaviour with restorative practice s and try to change behaviour and we pretty much can't kick kids out of school - we generally don't want to either because that's not how we view education - we believe all kids have a right and deserve the best . Those are the two cents from an Australian public school teacher ",

My son went to two private schools in Switzerland and Austria - one more expensive than the other. But yes, they were sort of good schools. Then he changed the focus from languages to science (chemistry mostly) and went to a public school in Austria, which also was good. Before I fought a hard fight to get official consent for him to go to another elementary school phase 2 in Austria because the one he would have had to go to was very bad, gangs (not like in the USA, just bullies) and terrible stuff happening\u2026 I had to rent an apartment in the other area so we could pull this off. But he (then age 10) always told me that I had saved his life. He had been mortally afraid to go to that other place, being an ExPat, neither Austrian nor from the Balkans or Turkey (where the close groups were from). Schools matter. Teachers matter. But most of all your child matters. My huge advantage was that I had money at that stage in my life and could afford all this. If I had not had money I still might have fought like mad to spare him that horror-school and I want to believe I would have managed. This is Europe, Austria and Switzerland, where all schools are pretty good. You can\u2019t compare that to (for example) the USA, or Egypt (or other Middle Eastern countries) where quality of teachers, amenities and surroundings are only driven by money and priviledge and inequality seems cemented. The bigger the gap between rich and poor is, the more the schools will be affected. However: We know how terrible the \u201cprivate\u201d so called religious schools are in Africa and other poor countries. Or how terrible the boarding schools in England can be with the bullying, cruelty of teachers etc.etc. - I believe in monitoring your child\u2019s teachers, school, board and everything involved in the school experience closely.

So much here depends upon supply and demand: in communities with comparatively high family incomes, one tends to find excellent private and public schools.  Certainly, in the Maryland and Virginia communities close to Washington, DC, for example, there are public schools with wonderful resources and academic programs that rival those of the finest private schools. A massively important intangible in the choice between a top private and public school in the US is a sense of affiliation (I'm not a fan of this one) and the inherent value of networking for the child (this one resonates with me).  Many families send their child to a private school to be a member of that school's brand, for lack of a less commercial descriptor. I know of communities where the public school is of a clearly better quality than the elite private school but the brands can't compare - one chooses the private school just as one chooses the \"right\" tennis club. Yet, the value of building one's network at a private school is and should be a factor for families to consider in choosing a school.  Not much has changed here since the 1950s.  At top private schools in the US, you will attend class and (in boarding schools) live with people who will run corporations and states.  Families see this as having tangible value, which it does. - Aron Aron SolomonCEO of the Q factory and smartswiseTW: @aronsolomon ",

For artistic kids, the school was pretty much heaven. Everyone was serious about their art, they received great training, and they were very supportive of each other. There were students from all over the world. However, the academics left much to be desired. Few of the teachers had credentials, because credentialed teachers can earn more at a public school. The lack of training showed in how the teachers taught. There was also a lot of teacher turn over. Many boarding schools are in isolated areas, so staff tends to move on. The school didn't have any AP classes. It produced average SAT scores. Our local high school is in a poor area, but it has many excellent classes and teachers for those students who want to challenge themselves. They offer all of the AP courses, band, choir, drama, sports. I would have been fine with my kids going there. ",

Bullying in public school was more about something that happened in class or over what someone said. Teachers could be indifferent to bullies but when pressed both parties had their stories heard. Often it was left to parents to deal with. Private schools had bullies that were supported by their religion and their superior wealth - anyone from a disadvantaged background was less likely to be believed. Even the teachers often ignored the bulling. The bullying in private schools was more class religion and race based. Parents were rarely involved. Since I haven\u2019t attended every public and every private school I can only say my own experience. The both suck equally. And they both excel equally. ",

You do not get funding so you don\u2019t get the best facilities, options, up to date text books, and the most important legit teachers. Private schools don\u2019t pay teachers anything. So they can\u2019t get or keep good teachers. So they have to settle for whoever they can get. Which usually means a barely graduated bachelor degree person or some desperate enough anyone they can find. That will leave before the school year is over. Most states you do not need a teaching degree, license, or any degree at all to teach in private schools. Anyone off the street can be a teacher. They don\u2019t have to follow certain curriculum either. I went to private school K-8th. When I got to public high school me and all my classmates were all behind. I do feel that I was not given a proper education in private school. Even to this day I feel behind on things that should be second nature. Even look at my writings. They are littered with grammar errors. I was horrible at math until I took a beginners algebra class in college and taught the basics properly then it clicked. School was a struggle for me, and I thought I just wasn\u2019t smart. It wasn\u2019t until I was 22 and got analyzed by a psychiatrist that had me run multiple IQ tests I had learned I have an above average IQ. So I am a huge advocate for public schools. Because legally they have to teach certain fundamentals from licensed teachers. I wonder if I would of been in a better school setting if things would of been different for me. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. Seriously. A big-name prep school that costs more in tuition than a state university would probably give you a better education than almost any public school. But. I grew up in an area where the public secondary schools ranged in quality from \u201crough\u201d (like mine) to upscale and elite to the point where their graduates who didn\u2019t go to the Ivy Leagues (or at least the Seven Sisters) were an embarrassment. The private schools came close to having the same range. There were a handful of real prep schools, but when my parents balked at my going to our local high school, they weren\u2019t willing to mortgage my college money. Which was fair, but fortunately I convince them to let try the high school, grit and all \u2014 where I got a better education, and certainly a better exposure to reality, than I would have at any of the private schools they were will to pay for. Honestly, they were pretty lame. Some were just dumping grounds for affluent kids who were discipline problems, slackers, or just not very bright. A couple were girl\u2019s schools that were glorified finishing schools. And some were just\u2026 lame. No science labs; no AP courses. (If my parents had been willing to try the local diocesan Catholic high school, it might have been different, but they were a bit bigoted that way.) So, if you\u2019re considering public vs. private, do some research. And talk to your kid. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, I would like to say that I live in the U.K. (funnily enough the term \u2018public schools\u2019 refers to the most prestigious of private schools such as Eton College or Charterhouse - our equivalent of public schools are known as state schools). My dad went to Magdalen College School (a private school) at my age but his elder sister and younger brother went to state schools. My mum went to a private boarding school (Ashford School) - her parents are Sri Lankan and at the time were living across the globe in Indonesia. Both my parents became anaesthetists (my mum switched to medical negligence law 15 years ago) and they expected to send me to private school. I ended up going to the local state school and I think it is one of the best decisions I made. I am a firm believer that private schools do not provide a bette education that state schools and attribute their success to the following reasons: they only select the well performing students anyway. Virtually all now have an entrance exam that you compete with the other students for your place. If you lag behind in school, it\u2019s so difficult to catch up because you don\u2019t understand the concepts behind different explanations.the teachers push the students to do the best that they can achieve. It\u2019s crucial to be reassured that you can go on to do x in your life - private schools give you this confidence.the students going to private schools come from wealthier backgrounds. This means that they are less likely to come from families with divorced parents, they usually come from financially secure families so don\u2019t have to work long hours after school is over to earn money and they have been to nurseries to get them prepared before school starts at age 4/5.*That mostly sums it up overall. No, private schools are not really that much better than public schools, when comparing students from similar backgrounds. I feel like I ought to mention two things: firstly, I live in an area where the state schools are very well performing and that secondly, lower class sizes definitely help students that are struggling (it is easy to overcome this by getting your children tutors for subjects they find difficult!!) *there is evidence of this from the fact that children in wealthier areas of the U.K. spend more hours on their work in the lockdown than those in less well off parts.

            "answer_text": "In Italy private schools have better buildings, better schedules and better canteens but, with rare exceptions, they are considered to be academically inferior to public schools. In public schools there is no mercy, every grade depends on how much you study, if you aren't good enough you have to repeat the year and if you don't study enough it's likely that you will never graduate. The private school is considered a place for those who cannot keep up in public schools or need compliant teachers to get decent grades. It's often chosen only because it offers better schedules to parents who work all day or because it has more flexible schedules for students who have special needs (such as those who are professional sportsmen or work as actors or models) and almost all private school students enter a public school in high school, in order to have a better chance of passing the mandatory national state exam to obtain a diploma. I work in a public elementary school in the suburbs of a small town and among the students there are children of doctors and engineers, the mayor's nephew, a couple of children who work as models in advertising, but also children with disadvantaged families and foreign children that come from all over the world (Morocco, Cape Verde, China, Australia, Brazil, Germany, etc.) and there are no special treatments, you can't have good grades if you don't study. Studies have shown that, despite many advantages, private school students are no better than public school students and that the best university students come from public schools, so in Italy a good student in a public school >>>>>>>> a good student in a private school.

For example, public schools will almost always have RtI and SPED coordinators who work with teachers in teams to examine data, etc. Professional Development at public schools will be implemented constantly. Private schools may be considered better, however, in terms of average student achievement. This achievement most often comes in that private schools have families that can afford the tuition and are, therefore, statistically better educated. These children would have succeeded regardless of where they went. Private schools perhaps are better because they allow stakeholders to actively express faith, viewpoints, etc., that would be otherwise prohibited in public schools. Honestly, as always, I see both sides of this issue. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a kid, I went to a catholic school for my first 5 years then finished in a public school after we moved. I was told that the public school was because the catholic school \u201cwas full\u201d but I learned later that the catholic grade school I was going to was free and included busing. You only paid for high school. My observations after going to both (and knowing people from both) are that the private schools are excellent for people in the middle tier but people needing extra help or above the norm, therefore requiring extra challenges, received better resources in public schools. Fast forward to today and my 2nd child is in her senior year at a catholic school. My reasons were several fold, and my wife\u2019s were probably different. I recognized that the schools of today were more successful in preparation than in my time. I preferred the uniforms as I watched my mother struggle with keeping up with clothing. I preferred an all girls school but was not set against a co-ed school. I do have to say, children today are much more forward and in an all girls school some girls are much more willing (and able) to explore their sexuality than they would have been able to in a co-ed or public school. Education in my mind was at least as good as the public schools. Both of my children took honors and college courses in high school. Their schools offered AP courses in way more flavors than I had heard of before although it concerned me that some colleges are not accepting credits but your PreK does not care about that. I met some of the girls my older child went to school with that received a full ride to Ivy League schools so I cannot see anything lacking in the preparation they provided. Additionally, when my oldest got to college, she started with 9 college credits, putting her ahead of everyone else. Religion seems to be an issue with you. I can honestly say that while their schools matched our religion, I know there are a portion of the students that do not subscribe to Catholicism and some who do not believe in any religion. There is a class each year but I was surprised to see there was a mix of Catholic beliefs and other religions. I personally believe that letting the child make their choices requires education in what is out there. I admit that I did not closely follow the curriculum of the religious education so there may have been slants in particular ways. When my oldest finished high school, I would have bet big money that she would have selected a non-Catholic college but that is not what happened. She is far from overly religious yet 13 years in Catholic schools did not steer her away. Finally, more than once I offered an alternative private school instead of the current one and neither child was interested. I personally did not select the school primarily because it was Catholic and another religion would have sufficed. Do not let this drive your choice unless you visit and they seem heavy handed. Approach it as a non-religious person with the admissions people and see what vibes you get. Other points of consideration. Costs are not cheap but there are needs based scholarships. Just like in college, their idea of needs differs from mine. Paying for private school for two children was a sacrifice which I can honestly say I am happy with. Clothing for school is purchased every year or two (based on care), worn only for school and we gave what was left over back for others that may have had financial challenges precluding them from having what they really needed. Yes, they needed play and dress clothes, just not as many. Yes, there still was competition whenever they could get out of their uniforms. Transportation is a challenge that has to be thought through well before making the choice. Things that they never tell you about are exam days are only for exams and when exams are done, they are expected to vacate the premises. This presented MANY challenges. Teachers\u2019 professional development were often half days because the state counts a half day as a day of school in the required number for the year (thus shortening the days they have to pay staff). Again, transportation challenges. Uber was not cheap but it saved my butt many times! I scheduled the ride, communicated when they were getting picked up and expected a call upon discharge. Add sports and extracurricular activities in and transportation can make your head spin. With 2 children, when they were at different schools due to age differences, transportation was just that much more challenging. Personalities was something I never really thought about in private school folks. I have met plenty of kids that are not people I would want to associate with because they have an entitled personality. We have strived to avoid this in our children. Furthermore, I went to a public school in a pretty well to do suburb and the same types of people were there. This is a parental management problem in my book. Teach children how to act and who to steer clear of and their life will be easier. I do have one warning though. Do not plan to switch back and forth. I know some students who went from Catholic to public and/or the other. I was surprised to hear that private school students learned more in some areas and less in others so connecting the two can be troublesome. Make your choice and stick with it. ",

Level of education in private schools and government schools vary across locations. This answer tries to evaluate private and government schools on an aggregate level. Good performance of schools can be due to factors outside the purview of schools such as the education of parents, tuition classes, home environment, employment opportunities etc.[3] ASER 2016 showed that children\u2019s basic mathematics skills were directly related to the affluence level of the family.[4] In this answer, it is assumed that the good performance of schools is only because of the resources and practices of schools. A- Count of private schools vs government schools- Figure[5]  Private schools account for 14% of total schools in rural areas while for 48% in urban areas. This is due to the presence of the primary government schools in almost all villages. B -Resources in private and govt. schools - Figure [6]  PvtU- Private unaided schools, GA- Govt. aided schoolsPrivate schools perform better on all fronts except in case of the library. C- Teachers in private and govt. schools: 1 -Single teacher schools- School where only one teacher is available. It means that only one teacher is responsible for teaching, administrative work, mid-day meal etc. Due to too much work, students will not get the required attention from the teacher. 8% of government schools are single teacher schools while 3% of private schools are single teacher schools.[7] One of the reasons for high single teacher schools in govt. schools\u2019 category is that the school is opened in a very remote location where the number of students is also very less. 2- Teacher\u2019s qualification- Figure[8]  Private schools have more qualified teachers on an aggregate level. D -Results in private and govt. schools- Figure[9]  Above data shows that private school perform better (assuming 10th class result to be representative of actual performance) than government schools across all categories. It affirms that though there may be other reasons for the good performance of schools, ownership type of school is also one of the major factors. Another important thing, as seen in the data general category students studying in Govt. schools outperform SC/ST category students studying in private schools. This shows how class and family background affects the performance of students. ______________________________________ On account of resources, teachers and results (class 10th) it can be said that private schools outperformed government schools on an aggregate level. \u00a00:00-0:30 Footnotes[1] Government of India Web Directory[2] No. of villages by states & union territories(in 2001 and 1991 censuses)[3] http://Factors Influencing the Student\u2019s Academic Performance in Secondary Schools in India Dr. Radhika Kapur[4] How privilege shapes learning outcomes in India[5] http://udise.in/Downloads/Publications/Documents/Flash_Statistics_on_School_Education-2016-17.pdf [6] http://udise.in/Downloads/Publications/Documents/Flash_Statistics_on_School_Education-2016-17.pdf [7] http://udise.in/Downloads/Publications/Documents/Flash_Statistics_on_School_Education-2016-17.pdf [8] http://udise.in/Downloads/Publications/Documents/Flash_Statistics_on_School_Education-2016-17.pdf [9] http://udise.in/Downloads/Publications/Documents/Flash_Statistics_on_School_Education-2016-17.pdf ",

The quality of public schools varies widely in the United States; where I was raised, in eastern Iowa, we had some of the best public schools in the country. When I transferred from private Catholic school to public school in Cedar Rapids, I was behind in math. The public high school I attended was superior than the local Catholic school in terms of the wide variety of classes you could take, as well as having far more advanced placement classes and extracurricular activities. Further, I was horribly bullied in the snotty Catholic school I attended, but when I switched to public school, I was able to actually make friends. I also feel strongly that a Catholic education is detrimental- I\u2019m now an atheist, but it took a long time to get a lot of that nonsense out of my head. ",

            "answer_text": "There are advantages to both and downsides to both. I had my son in private preschool. It was a very short day, 3 days a week. Very small teacher/student ratio. It was of course more expensive than a public school prek. But I personally feel he learned just as much if not MORE in the 9 hrs a week as the public school kids did in the 35 hr week public school. But like I said it cost too much for full day tuition. I had him enrolled in public school for kindergarten (Texas). All of a sudden it seemed this very bright, intelligent, loving child was getting in trouble. Not really bad behavior but excitable, active, difficulty blending in socially. This continued through 4th grade. In public school the rule was \u201czero tolerance \u201c you cause the teacher's too much time or energy you get in-school or after-school suspension. In intermediate school (5th grade) it got worse to the point I took him out of public school and back to the private Christian school. His grade (5th) had only 8 students total. Any student interaction issues were handled immediately by the teacher between the involved students as a learning opportunity. After 1 \u00bd years we had to move to a different state due to a life event. Again back to public school and some interpersonal issues but not as bad as elementary school was. This school was much better at dealing with his issues. His first day of school (after Christmas break) the teacher handed out a short list of spelling word. My son looked at the list, handed it back to the teacher and said those were baby words and he wanted harder words to spell!!! She called and talked to me about it and had him tested by the specialist at the school who said he was (at 6th grade) a college level in reading, writing, vocabulary, spelling, grammar and editing. I could have told them all this as he had written his own \u201cbooks\u201d since he was in 2nd grade!!! I had saved them and brought them to the school to show them!!! Sadly, they never provided him with the harder work he requested. He did finally improve socially in high school when he joined JROTC and ended up in 12th grade in second in command of his chapter. All this to say public school in my personal experience has overcrowded classrooms, not enough attention to figure out how to help a child.not even realize he's beyond bright and help them not constantly punish to the point they hate school. On the otherhand public school provides opportunitirs for extracurriculars and clubs. Depending on the Private school you will most likely get lower student/teacher ratio, more individualized education and discipline (not a one size fits all). Also in our experience a much better curriculum and less discipline problems from all the kids. (Tattling, disrespecting other students and teachers, no bullying). ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on a wide variety of factors. Generally speaking, a school can only be as good as the administrators and parents who support it. A study once showed the factors that contributed to a public school's high test scores. An interesting find was the average of parents having advanced degrees in one neighborhood as compared to another. A cycle is hard to break and success builds success. Better educated and informed parents are more demanding of school staff and more likely to be active in reform, able to financially support programs, and often have more time to devote to volunteering at the school. It doesnt mean they are smarter or that they care more about education \u2026it just means they are more available, especially financially. Parents can form a super strong network where they supplement school programs not paid for by the state. I taught for years at a great public school. When I first began there, most of the neighborhood kids attended private school. By the time I retired 25 years later, the school was razed and rebuilt, had state of the art technology, a beautiful school outdoor garden learning environment, a track and beautiful playground and continual high ratings. The parents were the force that turned the school around. Great teachers came and stayed. Private schools can be excellent too, but my point is that if parents are reluctant to spend big bucks on tuiton, they can work together to create a private school environment in a public school setting.

The results are evident: 30 years ago, America was the leader in quantity and quality of high school diplomas. Today, our nation is ranked 36th in the world.High schools are not preparing students with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel after graduation. Only 1 in 4 high school students graduate college-ready in the 4 core subjects of English, Reading, Math and Science.Private Schools on the other hand:Private schools are more responsive to parents. Over 78 percent of parents who send their kids to private schools are happy with the way the teachers and staff interact with them. Of parents who send their kids to assigned public schools, 49 percent are happy.For parents who send their kids to private schools, 80 percent are happy with the academic standards. For public schools, 56 percent of parents are happy with the academic standards.In 2004, 28 percent of private school students progressed through the science pipeline to the highest level compared to 18 percent of public school students. Again, if you look at absolute numbers, more public school students reached that level, though they were less likely.",

In Quebec, there is some government support for private schools and a comparatively high proportion of students attend independent schools in the province - in comparison to other provinces. (Quebec ranks very highly in comparative student performance - so government support for independent schools does not result in an educational Armageddon - quite the converse!) The fees and expenses for my school are now approximately $22,000. The bulk of this is for activities and meals. Only $4,400 is for actual tuition.So what do you get:- everything is covered for sports and activities (equipment, coaching, transportation) [In comparison, the costs and transportation duties for public school or other sports and activities fall on the parents.]- first class facilities - non-unionized teachers who manage to be professional without taking every third Friday off for 'PA' days ",

            "answer_text": "There is an excellent article by Spengler in Asia Times, \u201cHow America made its children crazy\u201d It makes for interesting though depressing reading but will provide some context to this answer. While I cannot speak for Japan, China or other Asian countries, I can at best describe my experience with Indian School system. With India, the debate about school system was never about cost or social engineering but more about which schools have good facilities. Naturally, Private schools with a much more localised management were far more rapid in their decision making process and had the money to invest in resources. With public schools, the request for funds takes years to climb up the decision making ladder and concepts are already obsolete before they are put into practice. But the debate never ventured into student discipline. The constant debate about the benefits of Private or Public schools with regards to Students' academic performance and discipline seems to be an inherent \"First World\" problem and exclusively a Western one at that. If I am correct, USA had a mixture of Private and Public school since its inception with varying degrees of investment in both. This is country that developed weapons of war, automotive and aerospace technology and many others and not all inventors and scientists had the benefit of private schooling. So what changed? Through the 60s with socialist and \"psychological studies\" snake oil being hawked around, corporal punishment, respect if not reverence for the Teacher and academic achievement as a virtue was slowly abraded away. Many erudite answers have already shown students playing truant in class while it is still in progress, teachers being subject to abuse both verbal and physical and an anti-intellectualism that is inherent in left-wing classrooms. Decrease in academics, unemployability and steady erosion of Nations progress through its roots is not exclusive from such negative environment. In India, student concentration was enforced not with Ritalin or detention but with the cane and a three foot long one at that. Yes I faced the cane or rather my \"rear-end\" did. Yet I never turned to crime other than the occasional parking ticket nor was I throwing puppies off the roof. so all the talk of \"corporal punishment\" creating \"career criminals\" is poppycock. Combine such lack of discipline with incredibly poor ideas about technical education and one has a recipe for disaster. While working in the office in Australia, making coffee in the Kitchen, I would often come across \"Bake Sales\". A school child would have made cookies with his or her pocket money and would be hoping to make some more to buy an ipad. Reason for the same; The school wants each child to have an ipad so they can \"learn\" better. There is nothing a child is going to learn on an iPad that he or she cannot learn on a piece of paper with a pencil and an eraser. And their brain-hand coordination is much better too. Wondering how we managed in the \"Pre-Ipad\" days, my mind wandered to my own experience while studying in India. The school I studied in did have computers, desktops as we call them now. Back in mid 90s, such systems would have cost 25,000 in todays dollars but the school had sufficient to allow students to practice programming or coding as Westerners term those. But did we start programming straight away, certainly not. Even a simple problem like A+B=C was broken down into an \"algorithm\", a flow chart and finally BASIC program. As we progressed, the formulas got more and more complex, like setting matrix multiplication to a BASIC program. It was both fun and stressful especially during examination when you had to debug a program which you though was airtight. Not fun when you have only 60 minutes to debug. So what is the core lesson? Any culture where education and academic achievement comes second to social engineering is a culture that would soon run aground. We are in an era where individual skill, knowledge and hard labour in STEM sciences make all the difference in national prosperity. When a Teacher is elevated to the status of a demigod who must be respected and obeyed, the student realises early on it is their word against the teacher and the teacher wins. I feared the teacher and even more, feared the outcome if my parents came to know I was spanked at school for being truant. Such respect naturally permeates our academic performance as well. Of course, are there mediocre students, yes, Are there \"about average\" performers, yes. But do all of us stretch brain and sinew to learn extra. That made all the difference. ",

            "answer_text": "My family and I live in Taiwan; our children are Eurasian. They go to a private school for a variety of reasons. Kindergarten (K1 to K3): our local public KG has terrible facilities: it is one block with two classrooms, no outdoor play area, unless you count the public park next to it, which is not enclosed so kids could easily run onto the road or get bitten by a stray dog. Besides, spaces are limited and you must sign up while pregnant i believe. The private KG , OTH, has lovely facilities and is located inside the campus of the university where we work. The children go on walks every week, to the farm, to the little lake, etc. It is a much nicer environment. Primary school: Grades 1 and 2 in public schools have class only in the morning until 1pm. Then the kids must go home, but we, the parents work. So what happens to the children? Sending them to a cram school (private) or paying for daycare kind of beats the whole \u201cfree\u201d part of public school. Private schools have classes or organise other activities (sports, arts, etc.) until 4pm. Classes are smaller - 30 students per class in private school v. 45 in public ones at primary level, and 45\u201350 students per class v. 60\u201370 at secondary level. Outside the capital of Taipei, foreign students and / or mixed ethnicity students are regularly discriminated against or singled out in public schools. In their private school, the teachers would not get mad when i wrote notes telling them the amount of homework was excessive and thus i had instructed my daughter(s) not to finish it all. The private school my girls attend has a good English teaching program, around 2 periods per day for a total of 8hrs per week, starting in KG, with qualified native speakers. Public schools offer only 1hour per week. My two elder daughters who are now in senior high are tri-lingual and master English as well as Mandarin. Those are the main reasons. ",

The last year in that school for both kids was really sub-par.

Both my girls said that they preferred their public school educations. My kids have also known peers who attended well-known private schools such as St. Ann\u2019s (downtown Brooklyn). One of the things they found out about private school kids is that the kids do a lot more drugs. They have the money to do it, but they don\u2019t get arrested for getting wasted. Overall, I think that the private school experience can be very crappy. But the people who make their livings there, or who swear by them, will spin the experience as lovely and amazing. BTW some of the worst, longest-lived cases of sexual abuse at schools have been in NY private schools such as Packer and Horace Mann. ",

Principals have real authority over staff and students, in public schools it is nearly impossible to suspend or expell a violent student. In private schools students are \u201c moved on \u201c for poor results. Staff who under perform are also asked to leave. Staff are payed substantially better and class sizes are generally much lower. Staff are rarely asked to teach outside their speciality area this alone makes a huge difference to results ",

Essentially, it comes down to money, and, unfortunately, many of the best public schools are in the wealthiest areas because of how schools are funded. That means more resources to devote to each student. The benefit of private schools is that you are directly paying them. It is your choice (as long as they want you) which one you choose, meaning you have more control over what sort of environment the student is in, and because they charge quite a sum, that means more money to devote to each student, usually. This leads to smaller class sizes, more staff to provide individualized attention, more extracurriculars and academic programs, and other opportunities. It\u2019s factors like the above that should contribute to your decision in choice of school, it\u2019s just that private schools may be more likely to have those elements because that\u2019s what people are paying for. You can\u2019t command 10\u201350K a year if you don\u2019t deliver. ",

The private school emphasized thought, it encouraged the students while holding them accountable and it had a world view where education is important for more than just a job. My daughter's good public school had adequate teachers, poor administrators, emphasized production over depth, had too many adults who did not believe in the students and were almost gleeful when the kids failed. BTW she was National Honors society and had a college merit scholarship. Even she saw the difference. Now not every private school is good and perhaps there are many public schools who prepare their students for life and not just a job, but that is not what I have seen. ",

Okay, so Sally went to private school K-9 and then transferred to a public school. While she had been happy and high achieving in her private school years, the sudden change to a moody underachiever must have been the public school, right? We don\u2019t know what would have happened if there had been no change. And private schools quickly tell you about wonderful outcomes; no one necessarily digs any deeper. A public high school in Washington DC boasted that all of its graduates had been accepted for college. (Private schools do this too.) in the case of a public school, however, this sent reporters looking for how this result had been achieved. It turned out that the local open-admissions community colleges waived application fees. Every student was given an application and help to complete it. The applications were then sent in. And good luck getting standardized test results from a private school. They\u2019ll show you their lovely campus, their eminently qualified faculty, their distinguished alumni, but their student don\u2019t participate in state assessments. ",

            "answer_text": "NOTE: in the UK public and private schools are basically the same thing ( I googled it because I wondered about it before). In the UK- it\u2019s at public and private schools that you have to pay for but state schools are free. The definitions of each are as follows: private school noun BRITISH an independent school supported wholly by the payment of fees. Public school BRITISH a private fee-paying secondary school, especially one for boarders state school noun BRITISH a school that is funded and controlled by the state and for which no fees are charged. Anyway, I will get back to the point and answer your question. DISCLAIMER: not everything is the same as my experience and a lot of it is coming from a personal view so I will put a factual conclusion at the bottom. I have been to all 3 types of schools and I am currently still at one of those schools so I hope I am qualified enough to answer this question (from a pupils perspective that is). However, I will have to write a very long answer in order to feel that I have answered this question fully. My mother originally is from Oxfordshire and is very posh and my father is from Sheffield and isn\u2019t so posh ( still speaks mainly Queen\u2019s English), so living in somewhere where there is a more colloquial accent and culture was rather different. I had been raised up differently and spoke differently so no wonder when I started school, I wasn\u2019t the most popular child. No, not because I wasn\u2019t friendly and in general a good kid, but because my friends\u2019 parents didn\u2019t want me to be near them because they felt ashamed of not having the same amount of wealth ( yes I know- this was around 2008) which led to bullying. Not only that ,but because in the classroom there were all sorts of abilities and I was capable of being fairly independent, I would usually have my hand up the whole entire lesson waiting for someone to help because all the assistants and teachers helped the less capable. Now I completely understand that the less capable need more help but condering that there were only 4 children needing extra help with 30 in a class, and 3 assistants and 1 teacher in the classroom at one time, I felt that surely their time could be spread around a bit more evenly. This then led to me crying most days in the morning about going to school because I never had anyone to play with, no help in my lessons and being emotionally bullied 24/7 for 3 years. Thank God that my parents pulled me out and put me in a Private school. When I arrived, I was delighted. So many more opportunities and better qualified teachers with only 15 in a class meaning I could have more help and attention. Also, we were put in sets of ability meaning we could all bounce of each other and feel that we were going at the right pace for us. I started playing the oboe which I still play to to this day and love as well as learning how to play hockey, netball, and rounders. The education side to this school was great. However, I must mention that I am a big, shy, ginger girl with no siblings of my own so I was easy to pick on. Again, I was bullied- emotionally. With no other schools that my parents liked in the area we had no other option but to stay there for 6 years in which I was bullied by 4 girls. We went almost every week complaining to the school who did absolutely nothing. It got to the point where I wouldn\u2019t really speak at school unless spoken to because I had been told so many times by those girls that I couldn\u2019t talk because I had said something mean ( AKA sticking up for myself) and then they would all ingnore me or tell me to stop bothering them and go find my friends (who everyone thought were the people bullying me because I had no one else to hang out with ). So I stayed there all the way until I was 12 when we all had to leave. And now finally I am at a Public school. Playing my oboe, in the choir and in a way, in a better place. I love the people and the education. Although I don\u2019t see eye to eye with everyone it\u2019s ok because the people in my house are like sisters to me ( and they are also incredibly popular even though I\u2019m not) so they stop anyone from being foul to me and we stick together. The opportunities here are immense and the school supports you which ever path you decide to take. Unfortunately, GCSEs and the pressure of being a teenager hasn\u2019t helped. And the end result of all that bullying has led to me having bad anxiety ( especially when talking in class and to new people) which I am still fighting. This is my second year here and so far so good ( no to jinx it or anything). So in conclusion I have indeed written a bullet pointed version for those of you wanting me to get straight to the point. State school: big classesAnyone can gonot great opportunitiesonly get funds from the government so very tight budgetPrivate school: have to pay a lot of money to go there but no exams to get ingood opportunitiesgood teachersPublic school: great opportunitieshave to pass numerous exams to get inhigh fees ( can be lowered with scholarships)good teachershappy environmentbig schoolHave more money to spendHope this answers your question, Eleanor ",

And while I only attended a private school for 4 years (K-3), I feel I have had enough of an experience to know for sure. When it comes to education, yes, private schools tend to be much better. Smaller class sizes allow for more personalized instruction. This, in turn, creates more success. in the students, and allows them to grow better. Some of them also offer religious classes. So, education-wise, yes, private schools are head-and-shoulders above public schools. However, in the atmosphere, private schools also have a chance to have a much more toxic environment, at least from the students. The students who are better off can feel like they have the right to do anything to the students who are less wealthy. And, if the families of the wealthier students donate enough money to the school, the administration can be too afraid of losing that funding to do anything about it. So, there are ways where private schools are better than public (such as the education), but some ways that public schools can be better than private (the enviroment/atmosphere). If you wish to get the best of both worlds, you should pick a charter school. -Allons-y! ",

The two are so ridiculously different they are impossible to compare.  My public school is one of the \u201cgood\u201d ones. Compared to others we have ridiculously high funding and amazing outcomes for students. Despite this it's still public school: the biggest way I can describe a difference is that at public school you can be invisible. The main goal of public school is to give everyone a form of education. Maybe it's not great, sometimes kids fall through the cracks, some people don't thrive as much as they could. But the schools don't have the resources to pay attention to each kid. They want overall stats. Private school is a business. As a business, what matters is the customer. That means it's much more individual - they want each customer to be happy, because if they aren't their entire school (read: business) is at stake. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it seems to make the quality of education much better. But it still brings up the argument of why a good education has to be monetized. ",

It is not appropriate, in my opinion, to make a generalization that private schools are better than public schools because there are exceptional public schools that do exist. What makes private schools stand out is the amount of resources their students have because those schools are privately-funded and, thus, have substantially high budget. Due to those high budgets, they can allocate many resources to their students that an otherwise low-budget schools can\u2019t give. Since public schools are funded by the Department of Education in each state in the US, there is only a certain limited amount of money that public schools have. Furthermore, many private schools do vet for teachers that have higher education degrees (e.g Masters/PhD), which definitely influences the learning environment for students. There are many more ways that public and private schools differ. But there are some public schools that are better than private schools. At the end of the day, I argue that if students are motivated enough then they will somehow find the resources to succeed. A school doesn\u2019t necessarily have to define a student. ",

Those who go to private boarding schools get a head start on figuring out college and managing their lives. They learn to develop relationships with faculty. They\u2019ll get more individual attention. But this doesn\u2019t mean all public schools are bad. There are many excellent public schools. I think much success depends upon the parents as it does on the students. Kids who have parents who care about them, who support them, who can provide the support the kids need (be it quiet study places, tutors, extra help, visits to museums, trips, who read to them, who can guide them) will do very well in public school.

            "answer_text": "This is a subject to which I have some authority. I attended a private Catholic school from kindergarten through fifth grade. From sixth grade through 12th grades I attended public school, in the same city and state. (The only reason I changed was we had moved and transportation would be an issue.) When I got to the public school I was shocked, my sixth grade year I nearly failed because they were so far behind my Catholic school! I was completely bored, things we had learned in fourth grade we were learning in sixth grade. I barely squeaked by, as they did not believe in skipping children into grades. Seventh grade wasn\u2019t a lot better, but I things were still behind. (For comparison, my best friend in the same grade, who attended a different public school, in another district, same city and state was also behind me.) Now I see classmates of mine on Facebook from the public school who can\u2019t put sentences together, can\u2019t spell or use punctuation. Who were lifelong public school attendees. While many of my private school classmates are lawyers and doctors. EDIT: In my Catholic School (elementary) there were approximately 50 students in each grade, divided by 2 classes of 25 each. In my class of 50 (who I am still close and in contact with) there are two doctors, two attorneys, three paralegals, and 5 nurses. Whereas in my class of 225 from my public school, there was 1 doctor, no attorneys, 2 nurses, 1 paralegal (which is me.) I am the only one from that Catholic school, besides my sister, to attend this public school district. ",

Philosophy,psychology,film, international travel, etc. these classes and all of our class outings such as to modern dance studios,ballet, the opera, silent films and so much more. It was an incredible enriching experience for all of my class. The work was challenging and taught by Ivy League educated instructors. It opened my eyes to a world that I was mostly unaware of. For that alone, I am most thankful to my parents realizing the extra cost it was for them. I came from a working class family and it was a sacrifice for both of my parents. I am forever grateful. ",

Exceptions are rare but they do exist. Where I grew up the Catholic elementary through junior high schools ran a year behind my public school district. My public school district was in the top few percent among public school districts. That Catholic school district in the exact same location appears to have been in the bottom few percent among Catholic school districts. Being the exception to the rule I bet my example is rare. Also I can name some other private schools near were I grew up that stayed ahead of schools in my district. I didn\u2019t care about any of that. I sucked out all of the knowledge I could and I was not about to let some school stop me. I was at public libraries, university libraries, libraries in nearby counties, you name it. I took French, then German, then finally Russian in parallel with German and more than one AP exam. What I learned is that parental involvement on an individual level beats whatever school you go to.

However, the biggest turnarounds I have heard about in students have been in good private schools. Private schools can and do serve needs public schools simply do not. ",

I personally experienced going to a private highschool and found that the support and resources were significantly better (in BC, Canada). I would say 'better' is not only about the level of funding, but also the focus of the school. My school was very centred on sports which was great and fun, but this limited the classes and opportunity to explore the sciences and applied sciences. Another class I would have liked to take was woodworking, a class that was not offered at my school. Basically, my answer is yes, but I would consider more about a school before judging it. ",

The facilities are just an order of magnitude better. But the there are some bloody good teachers at our local state school. ",

            "answer_text": "A very thought-provoking question, for sure. But before answering, you have to take into account which one is closer to your home. Both have pros and cons, but it is good to remember that our education system has so much more to offer! Charter Schools Let\u2019s not forget about charter schools \u2013 these add so much diversity to our educational landscape. They are also free, with some of them focusing on particular subjects or interests. Are your children particularly interested in a topic studied in depth at a charter school? Then maybe this is the way to go. Homeschooling Families living far from a public or private school may want to homeschool. Parents can become teachers for their children, or hire teachers for some subjects. But online courses are now largely available for homeschoolers. These courses follow the public schools\u2019 curriculum so children get to know a little bit from every subject, but still focusing on the ones they enjoy most. However, parents should make sure that their children get to socialize with other children in different settings. If there is a public school near your home or in the district you live, then you may want your children to attend that public school, and save money for their college education. But if money is not a problem and there is a good private school you\u2019d like to send your kids to, then feel free to do as you please. You shouldn\u2019t fear that your kids may not get the best education. You should better make sure that you prepare them for the real life at home, as well. Your children will make it! Don\u2019t worry ",

Public schools accept any students who live in the school district and in some cases outside of the school district. Otherwise, there are dedicated teachers in both public and private schools that can make a huge difference as well as competent administrators. It really depends on the ability, knowledge, and experience of the staff and the support of the parents to work together to make a successful school. ",

We all know the conditions of our country\u2019s government school and what is necessary to improve school\u2019s conditions yet not being done. Government schools don\u2019t have proper classrooms, seats, blackboard, Playground, Labs, Computer, All private schools must be nationalized and government should own or take on lease by paying the estimated fund to private schools. Teacher faculty, Infrastructure, Toilets, Drinking water, classroom conditions of the schools must be of International level. Government started Right to education act to provide free education till the class 8 which was a great steps towards improving literacy in India. But it is not enough, Government must form monitoring Committee to check quality of teachers, performance of teachers & students, Toilets, Drinking Water, Mid-Day Meal and Public distribution System etc. So just Privatization of Govt Schools and all other Govt Program/Schemes is not the effective solution in India as it contains 70% population which can't afford education in private schools  ",

Public schools vow to educate every child that walks through the door, while most private schools only allow those who can afford the tuition to come inside. Students have opportunities to participate in extra curricular activities that some private schools may not offer. In addition, public schools offer young people a more realistic glimpse of the real world by exposing them to different races and cultures. ",

Private schools get to choose who they let in and parents have to take effort to get their kids into them. As a result, the classes tend to be filled with motivated children of motivated parents. Studies have shown that peers have a larger effect on a child's learning than parents. Thus it would follow that one of the greatest influences you can have on your child is in choosing the child's peer group. I went to an excellent suburban public school district and had a great educational experience where I got to take challenging classes with ambitious peers. At the kindergarten level it's debatable how important this all is, but it becomes more significant at the higher grades. ",

There are some snobby people, but after awhile you get over them. My time in public school was decent, but I did not have the ability to connect with my teacher because there were so many students. Also there are some strange people you encounter that make you a little uncomfortable. So my awnser would be private is much better than public.  ",

Most private schools except the elite pay worse than public, but offer better discipline and smaller classes.  This attracts a certain type of teacher.  Also, all but the very worst school will have at least one very good, maybe excellent, teacher.  All but the very best school will have a bad teacher, or one who isn't right for your student.  Visit the school, sniff the atmosphere, talk to the principal/headmaster and to some teachers.  Ask where their own kids go to school.  There are no guarantees anywhere, but due diligence can help.  And never go into debt to pay for private school; you'll likely need the money for college.  (And even then if your kid learns really, really well through grade 12, college might be free.)   ",

There are more than 1,500 independent K-12 schools in India. In my opinion all schools have their own specification below are the some of them: It depends on the definition of better ... but I think total private schools are more in freedom to help their students. They have fewer students to worry about, first of all, so they can devote their time to making their students successful. Apart from this, they can choose their students, so the private school environment is good. But (by going to both) Do I think teachers are better at private schools? No, teachers do not matter where you go. Public schools are schools for people who can join anybody. Bad effects for your children are provided there. While in private schools the school will choose all those who are accepted in school admission and always ensure that there is a good environment around your child. While private schools ensure that your children are getting friends with the right family background and the right families. Private schools have more power and better teachers because the teachers of the school apply for a job and they compete for a job. The winner will be one of the best teachers for that topic and it will provide your child with a better learning environment. ",

I attended public schools but in an upper middle class environment in what was a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood. The kids were smart and motivated. Everyone went to University most everyone was significantly accomplished. These parents me included all sent our children to parochial private schools. Those few who did not were not in concentrated neighbourhoods and the critical flux of motivated children was dispersed among many schools with fewer achievers in each. Not so in the private schools our kids attended. There the concentration of achievers was there and the competition was significant. Also the work load was brutal. The hours longer and there was homework from senior kindergarten onwards. The ones who went through this all attended university and all graduated near the top of the heap. Our younger one has a 3.9 GPA. They are not messing around. This is school like it was business. ",

Sonoma State University isn't much different from a San Francisco State University, since they are both governed by the CSU system. California has a great UC system (University of California), and UC Berkeley is considered up there with Ivy League. There's no clear-cut winner between state and private.

One thing that can be more reliably counted on is that for-profit private schools are often, though not universally, bad news, as are, of course, any private schools that lack normal accreditation, including those that receive exemptions for \u201creligious reasons\u201d.

Parting with hard earned money is a great incentive to see it is well spent. In the Public system here in Australia, generally you get parents on side but some hand the whole discipline problem over to the teacher and in some cases blame the teacher for the problem. You only have to have two or three such students in a class and a lot of your time is spent in classroom management and paper work cataloguing the problem, instead of teaching. So with smaller classes in the Private system, the outcomes in terms of grades are better. BUT you asked about education, not grades. The two are different. With a lot of extra support in the Private system the students are vulnerable in the outside world, be it university or the workforce. Making your way through the public system is often the better education outcome, long-term. ",
