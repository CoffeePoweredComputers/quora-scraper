            "answer_text": "First, study hard and turn your assignments in on time :}> That goes without thinking, and, as you are already studying, I\u2019ll address below some of the important extra things. Learn how to learn a customer\u2019s technical and economic vocabularies. In a career in IT, knowing how to do this is very important. As part of requirements elicitation this is a critical skill. You need to be able to talk to customers on their own terms. (You also need to talk to the developers on their own terms, but I assume that\u2019s covered in your formal curriculum.) In an IT career, you may well need to do this a number of times. For practice, select an application domain that interests you. Subscribe to the trade literature \u2014 these are the materials that the industry uses to keep track of what\u2019s going on. The trade literature per se is the way commercial activities and developments are rapidly publicized and discussed. The professional literature may be highly specialized and opaque, but there are usually journals with a broader perspective. In medicine, there are the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). In computing it\u2019s Communications of the Association of Computing Machinery (CACM) and IEEE Spectrum. Other professions and trades have similar publications. All have web sites and web publications you should track. Pick an area, explore what\u2019s available, and learn the jargon, the concepts, the leading companies and relevant products, etc. Spend at least a year on this. Then pick a different area and repeat the exploration and learning as your fun extra task for another year.. You are learning a meta skill which you will make use of throughout your career. Secondly, learn how to make Microsoft Office\u2019s components hop through hoops. For example, Excel is the language of MBAs and other managers, and it\u2019s a language you have to learn to use to quickly communicate with customers. Word\u2019s spelling corrector will save your life. But never use the Thesaurus! I assume in your IT studies you\u2019ll learn how to use an IDE and a prototyping/ interface experimenting product. Last comes the hardest part: Learn your native language, and English if that isn\u2019t it, really well. No grammatical errors. Know how to spell and make both reports and screens perfect. During my academic career, this was the commonest complaint from our customers. (Our customers are the people who hire our graduates, and those graduates are our product.) Know the difference between \u201caffect\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d, among \u201cit\u201d, \u201cits\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s\u201d, that \u201cbut also\u201d has to follow \u201cnot only\u201d. Golly, I sound just like a high school English teacher. But here\u2019s the truth: they were right. Most IT graduates are functionally illiterate. This especially shows up on screens they specify/ prototype and in proposals and specifications. Yes, everybody is noticing your mistakes and laughing at you. I can\u2019t resist ending this by saying, \u201cgo forth and sin no more!\u201d ",
