            "answer_text": "Is the US education system the worst in the world? Absolutely not. There are places in the world where education itself is not valued. What the US has in place is better than those backwaters. Is it bad? Speaking as a product of that system and the parent of a grown adult who recently went through it, yes it is. Just because something is expensive doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any good. Americans spend top dollar on their health care system yet it too is mediocre and growing worse everyday. The problems with the US education system can be boiled down to two issues: Bureaucracy and orthodoxy. American schools spend a lot of money on salaries for people who don\u2019t teach students, and that number has been growing fast. \u201cThe number of non-academic administrative and professional employees at U.S. colleges and universities has more than doubled in the last 25 years, vastly outpacing the growth in the number of students or faculty, according to an analysis of federal figures.\u201d 'Link' Bureaucracies by nature become self-sustaining. They resist change and hoard resources in order to protect themselves and grow. Their single goal is self-preservation, not teaching students. My son attended 5 public schools before he graduated high school. One of the schools had a \u201cself-esteem coordinator.\u201d I thought this was a joke but I discovered that this person wasn\u2019t a guidance counselor. Those were present as well in the school. Her role seemed to be like school psychologist. This at a rural North Carolina high school supported by the taxes of the 3,500 resident town and 60,000 resident county. One of my sisters retired as a public school teacher in my hometown. In the last years she had struggled with a growing bureaucracy including teaching evaluators and lesson planners who micromanaged her lessons but did not directly teach the students. Many of these were high paid consultants brought in by her district who knew nothing about the students nor respected her own training and experience. Her school began to function similar to an executive administration. A new principal would bring in new people and ideas, sidelining those associated with the outgoing principal. There was little continuity and worse, blatant age discrimination towards the older teachers. Much of her time began to be mired in administrative duties that had nothing to do with the lesson plans, grades and other student-facing responsibilities. Education has also become increasingly ideological. Teachers and administrators view education as secondary to solving various social issues. To support this mission education has become increasingly authoritarian with minority viewpoints and free speech actively attacked in order to achieve these broader social goals. Instead of teaching students how to think for themselves educators and administrators indoctrinate students in what to think. In this view any alternate viewpoint that challenges current orthodoxy is silenced as heretical and those espousing those views portrayed as dangerous heretics. The situation is not unlike religious thinking prior to The Enlightenment. It\u2019s ironic that this movement which started back in the 1970s to encourage tolerance of politically unpopular views has become like its opponent: closed minded and intolerant of dissent. American schools were once some of the best in the world, but growing bureaucratization and adherence to orthodoxy have weakened their status. For foreign nationals considering educating their children here I would weigh my options carefully. ",

            "answer_text": "So\u2026 I go to a British private school, so I\u2019ll be adding my perspective here. Note that I have no clue, at all, on American schools. I\u2019ll be writing on what I think they are. Stupid examinations. From what I know, the tests there are quite simple, and mostly composed of multiple choice. That\u2019s not really helpful, whilst it is easier to get higher grades, it\u2019s not going to help you on later.Unqualified Teachers. I don\u2019t notice this being prevalent just in the US, but many regions. Teachers cannot teach. They cannot transfer their knowledge into a person that has no previous experience.Weird courses. Do you guys call it courses? Anyways, back to the point. I\u2019ve heard something about home economics? Really? What I hear of it, it is pretty useless and a waste of time. Neither do I know any more pointless courses, or irrational courses, but it\u2019s insanely wild to have things like that, imo.Ease. I don\u2019t notice anything that challenging in a normal curriculum of a US school. Sure, when you get to something like the APs, similar to our A-Levels, I can see where that would be going. But usually, they seem pretty damn easy, from what I\u2019ve seen.Atmosphere. I\u2019m not mocking the education here now, I\u2019m mocking the schools. Drugs, intimacy, rudeness, I see them all in the US schools. Yes, it is also common amongst other schools, but it is one example.Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but all of my speculations and opinions are fed off by the media. I\u2019ve never been to a US school. Speaking of US, I\u2019ve never even been there. ",
