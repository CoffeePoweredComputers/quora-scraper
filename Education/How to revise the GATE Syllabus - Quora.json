            "answer_text": "Making sure you are well prepared for an exam is the best way to maximize success. Part of the preparation process will involve creating revision notes that cover topics that will be addressed in your exams. The best thing which I did was enroll in MADE EASY GATE online test series. This kept me on my toes during the entire year of preparation for GATE exam, and will also serve the purpose of evaluating your preparation with respect to the competition. Different people have different timelines. Some can dedicate 10 hours a day while some can only give 2 hours. Some study at night, others during day time. Some dedicate 7 days a week while some can only spare 2 days. So, it\u2019s important to understand how much time you can take out for GATE preparation consistently and then devise the strategy. You can prepare your scheduled subject in the week and revise the already covered subjects on the weekends. Many times you will feel bored with a subject. Then you can start revising the already covered subjects using a standard book. Revision is one of the important parts of the GATE preparation. So, keep weekends for revision or dedicate a small amount of time daily for revision. I would suggest you do wholesome revision including numerical revisions and formulae. The syllabus of the GATE exam is very wide and it takes a lot of time to revise everything. Revise on a regular basis so that you don't forget and you will be able to save much of your time by timely regular revisions. Revise what you study on a daily basis instead of piling up and keeping long term revision plans. Frequent revisions save a lot of time and help in building a strong conceptual base. Make charts or notes to keep a track of formulas for last-minute revisions. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a list of things that will surely guide you through the revision \u2013 Make short notes - If you develop the habit of writing and jotting down a few key concepts from every topic that you study and read, it will help you tremendously to revise GATE subjects. Short notes can be read later when your memory of the concept is getting blurred.Carefully make revision points - While reading a topic, you should carefully determine important points of that concept. The best way to do so is to first focus on understanding the relevant topic. Once your concepts are clear, then you should make a summary of the same by jotting down all the important key points/ steps that would enable your understanding of the same topic again.Revision notes may contain important terminology, definitions, formulas, examples - It is important that you include important terminology, definitions, formulas, examples etc. in your revision notes, otherwise they not come in as handy during your revision time. Think of your revision notes as your own small guide to the syllabus.Revision notes should be precise - While your revision notes should be extensive, you also need to make sure that they are as small as possible. There is no need to add everything. Only include details of the concept which are absolutely essential in ensuring your understanding of it.Prepare revision notes regularly - You should prepare revision notes at least 3 to 4 times in a month or once in a week. This would ensure that you are not burdened with the note-making task for the last moment.Hope this helps!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Revision is the key to excel in any competetive exam which includes a huge syllabus.You can follow the following points to have a good revision:- Make short notes after finishing the subject. These short notes must be about 20\u201330 pages per subject and should include all the formulaes, important concepts, tricky questions.Revise these short notes once a week per subject as there are 10 subjects in total therefore you will be revising 10 subjects for about 10 times in 10 weeks. Revision of a subject should take approx 30\u201345 minutes.In the month of December, make separate notes for revision which must be shorter than previous ones(5\u20137 pages) and follow the same schedule of revision.Whenever u feel that you are not confident about a particular subject , study thay subject from your short notes of 20\u201330 pages.The more a subject will come in front of your eyes, the more your mind will capture.
