            "answer_text": "Being a young adult is such a rare thing. You will have to understand how precious it is to be young. Young adults have a lot of energy in them, with full of potentialities. You will have a lot of opportunities to explore the possibilities in the world. The education you will now receive at your college, will not only make you skilled but also improve your personality of your own. In this young age, you need to learn how to be independent from others that too not only in financial terms but also in making decisions of your own and in emotional terms. If you think someone will support you as an emotional cushion, then, it will be an instance of your ignorance. Being in a relationship with someone is a very big responsibility. You will have to be committed with someone, your privacy will always be in jeopardy, you will need to prove your worth to someone every now and then, else you may end up in losing the person and become mentally agonized. There also constant insecurity and jealousy will be a regular thing for you. You will have to invest a lot of time and energy for someone who is herself is clueless about her future just like you. At your age, everything seems fun and doable. But in the long run, you will be on the loser side if you take everything granted for. I am not saying you should not be in a relationship, but relationship must only be a priority only when you are able to take care of yourself on your own. When you are your own support system. Then only other people will like to be around you. Now is not the right time for you to look for relationships. Rather learn to make some good and genuine friends who will be always by your side and will support you in true sense. You won't regret it, believe me. Good luck \ud83c\udf40 ",

Because obviously it would be impossible to get a job in the other 16 to 18 free hours of your day.Cry as that girl and every girl quickly runs away from you as fast as they rightfully can since women don't want to support loser-type, lazy men.Remember that you are a man, and it is YOUR job to support your wife and family, not the other way around.Finally, completely change your perspective about life, and figure out how to become a valuable member of society\u2026 which is already full of too many lazy boys who never grew up.",

            "answer_text": "If you mean financial support, you've got a set of iron ones. Do what many females do when they are strapped for funds in their college years- work part-time and take a part-time course load. Women are getting wise to the fact that trophy wives don't do that type of crap for men. The starter wife makes all the thankless sacrifices. Ladies, don't be the starter wife. Don't support some loser through college and then get dumped for what he calls a hot babe. He'll tell the story for decades, laughing at you and not the least bit thankful. Ladies, get a man who's already established and can provide for you, not drain you. ",

Romance her to the point she will marry you or move in and support you while you attend university. Be diligent in your studies all the way to a PhD if necessary. Be care that there are no children. You fend off any demands from her by saying after I graduate. Then when you have your final degree you can tell that you have grown apart and want a divorce.NICE GUY. ",
