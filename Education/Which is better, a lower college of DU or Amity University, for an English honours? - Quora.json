            "answer_text": "I would suggest you should definitely go for delhi university because there is no college such as low ,each college is equally good what basically differs in college is crowd so if you are into your studies and want to pursue good career afterwards then you should definitely go for DU . There are couple of reasons for it- After you graduate on your degree only University of Delhi would be mentioned with no mention of college. University of Delhi is a central university so teachers teaching here go through a rigorous selection process before getting appointed. Lastly , University of Delhi has it's own brand value which is not matched by amity . ( P.S. Nothing personal against amity ,it's just my opinion) ",

            "answer_text": "Government universities have an upper hand over private ones any given day. But you have to consider many other factors while taking admission in any college. Go for any private college or university only if your family can afford all the high level expenses. Mobility and crowd are the other things to keep in mind. And last but not the least do consider what you want to do longtime in life before deciding amongst the any given choices. All the best. ",
