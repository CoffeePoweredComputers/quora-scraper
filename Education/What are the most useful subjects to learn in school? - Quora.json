            "answer_text": "The best subject is the subject that helps you achieve your dreams. In this case it is:Mathematics Why? It is applied to nearly every scientific subject you learn.It teaches you how to think logically, thereforIf you are good at mathematics you are more likely to succeed in programming, as the logic of mathematics is applied to programmingUsing mathematics and programming you can save time, for example: you can make a program that converts from kilometers to miles by a simple function instead of doing it in your head every time.It grows your brain and keep it healthy, the more you think,  because the more you train your brain to think, your brain becomes stronger more flexible, raising your concentration and planning abilities.It saves your money, accounting is not just for accountants, everyone of us do such a job for his home and business, being a good mathematician means that with some experience you can determine which deals suite you the best.So why do students hate it? There are many ways in which people hate mathematics. some think that is meaningless, what is X and Y they are stupid symbols used to make things much more ambiguous!!Actually X and Y are things that you \"wish\" to know, and mathematics is the science that helps you know them, next time you think that mathematics is meaningless, think about something you wish to know but you can't, and how will you feel if you knew it. Then consider it X and enjoy your trip searching for the value of X :)They get wrong results.They get wrong results because they either use the wrong methods or lost their concentration. When ever you make a mistake remember that you are about to learn something new or extend your ability to focus, and believe me, even if you had ADHD, it can be done, and you will improve!Thinking is hard.That's the beauty of it, the harder the problems you face the more robust your mind becomes and if you can't solve a problem from the first time, leave it for sometime and come back to it, keep doing this until you get the solution. this is not a waste of time, why?They think it is a waste of time.Spending time trying to solve a problem and getting nothing at the end is frustrating specially when you are a student studying for your exams.Give yourself a time limit after which if you couldn't solve the problem you should seek help. Otherwise if you have no exams running after you, keep trying until you get the solution. Every time you challenge yourself, you become better a little bit more.They had a bad teacher.All of the previous problems can happen because of a bad teacher.NEVER let your teacher disappoint you, NEVER constrain your knowledge to his. Always find a new way to solve problems and expand your knowledge.Aside from what I stated above, I recommend this course to expand your knowledge about mathematics :Page on coursera.org ",

            "answer_text": "Without any question, reading is the most important skill. It should be taught in first grade. Kids should be reading small books in fourth and fifth grades. After that they can read anything they want and pursue any educational goals that interest them. I say this so decisively because we have 50 million functional illiterates. This vast absence, this huge failure, makes clear how important reading is. That's 50 million people who will never reach their potential, thanks to our Education Establishment. We should not tolerate this abuse. I am amazed that we do.. Our ideologues get away with this malfeasance because people have gotten slack about what reading is and is not. Guessing all the time? Oh, that's fine. A little dyslexia\u2014 we expect that. Kids can\u2019t read in middle school? No problem. They'll get the hang of it next year. Folks, please write this down. None of that stuff is reading. That's people who have not been taught to read. The school pretends that they have. And the public goes along with it because nobody will tell them the truth. Not the Media (the M is for Mum). Not the universities. Not the foundations.. Not the business leaders in this country. Apparently no one cares. Here's a little video showing quotes from seven phonics experts. You'll be impressed by the fact that they think reading is easy. Our public schools think reading is more difficult than calculus. Who do you trust?  ",
