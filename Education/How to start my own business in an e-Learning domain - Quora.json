            "answer_text": "Well, I just created a plan for one of my \u201cfuture-clients\u201d. First of all, do your market research! You can also read how to do that in my blog which I will link later on my profile. So this is the order. Market Research: it\u2019s so crucial cause it decides about failure or success! It means going here on Quora or on facebook groups or using SEMrush and google keyword planner to really get to know if people want actually to buy your product or service! just try to find out what are your client\u2019s pain and pleasure points? Means how do they want to feel? What do they need to get closer to their goals (solving a problem), what do they want, not need?Out from that you can shape your product and you can use this in your copy and ad. What is also really important for your target market, where are they? Which websites do they use? Where do they hang out?Create your lead magnet (its a chunk of value for free), connect it to a first dollar offer (1$-27$), connect this one to your core offer (whatever the price be due to market research).Connect your lead magnet to your landing page, your tripwire offer to another landing or sales page, or even your webpage. Core offers the same. It\u2019s a step by step \u201cgain trust and sell process\u201dEstablish a CRM email marketing automation system with at least (8\u201330 mails) depends on the price you want for your product. (This goes hand in hand together with segmentation, follow up and upsells)run Facebook ads or Google AdWords or other ads on other platforms like Instagram or wherever your target audience might be. Use the results of your market Research (point 1!!) to target your audience and be very specific (the market research is no. 1!!) The more specific you are the more sales you can make. connect the landing page to the CRM system and provide a link in your emails to your \u201csmall dollar offer\u201d so that when they click on it they are on another landing page or sales page where they can buy your product. its a quite huuge process to explain it just in one post.I will link my blog to this answer when it\u2019s done! It\u2019s a huuge topic and so dynamic always changing! You need to keep being on track to keep up with technical changes constantly (messenger bots etc)FIRST OF ALL: CREATE THE PERFECT PRODUCT! don't distract yourself too much in marketing activities!",

            "answer_text": "Hi Nishad, I do not understand clearly what you mean by \u201ce-learning domain\u201d - can be technically or semantically. However i will give you some general guidance related to starting a business as a whole. In my humble opinion these are 3 rules to base on when starting a business, any type: 1) Define very well you are about to solve a need/problem. Many people start first a business and later try to figure out where it will fit. Huge Mistake. Everyone is not a \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d. Such business will close eventually.2) You have the right solution from a point of view of keeping what you promise. Always do your best to keep your promise. At the risk of your life.3) You ensure you have a Team that share your vision for the business and is willing to accompany you along the way, in good and bad times. Never hire people based on your feelings. They must be hired based on their meritocratic skills. Hire slow and FIRE fast. The rest will follow. I hope i have added value with my answer to the way i understand your question. Respectfully,Rodrigue OSIRUS ",
