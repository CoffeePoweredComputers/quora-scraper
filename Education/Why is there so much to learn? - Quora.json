            "answer_text": "That\u2019s the nature of life; there\u2019s always something around you that you don\u2019t know about. Imagine a box with nothing inside it (including oxygen or other random elements). You then put a rock inside the box. Immediately, the amount of learning that can be done about this single rock skyrockets; what is the rock composed of? Why is the rock hard and not soft? Why is the rock colored the way that it is? Then you put a phone into the box. What\u2019s the phone made of? Why does it work? What can you do with it? The questions you can ask are endless. Now, if you take the earth and put it in the box and start asking questions, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s impossible to learn everything; we simply can\u2019t live long enough to learn it all. My suggestion is that you find something that you\u2019re interested in and become a master of that. ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing to learn but to observe and experience. Learning is nothing but observing and experiencing and when this becomes a habit, learning is not a burden. Coming to the practical aspect, one needs to identify his/her own learning style. There are three kinds of people based on their learning styles. VisualsAuditoryKinaestheticVisuals respond more quickly to pictures, images, videos etc. If they are learning a concept and are able to understand it better by looking at the diagram/picture first and then reading the concept, then they are visuals and its their learning style. So what they can do is to create flowcharts, diagrams etc to understand the concept. Auditory people learn by more listening. If they understand the topic by the lecture method, then they are auditory. They can take help of light music while studying or they can read aloud to learn. Reading aloud is made a habit in the childhood itself but it is not suitable for all but onlyfor auditory people. Kinaesthetic people learn by more of activity method. They need something to do in order to learn a particular concept. They may perform actions while learning, they may have some toy or something while learning. This was a very brief explanation of learning styles. For details, feel free to DM me. Hence, identify your learning style and surely you will be benefitted. Thank you and Happy Learning. :) ",
