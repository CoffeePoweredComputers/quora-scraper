            "answer_text": "Yes and no, because some fall through the cracks. In my experience all of your regular teachers certainly have read your Individual Education Plan, assuming that everyone is paying attention. However it is very easy for your IEP to slip through the cracks; let me give you some examples. I shall start with a literal quote: \u201cFor some unknown reason, despite telling him about it five times, he still didn\u2019t hand it in.\u201d This was a second-semester teacher. The \u201cunknown reason\u201d was clearly laid out in the IEP, but he had not seen it, because he was not the teacher for the first semester. Oops, not his fault, the system failed. Choir master, band leader, replacement teacher, teacher in charge of chosen sport, soccer coach, new teacher, ring-in teacher, extracurricular teacher, instrumental instructor, school nurse, teacher in charge of your group on an expedition, teacher in charge of detention... Probably none of these have read your IEP, because it\u2019s a stretch to expect that they would have been told about it. ",

            "answer_text": "If they teach you, they had better know the provisions of your IEP, because they are legally obligated to follow them. Failure to do so might result in dismissal for non-performance of duty. Under FERPA, they may discuss your IEP only with you, your parents or guardians, and other members of the staff who are involved in your education, such as other teachers you have, nurses or counselors. If the IEP itself demands that variations in the school rules or routines be followed, they may briefly explain to the students, in general terms, why the student is being treated differently if it leads to changes in the class routine, for example, \u201cX needs extra time to get to her next class,\u201d or \u201cY needs this machine so he can read his textbook.\u201d (This was the situation when I retired in 2005. Please correct me if the situation has changed.) ",

I have over 30 with IEP and 504 plans. I do not know them all. I can\u2019t remember them all. I\u2019ve told me students they can always write IEP or 504 on their work if they are using an accommodation. They can hold their work until after class and talk to me about it in Private, so I take their accommodation into consideration and they can retain their anonymity. In the end, it is up to the student to insure that their accommodations are met. It is certainly not an ideal situation, but when a teacher has 230 students\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "If any of the accommodations in the IEP apply to their class, they had better know. That is the administration's responsibility. How can a teacher be expected to make accomodations if he hasn't been told what they are? (I can just see some money hungry attorney claiming that not being told doesn't matter!). In fact, any teacher affected should have been at the IEP meeting, or, at least, been invited and provided release time to attend the meeting. (I have seen meetings held during a teacher's class time and then a complaint by administration that the teacher hadn't attnded.) If the accomodation does not affect that teacher's class, he most likely doesn't know and doesn't want to know. Teachers have enough things to remember without being told nformation they do not need. An example would be a Physical Education accomodation. I don't do push ups in my English class; I don't need to be told about this at all. Teachers are professionals. Any teacher violating a student's information in an IEP is acting unethically. Of course, much of this information is readily apparent to other who share a classroom. Sitting close to the chalk board, using a laptop for tests, having a large print or Braille book, being given extra time to get from class to class, being in a wheelchair \u2014 all of these are known to others in school.
