However, there are some rules regarding examinations involving practical subjects like biology, you should read them. If you face any trouble, take help from your school. Or you can give exams in 6 subjects if you have not already given 12th exams, many schools provide you with the 6subject option. You don\u2019t have to worry about scoring less in the 6th subject, because the final result is taken on basis of best of 6. ",
