            "answer_text": "There are around 350-450 rather similar schools in the world if you set a number of students bar for a \u201cschool\u201d to be one having 10+ students and have a rather flexible definition for \u201csimilar\u201d. If you flex it further and include other forms of alternative education - you\u2019ll have 10k+ schools with some significant similarities. I think that any school similar to Summerhill must be built around the child, start with trust in human nature, trust in child being a natural learner capable of decision and pace autonomy in his earliest days. Particular aspects of school design (state or private, boarding or day school etc.) are important but still happen downstream from trust put into children and childhood as such. \u201cGardener\u201d or \u201cfactory\u201d mentality degrades children as being \u201cnot yet human enough\u201d to have a say, disables decision making depriving the child from his ability to learn from mistakes (one of the main ways to learn - fall, stand up and walk again). You might find this list helpful: LokiEducation.org - Schools list 0.5.1 but many more schools could be in it, it\u2019s based more on self-description than on actual practice. There are other lists online such as List of democratic schools - Wikipedia or Democratic Schools or European Democratic Education Community, but many other schools (including multiple state schools) put child\u2019s best interest first and thus could be seen as remotely similar to Summerhill that was built to be always on the side of the child.

            "answer_text": "Boarding schools are the exception not the norm. Steiner and Montessori schools throughout the world have a child-centred focus but the whole \u201cboarding school\u201d aspect of Summerhill make it an anomaly. In fact, because it is based on a model of housing and educating children outside the home, Summerhill is a lot like Gordonstoun. Eton and Harrow and other renowned British boarding schools. ",
