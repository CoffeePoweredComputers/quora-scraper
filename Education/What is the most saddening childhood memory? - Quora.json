            "answer_text": "When doordarshan stopped Shakthimaan. I have heard people say \"my dad is my first hero.\" But frankly ,he was my first hero.. Being a late 90s kids literary grew up watching him. I was so addicted with him. There is still some parts of him hidden inside me somewhere. As a kid, whenever I had any problem(not getting chocolates or not completing homework) I usually used to think he will come to rescue. I even dressed up as Shaktimaan during fancy dress competition. Though I didn't win the competition, I felt like the king of the world in that bright red and yellow suit. He was my idol. My mom used to blackmail me to eat food as otherwise she won't let me watch TV. I had bitterguards even which I used to hate (sill hate) just so that mom will let me watch Shaktimaan. So much sacrifice for him. But he was worth it. I would come back from school happily running and used to check time every now and then just to have a glimpse of him in that glowing suit. I used to hate the episodes where there is more of Dr.Gangadar and less of Shaktimaan actions. As years passed and I started reading newspaper and as news if some robbery or murder came, I used to wonder why Shaktimaan didn't help them. I once asked this to mom and mom smiled and said,\"he is a busy man. He can't take care of evrything always. Maybe these crimes happen when he is taking rest.\" I believed her. Such a dumb kid I was (still now I am). I used to discuss what would be the next episodes with my friends. I had all the advertisements on doordarsan byheart as I won't change the channel in fear of missing even a few seconds of Shaktimaan. I had a notebook with his cut out pictures. I was a die hard fan of Shaktimaan. I would often imagine the upcoming episodes. This continued till I was in 5th or 6th std. So, one day I was sitting as usual infront of TV to watch him. I didn't watch some of the previous episodes as there was no electricity. I was so pissed off. This particular day, I prayed God to not play with electricity again and he heard my prayers. That day, instead of Shaktimaan, some other program was telecasted. I thought our TV was not working properly and called my mom from kitchen. She said, may be the show was over. I was shocked. I was heartbroken. I cried hugging her. It was as if someone had cut out an essential part from me. I was shattered. I took out my notebook which had Shaktimaan stickers and wept. I somehow slept hugging that notebook. I was so obsessed with the show. It took me 2,3 days to get over it. Still daily I used to put on the TV in the hope to have a last glimpse of him. Slowly, I realized there is no return of Shaktimaan. It was hard to accept. But slowly I had to. I don't know how many of you can understand what I felt that time. Shaktimaan for 90s kids was like Hulk or Pok\u00e9mon or Spider-Man or batman etc etc etc for you. You have too many superheroes. But for us, our one and only Shaktimaan.  PS: Thanks Shaktimaan for making our childhood awesome. You are our immortal everlasting hero. Miss you. ",

            "answer_text": "What is sad, is that it\u2019s hard to focus on one particularly. With no photographical evidence, my childhood is defined by the memories I hold to myself. I often take to humourous, self deprecating, and sarcastic tones when opening up about my childhood as for reason that most of it is fucked up. (For lack of better word; tormented? Deranged? Awful? Hell? No word sits well in relation to how I feel about my past. It\u2019s simply fucked). At the time, I wasn\u2019t able to understand the depth of the event happening, but it\u2019s since been the saddest memory I struggle with almost daily. Mother was going on a trip she said. To where? It didn\u2019t matter, we got to spend a few nights at our grandmothers house; Bingo Nanny we called her. She was the sweetest but I can\u2019t remember her voice, I can\u2019t even recall the smallest details of her appearance. She\u2019s simply a childish nickname and a set figure in my life; a grandparent. The four of us were always excited to spend time at her place. Although I don\u2019t remember the house itself, I cherish the memory of us picking through her rhubarb patch, eating the raw stalks. We were still children so everything was a game, such was that when two dark vans pull up. We were all playing outside, running amongst the beat-down campers and trailers. We thought nothing of it, I didn\u2019t. I was four, they were five, six(ish), and 7(ish). We conspired about these vehicles, who were they? What did they want? Why were they here? Our questions weren\u2019t answered even as we were shoved into separate cars by complete strangers. This is one of the defining moments of my life. Understandably, as I was only four years old, I was oblivious to the fact that my life was changing. For better or worse? Nobody explained to me what was happening, why it was happening? I kept shuffling around with my closest-to-age sister, Starr. The elder two siblings were shuffled elsewhere; we ended up hours apart from each other. Two, too many hours away. From this day were we family? Separated. We had no voice, no choice but to watch silently as our family was uprooted and torn apart. However unfair it seems, I understand that no family could foster four children at once. From that day, in my eyes, I no longer had a family. Everything I could become was in the hands of people I\u2019ve never met. The government decided where we would go and with who. They decided when we got to see Mother and when we would have visits with our other brother and sister. We never had to see the Father. I will forever be grateful for that. When I think back to this day, it\u2019s white. It\u2019s so painfully bright, and I cannot look away from it. I want to understand it, I want to solve the confusions my young self faced, although it is too late. I can\u2019t go back, I can\u2019t scream and throw a fit. I can\u2019t hold onto the arms of my soon-to-be separated siblings, I can\u2019t go back and refuse to leave. I can\u2019t do anything, just like I couldn\u2019t do anything that day. That day was built on lies; The Mother was on no trip. I\u2019m sure she wasn\u2019t, she just didn\u2019t want a goodbye. She didn\u2019t want to deal with us. We weren\u2019t worth an explanation? I can\u2019t do anything but torture my mind as to why she abandoned us. My saddest childhood memory is also the reason I\u2019m in college. It\u2019s the reason I was given a chance, one I am supposed to be grateful for. But I\u2019d still give anything to go back to that day, to save my family. No matter how fucked up it was, it would\u2019ve been my life. Now I live in this state of uncertainty, I don\u2019t know who I am. I\u2019m not yet 20 years old and I feel as though I\u2019ve lived three lives, each cut off too short. I dunno. Everything that happened, and everything that could have, is defined by that day. It sucks. It\u2019s sad. But it\u2019s the past right? Get over it. ",
