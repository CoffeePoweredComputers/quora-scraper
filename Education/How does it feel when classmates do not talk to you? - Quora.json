            "answer_text": "Having experienced that first hand, I can tell you how it felt. I felt like I didn't belong. Everyone had their own friends, their own groups and I was just alone. If they spoke to me they\u2019d only talk to me regarding work or ask me if they could borrow my stuff or something like that. I had one friend but she bonded so well with my classmates that every time we were in class she would rarely talk to me, instead she would talk to them. It was like she didn't even care. I was lonely, and I was already shy and it made it worse. They wouldn't talk to me and since I was shy I didn't know how to reach out. I tried but I could not build any friendships because I just didn't know what to say. Over time, my confidence in making friends with them dwindled until I had no hope anymore. In class I would prefer to be ignored as I really would not want them to notice me as I felt self-conscious. I will look around and everyone would be so happily bonded and I just felt out of place. I didn't want them to notice me, I was lonely yet I was happy to be alone yet I just didn't feel like I should be there at all. If a teacher asked me a question, I would feel really self conscious and be afraid to answer for fear that I might get it wrong and that I would be judged. No one in my class talked to me so I didn't know how they felt about me. For that reason, I had a constant fear of being judged. If we had to work in groups I would be too afraid to contribute ideas even if I had them and that would cause the students in my group to feel like I was not playing my part and my teacher would believe that. I could not tell anyone that I was shy or afraid as they wouldn\u2019t understand and some might not even believe me. Some teachers who knew about it even thought it was a good idea to put me in more group projects thinking that would help, but that only make things worse. I just hate working in groups in class which is weird because one of my greatest passions involves working in a large group.whenever we had to choose our group members in class, I would always be one of the last people chosen and I would feel like the people who chose me only included me because they didn't have enough people in their group. Once again, I felt out of place. I would fall asleep in class but it was not something I wanted to do. To me, sleep was away to escape the reality of the uncomfortable situation I was in every day. I didn't know how to explain this to my teachers and some random classmate would not stop asking me about it, it was one of the few things anyone spoke to me about and that does not even happen often. I did not want to tell her the truth. I did not want to tell anyone the truth because I knew the teachers would organise some kind of class bonding thing and I would be more than afraid to join in since I didn't even feel like I belonged there. It affected my grades but I couldn't help it. Speaking of class bonding, during activities such as those I would be really reluctant to join in the games. Once, about two months ago, we were playing this game and I screwed up so badly and they just started laughing. I knew they were just having fun but I was so embarrassed I almost cried. It was one of the worst feelings ever. I just really want to get out of there but I couldn't. That's how horrible it is when you can't form friendships with your classmates. You start overthinking and you just don't want to be there anymore Just to clearify, I don't hate my classmates or anything like that I just feel really really awkward around them and I probably don't want to see them again simply because I don't know what to do around them. Thanks for reading this, I hope this answers your question :) ",
