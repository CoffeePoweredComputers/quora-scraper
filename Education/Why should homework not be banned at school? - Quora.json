            "answer_text": "A2A. I\u2019ve answered a lot of questions on homework in recent months. Most of them ask something similar to your question, along the lines of, \u201cWhy do we have to have it?\u201d The school or district decides whether homework should be allowed or banned or required or encouraged. I don\u2019t know your age or what type of school you go to, so I can\u2019t be more specific. My school requires homework, at least for most of the time. As a language teacher, I know it\u2019s necessary for students to practice what they learn and memorize new vocabulary, rules, etc. We simply do not have enough class time to do all that. If I did not ask students to do the extra work on their own, we would make little progress. All of you who wonder why you didn\u2019t become fluent in your high school Spanish class, this is one of the main reasons. Imagine how little you would learn, if in each class we had to review, because you never committed things to memory. The same goes for assessments. In order to check your retention, I need to give you assessments\u2014oral presentations, quizzes, writing assignments. For many students, those assessments are the motivation to actually learn. And, as I have mentioned before, many professions have \u201chomework.\u201d Sales reps, doctors, veterinarians, IT professionals, teachers and adminsitrators (all of whom are in my family) do work at home. Self-employed people often bring work home. Yes, it\u2019s a part of life. ",

            "answer_text": "Taking that component of a course out of the teacher\u2019s hands is, once again, making it more difficult to teach the often ridiculous amount of content we are tasked with each year. Math requires practice, practice that doesn\u2019t always need to be in the classroom. While I think that homework is often over done or giving for the sake of giving homework, the issue should be on the content and quality of the homework, not the idea of homework itself. Personally, I don\u2019t give routine homework like most math teachers do, but I do a lot of projects. If a student doesn\u2019t finish their task or wants to go above and beyond, it is homework. Real life requires homework. Many jobs have tasks that are done outside of the workplace. Personally and professionally I think that people who are trying to make decisions such as this about education aren\u2019t educators and really just don\u2019t get it. They honestly think they do, but they don\u2019t. If you aren\u2019t a teacher, don\u2019t work in the classroom, or have a professional part of the education system, your view of what goes on is idealized or skewed. Deciding how we should structure our classrooms, lessons, and management is not appropriate. It is right up there with some insurance company deciding that a medical treatment isn\u2019t necessary when the doctor prescribes it. ",
