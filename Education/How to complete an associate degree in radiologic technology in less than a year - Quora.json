            "answer_text": "If you already have a college degree, it is possible enough credits might transfer in to reduce your time necessary down to about a year. But without this, the answer would be a no. Degrees that take up to one year are Certificates. That\u2019s not the same as a certificate of completion, which simply means you successfully completed a course. Certificates are actual degrees that are one step below the Associates.
