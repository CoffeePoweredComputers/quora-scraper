            "answer_text": "At a deep level, there is no real difference as both media literacy and information literacy are means of thinking clearly and objectively. Media literacy used to focus particularly on the way in which film, television and the press convey information. For example, students would critically analyse the way a movie was designed, photographed and edited, the economic conditions of its production and the way it was received by audiences. They would then understand the ways in which the movie related to the society in which it was created. Information literacy used to refer to making a critical analysis of printed information in order to judge its truthfulness. But now, in the age of the Internet, when so much information is conveyed visually by social media, media literacy and information literacy use similar approaches and are largely the same activity.
