            "answer_text": "Political, social and cultural ties. You see, Somalia has very deep ties with the Arab World which is owed to the very geography of the country being situated on the tip of the Horn and just across the water from Yemen. This along with the long history of commerce which many nations from across the Indian Ocean actively traded with them. The Arabs had a presence there since circa 900 when a sultanate was founded under their influence and would lay the foundations of the nation as we know it today. Also consider that many of the places around the Indian Ocean would fall under Arab influence as well. All of this would ensure the Arabic languages' firm hold as both a language of trade, commerce, liturgy, learning and culture which would end up influencing the various languages that were spoken by those under Arab influence such as Swahili, Tamazight, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Urdu for example. The language continues to thrive in many of these regions thanks to a strong local media, religious tradition and in many cases, proximity. So it is only natural that it would continue to thrive in most of these regions. Inertia much? So in Somalia, much of the local media continues to be broadcast in Arabic with the language also being firmly entrenched in the the educational, religious and civil institutions due in part to the languages' official status. It is also a member state of the Arab League on top of it! They even employed either Arabic script or a form thereof known as Wadaad writing which is essentially a local adaptation of the Arabic script before the British and Italians came along. The current form known as Gilaal script is a more phonetic and simplified adaptation of the aforementioned scripts and has been in use since the 1950's. This all still coexists with the Latin script. As such, the language will be known to many Somalis despite the intrusion of English which stems from the British colonial period so it's only natural that many Arabs will expect them to have a working knowledge of Arabic. End of discussion. ",

            "answer_text": "Somalia\u2019s native language isn\u2019t Arabic? I don\u2019t know we were taught at school that there were like 12\u201313 or 22\u201323 Arab-speaking countries or something, and I remember Somalia was one of those countries, it was either Somalia or Djibouti, or both I\u2019m not sure, yeah most likely both. But I always assumed Somalia spoke Arabic except that their dialect/accent is very unclear to most other Arab other nations, you know just like how Morocco/Tunisia/Algeria sound like aliens for other Arabs, or how other Arabs barely understand Sudan/Libya\u2019s dialect. Or how we had no idea how Mouritania even existed or how they spoke. That\u2019s why Arab people (or at least us, the Saudi Arabian raised youth) assume Somalis speak Arabic. ",
