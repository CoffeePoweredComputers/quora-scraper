            "answer_text": "Hello, Reasoning Ability is an onerous section. With the increasing complexity of questions, it becomes hard for one to give it the cold shoulder. The pattern is getting complex day by day and most of the topics of this section are now being asked in the form of puzzles only. Earlier students used to have a mindset of ignoring the complex puzzles, thereby solving the other questions that are comparatively easy. But to their dismay, this strategy won\u2019t be working anymore as so many questions from the other topics like directions, etc. are being asked in the form of puzzles only. The number of questions being asked on puzzles ranges from 60-65% of all the questions in Reasoning Section. Always try to understand the type of question. Choosing question wisely is a great task.You should divide your your type of questions which one to be attempted first. Go for the question in which you have confidence.The puzzle is the most important topic of Reasoning Section as the number of expected questions from this topic is 20-23. Most of the other miscellaneous topics too are being asked in the form of puzzles only. The puzzles now being asked are very lengthy, complex and even calculation based. They are usually based on Seating Arrangement (linear, circular, triangular, rectangular and sometimes hexagonal even), Floors, Tabular form, Blood Relations, etc. and can be asked in 2-4 variables, depending on the difficulty level of the question. A mix of Seating Arrangement and Blood Relations is also being frequently asked in the examinations. Keep practicing, this is the only way out to deal with puzzles.The number of expected questions on this topic is 5-6. The questions can be based on the usual old pattern as well as the new pattern of Reverse Syllogism in which the conclusion is given in the question and you have to choose the correct statements for that particular conclusion. It is one of the easiest and scoring topics so prepare it well and you will be able to bag 5 marks very easily in Reasoning Ability Section.The questions based on data sufficiency can have 2 or 3 statements based on the difficulty level of the questions. If asked, there will be a total of 3-5 questions on this topic. Data Sufficiency is also an important topic that can get you at least 3 to 5 marks in the Reasoning Section. The questions based on data sufficiency can have 2 or 3 statements based on the difficulty level of the questions.

            "answer_text": "This is the simplest and most effective strategy. Just pen down every topic on a sheet, make a list of topics and start looking for the videos on YouTube. You can find very nicely organised videos on some channels like STUDY SMART, UNACADEMY, etc. Now understand a topic well and solve questions. You can get the material on bankersadda website or ADDA247, GRADE UP, etc apps. Do this with every topic and once you complete the whole syllabus, start solving mocks. Now practice more and more as practice is the key. I personally recommend you to meditate for at least 10 minuntes in the morning, as it is more beneficial than solving 4 puzzles daily. Reasoning is all about common sense, and you can't read it or learn it, you have to develop it. Hope this helps you with your preparation. ",
