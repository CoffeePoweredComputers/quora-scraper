            "answer_text": "There is only one time where I wished I had my own copy of a page from a student\u2019s IEP to share with the world, because it was both hilarious, extremely sad, and an example of how horribly ineffective our attempts to help kids with problems can be. I had two students from the same family in two different classes the last year of my teaching experience (which was a nightmare in and of itself) who had problems, capital P. If things had gone as planned, I would have never dealt with these two, because they belonged to a group of low achievers I would not have taught. An explanation is in order, and follows. At the beginning it the year I was teaching writing to all of the eighth grade students, a job I had won because I was the only one brave enough to take it on. Unfortunately, the school came in under enrollment, and I was switched to eighth grade language arts. I had taught it before, but I knew it was not going to a picnic because this group was what could be described as \u201clow achievers.\u201d Many of them were less gifted intellectually, but decent human beings and kids who put in a reasonable amount of effort. Others were more capable, but attitudinal, disruptive, and/or lazy. Some were not smart, disruptive, attitudinal, and determined to to fail spectacularly \u2014 or so it seemed. I knew, intellectually and in my heart, that many of the latter group were probably dealing with terrible things, such as neglectful parents, poverty, abuse, and mental illness. That did not make it easier to deal with them in the classroom. Gerald and Geraldine (not their real names, but they had similar names, the male and female versions of the same name) were siblings. They were disruptive in class (talking, sneaking out their call phones constantly, making noise and pretending to be innocent if called out on it) and contemptuous of authority. I did the phone calls home, which worked slightly with Geraldine, but not with Gerald \u2014 and for a reason. Apparently their mother could not cope with them, and they were often sent to live with their great-grandmother, who at some point decided she was done with Gerald. One day, a kid in this group of students told the dean of discipline that he had bought a ten dollar bill to class, and it had been stolen. She asked me to check things out and said that if any kid knew anything, they would be rewarded for the information with \u201cBull Bucks,\u201d fake money the kids used to buy small favors like sitting next to friends, a free homework pass, or snacks and supplies (which I and the other teachers paid for, of course). So I asked that the culprit turn it in quickly and it would be over. No takers. I went to the next level and told them about the dean\u2019s deal. Then I started class. At some point, a well-behaved girl raised her hand and was called the front of the room. \u201cI know who did it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSend me to the office but pretend it\u2019s for something else.\u201d I said something along the lines of \u201cYou\u2019d better turn that library book in right away,\u201d and sent her to the office. Gerald had stolen the money. He was out of class for a few days on suspension, which was a relief. The dean told me they had called his mother in, and she was obviously drunk or high, and that Gerald was quiet and embarrassed. This explained some of his behavior. Then I received the IEP form. Usually, these behavior forms would say things like \u201cSally will stay on task during seat work 80% of the time,\u201d or \u201cJohnny will not interrupt instructions 90% of the time.\u201d We were to check that these behaviors were improving, and discuss them during consults. Gerald\u2019s form was different. It read, as near as I can remember, \u201cGerald will refrain from stealing money 100% of the time.\u201d Really. As if this actually addressed this kid and his problems. I was so done with school at this point, and Gerald and I had butted heads so many times that I had truly given up. Dealing with this kind of societal problem, I felt, was beyond my pay scale. But I still can\u2019t help but feel that at some point, this kid had been let down, and that someone down the line would pay for it, and he would end up in jail or dead. All of us in education who had tried to bandage it or ignore him would then share the blame. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cFlorence* must be accompanied at all times by a student buddy. Florence\u2019s sister, Gertrude*, cannot fulfill this duty, as that would disadvantage her.\u201d * Names changed to protect confidentiality. Florence had serious medical problems. I can\u2019t go into them here, for obvious reasons, but they were both numerous and life threatening. When Florence reached school age, she was offered a place in what we call an SSP - a School for Specific Purposes. SSPs are built to meet the needs of children with very unusual issues, who cannot be placed in mainstream schools because mainstream schools cannot cope with the requirements. For example, at least one SSP that I know of has climate controlled classrooms where an alarm rings if the temperature varies by more than a degree or two. This caters for children who cannot regulate their body temperatures properly due to medical issues. As you might imagine, SSPs are incredibly expensive to run and places in them are only offered to children who genuinely need them. Florence certainly qualified. Florence\u2019s parents, however, wanted her to attend her local public school. As I understand it, they fought tooth and nail for this, in legal cases that went on for years. They won. Florence\u2019s case file came with a laundry list of requirements that the school was legally obliged to meet*. The one I have quoted above is the one that, in my opinion, was the most egregious (mainly because the others only required money to fix - loads of money, but just money). The school was required to select other students to accompany this young girl at all times. They would have numerous responsibilities that would effectively prevent them from getting any education themselves whilst they were doing this. The case file, written by Florence\u2019s parents and their doctors and lawyers, recognised this, and was perfectly okay with other children losing their right to an education as long as Florence\u2019s sister wasn\u2019t one of them. * Edit to add: I should point out that the specifics were being challenged in court. I don\u2019t know if the challenge was successful - my involvement was short lived. ",
