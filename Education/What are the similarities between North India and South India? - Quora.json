            "answer_text": " Obviously the whole of the Indian Sub Continental people are a mixed lot. Genetically speaking. The common denominator is the ancestral South Indian genes. These are unique native genes, that almost all of us share. The North Indians , subjected to successive waves of migrations/Invasions from outside the sub continent down the millennia have more and more of Ancestral North Indian Genes. The more recent the migration / aggression from across Afghan, Persian, Turkish/ Mongol, across the North Western frontiers , more of ANI genes in the Genome Map. Because of Geographical continuity, North India has a much more animated scenario of population mixture of several alien extra Sub Continental races and ethnicities, who have made the Sub Continent their home. The South , mostly buffered by geography, is less mixed genetically. Dont worry, I have not ignored the separate but diverse identity of East and North East. It all adds to the diversity of India, that is uniquely Indian. And I believe , that is our core strength as an Union of diverse Linguistic states, all committed to our Constitution.  The symbol and seal of Arunachal Pradesh is not different from the symbol of Dravida Munnetra Kazhakam of Dravidian stronghold Tamil Nadu!  Long live India. Thanks for the question. ",
