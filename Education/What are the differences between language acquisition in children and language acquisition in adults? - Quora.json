            "answer_text": "It depends heavily on the method of acquisition you choose for both. Besides, children age group is an essential benchmark. Adults are scared off by the magnanimous logical and grammatical load in a sentence structure. Children, the earlier the better, go by communicative needs. Children rather go by repeating, having intuitively understood the meaning, given they are in the right environment. For children it is \u2018situational learning\u2019. It is like pressing the right key on a computer, rather than understanding \u2018how it works\u2019. Children \u2018go\u2019 into the language by establishing logical connections within THAT language, rather than establishing such connections THROUGH their mother-tongue. Logical compositions of languages is different. When one does not have to translate into one\u2019s mother-tongue in order to understand, but only to understand without translation, it is easier and quicker to penetrate that language. Age is a hell of a lot of help in terms of accent. Learning though \u2018hearing\u2019 is a much more productive method than learning through understanding where the tongue should be based on scientific explanation of \u2018tongue positioning\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Children pick up by repetition and experimentation. Adults who are literate and interested in languages set out to figure out how the language works. They need repetition too but their brains are organised and they can benefit from that, if they are positive and confident. ",
