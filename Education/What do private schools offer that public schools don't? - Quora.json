            "answer_text": "Please note, this is very much my personal opinion, based on my truthful analysis! Elite private schools offer world class quality education! In plain words, undoubtedly the quality of a star hotel versus a budget hotel Since, I\u2019ve got the dual experience as a public and private school parent, I can hit the nail right at the wall. If someone asks me about the best thing we did as parents, \u2018r answer would be putting our daughter to an ELITE private school (I highlighted elite, \u2018coz private schools vary with less expensive ones, religious ones and the elite expensive ones with boarding and day school) I\u2019m leaving the money part here, as the question is what do private schools offer that public schools don\u2019t! I just cannot answer this question in a clear-cut precise way. I\u2019ll lay out examples of both private and public schools approach towards students (\u2018coz that breaks or makes them) and explain. My daughter was raised in a public-school system till middle school. Right now, she entered a private school for High School, literally her dream school of arts where academics and arts are given equal priority. So I\u2019ve just got l\u2019l over two weeks of her private school experience to share, but trust me, it\u2019s a groundbreaking experience for her, compared to her old public school system. Our kid was supremely creative since toddler days! But her public-school system drastically failed to notice that creative spark in her. A major flaw of a public-school system! Every kid will have a natural spark, which public schools are rarely bound to tap. I\u2019m not getting into the reasons, there may be several. Since our kid is born to us privileged (please do not contemplate it\u2019s just money and education, but all the qualities that make good parents) parents, we recognized her talent, guided and supported her till today, her works are in New England Galleries now, and she recently signed an agreement with a NY gallery for marketing her works, which are a few among her several achievements made till middle school, with zero to nil support from her public school system. Question?? What could be the fate of another child with not much privileged parents like us, who might come from a broken home, who had this very same talent, happened to be in a public-school system? Where could he or she end up in life? Public schools other than greater school districts at times can even dishearten or demotivate your gifted kid, with a different skin pigmentation, no matter how well-behaved, talented or charismatic your child is, \u2018coz the thought process of some of these adult school figures can be shallow, mean and petty. At the same time, there are few amazing touching educators too, who are the real good appless, unfortunately the bad ones, overpower them. Well, at the same time, I\u2019ve heard candid stories from my devoted friends, whose kids are in the best school districts, where Asian parents frequently get engaged in the hectic rat race, eventually burning their own kid\u2019s future. So that was an absolute no, no for us! Public school system has a bunch of awful adults in positions of authority. Our child may have to interact with them during their long hours in the school environment, which obviously will have a significant effect on the kid. Creativity and critical thinking may be totally devalued in this kind of authoritarian school system, where one could only expect a moderate thinking and standardized form of education. It\u2019s an environment of unpleasantness and uncertainty for gifted kids, where you may be singled out if you perform above the boundaries, singled out if you perform bad, teased if you don\u2019t look a certain way, teased if you don\u2019t do certain things. Nothing matters, except how your kid takes it all, how they view themselves, what they learned in school about groups, grading, exclusion, inclusion, the mean popular girls, bulling, differential rewarding and so and so forth. Since we were her rock pillars, nothing much affected her, except some minor heartaches due to her creative psyche which yearns for more softer emotions. The limitless love, support and encouragement from her art admirers, supporters, curators and organizations made her resilient and flawless moresoever. Towards the end of her middle school, my daughter got invited as a guest by YWCA for one of their luncheons in honoring women. Since she had to attend this luncheon on a weekday, she refused. But YWCA director assured her she will send a letter to her school principal and homeroom teacher, on behalf of YWCA for taking special permission for an early dismissal, not to mark down her absence due to her philanthropic efforts to the community. She sent in a beautiful letter, ccing me and her homeroom teacher and principal gave their consent in writing back to me, but at the end of the school year, records of her attendance showed the particular day marked down as unexcused absence, though all the records can prove them bluntly wrong. Just a specimen of a public schools negligence, careless and callous trait! Now I\u2019ll explain what my daughter\u2019s private school is offering her! Magic, yes it\u2019s pure magic, a magical place, where she is getting what she needs, to make anything possible! Firstly, she got the right school environment! Her school welcomed her with open arms seeing her incredible portfolio on audition. It's not just a place for learning academics and art, but stems a universal formula for making school \u2018fun, creative and a happy place to hang out\u2019. This school is an epitome of Virtues, right from the director to the security guy. The noticeable factor of this private school is a culture of mutual respect, kindness, understanding and acceptance, that elevates everyone\u2019s thinking. Obviously visible an engaging community with extraordinarily high standards and a level of high maturity. Resources are vast, and smaller class sizes makes student teacher ratio appreciable. The motto of her school is-Non Nobis Solum; \"Not for ourselves alone\", they literally mean it in every way! The School does so in a diverse, humane and ethical community. Being international, kids come from all four corners of the world, diversity at it's best! Here kids evolve together, learning from each other, helping each other, being kind to each other, being there for each other, discovering their SELF, developing as leaders for themselves and for the world. And the splendid faculty, teachers and staff, hear them, guide them, enlighten them and get them evolve as human beings in a real sense. Her regular school hours are from 8 am to 6:10 pm, at times going beyond that time, having their breakfast, lunch and dinner served with several different cuisines for both boarders and day schoolers (school being international boarding and day). Still at the end of this extended stretchy hours, our daughter is in her la-la land\u2026the power of natural drive through inspired learning, a truly-truly, ground-breaking experience for her!! While, I recall her coming back at 2:05 pm from her previous public school, it appeared her little shoulders were carrying the burden of the whole world! Now when I drive her back home at early evenings around 6:30 pm, she is at the height of contentment humming and smiling, still bursting with the whole world\u2019s energy!!! A world shattering difference between her public school and her private school! This private school is offering infinite satisfaction to our child, and that is what every parent craves for! I realize when creative people are happy, sky is the limit! Meghana AKA Meghan Basi - Artwork for Sale - Norwood, MA - United States MEGHARTZ - Meghan Basi's Portfolio ",

            "answer_text": "On of the big things that Private schools seem to offer are a more personalized education plan for students and a more opportunities for growth. I will explain what I mean. In public schools you can have IEPs for gifted and underperforming students, but they really do not have enough resources or time to meet these goals. It is just something that they cannot do. They try extremely hard, but it doesn't happen. In private school, they are there for your student and you are paying them handsomely for it. They can create an more idividualized plan that meets your students needs. This helps gifted students do better and better and helps underperforming studnents reach their goals and get on grade level. This is probably the biggest advantage that I see, especially for a student like me, however there are some other advantages: Students usually have to wear uniforms in private school. This alleviates the need for kids to have to figure out what to wear and eliminates bullying based on clothing, which is a common occurrence in public school. Students don't usually mess around as much in private school as their parents are paying for it. In public school, they have to be there so will behave worse. Behavior issues don't occur as much either at private schools as they do at public schools, most likely for the same reason. Teachers are usually paid better in private school due to the huge checks paid by the students' families each month. Public school teachers get paid very little and that is not always good. These are just some of the advantages of private schools over public schools. I still very much enjoy the public school system, but if you are willing to pay for it and don't think that your public school system is \"good enough\" (it usually is, you just have to ask about special programs) than private school seems like the way to go.
