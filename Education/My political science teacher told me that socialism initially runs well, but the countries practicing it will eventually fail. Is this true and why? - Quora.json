            "answer_text": "I love all these answers. They are absolutely hilarious. Socialism/communism is a great idea. Wonderful idea. Totally impractical, but a great idea. A classless society is a utopia. Imagine a world where you and someone like Barack Obama are equal. Except what are the differences between the two of you. Obama worked hard to get where he was, you are too lazy to get a better education to get a better job. (You being a generalized you, not you specifically.) A moneyless society! Oh how delightful. We can all drive our broken down cars on potholed roads. No wait, we will go back to horses. And my ABSOLUTE favorite argument: from each according to ability, to each according to need. So you have a family of four including a spouse and your neighbor has 19 kids and no spouse. You work eight hour days, but your neighbor has to be home mostly to take care of the baby. But you don't ever get ahead because all your production goes to your overly libidonous neighbor with the small army. Yep, you got it they can't work as hard as you can, but they can have sex and get pregnant. So their ability is less, but their need is more. So YOU work to feed 24 people, they work to maybe feed 3. All progress would stop because there would be no way to fund it. Moneyless and all. There is no incentive, why should you work your ass off for someone who can just have sex and babies,. And who is going to make you? You can't have policemen. That would require a class set above yours. Two actually. It would require one class of people to make the laws, and a second class of people to enforce them. The utopia of s/c is a great dream, but it does not take into account reality. Even in \u201csocialist\" countries like Britain and Sweden, there are classes, and incentives, and money. There are lawmakers and policemen. There is incentive to follow the party line. I don't think that these countries which have been \u201csocialist\" longer than the United States has been around, will fail (yes. I know they were both absolute monarchies then, but the seeds were already sown) They are very viable political alternatives to our own quasi-democratic society. But make no mistake, true s/c is an impossible pipedream. Kind of like a Hillary Clinton presidency to the democrats. ",

            "answer_text": "You have 300 million people, all with different preferences on what they would like to own, use, consume, produce, keep, dispose of. Who is going to be better at distributing all of society\u2019s resources to give them what they want, a central committee of 3 or 200, or a freely competitive market of all 300 million people driven by self-interest to better their lives and their families\u2019 lives, making the goods and services that best do that, and then letting the 300 million people picking what they want? Some people want to trade time for money and would rather paint; others want money and will work 70 hours a week; some are willing to go to school for 15 years to learn brain surgery; others would rather work in retail right out of high school. Markets have been proven over and over and over again to be the most productive, inventive, and efficient way of meeting people\u2019s desires. Resources are re-allocated automatically as demand increases, and reduced when it falls; people with creativity are driven to invent because they are rewarded and protected from theft when they do. Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty, invented more life-saving and useful inventions, etc. than any economic system in all of human history. It is like a \u201chive mind\u201d: no one person is good at and knows how to go find ore, mine it, transform it and trees and oil and human-created substances into all of the things that go into your car; no one person can design it, understand the physics, make it attractive, get people willing to buy it at a cost above the cost of production. Thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands of people\u2019s talents go into it. No central committee can compete with all of society combined. ",
