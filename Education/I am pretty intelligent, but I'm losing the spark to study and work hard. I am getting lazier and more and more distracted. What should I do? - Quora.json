            "answer_text": "I am just intrigued by your seemingly extensive self-talk mechanism, i.e. the negative stories you keep spinning and/or reminding yourself probably on a daily basis: \"... I don't feel like studying any more. I am getting more and more  lazy...\" \"... I myself know that I  am wasting my time but I am not able to do anything about it... \"  \"... My  parents and my teachers believe in me but I myself don't...\"  \"... I want to  change but I CAN'T... \"  \"... I've lost my motivation... \" \"... Has anyone gone  through the same phase?... \" I like to put these harsh realities of life across to you: Unless you work, nothing changes. For things around you to change, first you must change. CONCEIVE. BELIEVE. ACHIEVE, as success researcher and author of the landmark classic, 'Law of Success', often put it. You said \"I'm pretty intelligent\", but how come you don't use your seemingly intelligent brainpower to come up with ideas and insights to improve yourself? If you don't even believe in yourself, nobody out there can help you.  Can your recall the one particular scene in 'Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back [Episode 5]', during which the Jedi knight apprentice Luke Skywalker was shocked to see Master Yoda lifting the X-wing fighter out of the mud swamp, and said: \"I don't believe it!\"? Do you recall what was Master Yoda's immediate response: \"That's why you fail!\" That is exactly what's happening to you!  Also, what's your point of asking: \"... Has anyone gone  through the same phase?... \"  All you need to do is to look at yourself, and not compare with others. You job is to make a better version of yourself every day than you were yesterday.  Think about what renowned American industrialist once said: 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right.' If you want to succeed, you just have to take personal responsibility of your life, and be fully accountable of all your actions. Actions have consequences. All the whining, laying blame, and justifying will have to cease. You have to tell yourself, starting today, that you are prepared - mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually - to do whatever it takes to get to where you want to be and/or to go.  Are you ready? Let's rock n roll! Now try this: Grab a sheet of blank paper, preferably a large one, say A3-sized.  Draw 5 columns, and name them respectively: a) what I want to be;b) what I want  to do; b) what I want to have; c) what I want to improve;d) what I want to change;  Spend some time to explore each named column. Consider a few important areas of your life, say: - academic pursuit (your top priority);- mental development;- career aspirations;- physical health;- financial wealth;- family relationships;- social networking;- recreational ventures (including hobbies, interests, sports, vacations, etc.);- spiritual development (including contributions to society, volunteering, etc.); Take your time, as you are thinking about your future. You may end up with several useful ideas in each column. Narrow them down to say 3 to 5, by asking yourself, as you evaluate your goals,: Do I really like or want it?Will I enjoy it when I get it?Am I prepared to do whatever it takes to get it?  If Yes for all questions, proceed; if NO, it's a NO GO! Translate  each of the selected ideas from each column into specific, prioritised and executable  tasks that you can  execute immediately, within next 7 days; next 30 days; next 60 days,  next 90 days, next 12 months, and beyond.  Take your time to brainstorm. Be honest - and forward looking - with yourself.  The final outcome is your game plan.  You  may need to think about resources required for implementation and   execution, sharing of accountability (if any), metrics to define  milestones and completion stage, and more importantly, potential  obstacles/roadblocks and a slew of possible solutions to resolving them.   Follow up massively and follow through consistently, as celebrity  success coach and peak performance strategist Tony Robbins often puts  it.  In a nut shell, GOALS, PRIORITIES and a PLAN set your direction and direct your focus on the things that matter to you the most. In a nut shell, they give your the reasons for getting out of bed quickly every morning, and for staying - and feeling - alive. GOALS, PRIORITIES and a PLAN, are like precise commands preset into the flight plan of a Tomahawk cruise missile, homing on to a predefined, long-distance target, to use a military analogy. All  the strategic and tactical    initiatives in your game plan will collectively embody the envisaged  vivid image of your ultimate    success achievement, which you are  likely to hold in your    head, serving as your personal  driving force, keeping you inspired, motivated and focused, while in hot pursuit of your desired outcomes or cherished dreams. I have   already   written extensively on goal setting and goal achieving,   including how   to set up an systematic game plan on Quora. You can   search their   archives. Meanwhile, I like to leave these two elegant and inspiring quotes as food for thought:     Godspeed! [20151208_Future Focus] ",

            "answer_text": "What I'm about to say might sound harsh, it might be difficult to accept, but true motivation comes from someone lighting a burning hot fire under your ass to get you up, so that's what I'm going to try and do. First off, you need to think about why you're studying in the first place because unless you answer the WHY question with some sincerity, it'll be difficult to ever find motivation to study. Is it so that you can become a professional? Are you studying just because you're interested in learning a new topic? Do you need to study just because you're in school and you don't want to fail out? Second, you need to answer the question of what are you doing with your time when you're not studying when you should be. Do you waste time watching t.v.? Are you mindlessly browsing social media outlets, randomly browsing the internet, or smoking weed with friends? Third, think about the answer you gave to the second question, and think about the person you want to be 5-10 years from now. Everything that you do in replacement of studying, are LIKELY things that you can do at any time and anywhere, they're not time-sensitive, they won't disappear if you don't do them for a few days, and you aren't \"missing out\" out any opportunities. But think about the person you want to be 5 years from now. Think about the person you want to be 10 years from now. The person you want to be is likely well-educated, has mastered a craft, has a certain amount of skill and knowledge in an area. To become the person you want to be down the line, you HAVE to study. You HAVE to learn. You HAVE to expand your knowledge and you HAVE to do everything you can to grow intellectually TODAY. Why? Because if you don't change who you are today, if your mind stays the same as it is right now, then who you are in 5 years, in 10 years, will be exactly who you are TODAY. If you don't study, if you don't learn, if you don't grow TODAY, then forget about the person you \"want\" to be in the future. Stop telling yourself that you have dreams, aspirations and goals related to your school work, whatever it is that you're studying or you want to learn. Just stop. Because if you REALLY had sincere dreams and aspirations related to the reason you need to study, you'd study more. If you want to be the best, the smartest, have the best grades, be the best professional, understand the most, then you need to study, and out-work your peers. Strive to be the best version of yourself. The best version of yourself requires you to study, TODAY. ",
