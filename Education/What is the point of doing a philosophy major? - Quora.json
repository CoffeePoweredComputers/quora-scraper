            "answer_text": "You do a philosophy major because: You want to develop strong critical thinking skills.You want to be able to develop arguments on a position that can withstand the most vehement, volatile questioning.You want practice in defending the argument from the opposing side, even when you personally disagree with it. (This also teaches you how to view things from multiple sides of the issue, so you\u2019ll learn to understand the people who hold an opposing opinion, where they\u2019re coming from and why. It ultimately leads to a greater compassion for the world.)By practicing arguing both sides of an issue, you learn how to counter the opposition better and \u201cbest\u201d them, using their own arguments against them. (Vindictive, perhaps, but a good philosophical opponent will also be able to point out the flaws in your argument and turn them on you. Turnabout is fair play.)You want to learn how to have an intellectual argument in a respectful, thoughtful way.You want to answer the big questions in life.You spend a lot of your free time analyzing everything to death.You are the person who loves to share their opinion online and play Devil\u2019s Advocate on hot issues. (Without resorting to calling someone \u201csnowflake\u201d when you run out of defense.)You love mental gymnastics.You\u2019re quick-witted and love to exercise that.You want to learn to read not for context, but for content and details. To create a good argument, you have to pay attention to what is said and what\u2019s not said; what\u2019s insinuated and what is fact or opinion. You learn to read things with such discernment that you\u2019ll notice details others will gloss over.You just really, really, really LOVE reading and discussing the ideas of Sartre, Plato, Heidegger and all of the other big names in Philosophy.",

            "answer_text": "1. Not very useful but accurate answer:What Louis Armstrong said when asked what jazz is:  If you have to ask, you'll never know 2. Really long answer: Read Plato at the Googleplex by Rebecca Goldstein 3. TL:DR answer: It's how some very smart people have answered some very big questions. and finally 4. Moderate length answer Majoring in philosophy is a way to train your mind by thinking deeply about questions that have been thought about for thousands of years. The questions themselves are interesting and important to many people, and the answers proposed by various thinkers over the centuries offer not only good trees to sharpen your analytical claws on, but insights into the nature of human society, morality and other \"big questions\". While this doesn't offer direct job training for many careers (there are very few positions that call specifically for philosophy) it can be good training for many kinds of graduate school. Certainly  law school; but, especially if you have a biology or similar minor or double major in pre-med, possibly med school (in the USA anyway, some med schools are looking beyond the traditionally prepared student) and, if you have another minor or double major, almost anything else.
