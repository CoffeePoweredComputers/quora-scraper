            "answer_text": "As we all know study of mathematics develops the problem solving skills. Every problem contains its own solution. But you have to approach in a proper manner. With this, study of mathematics prepares you to solve the problems of life with confidence.Mathematics develops computational skills.Helps to develop organizing the things systematically. To solve a problem you should solve the equations step by step.Develops manipulative skills.Develops functional skills in numerical ability.Develops logic and reasoning.Teaches synthesis and analysis. In life if you come across a complex problem you have to make it parts and solve and then integrate to find the final solution.Develops to make proper assumptions by keen observation of circumstances and check whether the assumptions are correct.Develops the discriminatory power.Sharpens the brain. I mean you can think faster than your peers.Develops aesthetic sense - in mathematics you will learn symmetry and beauty lies in symmetry.Presentation skills- By studying the graphs you will know how to present your argument in a simple and more effective way so that every one can understand.Develops analytical skills. In life situations some times the problems seems to be complicated, the analytical skills developed by the study of mathematics will come handy to analyse the problem without losing the cool and get the best solution.Above all develops patience and discipline.Mathematics is basis for the study of sciences, engineering, architecture,computers,accounts,fashion designing and many more subjects.",

            "answer_text": "Here is the part introduction to my FREE Maths Algorithm Library MAL. Maths a drag? Everyone has needless math-difficulty. Yet little can be researched, invented, improved, optimised, designed or decided without some or all 70 algorithms. Likewise the means to make the item. So here's compact, anglicised, wide-range MAL for every too-busy professional + expert in most careers, especially those seldom using maths, who simply MUST solve problems routinely & rapidly, but don't have time, inclination or know-how for manual solving. Secondary + Tertiary students now effortlessly & enjoyably solve visualised-problems that still baffle experts. Even Primary students will find lots to enjoy in MAL. I have Invented & Discovered 5,470 items - evidently the world\u2019s 3rd most - yet most all required maths; some very simple, others real awful but exciting when the Maths comes out OK. MATH SOLVER: For variety, examples with suggested solutions, a fascinating detailed manual on same screen as the maths or separate, for solving some problems few if any can solve, low cost = FREE so far if only few needed, easiest to use, needs little memory, good on all Windows, easy to change apps in .txt file, is also a Scientific Calculator, some for all ages, + easy to generate your own apps, then I would highly recommend my own Maths Algorithm Library MAL that was started in 1950s! That\u2019s if that\u2019s what you're looking for. These 3 of my FREE Maths Algorithm Library\u2019s MALgorithms solve Groups of Mixed (simultaneous) arbitrary Systems of non/linear, implicit algebraic & ordinary differential equations. ALL 8 equation example sets were multi-solution solved concurrently over long capture range with appropriate starting conditions. Discontinuous Ordinary Differential Equations ODE driving functions are quite acceptable, as are unlimited ORD orders. Mathematica couldn\u2019t seem to match such numerical capability. Big deal! Except that our DIFFSIMP uses only 2.9k memory! The little POCket comp? It takes somewhat longer. No point DIFFSIMP if much faster easier DIANALOG (decades old Digital version of an Analog Computer) + its plotting are OK. Most ODE solvers appear 1 per century; my 3 arrived in 5 years - whilst squatting at 4 Unis to borrow computers + library + ask questions etc. ``GWBASIC - my favourite language - has a simple random number generator including a seed so you can repeat the random number generated for certain experiments; & which increases further still the randomness of such. Trying to remain modest I would say my own Inverse Sinh method for solving algebraic equations that took me months of effort on a simple Sinclair primitive calculator, & then on a single line 10k pocket computer SHARP PC 1500, which also helped solve plenty of tricky ODEs (differential equations). Later inventing an algebraic digital analogy - DIANALOG - of old analogy computers that enabled me to solve vastly more complex groups of differential equations. These are now part of an entire FREE compact Maths Algorithm Library MAL that earned me an American Doctorate of Science in early 1980s. Queensland\u2019s Uni\u2019s Uniquest must have sold 1,000s of MAL years ago. ",
