            "answer_text": "In the last, oh, decade(?) this idea of entrepreneurship through school has boomed. Universities have entire courses and degrees in Entrepreneurship, high schools are paying incubators to run programs, and students are asking about the value of that Entrepreneurship class. Heck, just look at Quora, there are a ton of questions about entrepreneurship and school. It begs the question\u2026 why? Why so many classes and questions? The idea of entrepreneurship has become more popular. Thanks to Shark Tank and films and magazines celebrating founders as pop culture celebrities, more and more young people are growing up saying, \u201cI want to be an entrepreneur when I grow up!\u201d Parents of course then, usually not knowing what \u201centrepreneur\u201d really means, encourage their k-12 schools to teach it and Universities (which you're paying by the way), create the class; frankly because, as any *business* should, if people want to hand you money for something, you provide it (almost regardless of if it has any value). Let me ask a question in reply, as an answer to this question, \u201cwhat would they teach??\u201d Think about it and bear with me\u2026. They could teach the history of entrepreneurship. Okay, that's valid.They could teach the psychology of entrepreneurs. Makes sense.Could they teach, \u201centrepreneuring\u201d? No. WTH is that?? Notice, there is no JOB at a company, called \u201centrepreneur.\u201d You can't DO entrepreneur. Entrepreneur is personality trait.[1] It refers to people who have a natural tendency to see gaps and problems in the market AND who have a tic-like fixation with needing to put themselves at risk to invest in fixing that. Entrepreneur != Business owner Entrepreneur != Founder SOME founders and business owners are entrepreneurial. Most aren't. Why isn't\u2026 introversion taught in school? Why isn't\u2026 being funny taught in school? You can't teach risk tolerance. You can't teach a quality that some people has that makes them need to fix things. You can't teach how to be a certain kind of person. And frankly, we shouldn't be encouraging more entrepreneurial people anyway! Countless social and health studies have shown that entrepreneurial people are more prone to mental health issues: depression, anxiety, etc.[2] Why? Because they're the people in society who risk themselves over and over again to fix things. They lose money.[3] They hear \u201cno\u201d and criticism more than almost anyone else. People think they\u2019re unrealistic, not planning or saving for the future, not caring for their family\u2026 all because they can't help but do things to improve stuff.[4] You can't teach that. Schools are offering it, but you really, really, can't teach \u201centrepreneurship.\u201d Now, what CAN be taught and what MIGHT you really want to be learning IF you are entrepreneurial (or even if you're not)? Starting a business. It's called business. It's over in the College of Business. They'll teach accounting, marketing, supply chain, and more. How to run a business. Keep in mind, running a business isn't entrepreneurship, it's just running a business.How startups work. Notice I'm not saying, how to start a startup or be a founder. Startups are distinct from new businesses because they're temporary, in search of a business model; because they can't just replicate what's already known: they're doing something net new. So we can't teach how YOUR startup should work not how YOU might be a great founder; there is no playbook. We can teach HOW they tend to work but even teaching that is pretty simple; it takes about 12 weeks. Actually BEING a successful startup or founder though still can't be learned; it takes practice and resources (the average age of a successful founder is 44\u2026 you can't just take a class and get there). And notice, startup founder isn't an entrepreneur either! Necessarily.Someone like Elon Musk is an entrepreneur. Notice: PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX \u2026 I think he's even in music now\u2026 and notice too, he's cracked a but in public, because his personality type puts an insane amount of pressure on him. Who in their right mind keeps trying completely different things?? Entrepreneurs do. Contrast that with someone like Zuckerberg who clearly is a successful founder and CEO. Agree with his style and product or not, he did it. But that's the difference, he did Facebook. Not entrepreneurial. And perhaps\u2026 why is Zuck so calm under pressure??? Because he doesn't have that entrepreneurial trait that keeps trying and failing and so many different things. Education, most agree, actually takes the entrepreneur quality OUT of most people. From our earliest ages, many of us are more entrepreneurial: we try, we build, we fix, we draw and color, we sing\u2026 we take personal risks. But in as early as grade school, we're beating people into a submission while we teach: follow the rules, get *this* work done, your grade judged by one person matters more than what's produced by what you learn, go to college and get a JOB. Most increasingly lose the tendency of entrepreneurship. And that's okay! Because society and our economy can't financially support everyone being like that. Our economy (and entrepreneurs) needs people working on the opportunities that emerge; if everyone taking great risks and losing money, the economy would collapse. The lessons to learn (the classes to take) if you are entrepreneurial, are in the field (industry/sector) in which you're passionate. If you are entrepreneurial and want to work in Buildings, take Architecture. If you're entrepreneurial and want to be in healthcare, take Medicine or Nursing. And don't think/take \u201ccoding\u201d because you want to be in \u201ctech,\u201d those aren't sectors. If you want be entrepreneurial in Social Media, take Marketing. If you want to be entrepreneurial in MusicTech, study the business and music. Sure, take engineering if you want to code but to be meaningfully successful, you still have to learn and experience the thing in which you actually want to be involved.

            "answer_text": "School creates worker bees. It is not structured to create free thinkers. Society works best when people follow the rule book of become educated to perform in service of an employer, to earn a wage, you then use to fuel the economy, until you age out of usefulness, where you wait until death. The more people who expand their thinking and education, start to question and change the system. You can see how if you had power and wealth this becomes a threat. Why would people work so that you could take a portion of their work, while having control over their lives. Sounds familiar\u2026 when did we have a similar arrangement.. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udfff\u200d\ud83e\uddb1Oh right. ",
