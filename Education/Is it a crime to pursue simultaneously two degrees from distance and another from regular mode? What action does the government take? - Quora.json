            "answer_text": "I would hardly see pursuing two degrees to be a crime. It may take up a lot of time and be expensive, but unless there are some rules or regulations in your home country that prevent it, I cannot believe it would be. In some locations, only people with certain visas are eligible for study. Also, the amount of subsidy or lending available from the government will depend on an individual person\u2019s past qualifications, either completed or not completed. If you have some concerns, talk to the education providers and look at their websites for further information. As far as I know, if you are paying full fees, they don\u2019t usually care! It is good to see that you value education - just don\u2019t overdo it and burn yourself out. Study is important, but so is experience. Please let me know if this has been helpful to you.

            "answer_text": "UGC has been clearly directed that persons who pursue joint degrees are to be technically disqualified from both the courses and further charges of fraudulency are to be filed. Cause courts have cleared the air that when a student is to study\u2026He should study and not do part time jobs along with studies. This is the reason for depletion of amplitude of course the court believes. Distance learning is a bitter pill for courts and have red eye on it. You do both and you are disqualified.Cant be at two things at a time as you are not omnipresent ",
