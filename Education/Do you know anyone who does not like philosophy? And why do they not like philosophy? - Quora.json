            "answer_text": "Yes. I know a plenty of people who don\u2019t like philosophy, though also without disliking it. People in general don\u2019t dislike philosophy, even though they also don\u2019t like it: they simply don\u2019t care. The fact that talking about philosophy e.g. in a cocktail party is disliked hasn\u2019t got much to do with philosophy per se \u2014 it\u2019s merely because you\u2019re supposed to talk about light subjects, which are easy to approach. In this sense it depends on when, where, to whom, how much, in what way, etc. but I\u2019ll concentrate on professional philosophy.\u2000\u2000The reason why most people today don\u2019t specifically like or dislike professional philosophy is, that it\u2019s like pure mathematics or such things, which are interesting only for the people who are highly specialized in that area of knowledge. Mostly people who specifically dislike philosophy, are either \u2000\u2000a.) professional philosophers, or\u2000\u2000b.) entertain highly naive metaphysical beliefs.The first group dislikes philosophy because they\u2019re so good at it: it\u2019s for them an actual profession, i.e. their thinking is on a level that takes the fun out of it.The latter group dislikes philosophy because they\u2019re so bad at it: thinking the \u201cbig questions\u201d is a fun hobby, so they can pretend to be \u201cprofound\u201d, i.e. they get annoyed when confronted by actual philosophy. \u2000\u2000Then again, quite a few people in general do entertain highly naive metaphysical beliefs about a lot of things and get annoyed when confronted by philosophy \u2014 but they probably do that every time their opinions are questioned and criticized, regardless of the topic. \u2000\u2000In current everyday understanding there is more bias against some sciences than others, e.g. humanistic sciences like philology are generally thought to have no rules whatsoever, i.e. knowledge about ancient languages is thought to be without value for understanding ancient cultures through their literary remains. This is probably because people in general have a strong tendency to instinctually simplify reality \u2014 the reality of different kinds of sciences and areas of knowledge contradicts their intuition, which can feel uncomfortable.\u2000\u2000People outside philosophy much more often have biased views about philosophy than e.g. nuclear physics. This is partly because the subject matter is different, i.e. nuclear physics is so outside everyday understanding, that non-professionals usually understand they don\u2019t understand it. Philosophy on the other hand has a much more closer relationship with everyday understanding: while the \u201cmatter\u201d of nuclear physics is nature outside man, the \u201cmatter\u201d of philosophy is nature inside man. \u2000\u2000Philosophy is closer to the world of man and people are inclined to think they always have a better understanding about the things which are nearer \u2014 even though the problem with philosophy is like looking for your eyeglasses when you\u2019re wearing them: the problem area of philosophy is so close that people mostly aren\u2019t conscious about it. When someone\u2019s naive metaphysics are confronted by actual philosophy, they\u2019ll accept it more grudgingly, since it\u2019s for them more difficult to understand, that they\u2019re not advanced thinkers on that topic.

            "answer_text": "Kierkegaard wrote \u201cPhilosophical Crumbs\u201d in 1844 when he was aged 31. He wrote in the preface, that any philosophy student could understand his book on reading it, but he doubted that they could reproduce it from memory. I wonder if this means that they didn't really understand it? Or does it mean that understanding is temporary and fleeting? I find myself in the same situation with most philosophy. I can't for the life of me remember what this or that philosopher said. And in fact I can't even begin to understand a lot of it. So I have to confess that I \u201cdon't like\u201d philosophy, but I feel a sympathy with a limited number of philosophers. Maybe this is because I am a dilettante rather than a serious student. ",

Many people don\u2019t like to think, and have this unthinking thinking: this is how authoritarian and totalitarian regimes can come and infect societies. Many people accept and do not question. Indeed philosophers John Gray and Alexander Herzen believed/ believes that humans do not actually want freedom at all but prefer the comfort of servitude. Indeed most philosophy, according to John N. Gray, has been a shame because it has unthinkingly been infected with religious thinking and faith instead of grounded reality and truth. ",

To compare philosophy to science is a strawman argument. The value of philosophy is not the discovery of new facts about the universe it is describing the universe in ways that humanity can understand and think about. Some scientist particularly in the above youtube link, seem to want all of us to think like scientists, to work as a scientist but I don\u2019t know what living like a scientist would look like. I can not live my life scientifically, but I can live it rationally and I can desire to become a little wiser from day today. I do not see becoming a little more scientific day to day as being practical or leading to a meaningful life. I am not saying that science is unimportant in our day to day lives, it touches upon almost everything we think, feel, and do\u2026 and we have to give unto science what is sciences, but scientism is not the only worldview.

If you any time connect philosophy to a shred of pedagogy or an intellectual specialization, the problem begins to brew. Can we make philosophy as simple as \u201cessential personal wisdom\u201d arising out of \u201cselective collection and conscious integration of emotive experiences\u201d? By this, we would have also modified the definition of \u201cwise knowledge\u201d to make it \u201cmost emotive\u201d, and \u201cleast academic\u201d. Acknowledging the fact that a common man may be endowed with more \u201cessential knowledge\u201d than most academicians or the most recognized academician could be the new beginning of the process of universal philosophizing of mankind. What the public has been resenting all these years is \u201cincarceration of philosophy in the academic campus\u201d which could be seen as its being hijacked by the \u201cnon-emotive intellect-simulating professionalism\u201d.
