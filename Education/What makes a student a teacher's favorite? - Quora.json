            "answer_text": "If you're in school, you spend most of your day in class with your teachers. If your teacher doesn't like you, or you don't get along, school can be extra difficult. Getting on your teacher's good side doesn't just mean getting good grades and sucking up, though. To be in the good books of your teacher you can follow the given steps and make your school life experience more fun and effective: Ask meaningful questions in class. Asking questions shows that you care about the subject matter. It also shows that you\u2019re paying attention. Asking questions is a great indicator of intelligence and a desire to learn.Complete all assignments on time. This one can be difficult if you have a lot of work, or if you tend to procrastinate. However, turning in assignments on time shows your teacher that you are prioritizing their class.Make extra efforts in your work. It\u2019s always good to do more than the bare minimum for an assignment. Extra efforts can include binding your paper in a nice way to make it more presentable, or doing extra research for an assignment.Ask for extra help if you need it. Asking for help shows your teacher that you want to succeed. Many teachers look for this quality in a student, because if you want to succeed you\u2019re likely to take their help and suggestions seriously.Respect the teacher\u2019s authority on a subject. Teachers have been through a lot of education and they have chosen a profession where they get to share their knowledge. You may know a lot about a subject as well, but teachers will appreciate if you treat them as the experts they are.Let your teacher know who you are. Teachers can tell when a student isn\u2019t being themselves. Never try to hide those things just to look like the perfect student.Be helpful to your teacher. Teaching can be difficult, and teachers get tired, just like you. If you notice that your teacher could use a hand, offer to help out. They\u2019ll definitely notice and appreciate your helpful attitude.I hope the information provided by me would be helpful for students to make their school life more productive and become teacher\u2019s favorite.

            "answer_text": "There's a difference between a good student who makes teaching so rewarding, a bad student, who is a class management nightmare, and a favorite student.I won't add anything new to the excellent comments other than my own experiences. My favorites could be a scruffy lost soul one year, and a braggadocios little snot the next year. I can't quantify who tugs at your heart, but what I always sensed was that they needed me more than the others. I don't know if it's done everywhere, but years ago when I was teaching fourth grade, all of the third and fourth grade teachers would meet at a table and talk about kids. Ack!!!! How terrible! In a tiny town there's a history and background knowledge that can support and enhance the learning experience for kids. The discussion would go something like this...Third grade teacher.\"James is from a broken home, he was out of school for months last year, but he's really a tough cookie and bright. He has a knack for stealing little things.\" Fourth grade teacher, \"Is he Mary's boy? I had her older son a few years back. I have a history with her. I'll take him.\"Third grade teacher....\"Annie's a chatterbox, she'll drive you nuts.\" Fourth grade teacher..\"Is there anyone she shouldn't be in class with?\" Third grade teacher...\"Diane! Don't put them together! They'll talk nonstop!\" Fourth grade teacher..\"I'll take them both. They could be my movers and shakers this year!\"Are you following this? As we've all stated many times, teachers are human and like and dislike as others do. Matching to the teacher's personality can be just as positive and productive. Some teachers are mother figures, others strict rulers, others easy going, and some, like me, in the middle. P.S. I love, love, love a kid with a sense of humor!!! ",
