            "answer_text": "I would say pretty average . I myself am a graduate from NITK and i have finished my CSE course. People usually complain about the bad quality of the professors , and i would partially agree with them. I could write a seperate answer why they arent bad. Every candidate joins this course with one main intention - MONEY. After hearing all those stories of placements with salaries 30Lakh+ , almost everybody forgets what they like and choose this course (not me, i loved computers and had interest in it from a very young age). Anyways coming back to the experience , Most of the students join clubs ( CSI ,IEEE) and spend time coding on codechef , Spoj , Hackerrank etc. The profs are lazy AF so we end up having just 2 to 3 classes every day. There is too much competition to score a decent pointer ( greater than 7 ) . Most of the students just come to class just for the sake of 75 % attendance and sleep in last bench , browse on social networking sites in phone , chat with chicks etc. The profs rarely teach and end up sending their research scholars to teach. No real teachings goes on for labs too . People just memorise codes for subjects like operating systems , computer graphics , compiler design and vomit it in 3 hrs lab exam . Basically , choose this course only if you have full interest in Computers or think that you might become interested in computers . You will enjoy this course only if the above condition is fulfilled. I hope you found this answer hopeful A proud NITian Shashank Kumar IITJEE 2011 AIR 1231 ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a student in NITK Surathkal CSE from the past 3 years. I feel that CSE is the WORST department in Nitk Surathkal ( ECE and Civil Department have good profs ). All the stories you hear about great achievement s ( 30 lpa CTC , 100 % placements) is only because of the intelligent and handworking students of the department . The profs are useless and play no role in the success stories . Most of the students join clubs ( CSI ,IEEE) and spend time coding on codechef , Spoj , Hackerrank etc. The profs are lazy AF so we end up having just 2 to 3 classes every day. There is too much competition to score a decent pointer ( greater than 7 ) . Most of the students just come to class just for the sake of 75 % attendance and sleep in last bench , browse on social networking sites in phone , chat with chicks etc. The department boasts of 50+ electives but end up offering same set of useless electives as the profs have no knowledge about other awesome electives. The profs rarely teach and end up sending their research scholars to teach. No real teachings goes on for labs too . People just memorise codes for subjects like operating systems , computer graphics , compiler design and vomit it in 3 hrs lab exam . Some people take CSE just because they want to get 30 lakh placement and later struggle to pass and clear the semester. You should take CSE only if truly love programming and ready to spend hours wasting time in class , coding in the night , self study to pass the exams and prepare hard for interviews . PS : I would recommend IT over CS as its much more chill , easy to get into and you end up with same job offers . Follow @Ashish Kedia for more info on competitive coding and nitk ",

Some of the highlights from the latest revised curriculum:- You will be divided into classes as per your branches. No more studying courses from other branches. Physics , Chemistry and Maths are as per your requirements in your own branch.Like in Physics for CS- IT , It was about quantum computers,Nano-Technology, Optoelectronics, Magnetic disks storage etc.Similarly in Chemistry we had Computational Chemistry. By the end of first year, we have completed data structures,Object Oriented Programming,Web designing,Basics of programming and Digital system design.These things are important for working on project and even for getting internship. Complete 6th semester is devoted for Internship/Training/project. Similar is the curriculum for other branches as well. This is the latest syllabus for Computer Engineering:- New B.Tech (CO)Scheme & Syllabi.pdf ",
