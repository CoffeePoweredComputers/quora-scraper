            "answer_text": "School years are fun. You complete your 12th board exams and are out there in the open trying to get admission into a good college. When you finally join a college you most probably join a hostel and even if you don't you are definitely exposed to a new environment. You make new friends and also meet girls and it is pretty natural to fall in love with someone. But whenever you are in a relationship just make sure you and your partner do not lose focus on your careers and give each other enough time and space so that you could grow individually as well as complement each other's growth. You will eventually learn how to love someone in ways you never thought you actually could. You will be a better person with many memories to cherish. Someone to the spend the evenings with, bombarding each other with your thoughts as the sun sets, watching you both together in the sweet silence. Someone to love you irrespective of your shortcomings and respecting the good in you. Someone to fight with and later ending up realizing how stupid you both were. Someone to travel places and help you explore broader dimensions of life. It is definitely a roller coaster ride but worth it if when you look back you are amazed at how you both have improved as a person. Love is beautiful as long as you do not hurt yourself and your career in the process. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly its nothing to do with right or wrong. Its how you deal with all that a relationship brings to your life. There are 2 sides to this. On one side being in a relationship is an amazing thing. Yes its fun to be with somebody who makes you feel good about yourself (of course you have to love yourself as well) and to enjoy the many new experiences of life together is the cherry on the cake. The flip side to it though is that at times we may take this relationship thing to a very different level and then break-ups, unfulfilled expectaions, responsibilities or even moving away for career or studies might create major obstacles in your growth. In college you are still at a place where you don\u2019t know yourself much and keep changing. Just like the other person. So many a times these commitments dont last forever and bring pain with it. Having the knowlege of this is important for you to decide for yourself whether you want to be in a relationship or not. ",
