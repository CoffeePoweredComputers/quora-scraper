            "answer_text": "First, anthropologists prefer ethnography because it is the methodology that has defined the field from early on.  Basically, from the time of Bronislaw Malinowski, anthropologists have seen ethnography as the only wholly legitimate way of understanding a culture.  As the Wikipedia entry on Malinowski notes, he brought anthropology down \"off of the veranda\" and into daily contact with them people's everyday life as the only way to understand \"imponderabilia of everyday life\".  Anything less than immersion in the culture that ethnography entails is inadequate.  Thus anthropology is steeped in use of ethnography as part of the history and identity of the field. Second, anthropologists like myself continue to feel that ethnography brings true value to the understanding of social and cultural phenomena.  It is important to note that there is great pressure to adapt more quantitative methods, that are deductive and seen as more scientific, and indeed, some anthropologists have moved towards are primarily quantitative approach to research and hardly do any ethnography at all. Several of my own experiences highlight why I prefer the in-dept method of ethnography verses large-scale, quantitative surveys. 1.  When I conducted my own dissertation field work, I included semi-structured interviews as part of my research strategy.  This was useful, but after working through a series of questions and finishing an interview, informants would often then tell me what they really thought.  Also, the interviews were conducted in homes, and I lived in the village for a year.  I would also observe things in that context and overtime that would challenge or refine the answers given in interviews.  If I relied only on the survey materials, my results would have been very different.  In statistical terms, the surveys had great reliability, but lacked validity.  2.  Recently, I reviewed an article for publication that was funded by a major foundation grant.  A team of researchers interviewed thousands of subjects. Unfortunately, it was evident to me, that many of the wrong questions were asked because they were based on assumptions and not developed in the field.  Also, the researchers had trouble drawing many conclusions from their results because they lacked the depth of understanding that would result from ethnography.  Again, they had great statistical reliability, but validity was a problem.  They could say only what their very narrow survey asked.  Ultimately, it is not that such surveys are not useful, but that ethnography can help us ask the right questions and then follow up to know how to best interpret those results.   3.  I recall attending a Gerontology conference.  Most of the papers were dead boring to me.  Often tens of thousands of data points and complex statistical methods were used all of which led to a very narrow conclusion.  No doubt, many of these were valuable and of interest to others, but I found them lacking.  One presenter did ethnography and told the stories of people downsizing in old age.  He didn't have a scientific study, but he told compelling stories that helped me to understand the issues people face when moving out of homes into assisted living and nursing facilities.   Human society is very complex.  Quantitative research can help us to tease out important questions and answers, but I feel strongly that ethnography is critical to help us create questions and interpret answers.  We need to see things in context and over time in order to really understand them.  That remains as true now as when Malinowski realized it a century ago.   Consider:  Do you feel that when you complete a survey, someone gets you?  Do they get you as much as they would if they spent a year in your community attending events and talking to you and people you know?    Ethnography helps to keep us grounded, and to diffuse the air of certainty that sciences appear to give us.  That applies to large statistical studies, big data, and genetic sciences.  All are valuable, but none of them tell the whole story.  Ethnography seeks to tell the whole story, albeit only for one small place and one point in time. ",

Ethnography is a method for becoming part of the culture or group one wishes to understand.  Genevieve Bell (Intel) referred to it as 'deep hanging out'.  I think of it as a way of achieving inside-out understanding, often accumulated over time.  Most behavioral sciences use  the outside-in (lab observation, for example) approaches.  Useful, but greatly lacking in relevant contextual awareness. The output from ethnography has been referred to as 'thick' description:Thick description ",
