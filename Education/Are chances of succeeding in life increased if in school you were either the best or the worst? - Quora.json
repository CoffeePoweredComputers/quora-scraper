            "answer_text": "I think, mathematically, the best have much more chance of slipping as they start a new phase of life. The worst have much more chance of comparatively improving. The latter speaks to my personal experience. By the time I left high school I looked undistinguished among my peers. But by age 30 I had caught up with them economically and surpassed 90% of them by retirement. ",

The students who didn\u2019t attend on average had lower grades. So I think that a good or bad school is important but is less important than the effort you put in as a student. ",
