            "answer_text": "We often hear our teachers saying that to score well in English 1 paper, try to score your best in the grammar section. Even I remember how my teacher used to advice our class to aim for fetching full marks 20/20 in grammar section. So here is an advice for you. Take one of the type. Let's say tenses(Filling the correct word). Now begin reading through your major textbook prescribed by your school - Wren and Martin OR Joseph and Myells . After going through all the rules, start practicing exercises from the very book (S) that you referred earlier but before that go through the examples given. Now what next, then go on practicing the same topic from total English which I find to be the best for practicing. Similarly go through all the topics. When you are done with all types of questions, start solving test papers from total English, ten years papers and another book 100%success From evergreen publications. You need to prepare a proper schedule for doing all these because it can't be grabbed in one day . Moreover practice from question papers available on internet. One of the useful website is : An approach to icse English Remain in contact with your teacher for help and correction. English is just like maths. It demands constant practice. Do refer to prelim papers of other schools which you can get on ResPaper Homepage Thanks!!! All the best for your boards!!! Hope it helps... :) ",

It's simple, there will always be questions on sentence conversion, prepositions. These questions are quite predictable. Once you solve enough papers and practise enough you'll know the answers to these question for sure. This will get you 80% of the marks. The rest my friend completely depends on your luck. If you read a lot and are natively English speaking then you have an advantage for these   are unpredictable. You still must practise a lot. Search for sentences and grammar exercises online, answer them, but most importantly, carefully check your responses, correct them and note all your incorrect responses in a notebook. After 2-3 exercises, learn up the correct answers and move on progressively , decreasing the repetition of similar blunders. Good luck and study hard! ",

So, I would strongly recommend you to read English newspapers as they contain news which are related to past as well as future also. In addition, do prefer your course book and obviously refer to your notes given by your teacher. Practice is the most important thing. Just as we require practice for maths same we require here. Just try to grab more sentences like related to active passive voice, direct indirect speeches etc. And then practice them. Hope it will help. Thank you. ",
