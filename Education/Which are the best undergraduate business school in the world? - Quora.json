            "answer_text": "Wharton is widely accepted as the best undergrad business school overall. It has the best finance program, too, according to most surveys and league tables. But, lately, the Haas School of Business of the University of California has been gaining a lot of publicity as it's been challenging Wharton in some surveys and ranking games. According to payscale.dom, a survey institution that collects data of employed alumni of possibly all colleges and universities in America, Berkeley Haas graduates are now earning higher than all its peers including Wharton. It has, for about half a decade running now, the best employment success record. It's also the most difficult business school to get into, according the Poets & Quants report, and has the best success rate of alumni being able to get into the top graduate business schools. Wharton's strength is finance and Berkeley Haas' is entrepreneurship. Haas grads count the most when it comes to alumni who founded their own startup companies. In my view, Wharton has got an edge over Berkeley Haas in the East Coast and the reverse is true in the West Coast. Wharton is well-connected to Wall Street and Berkeley Haas has an obvious prominence and advantage in the West, specially in Silicon Valley. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are the results of our latest ranking of undergraduate business programs. Frankly, this is the best ranking for business majors out there. Much better than U.S. News which uses only one data report\u2014a poll of deans and professors who pretty much fill those surveys out as if it\u2019s a popularity contest. I created the original MBA ranking at Businessweek in 1988 and am a former executive editor of Businessweek and a former editor-in-chief of Fast Company magazine. So you can rest assured that our ranking is carefully done and thoughtfully executed. I would not rely on the AACSB list of accredited programs. While it\u2019s important for a school to be accredited, it\u2019s hardly a sign of a great school or program because so many schools are accredited and the AACSB makes no attempt to measure quality and compare one program to another.
