            "answer_text": "I assume your on-line class is not conducted in real time but where the study material of the unit is posted on a site where students can access it and work at their own time. If the latter (Not real time) is the case, here are some suggestions on how you may stay on top of your on-line class each week. Prepare a study time-table \u2014 At the commencement of the semester, prepare a study time-table for your study each week for each subject enrolled. Revise time where needed to suit you.Actual study \u2014 For the topic assigned for each week on a given subject, read and understand the aims and objectives for the topic. What does the lecturer want you to learn for that week? Quickly skim through the content of the study material posted for the topic (lecture notes). Read the required readings (related literature for the topic of that week). Listen to the lecture podcast if available. Then return to the study material and read slowly but discriminatedly with the aim to understand the content and ask as you read what the lecturer really wants you to learn from that topic. Make succinct notes on the topic \u2014 that becomes your notes of what you have learned that topic \u2014 use this for revision. Improve notes where needed.When to study each week - Do the above if possible at the begining of each week, so it gives you time to complete your learning of the topic assigned for that week. It may take you 2, 3 or even more study sessions in a week to do that.Choose Best time to study \u2014 Decide what you feel as the \u2018best' time to do your study. Ensure you have planned for short break in each study session \u2014 these breaks are important to give you time to rest and recharged mentally. Help you to work efficiently.Efficient study time \u2014 learn to concentrate fully during the 40\u201345 minutes for each study session and then allow yourself a 10 mins break.Planned R & R \u2014 Ensure you have planned for free/exercise time as well as Rest and Recreation for your time-table for each week.Perseverance and determination - Do your best to observe your study time-table and you will fall into a routine with practice, determination and perseverance. Best wishes!",

Some tips which I personally found effective are as follows : 1 try to make notes during the class only not before not after that it will save your note mking time and these notes will be very good as you made them on Spot according to whatever thing you get during your class 2 try to synchronise your study and study same topic on the day its taught to you 3 try to switch off all notification of apps during online lectures so that you don't get distracted 4 try to attend lecturea on full screen so that you don't see anything else or side by side 5 Try to revise and practice same topic on same day at least twice 6 Take break frequently (like 10 to 15 minutes) so that you can easily maintain your productivity 7 As you have to only sit and study so try to eat more salad and less carbohydrates and eat less because if you eat more all oxygen will go stomach to digest the food and you will not be able to concentrate properly THANK YOU\ud83d\ude42 STAY HOME, STAY SAFE \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42 ",

            "answer_text": "We are living in an advanced world. If you are not good at technology then you cannot compete with others. We watch movie of two to three hours without a single minute break. If you take a break then also hardly for 20\u201330 minutes. And then you complete the movie. It is because your mind is developed to it. You know that you have to watch it and have no other means to watch the movie. Same is the case with our online studies. First you should let your mind understand that this is our generation study. Only books and physical teacher will not suffice. Also they will not be available with you all the time. Then you just get a laptop or mobile or tablet and start online classes. First you will not excel. But give yourself daily exposure to it for fixed times of your day. Suppose you watch classes for 1 hour in a day. Try to increase your hours daily. And one day will arrive when you don\u2019t get bored watching classes. Thanks Hope you get your desired answer. ",
