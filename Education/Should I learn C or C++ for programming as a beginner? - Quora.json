            "answer_text": "At the beginner stage, it really doesn't matter. You can start with either and still switch to the other anytime you want to. But if you are aiming for some advanced topics, then you will have to be picky. Like, if it is a compiler you wish to make, or a kernel of an Operating System, or program a microelectronic, then it is C. On the other hand, if you are interested to make core UI for operating systems, or make graphical programs, it is C++. Both languages can be used for memory management. If I had to pick, I would go with C++. The reason is, although there are some things that can only be done using C, those are some really low level and advanced stuff. You probably won\u2019t even hear about them while learning the basics. And since C++ is a bridge between sequential programming and OOP, you are essentially learning two different paradigms. And the best part is, almost all the basic libraries or header files used in C and their C++ version. So you can use cstdio.h to use printf(), scan(), etc. in C++. But the opposite is not possible. C++ also supports Graphical Interface, and it has been used to make one of the most powerful graphics engine, OpenGL. So, at the beginner and intermediate stage, you cannot be wrong with C++. But to be fair, the language may seem easy at first, but it is one of the lowest level languages out there. It is hard, and many of the things present in other higher languages for granted has to be implemented by the programmer him/herself. And the same goes for C as well. So, if you do wish to go deep into C++, or C, I suggest you enroll yourself at Holberton School, an excellent place to learn to program. The faculties here have years of experience and are very dedicated. They will teach you about programming, starting from the basics, all the way to advanced and professional levels. ",

            "answer_text": "C++ is an Object Oriented Programming language derived from C. Before you start learning any of those languages you will have to learn programming basics like data structures and basic programming concepts like loops, if/else statements, variables, functions and so on. Those basics are the same in both languages. After You are good with the basics You can start trying to write something more complex and at this point you will start going into differences between both languages. In a bit of simplification a structural programming (C) is telling computer step by step what it should do while operating on simple types like int - numbers, float - numbers with decimal point and char * - text (this is a very large oversimplification, please read more on pointers as this is a complex subject) . Then you tell the computer what to do with them step by step. In OOP (C++) you build more complex data structures called Objects which hold many simple and complex variables inside, but also can have methods which can do something with that object or other objects. For example you can create an object called Book in library application, and that book can hold information about author, title, number of pages, year of publishing, and can have method that will return this all as line of text for you to put on the screen. Programming in such environment manipulates those objects to match your programming need. Of course there is a lot more to that than this, but I just want to show You that there are different approaches to solving same problems. The core programming language beneath is roughly the same, but what is built on it is a bit different. Personally If I were you, I would first try to learn the basics - does not really matter which language you choose. After you master them, choose the programming method that speaks to you more. C++ is newer and is a lot richer than simple C and as such it will require more learning. Just Remember that on top of whatever language you choose there is a large see beyond that which consist of libraries, build scripts and development tools that go so much further than just the language. Learning programming is not just learning language, but all that is needed to finish a project, and that is much broader all together. Learning the language is just the first step, and not really the largest one. Good luck :) ",
