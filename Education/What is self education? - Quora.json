            "answer_text": "Drawing on my own experience, self-education is basically a self-directed, life-long and life-wide learning process, based on one's own chosen interests. My own learning pursuit actually started after I was given the book, 'Peak Learning', by Ronald Gross, as a gift by my PhotoReading co-developer and lead instructor, also my sensei, Patricia Danielson, from New England, USA back in the early 90's. In the ensuing year or so, I encountered another fine book, 'Self-University', by Charles Hayes. One of my three initial entrepreneurial projects after leaving the corporate world for good during the early 90's was setting up of an unique bookstore, aptly called 'The Brain Resource', which helped to fuel - and bankroll - my self-education through books, audios, videos, and other related resources.  It came under the umbrella of my registered company, 'Optimum Performance Technologies', which also included my strategy consulting and training development outfits, with seminar/workshop promotion. What I had learned in my self-education - I often like to call it, \"Learning from the Masters\" -  went naturally into my strategy consulting and training development, which served as convenient \"testing grounds\". That's how I got my moniker, Knowledge Adventurer & Technology Explorer, which I have used till today. In my view, the most important prerequisite in self-education is the drawing up of a learning agenda or game plan, with specific goals and objectives, metrics for measuring progress, myriad resources needed to produce results, and a timetable.   It should be evolving in order to keep it relevant to changing times and market dynamics. My personal interests, as part of my self-education, is very broad, almost from A to Z: accelerated self-growth, brainpower maximisation, cognitive fitness, through multiple intelligences, opportunity recognition, problem finding, all the way to X-factor development, yoga and zestful energy engineering. In the process, I have had the wonderful opportunity to meet many \"giants on whose shoulders I now stand\", who became great friends or associates. Compared to my early years in the early 90's, the implementaion and execution of self-education today is much breezier and faster and even cheaper, especially with Google search engine and the Internet, even though self-learners today have ostensibly more digital distractions. Nonetheless, to end this post, I like to take this opportunity to append a quick round-up of incredible resources for self-education and lifelong learning online: http://www.diygenius.com/100-self-education-resources-for-lifelong-learners/ http://www.diygenius.com/mind-expanding-documentaries/ http://www.diygenius.com/biohacking-genius-documentary/ ",
