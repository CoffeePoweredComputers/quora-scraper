            "answer_text": "It depends on where you live, country wise, I believe. But usually, for the most part, in the United States, high school contains 4 grade levels. Ninth GradeTenth GradeEleventh GradeTwelfth GradeTwelfth Grade is when you graduate in American high-school. For some students, they graduate a year or a year and a half early. In that case their high school career lasted 3 years to 3 and a half years depending on if they graduated that fall for that spring with the then, current graduating class. Many high schools offer an early graduation plan, typically a student would \u201cskip\u201d a year but taking double classes (or at least my school does). For example, if a ninth grader wanted to graduate in 3 years, the spring semester of that same school year, they\u2019d meet with their counselor and discuss the classes they\u2019d take their tenth grade year. That following fall semester they\u2019d still be considered a tenth grader, they would just be a tenth grader taking tenth and eleventh grade classes. Then the fall after their tenth grade year, they\u2019d be considered a senior and they can graduate in the spring. ",

            "answer_text": "The majority of high schools in the USA are four years, 9th through 12th grades. The grades are given names, 9th grade is freshman, 10th is sophomore, 11th is junior and 12th is senior. Probably 98% of students and parents refer to the grades by name. In some areas the high schools are grades 10 to 12, with the grade/names the same as the four year high school. The decision to be a three or four year high school is determined by the local school board. Those boards usually follow city boundaries but may be governed by a county or parish. In some areas there may even be special districts formed. ",

I've heard of high school as being 9 - 12, middle school as 6 - 8, and elementary was 1 - 5. I guess it all depends on what your district calls it. But it will most likely be 4 years or 3 years.
