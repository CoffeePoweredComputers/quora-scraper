I think it is a very stupid phrase. For example, let\u2019s say you took your car to a dealership, asked the attendant to wash the outside, clean the windows, vacuum the inside and check the tire pressure. However, when they finished, you noticed that they only rinsed the outside, didn\u2019t clean the windows, did a poor job vacuuming and didn\u2019t check the tires. Is that your fault? No. It is the attendant\u2019s job for not paying attention/remembering what you told them to do. Teaching kids is a bit different, but the premise is still there. Yes the kids need to pay attention, but also the teacher has a responsibility to get their message across to the kids. Often that means they will need to get creative. I think a lot of the problem with kids not learning or not paying attention in class is a lack of structure, which usually starts at home. I would much prefer this question: \u201cIf students are continually disruptive in class and refuse to learn/listen to the teachers, then the parents should shoulder the responsibility of correcting their child\u2019s behavior.\u201d HINT: It isn\u2019t the teacher\u2019s job to parent your child. I have several family members who are teachers of various ages. A lot of parents literally treat a school as a place where they can drop their kids off and they come back home smarter and with good manners. Disruptive/disrespectful behavior is almost exclusively(in their experience) linked to kids who come from a broken home or who have parents more interested in being their kids best friend than actually being an authority figure in their lives.

            "answer_text": "It's just another attempt to transfer responsibility for learning from the student to the teacher. Something that has been going on for years. It makes students appear as though they are morons that can't learn anything on their own, but require a teacher to spoon feed them information. This is of course completely false. For some odd reason people frequently do not want to take responsibility for their own actions and lives. It is decidedly more convenient to blame others. A teacher cannot open the head of a human being and pour information into it. A teacher cannot force someone to learn and retain information. Learning is not a passive process. For example, if you want to learn calculus or abstract algebra then practice. in other words activity. Don't practice and the student will typically perform poorly on the test, perhaps even fail. I had a few very difficult professors as an undergrad. I learned the most from them because they challenged me every class meeting. I'm not saying that there aren't terrible teachers, but they are the exception and typically few in number. Most truly terrible teachers don't make long in the profession. They usually end up in some other line of work, one way or another. In fact, I had one terrible teachers and I still managed to learn. A good teacher facilitates learning. They can\u2019t guarantee it. That comes from the student. ",
