            "answer_text": "If you are not choosing LPU for MBA, make sure you are into IIMs or the deemed government business schools of India.Lovely Professional University has an amazing infrastructure with experienced faculty giving holistic education to their students. The placement cell is also well-organized and regularly places their candidates into the biggest names in the corporate world. I did MBA from LPU and LPU is helping me grow professionally and personally with its career-oriented programs and support.I would say ,The Business School of LPU is accredited from (ACBSP) Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs from the USA ensuring quality education and industry experienced faculties, studying in LPU will get a degree accredited from a body of USA.LPU has recently Marked among Top 50 Best Management Institutes by NIRF ranking 2020. Also, LPU has won National Employability Award 2020.

Professors go for value-based education which is something we as professionals would require in our career. Guest lectures by experts and some really successful people are arranged by our department to widen our scope of learning. If I talk about faculty,Most of faculty members are from IIM or from elite B- Schools (India/Abroad. They have decade of experience. Faculty was really helping.

They have ample of specializations in MBA and also provides dual specializations.The course offers specialization offerings in Marketing, Finance, Human Resource, Information Technology, International Business, Financial Markets, Operations, Retail Management, Entrepreneurship, Hospital and Healthcare Management. and many more.More than 30 clubs to choose from. Clubs are good place for freshers to know how to work in teams and achieving a goal in a given time. LPU provide enough exposure to students so that one can stand well in coming era of his/her life. Also, in my view, I think you should not worry about the placements. If you work hard in the course and learn as much as you can, any company visiting the campus would be happy to hire you. However, you must not neglect polishing your communication skills as well, because companies will check that in their interviews. LPU provides plenty of opportunities to its students to take part in events, competitions, fests in order to let them grow their personality and give them a chance to polish their skills. Many students are placed in reputed companies in different cities and some are placed in abroad too.more than 150 companies including ITC, Asian Paints, HDFC, Federal Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Moodys Analytics, WNS Global etc and so on recruiting MBA students on an yearly basis with highest package in MBA at 21 Lakh Per Annum and on a average package will be 4LPA TO 6 LPA with nearly 90 % placement rates. LPU keeps improving and increasing it placements packages year on year. Even the number of recruiters visiting the campus increase every year. LPU provides different classes for placements which helps in grooming. Students are trained in Aptitude, Reasoning, free preparation for Govt Exams, Soft Skills and language training, Interview skills right from the 1st year, continuously for 2/3/4( duration of course) years till they get the job. A new program in tie-up with Talent Edge has been started.This program is having pre-placement offer at the time of Admission (provided student clears the interview). LPU offers Study Abroad Programme that allows the students to experience the international study culture well under the framework of a different educational system abroad.
