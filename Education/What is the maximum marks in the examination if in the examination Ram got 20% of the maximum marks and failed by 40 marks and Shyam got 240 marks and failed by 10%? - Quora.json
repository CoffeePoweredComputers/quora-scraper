            "answer_text": "Let maximum marks be X. Let passing parks by Y. Ram's marks = 20% of X. Shyam's marks = 240. Ram fails with 40 marks, thus Y - 20% of x = 40 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 eq 1 Shyam Fails with 10% marks, thus Y - 240 = 10% of X \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 eq 2 Now, solving eq 1 & 2, Y - 0.2 X = 40 Y - 0.1 X = 240 Therefore, X = 2000 Thus, Maximum marks are 2000. Passibg marks are 440, Ram's marks are 400 while Shyam's marks are 240. ",
