            "answer_text": "I took further maths A-level, along with Physics and AS-level German. When I was your age, maths was my favourite subject, but I thought I wanted to do either Physics, Astrophysics or Engineering as a degree and never considered maths. Well, I'm now in my second year of a 4 year maths course, completely in love with it, and if I hadn't done further maths, I wouldn't be in this situation (further maths really sparked my love of the subject). My point is, it's difficult to know what you'll do for a degree when taking GCSEs, you've got a lot of learning still to come, so I'd take what you enjoy and are good at, while keeping the future only in the back of your mind. If you like maths enough, and are on for top grades in maths (A* when I took GCSE), then definitely take further maths. From my experience, universities really like to see that you've done further maths, and it is required by many \u2018top\u2019 universities for courses in maths, physics or engineering. In the end, it's completely your choice. Talk to teachers, current students of further maths, students of bioengineering/ actuarial science if you can, take advice from people, but make it your decision. All the best ",
