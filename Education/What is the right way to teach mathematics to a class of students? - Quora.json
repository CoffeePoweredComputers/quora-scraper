            "answer_text": "I find I'm mentioning John Saxon and Jaime Escalante a lot the last few days. That's because these two guys were great educators and great teachers. They were extremely effective at bringing all the students in their classes along. Anything they say, you can trust it. Saxon was particularly emphatic in lots of different subjects, from reading to math, that you have to break the subject down into the bits and pieces that the students could most easily and quickly grasp. You make sure everyone has mastered this piece, then you test, then you review, then you move on to the next piece. I think that both these guys loved math and loved their students. We can't say that about the people behind Common Core. Quite the opposite. Mona McNee, in the UK, called her phonics program \"Step-by-Step.\u201d Because, she said, children want to learn step-by-step, with mastery and control at each step, before you go forward to the next step. Joan Dunn taught in Brooklyn in the 1950s. She echoes the same sentiments and techniques but she specifically said it's the dullest kids who need them the most. Wow, I have to say this made a tremendous impression on me. When I almost flunked calculus at the college level, I was one of the dullest kids. So I knew exactly what she was talking about. Me. I hated it. Everyone wants to feel that they are in control. The great Joan Dunn in her own words: \"Further, the children suffer academically because learning is neglected, and the time that should have been devoted to school work in reading, writing, thinking, and speaking is given over to chatter. Nobody knows this better than the children. They want to be taught step by step, so that they can see their progress. The duller they are, the more important and immediate is this need.\" So that they can see their progress\u2026Yes! (John Saxon is famous as the writer and publisher of text books on many subjects.. Jaime Escalante is the guy who taught calculus to kids from the barrio. They made a movie about him: Stand and Deliver\u2026 Both men are heroes.) ",
