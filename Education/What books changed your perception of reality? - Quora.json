            "answer_text": "It's definitely THE FABRIC OF REALITY by DAVID DEUTSCH. For David Deutsch, a young physicist of unusual originality, quantum theory contains our most fundamental knowledge of the physical world. Taken literally, it implies that there are many universes \u201cparallel\u201d to the one we see around us. This multiplicity of universes, according to Deutsch, turns out to be the key to achieving a new worldview, one which synthesizes the theories of evolution, computation, and knowledge with quantum physics. Considered jointly, these four strands of explanation reveal a unified fabric of reality that is both objective and comprehensible, the subject of this daring, challenging book. The Fabric of Reality explains and connects many topics at the leading edge of current research and thinking, such as quantum computers (which work by effectively collaborating with their counterparts in other universes), the physics of time travel, the comprehensibility of nature and the physical limits of virtual reality, the significance of human life, and the ultimate fate of the universe. Here, for scientist and layperson alike, for philosopher, science-fiction reader, biologist, and computer expert, is a startlingly complete and rational synthesis of disciplines, and a new, optimistic message about existence.   These are my personal views. Any resemblance to others' views, present or past is purely coincidental. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cInto the Wild\u201d The movie \u2018Into the Wild\u2019 starring Emile Hirsch led me to its book and believe me it just opened up my mind. The story is about a guy named \u2018Christopher McCandless\u2019 who, even after having everything a guy can ask for (love, money, education), is so sick of his life because of the way the world works.  The way every human being just compete with one another, the way no one feel pleased by seeing someone else successful, the way there is no peace and harmony anymore\u2026 He decides to give up all the materialistic possession and go on his own into the wild. The book covers his impeccable journey across North America and his life spent in the Alaskan wilderness in the early 1990s; where he finally finds himself and the peace long lost. Instead of continuing the explanation, I would recommend you to read the book or at least watch the click. Certainly a movie worth all the glory! Thank me after you feel that inner transformation and the change regarding the perception. (From the session: Breakup and Breakthroughs) Hope that answers. Thanks for the A2A, Jhon Robert Crebillo .
