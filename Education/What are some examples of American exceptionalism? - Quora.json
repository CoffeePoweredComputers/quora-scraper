            "answer_text": " There are many things about the U.S. which have changed the world. Many of these were concepts, ideas, and innovations. Other things the U.S. never has gotten right and continues to struggle with. This is the case with most nations, just not on the same scale of difference or effect. The U.S. only took about 175 years to become only one of two superpowers in 1945. And when the U.S. would in 1991 become the World\u2019s only Super Power. This is something Americans should be proud of. The fact that Medicines, Antibiotics and novel approaches to solving human suffering were pioneered in the U.S. is another set of endeavors which the U.S. led the way in. In Computer technology, there simply is no other nation which can even claim to have contributed more in the Modern Era than the U.S., from Hardware to the basis of Software these are all initial American innovations. Yet even with such great contributions, the U.S. fails in many areas and these areas if one is unlucky enough to be brought face to face with them, may change their view of America quite rapidly. American exceptionalism is there along with great inadequacies.    American Innovations America has been plagued with Racism, inequality and prejudice against people of color from it\u2019s inception. Thought it would become the world\u2019s first Modern Republic it would fail to advance the cause of human rights to it\u2019s full potential. At the same time, through innovation and immense effort, the U.S. would give the world scientific breakthroughs which the whole world enjoys today. These gifts have saved billions of lives and increased living standards through out the world. I will not attempt to balance contributions against short comings as statistics can be flawed when human impact is assessed. A victim of racism, does not care about statistics; for them statistically the answer is 100% in their experience. For another person who may have been treated very unfairly in one aspect of life may be saved by medical innovation, the very meaning of discrimination, must be weighed against the fact that their life has been saved. To mitigate this is simply not possible in a meaningful way as the variables are endless. And this how the American Experience is for many people, it is a mixed bag, and today these experiences matter more as the world is reverting back to multipolar world economically.   U.S. contributions however, have now found themselves being used throughout the world in a way in which they have become part of the global landscape. They have in fact paved the way for a return to a precolonial economic reality. In the coming century the progress all of humanity will make will be partly because of the discoveries made in the U.S. At the same time, the U.S. is not done in contributing to the world. Entire industries today, owe their inception to the U.S. and these provide jobs and opportunities globally. Yet the U.S. seems to be in a state of decline, and this seems to be coming from the very tensions which have for so long been left unremedied. While the U.S. is a global player still, a great feeling has spread in the U.S. that too many tasks remain unaccomplished in the U.S. A distrust of the Government exists, false reasons for the invasions of other nations and endless war efforts have caused people to loose faith in the purpose of America. Race relations feel like they continue to decline even after the election of a an African American President. The very office of the President is not viewed by respect by a large percentage of Americans. A decline in values continues, and the U.S. today does not feel like the same country it did 30 years ago. Optimism has gone away.   The U.S. incarcerates more people than any nation in the world, and most of these people are people of color. They argument that they simply commit more crimes does not hold weight, instead they are more likely to be arrested to begin with. Then they are more likely to be denied bail, and thus forced to plea bargain themselves into guilt. The truth is that they get harsher sentences, and are more likely to be shipped to prison than given alternatives. The effects of this, ripple through American Society. It still maintains a racial divide just now it is done by felonizing minorities rather than through outright and overt discrimination. It seems the more things change the more the remain the same in effect. Endless wars have not remedied America\u2019s problems. In fact it maintains the same alliances it did before 9/11 with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the two nations most closely linked with the terror attacks. And today, the U.S. is negotiating with the Taliban in Afghanistan to handover or create a power sharing agreement. Iraq was invaded in 2003, under the accusation of having weapons of mass destruction, none were found. In fact it appears the evidence was all fabricated. Though much has been said that Iraq\u2019s oil was not a factor, no definitive accounting of where Iraq oil Wealth has gone in the past 14 years has been offered. Once more exceptionalism is not present in any real way here.  The U.S. has been dominated by interests, offshore money, and corporations, instead of genuine public interest. The problem has become worse, and those in small business and brick and mortar companies can attest to this. No real remedy has been offered, rather Trade Deals and Wall Street reform have largely benefited only the narrow interests of those who already were benefiting before. The view has become all the more common and the implications have just begun to show themselves.  The U.S. has reached a turning point, either it must decide to see and really face it\u2019s problems or these problems shall become so large that no matter how great future exceptionalism is in specific fields, it will not be able to outweigh the negative aspects of the republic. One only needs to look at history, Rome fell not because of outside threats alone, it fell because it simply became over extended and it\u2019s moral fabric declined to a point where it lost purpose. The India Mughal Empire which in 1707 was the wealthiest Empire on the planet with almost 33% of Global G.D.P. collapsed because of the unequal treatment of it\u2019s subjects, not because of lack of success. The U.S. may be in a similar predicament today. To compound the situation, the very mention of humanitarian principles in the U.S. draws very negative comments from a large array of the public. American exceptionalism could be saved, but so far the change needed to do so has not shown itself. ",

            "answer_text": "The attitude or the actual \"we're exceptional\" part?   First, let me state, that the USA is \"special\", just like every other nation on earth. There are things about us that make us different.  Some things we do better than most.  Other's we do far worse.  Still, in a good number of things, we do just about the same as other comparable nations.   Exceptionally, the USA punches way ahead of its weight in the \"cutting-edge industry, business model creation, R&D development\" area simply because of a few reasons: Existing education and investment infrastructure.  The USA has a military-created Silicon Valley, and really amazing universities that can charge astronomical fees to students.  Flexible labor markets.  Companies can fire and hire at will.  No real protections.  Cultural obsession with \"making it\", independence, risk-taking, and entrepreneurialism.  Many nations like India and China (clearly future economic \"superpowers\") have a cultural aversion to risk-taking because younger generations are expected to care for older ones; any risk they take, they take for the whole family.  Giant vacuum that sucks up the world's \"best\" at a great number of things.  Half the IT resumes I look at are from India and China.  I get huge numbers from Poland, Germany, Canada, Brazil, the UK and elsewhere.  People who want to be rich, have a habit of coming here to do so.  That's something the USA does \"exceptionally\".   But if you're looking for the \"American Exceptionalism\" attitude (like, \"We're better than everybody!  Hoo-rah!\"), just turn on FoxNews. You'll see a ton of it.   It usually can be seen in spades on the \"Sean Hannity\" show.  He loves to use the line, \"The greatest nation that has ever existed in the history of mankind.\"  I've watched snippets of the show enough to hear him spread blatantly false nonsense that tugs on the heart-strings of \"Exceptionists\" (as it were).  It's usually: We are the most giving nation on earth -- well, yes, in raw dollars that may be true, but that's because we have 315 million people and 20% of the world's wealth.  Per capita \"giving\" is not at the top.  We have the greatest track-record of spreading democracy -- again, likely true.  But, then, the USA also has a really long track-record of toppling it when it doesn't work out and otherwise shrinking that wonderful record that most Americans either don't know about or run away from.  God has blessed the USA so that we can lead the world -- like, minerals and arable land.  Because, God moved the continents and killed a bunch of plants and animals and buried them underground to become oil/coal over the course of a bazillion years to prepare the way for us, the new Zion.  The USA is a Christian nation and those who reject God are doing so out of hubris -- Won't even go there.  He's too stupid to even know how wrong he is.",
