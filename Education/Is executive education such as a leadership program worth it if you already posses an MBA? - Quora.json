            "answer_text": "Indian MBAs are attended by freshers or young people with a very limited experience, generally with an average experience 1-2 years. Internationally, MBAs are attended by more mature students, with an average experience of 5 years and average age of 28 years. An Executive MBA is therefore a important for Indian executives, even for those with a MBAs, with a working experience of 5+ years to speed up their career in a global context. An Executive MBA gives participants the opportunity to expand their horizons, to learn from their own experiences and from the interaction with other participants and the faculty. The learning path is empowered thanks to the opportunity to apply immediately the concepts, skills and know how acquired. This allows the development of the necessary competencies and attitudes to navigate the challenges of the worldwide business arena and to become a Global Leader. There are not many international Executive Programs in India. You need to be careful when selecting the Best Executive Education Programs. The selection of the program can be decided bases on Faculty, Course Content, Business School Ranking & Alumni Network. ",
