            "answer_text": "Before anything, you should ask yourself is university is something you want to do. If you are unsure, do not go to university until you have considered the goal for university. You could end up wasting four or more years studying something that either doesn\u2019t give you much joy in learning, or something that you can\u2019t utilize to get closer to a goal you have. You also want to do a program that has academic merit, so some study things without giving them much thought on how useful or academically sound a field even is (I will not name any in particular, but I\u2019ll let you use your imagination). Lots of (typically younger) students these students are pushed into university or college programs without much thought and many I encounter end up being completely lost or lost in a limbo inside the university when they could be pursuing a job or their passion outside of it otherwise. Consider what your goals are, is it to get a specialization? A job? Interested in learning something to help yourself grow? Maybe something else? These are things you should ask yourself. The Internet can be very helpful these days in finding out what\u2019s out there, usually find a couple universities and see the types of programs and expand your search from there. Now, from this point forward, I am assuming you have a goal in mind and what could interest you in higher learning. So, the how boils down to this: With your interest in mind, find the academic field that fits that goal the best. Keep in mind that some degree programs are things people just study for the sake of it and offer next to no value outside of those areas. You will need to figure out this first otherwise you may get scooped by indecisiveness and universities usually will profiteer from this the longer you stay within the system.Determine which university or college fits your background and qualifications best. Universities usually come in different flavours and rankings, so you will need to think carefully about which one to apply to. Different universities tend to have different cultures or reputations, so depending on the reason you are going to university will determine what school is more suitable.Determine where that university sits among rankings, depending on your goals, this will matter as better ranked schools in particular academic disciplines will matter. For example, if you\u2019re interested in business, you may want to apply to a school that has a solid program in that and may have a good reputation.Determine from there, if it is affordable, find financial opportunities when necessary for that university. If that university is not going to work, return to one of the earlier steps until satisfied.Apply to the university/college, many universities/college let you apply online these days.Hope this helps and good luck!

            "answer_text": "With such well-considered responses on what to study at university, I\u2019m surprised that no one actually answered your question of what to study for university, so let me take a shot at it: what skills do you need to learn to be a successful student at the university level? Here\u2019s my top 8 because 9 is too many, but 7 isn\u2019t enough, even though it\u2019s easier to remember. Learn to read. Not just recognizing the words, but being able to understand what an author is trying to tell you. And be comfortable with reading a wide variety of material and genres because you\u2019ll do a lot of reading at university.Learn to write. Grammar, spelling, punctuation and the like are all important to know, but knowing how to make your point on paper in a way that makes the reader want to read it is invaluable. You\u2019ll start off rocky, but everything you write makes your writing a little bit better if you\u2019ll look at each finished piece with a critical eye toward how it could have been better (back to that reading thing again). For the record, I consider myself to be a mediocre writer at best, and I\u2019m still working on getting better at it.Learn to manage your time. Unlike public schools that tend do a lot of hand-holding, universities put the burden on you to get several things done in a limited amount of time. So it\u2019s up to you to turn that limited amount of time into sufficient time to get them done.Learn to listen. Your professors and fellow students will have different perspectives on whatever the topic is. Listen to what they have to say. No one requires that you agree with what they have to say, but you must at least understand it. Some things will jump out at you and some things you\u2019ll have to think about for a while before they make better sense. But it all starts with listening.Learn to ask questions. You\u2019ll need to move beyond recalling facts at some point and most of the papers that you\u2019ll write at university require you to ask your own question and then go out and find an answer. Note that I said, \u201can answer\u201d rather than \u201cthe answer\u201d since most of the questions that you\u2019ll be answering have lots of different answers and most of those answer will be right, but they will all be right for different reasons.Learn to get things done. I\u2019m all for \u201ca spoonful of sugar\u201d and all that, but the plain reality is that you\u2019re going to have to read things that don\u2019t interest you and write about things that you\u2019ll think are a complete waste of time and listen to people who you\u2019ll think are complete idiots. But you still need to do it and do it as well as you can.Learn as much as you can about as many things as you can. It might come as a surprise, but the more you know, the easier it is to learn something new. There is no such thing as \u201cuseless information.\u201d There is just information that can be put to use immediately and information that will become useful at some point in the future.Learn that there is always more to learn. Even the experts in their fields don\u2019t know it all. They know a lot more than the rest of us about their fields and they are learning more about their fields every day. But they are just as ignorant as the rest of us about things outside their field. So knowing what you don\u2019t know is sometimes just as important as knowing what you do know.",

            "answer_text": "What are you really passionate about? What makes your heart flow with joy or excitement? I came into college wanting to study Spanish Education because that's what I thought I wanted to do. I thought it would give me job security and pay well. Well\u2026 I ended up switching. I absolutely dreaded all of my classes. Here I was, thinking I\u2019m studying what I've been wanting to study all of my high school career, and now I dreaded going to them. Why? I don't know. But, I realized I had a passion for studying my Catholic faith. I made a few appointments with the advisor, talked with my parents and thought about it for a while, then I finally made the switch to Religious Studies. I haven't looked back since then, and I'm about to graduate in 3 weeks. Find what makes you really happy. It's okay to not know what you're doing for a while. Nobody expects you to have it all figured out right away. ",
