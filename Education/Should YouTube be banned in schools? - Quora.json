            "answer_text": "Yes and no Why? Let's explore both reasons Yes for educational purposes, YouTube can actually be really informative and helpful. You can look up a rap to help learn times tables, look at scientific explanations, e.t.cSo that kids can independently watch videos for their learning at their own pace. Say student A can take down notes whilst just listening and hearing the video once, student B needs to pause after hearing a peice of information to really understand. Having YouTube unblocked helps these kidsNo Because kids can look up random crap that's completely irrelevant. Believe me, I know people who will watch Idubbz instead of doing their work. I'm all for it if they've finished everything, but when you've got truckloads of homework, i don't think that's the smartest idea on the planet,Take your own stand on this. I'm in year 8 (in Australia, so I don't know what you call it in your country) so I know what I mean with the kids watching idubbz. ",
