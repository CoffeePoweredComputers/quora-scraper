            "answer_text": "Yes, I remember the first teacher I had in school. Her name was Mildred Murrel (spelling?). Mrs. M. was my 1st grade teacher. This was also the first time I ever went to school. The first time I ever rode a school bus or ate a lunch at school. I was born to a poor, rural, Appalachian family. I was the 4th of 10 children. By the time I was old enough and required(?) to attend public school, I had 2 younger siblings - making for a total of 6 of us by then. Suffice to say, there was not enough time or resources to learn to read or write or understand arithmetic. \u201cChildren are to be seen and not heard.\u201d I did know, and knew well, how to run, play, fight, and climb anything (nearly). And I was strong for my age-probably because I was used to hard work at a young age. When I got to first grade and saw all the numbers and alphabet posted around the room, I remember thinking that there would be no way I could learn all of it. I remember just wanting to go back home. Mrs. M. made the whole ordeal bearable, though. She had taught my mother and my 3 older siblings and was well aware of who I was. She told me that she knew that I would do just fine because I come from a smart family. Thanks Mrs. M. I don\u2019t regret anything. Please understand this. My parents gave us each other. I\u2019ll always have someone I can count on. We were raised to take up for each other and take care of each other. Siblings are the best gift my parents ever gave me. I picked up the rest as I went along. Cheers ",

By the time we get to school and meet our first official teachers we have learned so much, walking, talking, basic reading and writing skills at times, fine and gross motor control, how to act in public and so much more. Oh, did you want to know the name of my first school teacher? To bad as I don't remember. ",
