You like to be teacher? No problem even with MCA degree you can be good teacher/professor and earn quite good ,if you have some good expertise in any core technology which is widely used in IT market ,you can be a good mentor/trainer . You want to go in govt. job? Hmmmm\u2026 then another question if this above statement true ,why you did MCA ? Even after graduation you can go for SSC or any other govt. exam and you most probably you can get govt. job. Its due to frustration of jobless even after MCA? This can be a genuine reason for most of MCA/B.tech/M.Tech. passed out students.Even i faced some bad time(In term of Job but good time as we friend enjoyed too much those days),after doing MCA in 2006 it took me couple of years to get a job that also in that technology which i want to be . So be cool and calm think first then decide,dont be in hurry to decide about your future . ",
