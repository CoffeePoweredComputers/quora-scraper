            "answer_text": "Teaching is a profession with passion. Every teacher knows that and they don't bother about the toppers of the class because they know how to excel in studies so they are, at the same moment every teacher knows that, depsite all their efforts the below average student may not be shined. So, they don't bother about them also, finally the leftover are average students, these students are always put hard labour to excel in studies and seek helping hand to come up in the life. These students are not average because of their intelligent levels, they are average due to confusion or lack of right direction to excel in the life. As we worship teachers as \u201cAcharya devo bhava\u201d, the true teachers put all their efforts to identify the average student and the hidden potential in him/her to bring into lime light..I personally feel that, the change or reformation in the society begins with teachers only, as they mould the life of their wards..and a real teacher wants to see the student as their product to the society..

            "answer_text": "In this world it's really hard to get a mentor in life who understands your potential and guides you. Every student have their own abilities and way of thinking but this education system have teachers who are less teacher and more like relatives, they just tell you to study in a particular manner rather then observing that where the student is lacking. I deeply feel that we all teenagers try to uplift ourselves in all possible manner but if school's can create discipline, make students meditate, work on making them a well being, connect them to their roots no student ever will be average and at their teenage those students will definitely create a positive aura in their town and in todays world abnormal formulas spreads, inspires and grow like anything. In todays world Earning is the most easiest task you can ever have, but what needs is a revolutionary vision which brings revolution in that field. ",
