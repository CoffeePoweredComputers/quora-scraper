            "answer_text": "NIOS and CBSE are poles apart in terms of marking. CBSE is ridiculously generous. NIOS might be generous once in a blue moon, but most often, they are not. I know you might not want to hear this. I'm really sorry, but it is what it is. Students have scored over 90%, but they are outliers. They are blessed either through connections or by Lady Luck. I have personal experience with both boards of education, have tutored students sitting for CBSE and NIOS (some of them only took the NIOS exam for a couple subjects to satisfy the eligibility criteria for their desired college course. So, it's definitely not the students. Over 95 in CBSE and mostly 70s in NIOS. Even as low as 65.) I'm currently working on a story about the finicky paper checking in NIOS. They are infamous for their irresponsibility. The blatant cheating happening in Delhi centres makes me wonder what's going on elsewhere. In one instance, during the practical exams, 90% of the students left in a quarter of the time allotted. Even the invigilators left. A couple of students kept writing in an empty classroom. A janitor walked in after a while and told them to stop wasting their time. The invigilators were in a hurry to lock up and go. They threatened to mark down the students for taking too long. Apparently, taking the time allotted is too long. They have made certain changes. More weightage is now placed on practical exams and the TMAs (tutor marked assignments). Don't even get me started on those. For the practicals, you have to request a good grade or they're docking 5 marks for no reason. TMA gets a C grade if you don't approach whoever is in-charge at your allotted centre. The classes that are supposed to be held are a myth. They're either never scheduled, and if they are, nobody shows up. NIOS is a lottery. You might get a decent percentage. If you do, thank the Lord. If you don't, chill. I know many people that barely scraped by and currently have a CGPA over 9 in university. If you can afford a private university, your percentage will not matter. If you're trying to get admission through entrances, you only need to get a 65 to be eligible for most places. Don't get anxious about this. Get your senior secondary certificate and try to study through regular mediums in the future. There is peace and safety in being with the herd in this instance. Feel free to message me if you want to talk further. ",

            "answer_text": "Can resonate with Aakriti Jha\u2019s answer. Certainly scoring in any NIOS exam and particularly on demand exam is too difficult as questions are of random difficulty level with many errors in the question ( No one cares to correct them. NIOS text books are standing examples of poor quality of editing errors as you will find such typos , calculation errors and even logical errors across the books ). Markings are extremely stingy . This is no competitive examination like IIT . Students are appearing to clear the exam to pursue graduation. NIOS only allows less than 30% of the students to pass and fail the rest of them. CBSE and ISCE clears over 85 to 90% students and so do most state boards. The price one has to pay for the flexibility that NIOS provides such as on Demand exam is too high as there is no reasonable guarantee of clearing the exam with similar effort for other Board exams .
