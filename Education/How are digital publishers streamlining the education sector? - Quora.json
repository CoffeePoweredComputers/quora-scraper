            "answer_text": "There are two factors in a nutshell that are of significance owing to digitisation attempts being made in the field of education: It has the capability to ease the outreach of enriched content to remotest parts.It gives equity of learning to all.I think streamlining would require much more efforts than mere digitization in education. Digital publishers are creating competitive spirit in the field of education. This also creates a hazard of hoarding of resources for capital gains. Barring that digital way of outreach in education is a good way to learn what we seek interest in and if we are not having any prejudice about that method of learning.

            "answer_text": "With every industry undergoing digitalization, book publishing has also undergone the same. Although the traditional publishers used to perceive digital publishers as tough competitors, they have now come together to publish books digitally. Schools too, are trying to adapt to this trend. Various leading educational institutions are collaborating with well-known book publishers in India like Macmillan to publish books digitally. These books are packed with various features which make them better than traditionally published books. For example, they present the information better to ensure a great learning process for the readers.  If your institute doesn\u2019t have the necessary infrastructure for e-learning, digital publishers like Macmillan can help you build it. Even if an institute has already taken the path of digital learning, teaming up with a leading digital publisher would help to add value to their education and benefit the students. ",
