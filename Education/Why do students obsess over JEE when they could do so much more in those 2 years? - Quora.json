            "answer_text": "Most Indian teens prioritise Engineering or medical when it comes to career choices. Most of the people with no idea about what to do often choose engineering as that is what seems to have the most 'scope' in the future. Some people get the hang of it, some don't. The thing about IITJEE is that, IIT as a very high brand value. Every placement season, newspapers are flooding with the multi-crore packages that IITians landed. Obviously, now every parent wants their child to get such a package, what they don't realise is that newspapers just show the best news, they don't realise that there are many who don't get a job after passing out from IIT.It's usually this 'promising future' factor that draws teens' attention not passion. If you're passionate about doing your course from one of the best colleges, Those two years are really worth it.  Even if you want to pursue a career in engineering,\" There is life beyond IIT\" ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s all in the blood. See India is a very competitive country and in order to be the best, you need to cross the hurdles. This is what we are taught since childhood by Indian parents and hence we also develop a same kind of understanding of the world. But we cannot perform beyond a limit, and we should know our limits. Yes there is a kind of obsession in Indian teens but the fever of IITs is fading away though slowly. So this will eventually change but give it a rest till then.All the best. ",
