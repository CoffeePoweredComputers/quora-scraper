            "answer_text": "To echo User-13743967034596023228, the moment I found out, it was amazing - pure unadulterated disbelief/joy. I literally fell out of my chair and rolled on the ground the moment I saw this on the computer screen:  Critical Reading: 800Math: 800Writing: 800 At the time, I had been feeling a lot of pressure since a lot of my family/friends expected me to get into the top univerisites. I worked hard in high school, but test prep was unbearably rote and boring, so I had barely studied for the SAT, and I really thought I would pay the price for that. Immediately after the test, I actually thought I had done somewhat poorly, especially in this one section where I guessed a ton (I can only assume that was the ungraded experimental section [1]). So in that context, seeing those numbers were a huge relief. It helped me relax a ton and allowed me to really start enjoying senior year. Looking back on it, I think the most extraordinary part of the whole thing is how lucky/unlikely it was [2]. I guessed, a lot. They were educated guesses, but there were a ton of questions where I wasn't more than ~75% sure of the answer and could have gone either way between two of the choices. I still don't really know the mechanics of scoring for each section (how many you can miss and still get an 800), but if you assume that I guessed on 25 questions, even with a 75% chance of getting each of those right, that's a perfect test less than 8 times in 10,000. Of course, AFAIK, every college admissions process looks at scores in ranges anyway (i.e. 750-800), so the difference between an 800 and 780 is probably meaningless, although I'm sure the 3 round numbers briefly catch the admissions officer's eye. As a side note to that last point, it's amazing how obsessed we are with round numbers - perfect games go down in baseball history, but R.A. Dickey's back-to-back 1-hitters earlier this season will likely be soon forgotten, even though I would argue that it's more impressive in terms of consistency and historically rarer (has happened only 10 times since 1880 compared to 23 perfect games since 1880 [3, 4]).
