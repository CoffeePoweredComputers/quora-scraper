While most of the people who served in the military are honorable people, we do have a few rotten apples. So if you feel you are being scammed cease conversation, and contact the FBI with all the information you have. ",

I was a mail administrator for many years and I can do it in my sleep, from the command line. For this reason it is essential that you manually type in the email address yourself. Never hit Reply when verifying an email address! ",
