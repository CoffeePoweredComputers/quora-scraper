            "answer_text": "The thing about education in the US is that it runs the gamut from horrendously inadequate to subpar to mediocre to average to pretty good to excellent to world-class. There are world-class public schools, and there are horrendously inadequate private schools. You can't make any single, generalized statement about education in the US, because the quality varies not only from state to state, but from county to county -- and even from school to school within the same school district.  So, for every 8th grader reading at a 4th grade level, there's another one reading at a 12th grade level. For every high school that offers one AP class, there's another one that offers 12. For every elementary school that serves a population of 99% free or reduced lunch, there's another one where it's only 20%. For every high school with a 60% graduation rate, there's another one with a 98% graduation rate. (And so on and so forth.)  So why do we only really hear about the crappy schools? Because they're the ones that need to be fixed. There are a lot of schools and a lot of districts in this country that are doing just fine -- and are even excelling. That doesn't require a legislative or societal response. There's nothing to address there. We focus on the failing schools, because of course we focus on those schools -- they're the ones that need help. But it means that those are the only ones we ever hear about. Eventually, it turns into confirmation bias: We hear that education in the US is irretrievably broken, and we only see stories about failing schools and districts, so that's the narrative we internalize. In reality, the situation is so much more nuanced than that. Universities are a different matter entirely. Even though the US consistently lags behind the rest of the developed world in elementary and secondary education, our post-secondary educational institutions have always been top-rate.* There are, in my opinion**, a couple of reasons for this.  First, our major research universities (and elite liberal arts colleges) are incredibly well-funded and have ridiculously large endowments that allow their faculty to pursue cutting-edge research in state-of-the-art labs. That attracts the top talent from around the country and the world, in the form of both students and faculty, and that keeps those universities ranked at the top. Contrast that to the constant funding problems that public education faces at the elementary and secondary levels -- the level of funding is probably the single largest determinant of how well a school or district performs. It's well known that wealthier schools/districts outperform poorer schools/districts -- though, of course, there are other socioeconomic factors at play. But when schools are funded in large part by taxes, wealth can't be discounted. So, too, at the post-secondary level. It makes perfect sense that our incredibly well-funded universities turn out some of the best and brightest in the world. Second, until very recently (the last 15 or so years), college wasn't for everyone. The idea that every American high school graduate should go to college is a very recent one and only really came into vogue with the Bush-era No Child Left Behind. For a long time, it was possible to make a very good living with a high school diploma. As such, for most of history, only 1) the most intelligent, or 2) the most motivated students went to college. (Those aren't always the same thing.) It was a self-selective process. This wasn't a uniquely American thing, of course. Other countries are probably even more self-selective actually. But I still think it's a contributing factor and is something that distinguishes our top-rate university education in this country from our mixed-bag public education system in this country -- it's a case of optional vs. mandatory. Any time something is optional and has higher standards than the lowest common denominator,  it's going to produce more elite results, so to speak. Finally, I think there's one aspect about the American university system that is absent in a lot of others around the world that really makes it stand out: its flexibility. In many other countries, you choose your major or course of study when you apply, and you're stuck with that and are unable or are severely restricted in your ability to take any courses outside of your area of study. The very idea sounds absurd to most Americans (myself included), and I think it would sound absurd to the scholars of the past, who received a very broad education in a great number of subjects. I think there's something to be said for the US' flexibility and breadth in that regard. I took as many classes outside of my major as I took in it (or maybe even more, all told), and my education was certainly the stronger for it. I have to wonder if that aspect of it appeals to international students? *I'm talking 20th and 21st centuries. Quite frankly, I neither know nor care about the state of education in the US or the world prior to the 20th century, and, as far as I'm concerned, it's so far removed so as to be irrelevant to the discussion today. **I was always taught not to write \"in my opinion\" -- obviously it's my opinion, because I'm the one writing it. But I've found that if I don't write it on Quora, people misconstrue what I say to be cold, hard fact, instead of opinion. So I'm going against every writing teacher I've ever had -- and the nagging voice in the back of my brain -- and writing, \"in my opinion.\"  ",

            "answer_text": "\"The U.S. has more than 14,000 public school districts and spends more than $500 billion on public elementary and secondary education each year\" .School Districts What we don't have is an educational system; it is a mass of community-level schools which generally follow the same guidance and under No Child Left Behind were generally tested to something approximating a single standard. The problem with standardized testing was that it was applied so heavily that schools began to cheat on it. Knowing what questions were to be asked, the teachers often fell into \"teaching the test\" \u2013 and if you only teach the test, students will only know what's on the test, and not the world of words and facts that surround and expand each answer. The problem with the community level organization of our schools and the disparate sources of funding they had to use, was that they had to accept control by politicians. It can't have escaped notice that US politicians often want to tell schools what to teach. And the problem with control is that it is destructive of learning; learning and teaching are at heart chaotic enterprises \u2013 they work with minds so different from each other that one would be hard-pressed to teach the same lesson to everyone in a class with any reasonable expectation they would all learn the same thing. With the fragmenting of education into particular, discrete skills, children are apparently learning skills without the tools to make use of them. In 1987, E. D. Ehrlich, Jr, wrote a book called Cultural Literacy, What Every American Needs to Know, which called for a uniform curriculum of much greater depth and breadth then has been taught in the United States for many years. It was the author's position that children taught only the skills to do a thing without the information to make sense of those skills were handicapped by what they were being taught. This appears to have been the case, and it will take some years before our educational establishment comes up with some way to overcome the handicap its mistaken theories of education have lumbered on our young people. The man who used to be my [Representative], Dr. Vern Ehlers, PhD, got the idea that we could fix our educational problems by sending everyone to college. I seem to have avoided both college and the problems that many people younger than I experience in their professions and occupations, and I told Dr. Ehlers that what I wanted was to make sure they all got through Middle School. I might live long enough to see that happen. ",
