            "answer_text": "I can answer it for the science stream. MATHS: Instead of doing numericals from many books,guides and looking up questions from here and there,the best way to prepare is solve only(and only means only) the example problems of R.D SHARMA.There is nothing in a CBSE maths paper that is outside the range of this book. PHYSICS: Read the NCERT books properly and be thorough with the concepts along with the diagrams. Practice the back questions specially the numericals and also from the examples and hope for an easy paper. CHEMISTRY: This paper is generally a very a high scoring paper so the room for error is very less. Hence each topic should be very clear in one\u2019s mind with sufficient revision scoring a 90+ marks would not take you more than 45\u201350 minutes. English and physical education are more of reading and no such methods are known to me since in our coaching we barely had these classes. One last piece of advice along with the above things see the question of previous 10 years and solve a few papers in an exam like atmosphere which would give you the practice of writing continuously for 3 hours. ALL THE BEST. ",

As I have said clearly ,it is unknown to us from where they are adding these question as if it was known everyone will be a topper :P Study everything then you will get good marks ",
