            "answer_text": "Elimination Communication. So what's EC all about? Some people think it's infant potty training, but really if there's any training going about, it's training the parents! We're not necessarily training our bubs to go on a potty, we're training ourselves to pay more attention to our little ones, to learn their signs and signals, and give them a chance to go in a place other than their diapers.  Ever notice how a baby often pees right when his/her diaper is taken off? The idea is that babies, like us adults, NATURALLY don't want to soil themselves. So they will wait until they know that their diaper is off before eliminating. (Similar to puppies - don't take offense! If any of you has raised pups, you may have noticed that the accidents will occur everywhere BUT the place where they sleep).  It sounds crazy, I know. I thought so too when I first read up on this while doing my research on parenthood, but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. We basically train our kids in the western world to go in their diapers, and then when they reach time for potty training, we try to undo what we've conditioned them to do for the last 3 years. No wonder potty training seems to be so tough! The idea behind EC is instead of letting our kids go in their diapers, we train ourselves to know when our babes need to go, and offer them a chance to go elsewhere - a little potty, the sink, a bucket, the toilet itself, wherever! It fits right in with what the baby naturally wants, makes cleanup a whole lot easier, and builds a great bond between parent and child. Really - as silly as it sounds now, the feeling you'll get when you catch your child's pee / poop the first few times is amazing. Really makes you understand that babies CAN communicate with you and you can give them what they need from NOW! ",

            "answer_text": "Babies are born with bladder and bowel control. Nobody, including wild animals and babies, likes to mess themselves or in their nest. That control is definitely weak in the beginning, but it does exist. As adults we make choices for our children. When you have a baby, you have two choices: following a routine and help the baby improve its bladder and bowel control, or indulge your adult flexibility and allow your child to forget about bladder and bowel control and learn to mess him or herself. The difference is elimination communication versus the traditional wait and see approach to potty training. The frustrating part about elimination communication is the myths around it: you have to be a stay at home parent, the child will forget anyway, you have to do it 24/7 with now chance to relax, your child will have \"too good\" of bowel and bladder control, you will harm your child mentally, and more. No, no, and more no to all of those. Simply put, those theories are insane and out dated. We did elimination communication with our daughter and have been extremely happy with the results. The process for us was as follows: Months 0-3: Watch her face and behaviors, whenever she had to go to the bathroom should would squirm, cry, and make the \"poop or pee face\". We would then open her diaper, put a little teepee over her so she did not pee or poop everywhere, and encourage her by making pee and poop sounds to do the deed onto her cloth diaper. We learned what her cues were as she learned our cues to her. We could quickly clean her, swap the diaper out, and put a new one on her. -- Cloth was important, we could tell faster if she was wet and she would complain more when she did so.Months 3-6: Keep watching her, transition to putting her on a tiny little potty. Same sounds, but by now she could hold her head up. It worked fantastically, she would consistently make the same facial gestures and behaviors, we would pop her down on the potty, and she would go. We bought a little travel potty and cloth diapers. They worked fantastic, we had to clean maybe 1 soiled diaper a week.Months 6-12: Keep it up. Sent her to daycare at this point. Talked with the daycare about her facial responses, helped them figure it out. They were excited and transitioned several other kids over to the same system. It worked fantastic, because they had one less dirty diaper kid to clean up! -- Note, through this period we would periodically use standard diapers when in public or traveling long distances, just to make accidents easier, but it was very unusual for an accident to happen.Year 1-2: When she made major learning leaps, like walking, she would forget for a few weeks, lose a bit of control, but a gentle reminder and paying a bit more attention would get her right back on track.18 months: We put her in preschool, toddler room, she went two weeks, retrogressed for one week and explained \"but the other kids don't use the potty\". We explained it to the teachers, they made the potty available to her, and week 3 she announced, \"I am not going to wear diapers anymore!\" -- You try buying panties for an 18 month old, they virtually do not exist unless they are designed to go over a fat, sodden diaper. Buying the panties was literally the hardest part of this whole process.Year 2: She turned 2, she declared she did not want to wear diapers anymore at night. We took her potty twice a night, alternating which parent does it, and it works great. As she became more aware of herself, we put a potty down in her room and started to encourage her to get up at night and use it: success!Year 3: She decided she wanted to sit on the full-sized potty. Now she does so consistently.Okay, maybe my child is somehow unique. If I remember, I will update this eventually, as my next child is born and I can see if we have this level of success a second time. However, every parent I have told about this who has gone on to try it has been very happy with the results. Seriously? Who likes changing a dirty diaper? ",
