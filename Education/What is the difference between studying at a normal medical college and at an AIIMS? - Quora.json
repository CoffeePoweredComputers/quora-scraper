            "answer_text": "First of All, Aiims is also a normal medical college, there is nothing abnormal about it. The main advantage of studying in the top colleges over lower ranked colleges are: The environment of the campus will be much more competitive.You are fortunate that the top faculties and book authors are teaching you the subject.The facilities provided to the students are also surplus as compared to other low ranked colleges.The hospital attached with the college is really vast, so all kinds of clinical cases you can see, even the rarer ones.A bit more self confidence in you that you are studying in the top college of the country.Now coming to the actual facts which really matter. All the colleges have competent enough faculties to teach you and make you understand your subjects.Hospital attached with most of the govt medical colleges have abundant number of cases to learn at under graduate level.Facilities provided are also not very less.Environment of the campus is not that competitive but it can change.So, final opinion is that what actually matters is your own hard work and self study and your dedication. College dont play a very big role. As there are supple candidates in Aiims also and there are gold medalist in lower ranked colleges also. Definitely if a particular student put same effort and same hard work while studying in Aiims will get more fruitful results than the students of other colleges. Ther reason is mentioned above. Hope it will help you in understanding the role of college at under graduate level ( I am sorry if this question was about persuing Masters from Aiims and other colleges, because the answer will change in that case).
