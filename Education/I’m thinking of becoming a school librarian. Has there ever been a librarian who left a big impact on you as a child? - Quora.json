            "answer_text": "When I was in 3rd grade, I learned from the school librarian that we would soon be getting a new book about castles. I was very excited! I came in every day after school to see whether the book had arrived. It hadn\u2019t. I would turn around and walk out. Wash, rinse, repeat for at least a week. The next week, the librarian expected me and when I came in, she said that it hadn\u2019t arrived, but I might want to read this other book instead. She convinced me to take it home and give it a try. I took it home and sure enough, I enjoyed it. She kept finding other books to hold my interest until the castle book arrived. Finally, the big day came and the castle book arrived! I was surely excited, but I also wanted to know what the *next* book I should read would be. In essence, while waiting for this one book, she had convinced me to read four or five others in the meantime. I read the castle book, but would still stop by on a regular basis to get more books. My school librarian did an excellent job in nurturing my love of reading and exposing me to several new authors that I had not previously known. ",

            "answer_text": "Librarians are incredibly important people in the age of the internet. I learned the most from the librarians at the California State University Sacramento who offer a case in using the library and using internet resources for undergraduates. Since I directed my students to take the class, I of course also attended. Learned a lot. The sooner children can learn to be critical and discerning consumers of on-line education the better. Good luck with your information sciences studies. ",
