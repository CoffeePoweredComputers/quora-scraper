            "answer_text": "Hahahahahahahaha, WTFrick? I'm sorry, what I meant to say was:  To an extent, yes. Albeit very little similarities. Some including the obvious: They go to schoolThey have all the core classesThey do have extracurricular activities and clubsThen there are cultural facts Teens are pushed really REALLY hard to do well in schoolA lot of Japanese are interested in AmericansThey do have entrance exams for highschool (which I think is a load of bull)Now for what you're looking for in particular (maybe) They DO have short summers, BUT they also have more holidays than we do, so it's not like they go to school longer than AmericansI'm not sure about class reps, but they do have valedictorians and class ranks (just like we doNow I'm also not sure about boarding schools. They MIGHT have those. (Key word MIGHT)But of course, here's where I fall short to be able to answer you fully; I've only ever toured JapanI've read a lot about their culture, but not all of itHaven't gone to school in Japan, but I think I know people who could tell me, but they're probably at church right nowThat pretty much sums it up for me. Hope it was insightful. ",

            "answer_text": "Japanese schools are surprisingly similar to their portrayal in anime. It all depends on the anime it is, but they are usually pretty close to the real thing. People in Japan don\u2019t speak like a lot of people in anime do of course, but they still do a lot of the same things if it is a realistic anime. This is likely true because of Japanese influence on the anime. Say for example someone in the USA makes a cartoon, which is very similar to anime. If the setting is in a school, they would usually make it like a real-life school (if it is a realistic anime). They would not make school extremely different because that would just make the whole show seem weird to people who live in the country. Since most people who watch anime live in Japan, and most anime is written in Japan by Japanese people, most Japanese schools shown would be like Japanese schools in real-life (if the anime is realistic).
