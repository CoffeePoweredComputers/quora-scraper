            "answer_text": "Teachers play vital roles in the lives of the students in their classrooms. Teachers are best known for the role of educating the students that are placed in their care. Beyond that, teachers serve many other roles in the classroom. Teachers set the tone of their classrooms, build a warm environment, mentor and nurture students, become role models, and listen and look for signs of trouble. The most common role a teacher plays in the classroom is to teach knowledge to children. Teachers are given a curriculum they must follow that meets state guidelines. This curriculum is followed by the teacher so that throughout the year, all pertinent knowledge is dispensed to the students. Teachers teach in many ways including lectures, small group activities and hands-on learning activities. Teachers also play an important role in the classroom when it comes to the environment. Students often mimic a teacher\u2019s actions. If the teacher prepares a warm, happy environment, students are more likely to be happy. An environment set by the teacher can be either positive or negative. If students sense the teacher is angry, students may react negatively to that and therefore learning can be impaired. Teachers are responsible for the social behavior in their classrooms. This behavior is primarily a reflection of the teacher\u2019s actions and the environment she sets. Teachers typically do not think of themselves as role models, however, inadvertently they are. Students spend a great deal of time with their teacher and therefore, the teacher becomes a role model to them. This can be a positive or negative effect depending on the teacher. Teachers are there not only to teach the children, but also to love and care for them. Teachers are typically highly respected by people in the community and therefore become a role model to students and parents. Mentoring is a natural role taken on by teachers, whether it is intentional or not. This again can have positive or negative effects on children. Mentoring is a way a teacher encourages students to strive to be the best they can. This also includes encouraging students to enjoy learning. Part of mentoring consists of listening to students. By taking time to listen to what students say, teachers impart to students a sense of ownership in the classroom. This helps build their confidence and helps them want to be successful. Another role played by teachers is a protector role. Teachers are taught to look for signs of trouble in the students. When students\u2019 behaviors change or physical signs of abuse are noticed, teachers are required to look into the problem. Teachers must follow faculty procedures when it comes to following up on all signs of trouble. ",

            "answer_text": "You asked, \u201cWhat do teachers do?\u201d But you did not say what sort of teachers so I will address a few different types. There are those who are called teachers but they don\u2019t really help students learn. They are paid to help students learn but they are just attendance takers and time consumers. These Aren\u2019t-Teachers do not get lessons together that help students learn; these Aren\u2019t-Teachers do not listen to students and then help them learn, grow, and mature. These Aren\u2019t-Teachers give the profession a bad name. Normally these Aren\u2019t-Teachers are the favorite Faculty members of a majority of the students because they are easy and they pass out good grades \u2014good grades really do not matter in the long run becauses after the student is at the next level what matters is \u201cDoes the person have the knowledge and skills that the grade was to represent?\u201d Normally, people who just had the easy teacher but who learned nothing want to feel important by telling others that \u201cI was on the honor roll.\u201d People who had the Real Educator and who mastered the content, do not need to tell others that \u201cI was on the honor roll.\u201d (if you have to tell someone who you are, then you aren\u2019t.) There is another type of teacher who really isn\u2019t a teacher either. These are the teachers who have the students who do not really need the \u201cgood teacher.\u201d Normally, the so-called good teacher is really just an attendance taker who gets in the way of the students who would learn if they were just provided with resources. These teachers get the so-called Good Students and these teacher get the credit for what the good students would have accomplished anyway. Sometimes the Good Teacher really is a person who helps the students learn, grow, and mature, but this is rare. What we call a teacher is a person who should be preparing lessons that help the student Thrive on the other side of graduation. What we call a teacher should be the person who is not a friend to the student but who is viewed by the student as a favorite Aunt or Uncle. A favorite Aunt or Uncle whose words have value and wisdom for a better life for the student. A favorite Aunt or Uncle whose lessons are more like \u201cAdvice.\u201d The Good Teacher should be the type of person who helps students be better today than they were yesterday. The Good Teacher should prepare and conduct him or herself such that one day, the former student will say, \u201cLet me tell you about this teacher whom I had\u201d and then smiles will wash across the face and out of the eyes. Every school as a few Good Teachers. The student who wants to work hard now so that his or her futureself will say, \u201cThank you,\u201d should find the Good Teacher and take a class or two under the Good Teacher. If, however, you are not interested in Your Future, then find the so called good teacher today, but don\u2019t worry. Your Future Success will find another partner while you lament your life and blame it on the good teacher. I am Allen Morris and I approve of this dashed off first draft complete with all of its errors\u2026 ",
