            "answer_text": "Online learning at the college level has been around for years. I began teaching with a black, slate board. As I finish my 50th year, I taught 100% online. My class is a potpourri of opportunities to learn, none of which require listening to me lecture on video, reading a tomb of a textbook or following PowerPoint presentations. While all students are held to the same standards, how they learn and how they demonstrate competency to me can come in many ways. There are many ways to be smart. Their favorite times are via some sort of teleconferencing tool where, in small groups, students from New York to Washington and many in Georgia share ideas and what they are learning. We are a traditional public, brick and mortar, school. All information now duplicates exponentially about every 10 months. In future jobs students will do their business distantly. They will attend professional development electronically. The last house I bought, I did so from a boat floating down the Seine River. I did not physically sign or initial anything. It was all done electronically. It was located in Florida. When my son started a new job over a year ago, he spent weeks processing through learning modules on his laptop in his basement. Being able to function in the online world is a basic skill. Colleges like mine will still have F2F environments as we are social beings, but, given what they were forced into these last six weeks, I suspect all courses will become hybrid. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume that, by \u201cnew normal\u201d, you\u2019re asking if, post-pandemic, most college/university students will take most courses online? I would say no. Most students are not enjoying this, and those that wanted an online-only education could get that before the pandemic. Will we see an increase in online course delivery and students either seeking or at least taking these courses? Probably, but not by massive margins. Of course, much depends on how the pandemic plays out. We\u2019re not even close to out of the woods yet. OQ. Will online learning become the new normal for college students? ",
