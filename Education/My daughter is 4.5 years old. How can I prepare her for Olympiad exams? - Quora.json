            "answer_text": "Your daughter is a sprout. You understandably want to nurture her into a tall, strong, and healthy oak prepared for the challenges of life. The flaw is your daughter may not be an oak. She may be a palm tree. Or a rose bush. If you prepare her to become an oak, she will not only not be an oak but she\u2019ll be a sickly rose bush. The kids who make it at the Olympiads are oaks. Their parents recognized their oakness and fed them what oaks need to grow mighty. Your role as a parent isn\u2019t to nurture oaks. It is to discover what kind of sprout your child is and provide what that sprout needs. She is showing you what kind of sprout she is right now. What children are drawn provides little windows inside. She may love to move her body. Or she may love puzzles. Or she may love people, animals, stories, singing, growing things, drawing. Your role is to honor the sprout she is, not show her that your love and approval is contingent on her being the kind of sprout you think is best. Give her more of what she loves, even if you don\u2019t see the value in it. She\u2019s 4. She needs what feeds a 4 year old, not what feels satisfying to an adult. If it\u2019s a cartoon, or chasing the dog, or dancing to music that\u2019s what she needs. Give her what connects to what she loves. Open doors and build bridges out into the world from where she is. Let her choose to explore or not. Let her know what\u2019s there. Take her new places and expose her to new things. She can\u2019t know what she loves until she\u2019s seen it. But let her enjoyment be your guide. If she\u2019s not engaged, she\u2019s not learning. If she\u2019s pushed, she\u2019ll pull back and associate the activity with being pushed. Let her choose. If she\u2019s an oak, she\u2019ll be prepared for Olympiads because that\u2019s who she is. She\u2019ll be doing what fascinates and challenges her. If she\u2019s not an oak, she\u2019ll be prepared for who ever she is by being supported in following what engages and challenges her. It won\u2019t be Olympiads but it will be something she\u2019s uniquely good at. The question is, will that be good enough for you? Or do you need an Olympiad daughter to feel you\u2019re a good parent? ",

            "answer_text": "Please don\u2019t, until or if she indicates that she wants to compete academically against other kids. The world doesn\u2019t need more hyper-competitive, overly-prepped people who can\u2019t function without someone scheduling their every moment or pushing them toward a specific goal that they themselves did not choose. I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re there yet, but it sounds like you\u2019re considering starting down that path. Please just don\u2019t. We know kids - my kids have friends and classmates - who have little to no free time, who don\u2019t get to choose their own activities based on their own interests, who aren\u2019t allowed to play with friends or go to birthday parties or just chill and be kids because their parents want them studying and training all the time. These kids are stressed, anxious, and miserable. There\u2019s already a problem with kids in college, high school, and sometimes even middle school killing themselves because they\u2019re under such tremendous pressure and cannot handle it. Our job as parents is to produce children who grow up to be healthy, productive, functional, and hopefully happy and interesting adults. If they aren\u2019t those things, how will they be dealing out in the world on their own? ",
