            "answer_text": "There are Trolley Problem variants in which a greater moral dilemma supersedes the negative ethics of cheating; for example, if literally I held a gun to your head and told you to cheat, you\u2019d be fine. The practical variant of this was explored in a subplot in the American version of Shameless; Lip Gallagher, a brilliant student, took the SAT for a number of peers and got appropriate (not merely high) scores for them, for pay. He was using the money partly to pay for food and other necessities for his family. This being TV, he\u2019s eventually caught, with good and bad outcomes, but the idea is interesting. However, the principal reason that most people cheat is entirely self-serving. It\u2019s often framed as fairness, but it\u2019s a variant of \u201cJane is smarter than me, and I want the good outcome, so it\u2019s fair to cheat. It\u2019s just leveling the playing field.\u201d However, the field isn\u2019t supposed to be level. It\u2019s supposed to differentiate between you and Jane, and it\u2019s unethical to distort that. Moreover, most institutions (and the SAT and ACT) require you to agree to a code of conduct that precludes cheating, and you can\u2019t cheat without violating that agreement. ",

            "answer_text": "No, there is no acceptable reason to cheat on a test. Cheating on a test is unethical, and you're not just cheating the system you're cheating yourself. An important part of it the educational's process is tests that tell the student how well they're doing in the class. Keep in mind, that most teachers have a pretty good idea when cheating is occurring. They can tell from a student's performance in class compared with their performance on a test. When I taught math, I required students to show their work that exposes much cheating. Whether teaching math or science, I often used multiple copies of the exam for more important tests. Not only does this expose cheaters, but when a student copies off of a different version of the exam, the answer is marked wrong. Teachers and schools take cheating seriously. Cheating is not fair to those students who are honest. When a student is caught cheating, the teacher will give the student of zero for a grade on that test. If it is a final exam for the course the teacher usually gives a zero for the course. In serious cases, the teacher will turn evidence of cheating over to the Dean, and the Dean may cancel credit for that course and other similar courses. It is never never never acceptable to cheat on an exam for test. ",
