            "answer_text": "You\u2019re already starting on a better foot than most people by asking this question, Don\u2019t trust anyone who says college is good for everyone anywhere regardless of personal context. It\u2019s an unthinking opinion that we wouldn\u2019t apply in almost any other category but which we use gleefully when speaking of college all the time. It\u2019s led to massive debt, unemployement, and general unhappiness for tens of thousands of people. Without knowing more about you, the best I can do is give you a bit of a system to use to make the decision more clearly. Try to answer the following questions as concretely as possible. A. What do I want to use my degree for? B. What\u2019s the financial cost of the degree? Will I have to go into debt? How could that limit my other goals? Do I really understand all the implications of a large college loan? C. Can I micro test my career first before enrolling in school through an internship or apprenticeship somewhere? D. Are there cheaper/faster alternatives I can pursue elsewhere? E. Is it the right time for me to enroll now or would I prefer to do something else first? F. What are my reasons for going to college? Are they my own reasons or the reasons of my friends, family and teachers? G. What is the opportunity cost of going to college in terms of time? In other words, what do I give up by spending 4 years in the classroom and am I willing to giv that up? Don\u2019t stress about the answers, just be honest. Nobody will have the exact same answers but I\u2019ve found these questions to be particularly helpful. If you\u2019re like the majority of young people out there, you probably shouldn\u2019t enroll in college right away. It\u2019s hard to have these answers and in their absence, I don\u2019t think you can justify the cost and time associated with a degree. ",

            "answer_text": "If you can\u2019t think of any better opportunity, then college is for you. If you can\u2019t think of anything worse, then college isn\u2019t for you.  I mean the first one literally. Some people have a specific, concrete opportunity in mind that is so life-changing that college pales in comparison, or that gets them to their goal without an intermediate step. They have a choice between studying Drama in college or being the star of a big budget movie or TV series\u2014taking the starring role is a better, more direct option, and they can always go back to school if they want to. I mean the second one figuratively. For many people, it\u2019s a great privilege to have four years to read great books, learn from the learned, and have a marvelous social life. For others, college seems like four more years of the worst parts of high school, and they\u2019re now paying for the privilege. College is still the best option for many people, even people who don\u2019t yet know what they\u2019re going to do with it. Many of the downsides can be avoided with conscious attention paid to selecting a college that is right for you: it provides the experience of college that you want to have, with classmates who feel the same way. Consider many colleges, especially the weird ones\u2014they have the strongest cultures. You should also consider and explore other options. Find out what your friends are doing and why. Even if you ultimately reject some or all of those options, that gives you information about yourself. ",

            "answer_text": " In the US about 40% of high school graduates rush off to college to earn that credential of credentials\u2014the bachelor\u2019s degree\u2014not realizing they are entering into a competition for a few good jobs. Half of all college graduates are going to be under employed or unemployed in today\u2019s job market. One in four student loans are in default or delinquency. Despite these facts many students (and parents) are obsessed with the idea of going to college. For decades the youth and their parents in our country have been the target of societal, familial, educational, and political propaganda stressing the point that: To be a success in life you MUST graduate from a four year college. This pressure has led a lot of young people to make some really na\u00efve post-secondary education choices, the result of which is an investment of time and money with little or no return. Often this poor investment choice has had the corollary effect of running up debilitating debt. There may have been a time many years ago when a college degree almost guaranteed financial success, but nothing could be further from the truth today: There is a huge disparity between supply (graduates) and demand (suitable jobs).Colleges, by and large, are operating on an obsolete business model--pre-Internet/pre-globalization.Not only is the business model obsolete, the education they are providing has deteriorated over time. (Read Academically Adrift.)There is a gap between skills acquired and skills required. (There are businesses making a nice profit providing camps that teach college graduates the skills they need to get a job.)At the same time the cost of college has soared. Many degrees today have little or no ROI.If colleges operated as private sector businesses, they would be out of business, but yet large numbers of high school graduates just keep beating a path to their gates. Going to college in the US today is a risky business because of 1) the high cost 2) the shortage of suitable jobs, and 3) the danger inherent in taking out student loans. Is college for you? Are you really smart and highly motivated?Have you identified a marketable major?Can your family afford to send you without you having excessive student loans.Has your family prepared a \u201cwhole degree\u201d financial plan?If you can answer, \u201cyes,\u201d to all four of these questions there is a pretty good chance you can go to college, graduate, and get a good job.

            "answer_text": "You need to analyze from different perspectives while choosing a college: Degree - Research about the achievements of past students of the degree that you wish to study in this college. If you could pick a handful of students excelled in career (either in research or industry jobs) because of doing your degree of choice in this college, then you can conclude that it makes a great sense to proceed further. In this context, also make some homework about the benefits that the college offers for the department where your degree is being taught. For example, check whether the department has any great projects that it can offer for its students and therefore, upon working for such projects, your resume will be enhanced greatly.Other curricular activities - Say for example, you are interested in tennis. Check whether the college has facilities to provide you an environment where you can improve your tennis and play at local league levels. I firmly assure that college is a great place to improve your extra-curricular talents than schools.Living facilities - In case you are choosing a college far away from home, I would prefer to stay close to the campus since it adds a great benefit to get away from distractions and focus on your studies and other activities. Therefore, it\u2019s very important to check whether college provides facilities to stay or at least the place near your campus has good and safe residential facilities.Socializing - Again, in case of staying away and studying, check whether your college has activities or local organizations for students in order to improve socializing capabilities of a student - for example, conducting events to understand other country\u2019s culture. Socializing is very important especially when you stay away from home as it gives a positive attitude to proceed further in the college.Student Development Centre - Check whether the department of your degree of choice has something like this where they discuss about new trends. techniques or researches in order to update the students\u2019 knowledge in a particular domain and keep them enthusiastic in their studies.",

You\u2019re likely not ready for college if you can\u2019t do one of the following: Score at least 1300 on SATPass at least 3 AP examsThat should be minimum requirement for anyone to get into a college. Sadly, most colleges are a repeat of high school, total scams. Avoid shit schools, there are only 100 schools worth going to, and some of them only if you get into their honors program. You should also avoid college if you struggle with pre-calc. College Makes People Fat and Stupid ",
