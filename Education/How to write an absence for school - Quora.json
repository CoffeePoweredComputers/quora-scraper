Text should be sent prior to the absence, or via email. Have your child follow up to insure all assignments are received from each teacher.

The last two schools that my sons attended didn\u2019t accept written letters or notes; one required a phone call from a parent and the other required an email to the attendance desk. The school my son is attending now does required a written excuse but this is literally a simple note scrawled on a scrap of paper: \u201cJohn was out sick yesterday with the flu\u201d followed by a signature. Nothing formal at all. Check with your school for guidelines, as I\u2019ve attended many schools and my children have attended many more and I have yet to see one that required any type of letter beyond a simple one-sentence note.
