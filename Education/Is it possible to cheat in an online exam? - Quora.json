            "answer_text": "People keep asking this question. The answer is always the same; yes, but it\u2019s harder depending on the rules and design of the test. Instructors have learned how to make cheating more difficult. They use different strategies. In classes where rote memorization is important, multiple-choice or short-answer exams may be written with very challenging questions and put on a strict, short time limit. A student could still cheat by looking up one or two answers but wouldn\u2019t have time to do them all. The more devious student might get a study group together and have the other group members sitting about with the book and have each of them look up an answer to a different question.My coures were general education\u2014I think in a gen ed course rote learning is not nearly as important as in classes in the student\u2019s major. So my tests had almost no rules. Take as much time as you like\u2014even save your answers and return later. Use books, notes, websites, other students. I even had one class where a small group would congregate after class and take my test as a team; I complimented them. Now, I would write questions that involved application of ideas and analyzing things we hadn\u2019t covered in class, so often the answer would not be explicit in any materials. The only way students might have cheated would have been if a surrogate took the test for them or if they plagiarized an essay.",

            "answer_text": "Cheating in online classes is next to impossible because you camera is on and everything that you do is visible. However, some students do find ways to cause trouble, which I do not understand why. There is no good that will come out of it.I recently heard that FIITJEE in collaboration with EdFora is doing something to bring the \"fair system\" of examinations in the online form. To make online invigilation smoother with the help of Artificial Technology, is a great initiative which I am personally looking forward to. I heard they already started conducting the exams with this system. I searched for some information online on this for you. This is what I know so far.These tests follow a three-tier proctoring system that consists of Artificial Intelligence proctoring, Live proctoring and Post Test review. When a student sits for an exam, the Artificial Intelligence proctoring recognizes the student's face which is stored in the already existing database. This enables the students' laptop, desktop, phone cameras to make an ID match with the AI face recognition. Then there is a live human proctor to supervise the students like a teacher/professor does in offline classrooms. One invigilator can monitor up to 10 students at a given time. The entire test-taking journey is recorded, and the click trends are also documented. If the AI technology detects any suspicious activity, it will generate a warning. Since the AI technology can identify the student's face, does an environment check of the room, detects multiple faces, objects like books, mobiles, secondary sound source, suspicious browser activity and much more, it is a foolproof way to help invigilators create the same environment as an offline exam. After the students submit the test, the post-test review is done where the human proctors can get back to the recordings and re-check for suspicious activities, other discrepancies and accordingly mark the students.I am personally blown away and hope this technology gets adopted everywhere soon.
