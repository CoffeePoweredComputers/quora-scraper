            "answer_text": "The previous 'answer' by Alison Irving Hall is simply wrong. Joe never uses this phrase in circumstances where he 'knows it will never happen'. Rather, he says it to Pip in genuine anticipation of the larks, or laughs, they will have when Pip recovers fully. As Pip does indeed recover fully, and as Joe becomes happily married to Biddy, there is no doubt, for those who actually read the book, that Pip and Joe do indeed go on to have larks a plenty. What larks!!! ",

Both are uncomfortable with the difference in their circumstances. Joe says that next time Pip comes home, they'll enjoy a good time together: \"What larks, Pip! What larks.\" But both he and Pip know that it will never happen.  Heartbreaking. ",
