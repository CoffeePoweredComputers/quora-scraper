            "answer_text": "Oh gosh! I am so sorry for the late reply if you are taking your O\u2019levels this year. However, I feel like the tips that I am going to give you will help you with other subjects and in the future too, so do not fear haha! Alright. So for the tips that I am going to give you, I need to know what type of learner you are so that you can secure that A* without a shroud of doubt. Since science is a subject where answers are repeated quite a lot for a variety of questions, I would say to thoroughly understand the answer scheme for a particular question that has been echoed very frequently and memorize it so that you won\u2019t go wrong in your phrasing. So, if you are a kinesthetic learner [basically someone who needs to move a lot while studying in order to absorb information], this study method for Science will work well. You need to assign an object a particular phrase or a paragraph that you want to memorize. It will be especially helpful if that object is something memorable and something that you will bring into the examination venue (like a glue stick or scissors). Make sure that you revise that phrase or para with that item frequently throughout the year so that when you sit for the paper and you need to regurgitate the answer, the object will trigger that for you. Next, if you are a visual learner [basically someone who learns best with visuals and aesthetically pleasing diagrams], a study method for Science that would work best for you is one called \u2018Blurting\u2019. Basically, once you have revised a chapter of Physics, for example, you need to close the textbook, take out a piece of paper and blurt out everything you remember from that chapter in 5 minutes. This was extremely helpful for me because after using this method for my Science subjects, I started scoring As and A*s. Finally, if you are an auditory learner [someone who learns best by listening], one method that will work best for you, will be to record you saying the chapter out loud using your phone\u2019s voice recorder and listen to it using your earphones while going to school. This won\u2019t seem much but trust me, it is very useful, especially for denser and dryer science subjects like Biology. All in all, these are study methods that you can use in order to guarantee that A*. However, make sure that you understand the concepts first. If you don\u2019t, do ask your teachers and have consultations with them. You can also mix and match these methods to suit your learning type because, at the end of the day, these are all active recall methods. Anyway, I hope this was helpful for you and good luck with your O\u2019levels! ",

            "answer_text": "Try to make your concepts as clear as you can and practice past papers as much as you can. Past paper practice is the most important thing because it gives you an idea of what type of questions you are going to encounter in your exams.But make sure you don't go to much back past papers of last 10 years are enough before that the syllabus was different. Hope this is helpful. ",
