            "answer_text": "The most often problem is one of wasted effort. I have this issue every time I write about intelligence and my experience as an intellectual. They get a few reads but not nearly the kind of reads as my answers on politics or mental health. I\u2019m intensely interested in the process of intellect, but these answers are among the least viewed and commented on. The same applies in daily conversation. In general I avoid offering up my opinion unless it is asked for. Experience has taught me that if I insert my opinion where it isn\u2019t wanted I appear to think a lot of myself and be trying to dominate the room. Mind you I do tend to try and succeed at dominating a room, but silence is as effective a tool at that as offering opinions. A short intelligent question communicates more about the ability of the asker than them telling you what they think. Which is probably why I don\u2019t post many questions here. All of my questions are of a deeper nature that require scholarly attention, and most answers here are of a more general scope. This is my outlet, especially because I get answer requests. That implies that people want my opinions on things, which makes me a little less of a show off when I respond. As I sit here I have 137 requests in my active inbox, and several thousand more outside of the active flow. I will never clear that box and I haven\u2019t been able to for months. Part of ability is knowing when you have relevant experience and when you don\u2019t. It\u2019s important to know how much effort you can reliably put to any task. Offering opinions is work because you have to defend them. It is a form of proof of your ability, and that challenge is unpleasant more often than not. Confident intelligent people don\u2019t need the approval of everyone they meet, they treasure the regard of those with more wisdom and experience than them. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy do intelligent people often hold back their opinions?\u201d Two things spring to mind: First, the \u201cnot casting your pearls to swine\u201d analogy. Eventually, through life experience, hard knocks, and honest introspection, you become more humble, more attune to the pearls of wisdom you collect along the way, and you\u2019re not so willing to cast them out to the general crowd. It\u2019s not because you feel or believe that others are beneath you, but rather, it\u2019s because those others may not understand and appreciate what treasures you have to offer. Intelligent people, especially emotionally intelligent people, can typically gauge the maturity level of those they engage with, and act accordingly. Second, is the \u201coffering of a full plate\u201d vs. offering to help someone to \u201cfill their own plate.\u201d We cannot live other people\u2019s lives for them, nor should we try to direct the steps of others in totality, via our opinions. It is one thing to offer opinions seeded with nourishment that carries the potential to offer extensive positive and productive growth in a person\u2019s life, and quite another to offer up a prepackaged meal that could potentially stir up quite a hornet\u2019s nest because of differing perspectives and a lack of common vision. Learning to discern the difference only comes with time, via life experience. ",
