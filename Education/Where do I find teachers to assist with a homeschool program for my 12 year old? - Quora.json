            "answer_text": "It depends upon the type of help you need and why. If you\u2019re looking for a tutor for a subject that you find difficult to teach, check local colleges. The departments often keep lists of tutors. Students often tutor at lower fees and they are perfectly capable of handling middle or high school level curriculum. A few hours a week is usually enough if you\u2019ve researched and found a parent friendly curriculum. There are many online providers of single courses for homeschooled high schoolers. Some are excellent. Others are garbage. They often have instructors your child can contact with questions. There are charter schools that offer support to parents who homeschool, but like every tax funded public school, there are strings attached. Sometimes it\u2019s what curriculum you can use. Sometimes it\u2019s mandatory testing. You need to decide if that is something you can live with. And yes, charter schools are public schools. They have to abide by state Ed codes like every other public school, however they are independently run and vary greatly in quality. If your child has a learning disability or other specific issue, there are teachers who act as consultants. This can be helpful if say your child has dyslexia. They can help you review and evaluate curriculum. Look into homeschooling co-ops. They can be a great opportunity for enrichment and other courses. The quality and qualifications of their offerings and instructors will vary, but many are good, some a few will hire whomever is available. Homeschooling support groups can be a great way to meet other parents. While other parents may try to convince you that how they homeschool, the curriculum and style are the \u201cbest\u201d way, they\u2019re a great way to see the variety of styles and figure out what fits your style. You\u2019ll meet parents you want to emulate and ones you want to avoid. It\u2019s a group. That\u2019s to be expected. ",

            "answer_text": "If you're not equipped to do lesson planning yourself, but still prefer homeschooling, I would strongly suggest you look into K12. It's an online school program that is part of the public school system. My son wasn't doing well in highschool. I took him out and signed him up for a local K12 program. We soon received all needed items. A laptop, printer/scanner, science project items, microscope, books. Basically everything but WiFi. He did really well. He loved it. Told me it was the best thing I ever did for him. After work I would go through his days work, help him where he needed it, and showed him resources for the help I couldn't offer. I took him on \u201cfield trips\u201d to museums and other places that supported his lessons. And best of all, when we went on vacation the only thing that changed was where he did his school work. The staff and teachers are very helpful and accommodating. I strongly suggest you look into it. ",
