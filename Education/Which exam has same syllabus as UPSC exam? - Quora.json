            "answer_text": "Hello friend Since the syllabus of UPSC exam cover such a wide spectrum of topics it mostly includes everything in its syllabus. Here's the thing the depth and the cut off of every exam makes the syllabus vary. Say, in UPSC exam CSAT qualifying paper so a UPSC aspirant would focus more on prelims and answer writing compared to CSAT. The syllabus is mostly common to State Civil Service( but the state service exams would focus more on the state\u2019s history, geography etc), mastering the CSAT part helps you in exams like SSC, PO, Clerk,RRBs, CDS and many more. Having said that I would again like to bring your focus to the fact that the depth and the pattern of questions are found to have different level of difficulties. I sincerely hope my answer helps you in understanding the scenario clearer. Good luck. ",
