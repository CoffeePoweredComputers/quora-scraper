It\u2019s a really quick set of tests (urine and blood to test your sugar levels, insulin levels, hormone levels and organ function) and you\u2019ll have results within a week. You could do it at a walk in clinic. Once that\u2019s out of the way, you need to talk to your parents about why they feel they need you to do in person. It could be they don\u2019t feel comfortable leaving you alone at the house for long stretches while they have to work, or they worry you won\u2019t be able to keep up. But get your vitals checked first so everyone\u2019s working off of known quantities. ",

Second - ask your parents if it is alright with them if you do online schooling at home ? if so then do it this way but if not then you have to go to school ! having diabetes has nothing to do with online schooling ! for you can do your diabetes thing before you get to school ! my brother has diabetes and can go to work after he takes care of his diabetes ",

You ask your parents to get an appointment for testing and discussing your concerns with the doctor. While you are waiting for the results, the doctor will provide the information that you and your parents and school will need to know to adjust your diet, exercise, and studies. As long as you maintain good hygiene and manners, COVID is a manageable concern. If you are concerned about restricting yourself to online studies, ask your doctor to check data for your area and speak with your parents. The only thing you can do is learn the facts, not the rumors, and discuss it to a conclusion. ",
