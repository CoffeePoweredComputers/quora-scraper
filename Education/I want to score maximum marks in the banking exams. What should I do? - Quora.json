            "answer_text": "Certainly you can score good marks in bank exams. i have personal experience of this. Keep in mind few things: (well list of few might go on and on\u2026 i ll list only few of few's) Trust Yourself and be motivated: This is the most important thing, have patience and continuously do the hard work. Remember hard work will eventually pay off, there are no shortcuts to success. Have a solid Plan: This is what helped me most. Understand the paper well, know your strengths and weaknesses, focus on your strength. They never expect you to know every answer in the set but they want to know how well u manage those 2 hours to get the best possible score. When you make final strategy, count down to every minute. Use Internet: Use different websites for studies and information, banking and current affairs are all available on hundreds of websites my personal favourites are: Current Affairs Today - Current Affairs 2015-2016 AffairsCloud for Competitive Exams Bankers Adda - IBPS PO, SBI, RRB Improve your mind level : by continues practice and regular calculations. even if you know a problem solve it again and again so as to increase your speed. its not a test of knowledge but of speed and accuracy. Practice Test : YES it is very very important. at least one daily. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "As we are listening from our childhood, attempt that questions first which are easy for us and in doing which we take very less time, Similar the case for bank exams also there is no rocket science in that (especially in mains examination) Although the competition is getting stiffer day by day, but to get the good job and lifestyle you have to win yourself\u2026.. To get maximum marks in an exam you have to do as much practice as much you can. It is so stringent for us but this is the only way\u2026. ",
