            "answer_text": "We can not compare advanced online class with offline class held in the school first both of them should be with reach of every student. In india right now there are many student who can not acrewss to online class due lack of facilities. IN many part of india there is no internet or very poor internet which make it diffcult for online education. In region such as kasmir due to govement rules most of the time there is no intenret or if there is only 2 G available which made diffuclt for video call to happen. I think both facilites should be available then there should be comparision of these a sthen only we can understand then what is good for the student. Hope you like my answers.
