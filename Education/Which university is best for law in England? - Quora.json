            "answer_text": "The usual suspects ! Oxford and Cambridge. Most lawyers in the City of London working as commercial /corporate lawyers are Oxbridge graduates. If you can't get into either of those two universities next in line in the pecking order are: University College London, Kings College London, & The London School of Economics. Then Durham, University of Bristol, University of Nottingham, & University of Manchester. I personally know someone who got a job as a corporate lawyer in a major City of London law firm, with a 1st Class Hons in Law from University of Liverpool. But that was in 1993. ",
