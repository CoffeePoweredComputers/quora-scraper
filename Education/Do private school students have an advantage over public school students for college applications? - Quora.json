            "answer_text": "To a certain extent, maybe a private school educated kid (whom I will refer to as student A) can be at an advantage than a poor student who made the best of himself (whom I will refer to as student B). There are different types of situations with the question that you have posed and so there can different types of circumstances. One situation: Grades and School-Competitiveness If student A does not get good grades and student B gets good grades, and vice-versa, then student B will have a higher chance of getting into that college than student A. However, there is also the question of the difficulty level of that school. If the school that student B goes to is not academically-challenging and the school that student A goes to is, then the admissions officers may look at student A\u2019s grades with a different eye regardless of the fact that they might not have good grades on their transcript. Another situation: Extracurriculars If student A does more extracurricular activities, such as partaking in a sports team or helping out in a certain place where he/she may have gained life-skills and experience, but student B does not have that many extracurriculars that has gained the student\u2019s skills, then student A might have an advantage in this case. One more\u2026: Effort and Passion College admissions will take a special note of how much effort you have put forth in trying to attain your goals. If you do not seem to put forth the effort to get into that college and do not look like you are passionate learner, then obviously they will overlook your application and take the time to consider a candidate who seems like they are willing to sacrifice their time in order to learn in this college. And this is something that not only colleges consider, but in whatever job you decide to go to in the future, you will always be evaluated on your passion and dedication. There is nothing more that an school or an employer wants than to have people who will work hard and achieve the set of good expectations that the school wants their students to meet and the set of good expectations that students set for themselves.

            "answer_text": "Not always, but on average, private school educated kids have significant advantages over public school kids because their parents can afford private school: they have money. The first issue is that money buys health. Here\u2019s a fact I only found out recently: the primary reason children miss school in the poorest counties in the U.S. is cavities. They aren\u2019t being educated to their potential, despite the best efforts of educators, because they can\u2019t afford a trip to the dentist. Second, money buys opportunity. Not just for school: tutoring, books, computing devices, music instruments and lessons, sports equipment, travel costs for team activities, summer camp, and so on. How is a poor student supposed to be \u201cwell rounded\u201d or explore her interests when she can\u2019t afford these things? If that\u2019s a factor in college admissions, then the poor student is disadvantaged. Give a poor, but driven, student the same health, the same education, and some assistance to compensate for the lack of time and attention from parents (who are too busy working, because they\u2019re poor), and they can have the same or better outcomes. In the U.S., we generally don\u2019t provide those things, so we have some of the lowest economic mobility of the last century. In other countries, government provides a baseline, and poor students can make quite a bit of themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know very much about this topic, but yeah. I would think so. Private schools are generally harder curriculum, stereotypically. The same can be said of a junior college and a full university. I think it's mostly bias.If they are truly the same score on a standardized test, however, they may be of equal likihood. Like if the collge they were applying to gave a test of some kind. Or maybe the SAT/ACT scores, that may just be because of removing the bias, though.Have a nice day. :) ",
