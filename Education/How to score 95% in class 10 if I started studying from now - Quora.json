            "answer_text": "First of all 9th class is totally different from 10th class . Have a positive attitude and forget what was your level in 9th class. Maths: Remember formulae and know the concepts and do NCERT for practice. If you go to tuition then do the homework/classwork seriously. Do RD Sharma\u2019s important question ask your teacher to mark the important question . Science: Class and tuition notes for theory purpose. You can also buy S Chand and can read from there but they have given unnecessary details also (very elaborative content present). So I Prefer you to Stick with NCERT. NCERT QUESTIONS more than enough for practice. English: NCERT + ALL in one (best combo). Practice NCERT and do previous year questions. See in book how to write the answers (in point to point manner). Social Science: NCERT More than enough . Read history as a story book. Hindi: NCERT+ Any refrence book to know the meaning of lines in poem. Do yoga and meditation and don\u2019t take much stress it\u2019s just an exam .You can do it :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hey buddy , Go only through syllabus ( nothing will be comes out of syllabus) 10 years solved questions papers definitely help you to score 90+ (I use Arihant publication that time and I am much satisfied with that) If you use side books like S.chand , R.S aggarwal , Pradeep etc. It's good but you have to read ncert throughly because 80% questions are come directly from ncert ( specially the exercise, the bold one ,and questions in the middle of the chapter) Self study is more important in all of these ( this is what more than half student does) All the best ",
