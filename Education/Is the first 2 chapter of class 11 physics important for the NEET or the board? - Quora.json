            "answer_text": "Hey !! So the first chapter of physics class 11, which is Physical World, is not important at all. You can leave this chapter. Coming to the second chapter, which is Units and Measurements, is not so important. Not more than 2 questions will be asked from here in NEET. The questions that are asked are based on Significant Figures or Errors. But these questions are scoring so try to practice such questions Hope this helps you. Thank You !! ",

There is at least one question on dimensions in entrance exams. So it's better to study the dimensions. Scalars and vectors on the contrary is not that important. But it is very easy. Go through it once! :) ",
