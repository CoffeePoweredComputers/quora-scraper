            "answer_text": "'Learn about computers' ? By your question I'm guessing you just want them to learn how to operate or use a PC. So I'll answer according to that.  Step 1 : Get a computer/laptop if you don't have one. Step 2 : Let your children try and learn new things on their own on the desktop by experimentation. You can give a hand obviously if you know computers. Step 3 : If they don't proceed in step 2, then there are many courses open now which teach your children about how to operate computers and other stuff within just a few days. Quite helpful. That's it I guess. Pretty easy stuff. Plus even if you don't make them go through all courses and shit then they'll end up learning about it on their own. Kids nowadays. Also, taking up computers as a sixth subject in school helps a lot too. All the best :) ",
