            "answer_text": "First of all, understand why you\u2019re procrastinating. You say you need to learn something you don\u2019t enjoy. Why do you need to learn it? For your job? Why don\u2019t you enjoy it? Is it boring? Is it hard? Overwhelming? There's a whole load of reasons it could be. Here\u2019s a mind-map I\u2019ve distilled from various sources and applied my own thinking to. You\u2019ll have to zoom in I\u2019m afraid!  Determining a strategy The mind map here isn\u2019t gospel -it\u2019s my interpretation of the work of various sources as I\u2019ve said. But it does give you a clear view of where you may be stuck. Fuzzy goals? Perhaps you need to really look into why you're doing this learning. Boredom? Is there a way you can automate? Are there little milestones that can keep your motivation up as you chip away at them? At the end of the day, there is usually a tactic you can deploy to move yourself a bit further forward. Process over product Understanding why, might help you determine a strategy, but ultimately you just need to start. Now I'm not saying blindly dive in, that\u2019s where the determining a strategy comes in, as per above. What I am saying is that the technique to stick to the strategy remains constant, and remarkably simple. Process over product. Stick to your strategy for a fixed, but manangeable block of time. Focusing on the process rather than the outcome is the key. Or put another way, don't beat yourself up about the perfect end result, just get yourself consistently 'turning up' and applying techniques to *start*. And using something like the pomodoro technique, or even telling yourself \u201cI'll just do this for 5 mins\u201d is often enough to get you in a state of flow. Think about when you don't feel like exercise but you force yourself. One of two things happen: it wasn't as bad as you though once you got into it. Or, you didn't have a great run/workout but you still managed it. And therefore you're still that little bit better than before. It's no different to getting this work done. You may be doing this for your boss rather than your health, but the work will still be there regardless of you ignoring it. If you can conquer this procrastination most of the time, you\u2019ll be making great progress, just a little a day. ",

            "answer_text": "Learning something you don\u2019t enjoy is a surefire way to retain absolutely nothing. To me it is a real waste of time! And here is how I deal with it. I first ask myself why I am learning something I don\u2019t enjoy. And 99.9% of the time I find that it is because someone told be I had to. Not because I decided to try it out. So, then I ask myself why I am being asked to learn it. Is it because it is a required course in school? Or a course needed for my job? Why am I doing it? The WHY is the most important thing. Once I sort that out, I try to figure out if there is a different way to achieve the person\u2019s goal for me. Is there a different class I could take? Or is there a book I could read? Or someone else who could learn this task so I could learn something else? Then I talk to the person who has asked me to learn what I don\u2019t enjoy and tell them what I have discovered and provide some alternatives to the current situation. And please don\u2019t assume they will say no! Keep an open mind and be open and honest with your thoughts and concerns and ideas. You may find that you no longer have to learn this thing you don\u2019t enjoy. Or you may find that you do. And if you do, your final step is to try some different methods to motivate yourself. Perhaps a reward upon completion. Maybe an accountability partner or study buddy. Sometimes even a shift in your perspective about why this information is important and how you can use it in your life. Good luck! And I hope you always find enjoyment in what you are learning! ",
