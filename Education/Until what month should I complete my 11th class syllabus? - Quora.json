I would definitely suggest you to go with it at the same pace as it goes in your school. There is no need to hurry up and complete the things in half the year and then spend time in revising it etc. Instead of it try to be strong at the foundations and basics, instead of keeping a target of completing things try to keep a target of learning it as deep as possible. At each chapter or stage try to go as deep and as strong a possible. For example if a topic of first order differential equations going on, then try practicing different variants of it, different problems from various books etc, rather than fixing a target of completing it asap. And if you still find time then use it to pursue your other interests. This time is apt for learning and trying new things so don't give it up..... ",
