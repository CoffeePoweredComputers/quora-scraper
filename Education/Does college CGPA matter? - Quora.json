            "answer_text": "This from my personal experience..because once i was also asked this question. A) Why CGPA should be high? 1. For better placement (that is what you want hear :D). 2.For parents Hard Work. 3. For status of topper or may be to self motivate. 4. If in case CLG does not place you\u2026then to get quick job in outside world. 5.If you are the person who is attention seeker or live the society where success is measured by person\u2019s marks. 6. or may for some other reasons. now carefully observe every reason behind it and you will know that except first reason all other reasons are TOTALLY BULLSHIT. YES even second also\u2026because your parents only want to see you as a successful person and there are so many other ways to be successful. B) What is actually important? 1. Do not study for marks\u2026study for ultimate knowledge and if you choose your field accidentally then build interest in it.because after all it is engineering.each and every brick of the engineering is interesting. 2. Don\u2019t listen to others. do what your heart says\u2026(mostly about placement news) 3.Last one\u2026..har koi apne life main kuch na kuch kar hi leta hai..so dont bother about your future just focus on your present. Thats it\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "This is one the most debated topics during results and placement season. My view - Yes, they do matter. True, your CGPA is not everything, but it is still significant. People who blatantly claim that CGPA does not matter at all, are usually the ones who do not have a good CGPA. Coming to the fact, no one will ask your CGPA or even Board marks in the future. But, you will need them in the immediate future. Good 10th Marks  = Good School in 11th and 12th Good 12th Marks = Good College Good CGPA = Advantage in getting a higher studies admit, Job. An interviewer, scanning through tons of resumes, will be attracted by a 9 more than a 6. ",

Let's say you scored your CGPA by referring the notes prepared in class and doing some selected questions, my answer would be NO. Instead, if you are having conceptual clarity regarding the course and if you are able to form a connection between various courses, then YES. I have purposely not included terms like internship/ higher studies etc. If you think a number can get you a job, a better number from anyone else in the future can remove you from the job as well. Your focus should be on something which is hard to replicate. Assignments assigned during a course are submitted by everyone, but if you are able to see something during an assignment that is not seen by any of your classmates, is what, which will make you unique. \u201cGetting CGPA the right way is more important This is my view on CGPA being a third-year undergraduate.
