            "answer_text": "Udemy offers various short term Data Science Programs and these programs are pre-recorded programs wherein you can start off with self-paced training. These courses are best suited wherein if you want to know about Data Science, how it works. But if you want to change your career and want to go through rigorous training then these courses offered by Udemy are not the best option you get. There are various platforms that you can find wherein you can take up a Data Science training program, wherein you will get proper exposure through the training with lots of in-depth knowledge and project training. Platforms like Simplilearn, Edureka, Intellipaat, Learnbay provide Data Science training programs. Among these above-mentioned platforms, the one that I would recommend is Learnbay. They offer IBM Certified Data Science Programs and they have designed these courses especially for working professionals. The courses are designed in such a way wherein they can target the desired job roles. The Programs offered by Learnbay are: Data Science and AI Certification: This is for those with a job experience of 1 to 5 years. This course is aimed at all individuals who want to begin their technical careers as an ML programmer and data scientist. AI and ML Certification Program: This course is designed for the ones having more than 5+ years of work experience. This course is designed for the ones in the search for in-depth expertise in AI and ML. Data Science & AI for Managers and Leaders: This course is designed for the ones having 9+ years of work experience. With these many years of work experience, you must target for managerial roles. ",
