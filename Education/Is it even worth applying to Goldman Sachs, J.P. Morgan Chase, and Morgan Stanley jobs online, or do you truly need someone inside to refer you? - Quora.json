            "answer_text": "No, it isn\u2019t worth applying online. That application is nothing more than HR housekeeping. If you go to a target school, they\u2019ll come to you through your careers department and interview you in person on campus. If you don\u2019t go to a target school, your best\u2014and probably only\u2014option is to exploit the hell out of your university\u2019s alumni network. Go through the last five to ten years of graduates, and find as many current or former investment bankers as possible. These guys and gals have: one, already done what you\u2019re trying to do, and two, possess a professional banking network and contacts that will prove more valuable to you than a literal bar of gold. Trust me, I know; I went to a state school in central California. It was an excellent institution, but had no banking presence whatsoever. So I did it myself. I started researching, networking, and preparing for a banking job during the first quarter of my sophomore year. This head-start was invaluable. Investment banking interviews are notoriously difficult, especially for yet-to or recently graduated BS/MBA\u2019s. They are highly technical, and exhaustive, and very little of what you learned in the classroom applies because this is the real world. MD\u2019s can\u2019t bank on myths like revenue synergies or perfect-states or pure-plays because they don\u2019t exist except between the pages of bible-thick textbooks. This means you will have to dedicate a significant portion of your free time to learning (or re-learning) the technical information necessary to survive on the job. It\u2019s what I had to do. I devoured every investment banking textbook I could find (Training the Street, Investment Banking, Valuation, etc.), wrote out the answers to 300 plus practice interview questions, ran through dozens of mock interviews, networked relentlessly, and even helped found a university club dedicated to training students for banking jobs and then helping them break in. (They liked this *hint* *hint*) I maintained a high GPA (*hint* *hint*), worked a relevant (private wealth management) summer internship between my freshman and sophomore years to pad my work experience, and did whatever else I could think of to make myself stand out, including assisting a finance professor with the authorship of his new textbook, published before graduation (*hint* *hint*). And all of that would have amounted to nothing if not for a single alum. One who I almost didn\u2019t contact. Without him, my resume wouldn\u2019t have made it past the receptionists. But I reached out, managed to impress him, and was notified I\u2019d made it through the first round at my number one choice three days later (JPM). I did well on the phone interviews, got invited to the third round superday, and voil\u00e0\u2014a summer internship that ended with a full-time analyst offer. Honestly, I cannot stress enough how important networking is to landing a banking job. If you\u2019re from a non-target school and you neglect it, don\u2019t bother with the rest. It won\u2019t happen. Get a nice, easy, back-office finance job, do a two-year rotation, and settle in for a lifetime of budgets and expense reports. Or pick up the phone, and maybe get your dream job. Up to you.  Thanks for all the upvotes! ",

            "answer_text": "While I don't work for one of the mentioned companies, I do work for one that sits above them all on every Forbes list. I do know people whom have left us to go to work at Sachs. As I work in IT, I can only speak for those types of positions, but someone does have to go through those online application. While unsolicited applications for executive level positions might be added to an ignore pile, as more likely than not they already know who's getting the job, you always have a chance with entry level positions. Look at it this way, if you have no other \u201cin\", it can't hurt! You never know who's attention you might grab. I got laid off about 8 years ago. I was given a very good severance package, and was planning on taking a few months off to hunt around for the \u201cright\" job. However our HR department was working really hard to find us jobs (our entire department was getting closed down). They happened to get us a job fair at the home office of the largest company in the world. So about 3 weeks before our final day, I found myself going through a bunch of interviews. Later I get a call from the HR recruiter, she tells me than none of the managers that were hiring had asked for a second interview (the positions I had applied for) but that a manager who had been in one of the interviews thought I might be a good fit for a position a peer of his had open. They ended up loving me, and I'm still there doing well. And it was just a crazy series of events he had even been there. The job fair rules required each interview to have 4 managers. They couldn't find a 4th manager that was hiring to fill out my interview group, so they just grabbed someone who was handy to make a fourth. He didn't have any open positions on his shift, but he was one of four managers that ran his department. And another manager WAS looking for someone. So if I haven't have just been fishing in the dark, and if they hadn't have been short interviewers that day, I wouldn't be where I am today. I'm very happy where I am today. Did miss out on the several months paid vacation I thought I was getting when I was laid off, but it all worked out for the best. ",
