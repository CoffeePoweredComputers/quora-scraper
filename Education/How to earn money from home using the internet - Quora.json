            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been making money on the internet full time for the last 6 years, I\u2019d be happy to help. It took a few years to figure out what works and what was a scam. IMPORTANT: I now focus on just 3 online business models, and make over $1M per year\u2026 (Crazy what happens when you focus on what works). Before getting to the answer, it\u2019s really important to understand the following: Making money online keeps us truthful, the numbers will never lie. If you put in the work, you will make money, if you don't put in the work, you won't make money. The amount you make is in relation to the amount of work you\u2019re willing to put in. I\u2019ll show you 10 ways that I currently make money online (all within the 3 online business models), that you can start without spending money. Also, I\u2019ll show you 10 ways that I do not recommend for making money online. You don\u2019t need to buy any courses, or have any specific skills to get started. Additionally, you don't need to sell anyone anything! With that said, I\u2019ll list the categories below, then I\u2019ll attach a video to explain the categories broken down into 10 specific websites. Categories Print On-Demand: Creating simple, catchy, funny, or even text only, designs that are uploaded to websites that offer that design to be printed on clothing items and accessories. You create the designs (with design apps) and upload them to the big print on-demand websites, then they create virtual listings of your \u2018products\u2019, and market them for you. Then when someone order an item, the website prints the item with the design on it, ships it to the customer, and handles all customer service. They take a split of the profit, and you get the rest. [How To Video] Affiliate Marketing: Creating reviews, comparisons, articles, about products or services, then linking the reader/viewer to the product where they can purchase it, and the company who sells the product will give you a commission for referring the person. [How To Video] Information Products: Creating online courses, or ebooks, to share your knowledge on a specific topic, and selling it digitally around the world. You only have to create the online course, or ebook, one time and you can sell it time-and-time again digitally. Rather than writing a novel for you, here\u2019s a video to explain 10 best websites you can use to start making money online, without spending money.  Additionally, here\u2019s a similar video with the 10 ways that I do not recommend for making money online:  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been making money online since 2005. It\u2019s been over 15 years. I quit my full-time job 2 years ago to become a full-time blogger. Right now, I\u2019m making a living from online i.e from my blog. You can read my blog\u2019s journey to find all the details. Here\u2019s a screenshot of earnings from an affiliate product I promote on my log (which generated over $240,000 in affiliate commissions).  At an average, I earn around $10K from my blog. So yea, my answer to your question on how to earn money online is this: start a blog. Starting a blog has its own benefits including; Helps you generate incomeHelps you build a brandHelps you network with other bloggers and influencersImproves your marketing skillsImproves your writing skills (if you\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to create content for your blog)And the list goes onAnd.. the best part is, it doesn\u2019t cost you much. In fact, you can start your own professional blog on platforms like WordPress for just under $100/year budget. Yes, you heard it right. All you need to start a professional blog is a domain and web hosting. If you\u2019re just getting started, web hosts like Bluehost will be more than enough. It also offers you a free domain for the first year. You can set up your own blog on Bluehost within 10 to 15 minutes. Here are a few important tips that helped me build a profitable blog. If you\u2019re planning to start a new blog, use these tips as they can help you a lot. Focus on one topic: Most beginners make a mistake by covering too many topics. It\u2019s not the right way. Focus on one topic. Cover in-depth content around that one particular topic. Get more traffic and build an audience around that one topic. Then, move on to the next topic. That\u2019s how you grow a new blog!Don\u2019t copy others: Another biggest mistake: stop stealing content from others. Also, don\u2019t replicate other\u2019s blog design, content etc. You should be unique. That\u2019s how you build a great blog from day 1.Learn how to sell: Profitable blogging is all about selling. Don\u2019t sound like a sales guy in the market. You should learn how to sell by educating your target audience. Find out a monetization strategy such as affiliate marketing, selling your own products, offering services etc to generate income from your blog.Invest money: Yes, you can start a blog for free. But free blogging platforms have limitations. If you\u2019re planning to start a blog to make money, learn to invest. Invest in proper hosting, domain, essential tools etc as they are all going to help you build a successful blog quickly.So there you go. Have any questions? Let me know in the comments.

            "answer_text": "There are many different businesses that you can focus on and we will look at what you should look for within a particular business that you want to do. There are great many opportunities for you in creating a work at home business that focus on the Internet and online. Affiliate marketing is the most common. Some of the categories that you can market include finance and investment, food and beverage, automotive, and health and fitness. Each affiliate program will list their website as well as a small description on what they do and you will want to visit the website as well. If you are going to be spending a great deal of your time promoting a particular website and program, you'll want to make sure that this is worth your while. Also, with each of these particular programs, you should look at how much money you would be making by selling each of these. You'll probably find several programs that seem interesting to you so see which one peaks your interest and pays well and head for that opportunity. For me I have been using Cickbank, Ebay, and Amazon although I have preciously used Maxbounty, Ogads which are still great options. As far as fair warning for what seems to be opportunities on the Web for other things, there are many different websites that promise that you can make money through either taking surveys or through posting on free forums for several hours day. This sounded good and many people have signed up and found that they have wasted a great deal of time and money in the end when trying out these so-called \u201copportunities\u201d. Remember to listen to your gut when you're thinking about this. There are many work-at-home scams out there so make sure to take your time in reading about what the different websites have to offer. Another great work home business that has an online focus can be eBay. This is stressed throughout some articles on this website but it is a great tool for you to begin your career. You can learn how to write sales copy for your auctions as well as how to properly promote yourself. If you take the lessons to be learned on eBay and apply them to other Internet marketing areas, you will find yourself ready to tackle almost anything out there. This is just is not all that is out there but it all depends at what skills you have and what you are able to do well.

            "answer_text": "Well there are indeed a lot of ways to make money online from home and I can definitely list some of the for you .  Freelancing- this is a way where you get paid for writing for business and companies on the internet after getting accepted for a particular job offer you can start getting paid and make a good amount of income.Copywriting- this is also another great way you can use to make money online it's the same as freelancing but this is much better and requires skills that can help a particular business get the sales they need and copywriting is the root of business as everyone knows because every single product needs a form of writing or a sales letter to get customers to buy the product they offer.Online surveys- this is another method to make money online but you cant expect to make decent amount of money to change your life by completing online surveys and reviewing products online because they pay you from a few cents to a few dollars .Affiliate marketing- this a program where people get paid for promoting a particular product and get a commission for that product they sell you really dont need to ha e a physical product and all you need to do is have another person buy the product you're promoting and get paid a commission and it's a very great way to earn money.Dropshipping- this is a way where you can make money online by selling products online by buying them for cheap from sites like Alibaba and sell them for more on Amazon.So these are some of the ways you can use to make money online by using the internet from home and if you're just starting out or have a little knowledge about making money online check out the link of the program that can help you setup your business and reprogram your mindset so you can be successful both in your financial situation and your life as a whole. PS- checkout the link to the program on my profile which shows you everything you need to know to start up your own business and get successful.

            "answer_text": " Making money on the web has become a routine activity. Just two decades ago, when the internet was considered a luxury, nobody could believe that it would be so easy to earn from home, using just a computer. Today, I want to present to you a shortlist of the trendiest directions that can help make money on the internet: start a blog;write books;start a YouTube channel;become an online translator;enrol in affiliate advertising;start selling online;create an online casino;use your voice;take online surveys.Start a Blog Blogging is a good way to make a quick profit. Starting your blog is easy. There are many free platforms for this. Your life definitely has something interesting to talk about. Even if you do not visit different countries every month, but simply lead a peaceful life, there is always something that may be of interest to other people. Are you creative? Show off your work, immerse your readers in this topic, and tell stories about how you do it and what inspires you. Do you walk a lot? Take photos of your favourite places, city attractions or just tell others what is best to visit in your city. Eventually, profit will come from sponsored articles or goods that you will show in your photos. As easy as that! Write Books  Nowadays, everyone lives on the Internet, spending time chatting, searching for information, or simply reading books online. Online authorship, as a form of making money, does not require any investment. If you have an interesting story and want to tell it to others, feel free to start writing. And you can place your creations on such platforms as Apple's App Store, Google Play Store, or Amazon's Kindle. First, you can give away your books for free or ask for a minimal price. As you gather a wider audience, you can increase the cost of your books. Start a YouTube channel This is a very profitable business. Create entertaining videos, make up animated clips, or run a travel blog. Share your videos on the channel, get views, and, of course, profit. All it takes is a quality camera and a good idea. By uploading a video to YouTube, you should immediately monetize it. When users watch the video, YouTube will advertise and share with you a portion of its income. The amount depends on the number of views and subscribers on your channel. For example, a channel with a million users brings its owner from 100 to 300 thousand dollars a month! Success depends only on how interested people are in your content and editing skills. Become an Online Translator For people who know two or more foreign languages, there is always the possibility of additional income. Several freelance platforms can easily help you find a job. In most cases, these sites work like auctions, where each translator offers their prices, and the customer chooses which option suits him. The customer and the translator solve their money issues through the platform. The more exotic the language is, the higher the price can be (but the demand can be lower). Affiliate Advertising  If you have your own portal or informational resource, you can earn additional income from advertising your partners by actively promoting their product on your website. In this case, you will receive money only when your visitors follow the backlinks from your website. Affiliate marketing is pretty diverse since you can agree on different types of cooperation (you can get paid for clicks or clients\u2019 actions). Sell Online Hand-made things are getting more and more popular. If you know how to make jewellery, knit, or make stuffed toys, this is a good way to make money. Thanks to such social networks as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, you can easily find your target audience. Create an Online Casino No jokes, you can become an owner of your own online gambling establishment. And there is no need to invest millions. Even though a personal casino from scratch costs around $150,000, you can always work towards a franchise or a White label business. The organizational process takes just a few weeks and there is no problem with the legality. Use Your Voice Do you have a pleasant gentle timbre, or, on the contrary, a courageous baritone? Then you have a great opportunity to sell your voice. There are many Internet services for this. All you need for this is a good equipment to make high-quality audio recordings. You basically choose a task, complete it, and receive your money. What could be easier? Also, you can work on yourself and create podcasts with sponsored mentions of their items and services. You just want to ensure that the public loves your voice. Take Online Surveys  Quite recently, it was hard to imagine that you can earn extra money by answering the questions on the internet. They pay a little here, but you can always make yourself a certain amount. However, be ready to get paid with vouchers from popular online stores. As you can see, there are tons of ways to make money from home using the internet. The only thing that you need is determination. Pick a direction that you enjoy and work towards receiving profit from it. This is what happened in my case. I decided to turn my gambling hobby into a simple project. A few years later, I am a successful owner of a few huge online gambling establishments. By the way, Online Casino Market and their convenient turnkey casino solution played a great role in this story. Have a beautiful day! ",

            "answer_text": "Arguably, the internet is the greatest invention by mankind since the stone age. Let\u2019s recall some history: Agrarian Age The agrarian age was a period in history when the economy was primarily based on production and maintenance of agricultural crops and farmland. Also known as the natural economy because of its overreliance on natural resources, the agrarian society had other means of livelihood and work habits but mostly stressed the importance of agriculture and farming as the primary source of income and the use of basic tools. As such, the agrarian society emphasized the ownership of land, shelter and agricultural produce as the primary source of wealth. The Industrial Age By design, the industrial age was rooted on industrial design was developed based on mass-manufacturing. As such, machines replaced most of the processes that were traditionally done by humans. The industrial society emphasized importance of land, manufacturing and other physical possessions as the primary source of wealth. The Knowledge Age Since at least 1959, management guru, Peter Drucker first described the rise of \u201cknowledge work\u201d in his book, Landmarks of Tomorrow. Decades later, Drucker was more convinced that knowledge was a more crucial economic resource than land, labor, or financial assets, leading to what he called a \u201cpost-capitalist society.\u201d In 2001, Peter Drucker declared as follows: \u201cThe next society will be a knowledge society. Knowledge will be its key resource, and knowledge workers will be the dominant group in its workforce. Its three main characteristics will be: Borderlessness, because knowledge travels even more effortlessly than money.Upward mobility, available to everyone through easily acquired formal education.The potential for failure as well as success. Anyone can acquire the \u201cmeans of production\u201d, ie, the knowledge required for the job, but not everyone can win.Together, those three characteristics will make the knowledge society a highly competitive one, for organizations and individuals alike. Information technology, although only one of many new features of the next society, is already having one hugely important effect: it is allowing knowledge to spread near-instantly, and making it accessible to everyone. Given the ease and speed at which information travels, every institution in the knowledge society \u2014 not only businesses, but also schools, universities, hospitals and increasingly government agencies too \u2014 has to be globally competitive, even though most organizations will continue to be local in their activities and in their markets. This is because the Internet will keep customers everywhere informed on what is available anywhere in the world, and at what price[1] . Enough with Drucker\u2019s predictions. Let\u2019s get back to the question: \u201cHow do I earn money from home using the internet?\u201d The Internet The internet emphasizes the importance of information, knowledge and data as the primary source of wealth. Therefore, to make money on the internet, you must find a way to sell information, knowledge or data. 95% of the world\u2019s economy is still offline. As such, most of the information, knowledge or data is used for purposes of feeding the offline economy. For example, suppose someone wants to find the cheapest air line from New York to Singapore. You won\u2019t believe it, but finding such information can be quite daunting, even intimidating for some people. But suppose you build a website for people to easily access such information. You can even make it easier by organizing the data by airline, by air fare and other features. The traveler will be able to find the data she\u2019s looking for quite easily. She\u2019ll even be able to customize the data, sort it according to any criteria she likes. Now, suppose you charge a small fee for the entire service. No big deal. However, online services have gone ahead and not only prepared such data for potential customers to consume, but also gone further and provided a ton of other value-added services to remain competitive because the competition for such services is very high. This is just one example of the myriad ways you can make money on the internet. And you can provide such a service from anywhere on your laptop or from the comfort of your home, because whether you\u2019re operating from a coffee shop across the world or from your bedroom in your home nobody cares as long as you deliver the service. Another popular way to make on the internet is to build a website, drive web traffic to it and then sell it for a fortune after a few years. #1 UGO \u2013 Sold For: $100 million; Year: 2007 #2 Fotolog.com \u2013 Sold For: $90 million; Year: 2007 #3 ConsumerSearch.com \u2013 Sold for: $33 million; Year: 2007 #4 PaidContent.com \u2013 Sold for: $30 million; Year: 2008 #5 TNCCompany \u2013 Sold for: $30 million; Year: 2008 #6 TechCrunch \u2013 Sold for: $30 million; Year: 2010 #7 Ars Technica \u2013 Sold for: $25 million; Year: 2008 #8 Weblogs.com \u2013 Sold for: $25 million; Year: 2005 #9 Livejournal \u2013 Sold for: $25 million; Year: 2007 #10 Bankaholic \u2013 Sold for: $15 million; Year: 2008 Can you see the numbers? Another popular way to make a fortune on the internet is to create a blog and then monetize it though affiliate marketing. The affiliate marketing industry is booming and is estimated to hit $6.8 billion by 2020. Sadly, less than 1% of people make any money on the internet. A paltry 0.1% are internet millionaires, while the remaining 98.9% either hardly know anything about making money on the internet, or are sitting on the fence as critics who actually believe that the whole make-money-online \u2018thing\u2019 is a fraud. That being the case, there\u2019s an underground group of online marketers, who have mastered the skill of making money online on demand, but you will hardly hear them blowing their mouths in a forum like this. Why should they? They make good money that any senior bank executive can only envy, so they don\u2019t feel morally obligated to reveal their trade secrets. So, how do they do it? The online marketing game is rigged against the small beginner. Even before you begin, the big guys will have already eaten your money, by selling you products they know won\u2019t work. On the other hand, if you want to learn it on your own, you will spend months or even years trying to figure it out, because the internet marketing game is becoming more advanced and sophisticated. There\u2019s the Hard Way, and there\u2019s the Easy Way.. So, instead of wasting your valuable time, effort, and money struggling to figure it out the hard way, why not just grab an already proven, DONE-FOR-YOU-SYSTEM? This will be more economical and comfortable for you because someone else has already spent their time, effort and money developing a system that\u2019s already working and earning them $100, $200, $300, $500 or even $1,000 per day.

            "answer_text": "The best route to do this is to take your current job or job that you are very good at and convert that into working from home. I\u2019ve successfully done this TWICE: I was a computer technician based in Atlanta where my employer and my customer were located. These were larger servers, not PC\u2019s, in which most of the work was able to be done through connecting to the systems through local or remote networks. I was making up to just under $80K up until about 2010 doing this. The way I converted this job from an on-site job to a telecommuting job was unique for the situation. My wife\u2019s job caused us to relocate from Atlanta to Chicago. We were a few people short in my department due to illness. So my boss suggested I could \u201cdial in\u201d (back when we still had dial-up lines to the systems) and work from home until I could find a new job in Chicago as he still needed my help in Atlanta. But after about six months of working from home, my boss said, \u201cWhy not just continue working from home? You\u2019re doing just as much telecommuting as you would be onsite\u2026\u201d. So I worked from home for the next ten years.Currently I\u2019m a real estate agent, but I work in a referral service for my company at the company headquarters. Typically I\u2019d have to work in an office about 50 miles away, driving one way. After a series of terrible snowstorms, several instances of having to cover co-workers who couldn\u2019t make it into the office, and showing managers that I could do everything from home, I was able to permanently work from home from that point on. I offered to be able to cover evening shifts with no extra fuss and do things a lot easier than I would have to do if I had to drive in. I still come into the office once every few months for major meetings, but for the most part, it\u2019s all working from home. I had one snag trying to get a VOIP phone to work correctly for the job I do, but when that got resolved, I can do everything I could do back in the office.So really, if you want to work from home, do what you do best and/or do what you love and you can transform the job into a \u201cwork from home\u201d job.

Stock Market: Buy promising stocks Buy the stocks of any brand you will purchase in the coming days (i.e. Amid lockdown) since post corona world will be essential commodity-focused and less luxury and comfort-focused. Buy essentials commodity brand stocks like FMCG, Pharma, etc. Peer-to-peer lending: Peer to peer lending India | Personal Loans & Alternative Investing - Lendbox or Faircent: Peer to Peer Lending India Lend small amounts like 25k, 50k, etc. to loan seekers and charge interest (up to 30%) based on their CIBIL score/credibility. When banks deny loans, people turn to such portals for small loans for travel, marriage, emergency expenses, etc. It is like starting a small finance company of your own. There is the obvious risk of non-payment in this (like any bank) but it is taken care of by these portals. For more, follow me on Quora or explore my blog.

            "answer_text": " As someone who's done this for almost 20 years now, I can tell you there are several ways to do it. Through Selling Products Online One of the best and easiest ways is to sell stuff online, like selling things on Ebay or Amazon. That's one of the easiest, lowest hanging fruit types of opportunities that exist. You can buy stuff locally at thrift stores, flea markets, swap meets.You can buy stuff locally using the Facebook marketplace or using the local Facebook classified ads. You can buy stuff locally and then sell it globally on Ebay or Amazon and you would be amazed at the kind of profits you can make. Now that's a work intensive type of business, but it's a great, honest business where you can buy stuff and flip it online for great profits. Through Freelancing Another way that you can make money online with your computer is to be a freelancer. By freelancing, I mean that you can go to these websites like Upwork. You can publish a profile there explaining what all your skills are, all the different things that you can do, and then people will hire you to do some of that stuff. So if you have basic office skills, you know how to work with spreadsheets, you know how to do some simple accounting, even proofreading or translating, there are many different tasks that you can do. If you just go visit those websites, you'll see what I mean. They have a list of all the different types of tasks that people are doing right now. So you can do that and you can make some pretty good money as a freelancer just offering your services online. My Favorite Method of Making Money Online The Third Way and the way that I liked the most is you can take your skills, your knowledge, your abilities, your talents, and package them up into a how to course a video course or video training. A course that shows people how to do what you're already good at, and that's a lot easier to do than you might imagine because if you can put a Powerpoint presentation together an narrate it over your computer, then you've got a course. It's a very, very simple way to build out an online course but once you do that, you can publish it on a variety of different marketplaces, not just on one! You can actually publish it on many different marketplaces, and every one of these marketplaces will start sending you income every time someone buys your online course. It's an incredible way to make money because it's not work intensive. You do the work once, and then it just keeps paying you over and over and over again. So I have a preference for the online course business. I have over 60 online courses, 60 different income streams coming in from a variety of different marketplaces. So I love this business. It gives me a massive passive and that's why I love teaching about it and showing people how to be successful with the online course business. I have also answered this question in the video below:  ",

            "answer_text": " Remote working possibilities have already excelled the conventional job offers with the presence of some peculiar features. Comfortable office (actually your home sofa), accessible environment (just a laptop and the internet needed), and plenty of time saved. However, there has recently been hardly any stable working opportunity to earn money on a stable basis. Therefore, I tried to gather the most efficient variants into a single list to give you an opportunity to make a wise choice, based on your preferences: monetize your YouTube blog;write a book and sell it on Kindle;sell the unnecessary staff on eBay;sign-up for a freelance platform;take and sell pictures on Getty Images;start online tuition courses;review music for money;offer your services on Fiverr;start an online gambling platform;receive cashback after your purchases;take up PPC (pay-per-click) jobs.The online gambling business has appeared on the market quite recently but has already won the attention of hundreds of operators with its profitability. I had severe doubts upon enrolling into this sphere, but an easy organizational process and a few persuasive features helped me make the first step that I had never regretted. How can an inexperienced entrepreneur launch a successful online gambling platform? First of all, you must elaborate a detailed business plan. It will consist of all stages of the organizational process, their peculiarities as well as concise information about your budget. With this guide, you will be able to move along a preplanned path and set up everything accordingly. Official registration Afterwards, you must ensure you operate on a legal basis, without a risk to receive permanent bans for illegal nature. That is why obtaining an official license is a must. You will have to pick up a jurisdiction that offers such services. Here is a shortlist of the most popular ones: BelizeCuracaoAlderneyGibraltarKahnawakeCosta RicaMaltaAll of them provide you with the possibility to operate legally. However, some of the conditions, requirements, and fees may be different. You are recommended to contact the local authorities to find out the latest details. Website and software Next, you must develop a platform itself as well as find the necessary entertaining and administrative content. It will be beneficial if you possess some programming skills. If you aren\u2019t familiar with coding, you may resort to any web-designing agency that will organize everything for you. The situation is similar with the necessary software. It is essential to find a reliable gaming manufacturer that will be able to provide you with high-quality gaming content and stable security systems. The payment methods are also crucial since people may use different means of replenishing their accounts. Try to ensure your platform is compatible with the most popular ones to be able to provide high-quality services to more clients. Advertising Your profit depends only on how successful the promotion of your platform will be. Since you are working from home, you will only need to take care of virtual advertising. Even though online gambling has restricted marketing access, there are still plenty of possibilities to make your website popular: search engine optimization will help Google find exactly your platform;social media marketing will target the most popular social networks and describe your enterprise in the brightest colours;affiliate programs will introduce your services to visitors of other popular sites;emailing will ensure that your potential clients know about you;video content will give you an opportunity to show your creativity and earn your clients\u2019 attention.Is there a way to skip all the stages and start earning from home immediately?  There is no chance for you to create a successful online gambling platform without all these stages. However, I managed to get everything done for me as soon as I resorted to the professionals from 2WinPower. They offered me a convenient turnkey business option, meaning I had my website ready without many efforts. It saved me a lot of time and gave me solid guarantees for a steady source of income on the internet. Hopefully, you will soon become another happy online gambling operator. ",

            "answer_text": "Fast Way to Earn Money in 2019 - You have to READ this!  This is the Fastest & Easy Way to Earn Money for part time. You can do this now! Related topic: http://Designblaz.com You\u2019re broke and payday is still a week away. You need to figure out how to make money fast. Christmas is Coming but are You Ready? Do You have already things to buy as a Gift for your lover. Family or Best friends or Relatives or your crush? WELL, we got that covered for you our Friend! You are in the right place. So now enough of the intro and let's see all the Best Fast Way to Earn Money! Part 1. 12 Best Legit Websites to EARN FAST CASH! Swagbucks Pays In Ten Days Or Less I almost didn't list Swagbucks here because, while it's a great rewards site, they list in their terms that you can't expect for up to 10 days after you cash out. However, it's still an option to earn fast cash because some people report getting paid much faster than this. You can redeem you SB (Swagbucks) for Amazon codes, Paypal cash, and gift cards to popular merchandisers among other things. These points build up quickly thanks the the large number of things you can do on the site to earn. I've used this site and been paid many times. You can read my review of Swagbucks here or sign up here. Online Surveys For $3 a Pop With Pinecone Research Pinecone is one of the best survey panels out there for earning fast cash, and they pay quickly \u2014 usually by the next day \u2014 for the surveys you complete. The surveys don't come every week, but it's a nice little bonus when they do because of how fast they pay. Right now Pinecone is open, but there is no guarantee you'll get in just depending on what demographic they need right now. Go here to sign up or learn more about how to join Pinecone Research. Earn Fast Cash Online With Ibotta Ibotta is an app that pays you back for things you buy at the grocery store. The reason I'm listing it here is because when you cash out, the money goes instantly (or almost instantly) to Paypal. I've never had to wait longer than five minutes to get my money from Ibotta! You can also earn from referrals there, too. However, you must have at least $20 in your account to cash out. Still, cashing out every week isn't unrealistic with consistent use. You can sign up for Ibotta here or read my Ibotta review here. Transcribe Me Pays Daily This is a site where you can sign up to transcribe audio files. They pay new transcribers $20 an audio hour (remember this is quite a bit longer than a regular hour). You can get in with no prior transcription experience, you just have to take a short test which I believe you can retake if you fail it the first time. You only need $1 to cash out, hitting the withdrawal button for payment any time as long as you have $1 earned. It might be one of the best ways to make money fast today if you can pass the skills test. Read my review of Transcribe Me or sign up here. Amazon MTurk Has $1 Minimum Cash Out This is another task-based site that makes it possible to earn fast cash online. They have a variety of work to choose from in several different categories. They pay with bank transfer and it can take about two days for money from there to hit your account, but you only need $1 to request a payout. The way to get money in your hands daily from here is to request a payout every day. Then, within a few days, you'll start seeing daily deposits from MTurk to your bank account. Is it easy to make $10 a day on Amazon MTurk? It actually is. You can get signed up here. Slice the Pie Pays Twice a Week Slice the Pie is a site I use quite frequently. All you do is listen to music and rate/review it. You'll get paid anywhere from six to seven cents up to sometimes seventeen cents per song you review just depending on if they have any promos going on. It only takes a few minutes to review a song. They pay out on Tuesdays and Fridays and you must have a minimum of $10 to withdraw your earnings, but this is very possible to do twice per week. You can sign up for Slice the Pie here or read my Slice the Pie review. InstaGC Offers Fast Cash Instantly InstaGC is a rewards site you can use to redeem instantly for Amazon gift codes (and all kinds of other gift codes). With this site, it's possible to earn money for doing all sorts of things which include short tasks, surveys, watching videos, listening to music, and more. What I love most about this one is that when you do redeem, there is NO waiting. You just ask for your code and it's there waiting for you on the next screen. It's also possible to request a check for a cash payment, but you will have to wait several days for that to show up in the mail. I have not yet reviewed InstaGC, but Work at Home No Scams has a very detailed review of how it works here. Qmee Pays Instantly This is a browser extension you can install that will occasionally show you sponsored advertisements on your sidebar when you search. Each advertisement is worth a few cents or more. If you visit the ad shown, you receive the dollar amount shown in your Qmee virtual \u201cpiggy bank\u201d. You can cash this out at anytime, there is no minimum. Also, the money shows up in your Paypal account pretty much instantly after you ask for it. I put this site on this list because even though it's not a big earner, you can get paid quickly. Go here to sign up for Qmee or read my Qmee review. Go here to sign up at Ibotta. Paid Viewpoint Another survey panel that pays fast, but you do have to have $15 in your account before you can cash out. This can take a while to reach if you don't have a lot of referrals. They are owned by the same people that run Instant Cash Sweepstakes. Typically payment comes to Paypal the same day you request it, although it has taken up to three days before. Go here to get started at Paid Viewpoint. TreasureTrooper This is another GPT site like many others, but definitely worth signing up for if you like instant payments. Complete surveys, offers, play games and more to earn cash. Once you've earned $20, you can cash out immediately to your PayPal account. Also, if you're looking for jobs for teens, you'll be happy to know this site lets you sign up as a teen with parental consent. Go here to get started with Treasure Trooper. Mindfield Another fantastic survey panel that still pays users in cash, not redeemable points. In the past, this site only paid out via check, but they've recently added Paypal as an option. Also, Paypal payments here are much faster than if you request a check. If you cash out via Paypal, you'll see your earnings sometimes within 5-10 business days. Go here to become a member at Mindfield. This panel is not always open to new members. Good luck to you if you decide to sign up and try any of these! Part 2. 28 Fast Way to Earn Money in 2019 1. Take Paid Surveys Websites like Survey Junkie will pay you a decent chunk of change for the low-maintenance, borderline mindless task of completing surveys. Companies want to understand consumers better, and one way they do that is by compensating survey-takers (a.k.a. you). Most surveys pay between $0.50 and $1.25, and many of them take less than 5 minutes to do. You can read our full Survey Junkie review for more info. Survey Junkie adds new surveys every day, which means you can make money faster than you think. If you\u2019re really into surveys, be sure to check out our list of recommended paid survey sites. 2. Get $5 from Swagbucks Swagbucks is another great survey site to make money fast. It\u2019s similar to Survey Junkie, but there are also a few other ways you can earn money as a member (including a $5 bonus just for signing up). Other ways you can earn with Swagbucks outside of surveys: Cash back program for internet shopping (includes $5 bonus).Get paid for searching the web (includes $5 bonus)Watching videos (includes $5 bonus)3. Get a Free $300 Bonus as a New Lyft Driver If you\u2019ve got some free time and don\u2019t live in the middle of nowhere, becoming a Lyft driver can be a very lucrative side hustle that allows you make money fast. And right now, they\u2019ve got a promotion going on where any new driver will instantly get a $300 bonus after completing their 100th ride. If you start now and hustle hard on the weekends, you can probably unlock that bonus within a few weeks of driving (and that\u2019s in addition to your normal earnings). 4. Download the Nielsen App (and Collect $50) Have you heard of Nielsen, the company that tracks TV ratings? Turns out they collect data on a lot more than just TV. One area they\u2019re really into is internet usage research. What does that mean for you? It means Nielsen will pay you $50 a year to keep their app on your favorite internet browsing device. The app itself collects statistics on your internet usage anonymously, so you never have to worry about any data being linked to you. And the best part is, the app takes up barely any space and doesn\u2019t slow down your phone or tablet at all! 5. Link a Card to DOSH and Get a Free $5 Instantly The DOSH cash back app has been creating a ton of buzz on social media lately, and for good reason: they are offering free money to attract new users. Here\u2019s how it works: Download the app and connect your credit and debit cards (they use bank-level encryption technology to keep your info safe)Accumulate cash backDeposit your cash back into your bank accountPerks of DOSH: All rewards are pure cash.You get $5 for every card you link to the app and $10 for every friend you refer to the app. Get a few family and friends to sign up and the money adds up quick! (Note: The $10 referral bonus varies. Sometimes it\u2019s only $5, but we\u2019ve seen it as high as $15 per referral).6. Let Trim Lower Your Bills I recently stumbled on the Trim app and I have to say, this one is a game changer. It\u2019s a simple app that acts as your own personal financial manager. Once you link your bank to the app, Trim analyzes your spending, finds subscriptions you need to cancel, negotiates your Comcast bill, finds you better car insurance, and more. And of course, the app is free! My bet is that it will only take a few days for Trim to put an extra $100 in your pocket. So easy! 7. Find Unclaimed Money Search for and claim forgotten money that may be due you from the official government agencies. is an awesome site for finding money that\u2019s due to you that you may have forgotten about. Examples: A utility deposit on an account you had forever ago, money left in a bank account you had as a kid, or a check from a former employer. 8. Drive with Uber and/or Lyft This is a really good use of your time if you are trying to make some extra cash in a weekend. By driving with Uber, you have the flexibility to drive whenever you want, which means you can make money fast, and it\u2019s on your schedule. Pretty slick! Pro tip: Sign up with both Uber and Lyft so you can compare fares and keep yourself busy. 9.

As a car owner, you can make $5+ per hour just by letting someone else borrow your car. Getaround offers $1 million primary insurance coverage, so you don\u2019t have to worry about possible damages.

You can deliver day or night, for however long you\u2019d like. You just sign onto the app, and you can start receiving delivery requests in your area. 12. Be a Personal Grocery Shopper with Instacart Have you heard of Instacart? It\u2019s a grocery delivery service for people who don\u2019t want to bother with the hassle of going to the store. What does that mean for you? An opportunity to make extra money! It works in a similar way to Uber Eats, in that whenever you need to make money, you simply sign into the app and mark yourself as available for shopping. As an Instacart personal grocery shopper, you will actually be doing the grocery shopping yourself (so don\u2019t crush anyone\u2019s avocados!). Your compensation depends on several factors, like the average size of your orders and average number of miles driven per trip. You can also get tips in addition to the pay that comes directly from Instacart (most people report an average earnings rate of $15 per hour). 13. Make $100 Fast with Listverse Do you love to write? Listverse, a popular site featuring tons of list articles, will pay you $100 to write a \u201clisticle\u201d of your own. You don\u2019t need to be an expert\u2014you just need to have English equal to that of a native speaker, a sense of humor, and a love for things unusual or interesting. 14. Answer questions on JustAnswer. People looking for expertise online. JustAnswer (and several sites like it) allow doctors, lawyers, engineers and others with enhanced knowledge to earn a small income merely answering questions from people who would otherwise have to pay a hefty sum for those answers. This platform is a great resource for people. It's also lucrative (for the time spent) if you're looking to earn a bit of cash in a hurry. Don't expect to get rich answering questions, but you can generate a few bucks here or there if you're in a bind. 15. Do gigs on Fivver. No matter what type of service you offer, you can likely offer it Fivver. This is terrific for digital services such as graphic design, web design, short audio or video clip creation, editing services, writing and so on. Fivver has expanded beyond just the $5-per-gig model. Fiverr Pro pools the best talent on its platform. Depending on your skills, you could do considerably well on here.

Rover is one of the largest networks of dog walkers out there. Of course, you could also use social media or just knock on neighbors doors to advertise your services, but you can easily use one of these services. Do a great job if you're serious about building a track record of solid reviews. That will help you make money in the future when you're in desperate need of it. 17. Babysitting with Find Child Care, Senior Care, Pet Care and Housekeeping. You can easily do some babysitting when you need to make a few bucks quickly. Parents everywhere are always in need of babysitting and nanny services. Websites like Find Child Care, Senior Care, Pet Care and Housekeeping connect parents with babysitters. The company does all the background checking and other due diligence to put parents' minds at ease. Of course, you can appeal directly to people in your personal network, but if you're looking to generate recurring revenue sign up with a site marketing to parents looking for child care services. 18. Photography Have an eye for photography? Of course, you need to be good at this to earn any money but it you are, you can sell photos on ShutterStock or iStockPhoto (along with many others) to generate a passive income from something you might be very passionate about. For a quicker way to earn by taking photos, solicit people looking for photographers to cover their wedding, engagement, child's birthday or any other life event. You'll need a good camera and some experience, but you can definitely earn some must-needed income this way no matter where you live. 19. Do personal training. If you understand fitness, you could be a personal trainer. People pay good money for personal trainers, if only to have someone keep them on track towards their goals. You can add value while also helping yourself financially. This could also break off into nutrition and assisting people with meal plans, and so on. You could solicit clients in your local gym, but depending on where you live, you might need some certification to do this (not to mention the gym's approval). You could also use a site like FitnessTrainer to advertise your services. Related: This Entrepreneur Lives in the Back Room at a Gym While Building His Business 20. Tutoring Parents are always willing to invest in their children's future. If you have a great deal of knowledge in subjects such as math, science or computers, you could tutor for cash. Both Job Search | Indeed and Find Child Care, Senior Care, Pet Care and Housekeeping offer opportunities for tutoring local students. You could opt for either of these platforms or simply find your clients through your personal network or social media. 21. Advertise for companies with a car wrap. Platforms like Carvertise connect brands and companies with drivers. The process is simple -- agree to turn your car into a roaming billboard for a price. If you qualify, you can earn a set monthly fee for advertising with your car. You won't have to pay anything to do this, but you'll need a clean driving record and a fairly new car. You'll have to drive the car enough to be worth it for brands paying for your services. If you have all that, then you could make a bit of side-hustle income through this endeavor.

Offering your services as a local gardener could make you enough money quick enough to satisfy some pressing needs. There are loads of options from mowing lawns and pulling weeds to planning gardens and decor. If you pitch to enough neighbors, you'll find at least a few takers. It'll definitely be worth your while. 23. Housecleaning. There's a variety of platforms online that you could tap into for doing this, or you could simply scour your neighborhood or post on social media. You could use Amazon's Home Services for this as well, or you could create your own simple, one-page website to advertise. Either way, this is a terrific way to make upwards of $20 per hour or more doing a job that's often in high demand. You could easily make this a long-term gig if you perform well and don't cut corners. Related: From $100 Million to Broke to Betting It All on Cryptocurrencies 24. Home organizing. You could easily do home organizing for people. If you're a tidy and organized person yourself, and you're good at organizing spaces, why not offer your services to people around you? You'd be surprised at how many people, even on your own social media feed, might take you up on doing something like this. Again, a site like Find Child Care, Senior Care, Pet Care and Housekeeping also helps to connect home organizers with people looking for this type of service. It all depends on whether you want to go through a professional company or pitch it yourself to people that are already in your personal or business network.

Rent a carpet cleaning machine at your local home improvement store, or buy one if you think you can get enough work doing this. You'll likely find lots of people need something like this, but haven't actively looked for the service. You can wash carpets in the owner's homes, or have them steam-cleaned offsite, depending on the job and the trust you build with the owners. 26. Give blood. You can \\make around $20 to $50 per donation of blood, depending if your blood type is rare or common. You can also donate plasma. Different states have different minimum requirements that must be paid when people donate plasma. Plasma donations help people who are fighting Leukemia and other immune disorders. This is a bit more complicated and involved than donating blood but you won't get much more than donating blood. 27. Decorate homes for the holidays. Whether it's New Year's, Christmas lighting, Easter, Fourth of July or any other holiday, you can get paid to help decorate homes. This might involve putting up lights inside or outside, decorating trees, setting up games and other decor.

            "answer_text": "Here are some of the options you could explore: - Freelancing - If you have a marketable and in-demand professional skill, you could list yourself on platforms like Upwork, Freelancer or Crossover and start earning. Areas of expertise range from data entry to complex technical projects as well. You could find mostly each marketable skill listed on these platforms with a project that needs a freelancer. - Search and Social Media Engine Evaluations - Checkout opportunities that Appen offers as an Internet researcher and evaluator for Google, Microsoft and Facebook. However, there is no guarantee of steady work and pay may not be enough for you to support all of your expenses. Still, learning is good. - Social Media Marketing - If you own a social media profile with really good followership and audience engagement, you can approach brands and help them tap into their target market through social media marketing. Payments can flow in for each post, social media banners or events. - Blogging - If you own a blog or website with good traffic, you can check out the Google Adsense program to earn money as well. - Influencer marketing - If you are an expert in any fields like technology, arts, education or entertainment, you can start your youtube channel, grow it and start earning through brand recommendations, reviews as well as by enabling your channel for monetization through youtube. -Affiliate marketing - Many retail websites as well as business brands allow bloggers and social media marketers to promote their products through an affiliate link. When your followers or visitors click those links and buy something from the brand, you get paid a fixed commission.- Stock market trading - With some capital and knowledge of the stock market, you can sign up with a broking firm and start trading in stocks to earn money as well. All of these options aside, you must first decide what is your expertise and there is enough material available online for you to learn how to grow each of these businesses. Just remember not to fall prey for scams and verify the credibility of platforms and people through online research beforehand. None of the above options except stock market trading I suggested, should cost a dime to get started. ",

CROSSING 25,000 MONTHLY PAGE VIEWS ON MY BLOG - FRUGAL BEAT Sharing my journey :) A dream I saw finally seems to be turning into reality. I started my blog as a complete newbie a few months back. And while scrolling Google Analytics today, I realized that I've crossed 25,000 pageviews. This makes me so so happy. All this while I've tried my best to create quality content without bothering about traffic or monetization. My focus was on providing value and now I see the audience visiting my blog more regularly. This feels good. My blog started earning as early as February and now finally soon I'm switching to an advance Ad network that allows even greater monetization. All these months, I've worked harder than I could have imagined. And hardwork always pays I guess. I'm sharing this post to let you know that anyone who is consistent with blogging will surely have people visiting their blogs. So please stay regular on your blog and write with all your heart. Prioritize good content and the right niche above anything else. Lastly, take guidance from people who actually will help you transform in your professional journey and not 'gyaan fekus.' Trust me, you will surely see a spike in traffic and monetization both like I'm seeing now.      Be part of my Frugal Beat community and learn amazing things about saving money and earning money that adds value to your life :) ",

I made about $100 my first week working about an hour a day. Instant Rewards Network works as a middleman for some fortune 500 companies. The network promotes products for companies like Netflix, Walmart and a lot of other well know brands. They also have a referral program which you can join to help promote their offers. You make money by signing up for the program and referring people to the site to try offers from companies in the network. You get paid each time someone you refer tries an offer. A lot of the offers are free to try but some of them cost money. You can also make money by trying out offers yourself. You can make between $20 to $120 per referral depending on the product you choose to promote. They provide you with training, a lead capture page and a back office with all the marketing materials you need to successfully promote the opportunity. The more people you refer to try out offers the more money you make. You can easily make between $60 to $120 per day just by referring only one person per day. You can learn more about the program by visiting their site at Instant Rewards and watch a short video that explains how the opportunity works. ",

            "answer_text": "The beauty of the internet is you can build a business from your laptop while sitting at home. Sure you can make a few bucks by working for an internet company but why not put that little bit more effort in and build something sustainable. On the Empire Flippers marketplace it common to see websites making anywhere from a few hundred dollars a month up to five figures a month net profit. Think about that. Having a business like that also becomes a sellable asset. To do this you create a website and create high-quality content that people want to read. Learning how to do keyword research and SEO will give you lifelong skills that give you the ability to create content that makes you money. This is because learning about these things will show you how to create content that people are already searching for in Google. The best part of this is you can monetize your website. It\u2019s free to sign up to Google Adsense. They will place adverts on your website and you will then get paid depending on how well the advertisers do. To increase your revenue even further you can place affiliate links in the articles you create. These links will earn you money every time someone clicks one and purchases whatever product you are recommending. Amazon has its own affiliate program called Amazon Associates. This is really easy to sign up to. Having these two income streams on a website you\u2019ve created is a great way to make money online. ",

They could have their freedom to travel around the world, spend time with their family and seeing thousands of dollars floating towards your bank account. Affiliate marketing its part of my source of income. I partner with brands and business within the content of my social media and website. All i have to do is mention a product or service and link to that produce or service. From there, I could generate $1000 of one day for simply promoting a product or service. Day Trading its also my another source of income I received every day. I either make my money fast or lose my money quick. The only way it wont not be a \u201crisk\u201d for me to lose money if i take \u201cTIME\u201d to do my research of the company i want to invest on. All those things I do to make money online it made me comfortable in life. Im in my mid-20s so if i can do it, anybody can do it.

            "answer_text": "You can own your own website (like a blogging or informative or something centered around a skill you use, like your singing or if you happen to play an instrument). Get people to visit it and all that, and if you own the domain, you can put google ads on it, and receive money for that. Also, look at freelance writing. You can make good money just by doing reviews, although I don't really see that as honest work (unless you actually know about the item you are reviewing).  There's also investing, but that's a tricky risky business depending on how you go about it. Really, you have to put in some money before you can get anything out, and the more you put in, the more you risk. But there are ways to minimize your risk, and if you are home all day (as in, you want to make earning money on the internet a career), than you can afford all the time it'll take to watch your stocks like a hawk, which is what you have to do.  Also, look at fiver. If you think you have a cool voice, or even if you don't, you can invest in a cheap microphone and do voice-overs, or write reviews, or pretty much anything. On there, people pay for \"gigs\", you earn four dollars per gig, and you can pretty much market any skill. It's great. You just have to come up with something you're willing to do for five bucks.  There's also youtube vids. If you can make youtube videos that are completely al your own original work, you can monetize them, and get, around $4 per 1,000 views for having a little ad in the beginning. This might not seem like a lot, but like Fiverr, it racks up over time. ",

            "answer_text": "Five ways to earn extra money via the internet You want to buy something special, your family is expanding or the Christmas season is approaching. Everyone has a moment in their life when they need extra money. And believe it or not, it is possible to supplement your income, or even earn a modest income! In this article, we show you five ways to make money over the internet. More and more people have a smartphone or tablet and can access the internet at home and on the go. That offers them even more opportunities to make money at times that suit them. Obviously, people are scared of scammers who promise to make money fast, but here are a few tried and tested ways to make money legally without leaving your comfortable seat. 1. Discover cashback websites It almost seems too good to be true, but there are heaps of safe cashback websites that make money by just clicking through their website to the website where you normally make your online purchases. It's that simple. It takes a while to build up your reward, but it is an easy way to make money. All you need to do is click through a few times when shopping online. 2. Start a blog This may not be a guaranteed success, but starting a blog yourself and sharing your ideas can attract followers, which can lead to advertising, sponsorships and free samples coming to you. Free blogging websites like WordPress are a good place to start and reach an international audience. So if you have writing ambitions, this is an excellent opportunity to show your talent. Maybe you will find your audience and this means the start of a new career! 3. Go undercover Customer service is a spearhead for most companies. Both small and large companies like to use secret shoppers who pay them to visit their store. It's irregular work and sometimes you don't get paid in cash, but in receipts, but if you want to feel like a bit of a detective, this is a fun thing to do in your spare time. Check on the Internet with your favorite brands if they are looking for people. In addition to shopping, you can also write paid reviews about a store or service. Look for companies where you can register for free and that offer their customers these kinds of services. 4. Sell your things Have you ever wondered what to do with that old lamp in the attic or with that stamp collection you don't do anything with? Sell them online and earn some extra money! There is a huge range of auction sites out there that will keep you from estimating your stuff before selling it. Take some good photos, add as much information as possible and wait for the buyers to present themselves. Do you think you have nothing of value to sell? What about old jewelry, clothes, baby things and bicycles? It can all be rented or sold online. What is messy for one is a treasure for another.

Just email me at w.chindawi16@ gmail.com Different ways to make money in 2020 from home is Theme Design All sites and blogs need a \"theme\" (or template) that defines their appearance.This is why, if you have a good design sense and other required skills, you can become a theme designer as well. Once the theme is ready, you can sell it on dedicated theme sites or create your own site where people will buy them. Creating themes for platforms like WordPress, Blogger, Joomla, Drupal and others is a very profitable business from scratch . Online lesons You can share your knowledge and give lessons online. You can be a teacher on the web . And the good news is that you can teach almost anything. Therefore, regardless of your skills and experience, you will be able to offer your lessons to interested students. SkillsShare is one of the services that you can use to be an online teacher. After registering, you will be able to create courses (classes) on any topic: cooking, mathematics, engineering, design, languages, whatever!There is another similar service - Udemy . On these sites, you essentially sell your courses and make money from online lessons. Sell your old( and new) itemsFor example, if you have an old, big, useless phone in your drawer, you can sell it on OLX or Cragilist (Cragilist is a great option for people living abroad).Therefore, old and unnecessary things, such as CDs, books, clothes, stationery, toys, can be very easily converted into money. Do internet research If you enjoy surfing the Internet and reading different sites, then why not use this talent more purposefully and do research for others? There are many different organizations that need research on almost any topic. They hire people to monitor certain topics on the Internet and provide the information they need.For this job, you don't really need to be a writer, you just have a keen eye for the information you need and be able to logically present it. Just find what you're asked, format it according to the format you want, and email the organization. They will pay you well. And you get even more if you can get hold of information that is usually difficult to find on the Internet. ",

            "answer_text": "With some time invested you can make a good bit working online. I know this is probably the answer everyone gives you but dropshipping can be very lucrative. The thing is you are going to need a bit of cash to do it effectively. In my opinion one of the easiest way to try dropshipping is by using ipage and shopcart. Ipage will run you about 35.88 starting off but you will have to upgrade for sure. It features a very easy drag and drop site developer and different base themes you can use to customize your online store. Once you make the store youll need to upgrade to the shopcart business account. The product limit is 15 for the base account and 25 for the pro which isn't a lot of inventory at all. The business account is unlimited and feature a ton of other benefits. Now the reason I recommended this is because by using ipage and shopcart you can link directly to Doba. Doba is a huge dropshipping site that wholesalers us to connect their product to dropshippers. Using shopcart you can pull entire product listings and put them on directly in your store. Doba has over 2,000,000 products on the site and detailed reviews of each wholesaler by other dropshippers. This helps you make sure that you won't have to deal with too many pissed off customers. Their are tons of other way to make money online, this is just one example. It take as little investment/time to get set up. If do it right though you will have a pretty good paycheck. ",

So, if you are looking to start making more money or if you want a new career path that lets you earn money from home, this list is especially for you.

This round-up includes everything from selling on Amazon, teaching English, becoming a cooking instructor, flipping items for profits, and more! My hope is that these stories will spark your interest, and they may even inspire you to learn how to earn money from home. I'm always looking to add to the list of different ways to earn money online and different ways to work from home, so if you know of anything else, please leave a comment or send me an email.

Online Fantasy sports has created a revolution in the gaming market. They have evolved over the last few years. One of the main reason is the attraction for money that lures million people to online portals. Gamers who can perform better and prove their skills are the ones to take cash prizes to their bank accounts. There are numerous promotions and offers that give players additional value while they are playing. Regular text messages and email updates keep players informed of new competition. No need to wait for your buddies anymore, simply log in and play with others from around the country and derive great relaxation. I have been a huge fan of fantasy games. One of the reason is I love to control my team. I mean since childhood I had always thought of you know having awestruck players like Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle in my team. And fantasy games give me that power. Also, it rewards me with lots of prizes and offers. I have been playing at 11Wickets since six months and not yet got bored. I have had a hassle free experience. It\u2019s a very low competitive platform so chances for everyone get high. They have free daily leagues so no need to invest any money. Also, you can create your own league and you get 100% Profit from it. ",

Surely there will be some thing which motivates you, something which if you do, you don't feel tired. Find that, and then be the best anyone has seen in that. Sure, it will be hardwork, no one said it will be easy to earn money.

The basic process is buying or creating a template, changing the graphics, and selling the app. With just $150 you can get a pretty decent start re-skinning apps. $99 is for the Apple Developer Membership and the rest can be to purchase your first template. I love re-skinning because its pretty fast and in my opinion a bit more fun than stuff like affiliate marketing. You can expect to earn between $100 and $300 per hour of work once you get going. Sometimes I\u2019ve even earned $2,000 from 1 hour of work. Last year I actually made $15,000 just working an hour per week. If you\u2019re interested in learning how to re-skin apps, I would first check out Chupamobile to look at some templates. Then I would look into getting an Apple Developer Membership. Finally, check out the site Flippa because this is where you will be selling your apps! Check out my YouTube Channel if you\u2019re interested in learning more about re-skinning apps! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I work from home doing what I love (answering questions and Social Media Marketing) and I learnt pretty much everything I know online through courses and talking to other people. I work when I want, where I want (I\u2019ve actually been known to write blog posts whilst sat at the cliffs\u2026). Nowadays, there are THOUSANDS of free and paid courses online available at Alison, Udemy and even just learning off Youtube. Consider learning a skill and setting up your own business - it\u2019s a slow process but can benefit you in the long run. If you are a good writer or designer, consider using platforms like Squadhelp, Upwork, Freelancer and PeoplePerHour - more and more businesses are outsourcing and it can be really great to work from home in your spare time and earn an extra income. Build relationships with people in the industry you want to work with and build a good rapport. This doesn\u2019t always have instant results, but it is 100% worth spending the time to do it. Work on your strengths, not your weaknesses! ",

There are all sorts of scams out there supposedly teaching you how to make money from the internet.-but you have to pay for the info first. Don't believe it. Don\u2019t fall for the scams. Here are just some quick free ways to earn money from the Internet. Method #1: you can freelance This is self-explanatory. There many freelance platforms out there like Fiverr. Avoid freelance platforms that charge you money Method #2: you can do arbitrage Arbitrage is a fancy way of saying that you buy stuff low and you sell at high at a high price. You can go to many different forums that are offering services and you can advertise those exact same services with the profit margin at places that don't have those services on offer. In the beginning, avoid forums that charge you money for placing ads. The key here is to earn money through the Net without having to spend money . But as you start making money from your arbitrage activities feel free to buy advertising or buy ad placements at online forums. Method #3 write your own books Write short books on stuff that you know. Make sure that they are profitable topics so anything involved in finance, legal issues, or anything other or any other traditionally higher paying niche. Upload the books to free document upload sites. How do you make money off this? Place affiliate links in the books. ",

As an affiliate, your job is to find prospects and clients (or to sales) online for other companies and products. Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest and most affordable businesses to run. In order to start, you don\u2019t need to have your own products, customer service or any other trouble that comes with other business like eCommerce. More importantly, it can be automated, meaning that you can simply set it up and forget about it. Take a vacation and earn money while you sleep because your entire business is automated! ",
