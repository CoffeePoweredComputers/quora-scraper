            "answer_text": "This is an excellent question, I believe a sentence that was told by my teacher, Mrs. Rohini. \u201cQuality questions leads to quality answers, there by nurturing the innovation and creativity\u201d. Yes, schools can teach students to innovate and think creatively. this is not a conundrum, innovation and creativity are not skills, they are concepts, that means creativity and innovation can be developed, through constant teaching and training process. It is not the schools that nurture the innovation and creativity, on an average, in a school of 30 teachers, there would be only 1 or 2 teachers, who are truly creative and innovative. Hence to encourage the creativity and innovation, teachers are to be encouraged and motivated. Imagine a model school in which there is no syllabus, except innovating and application of creative thoughts. There are few schools which follow this culture, more of innovative training and less of traditional conceptual training. Thank You! ",

            "answer_text": "There are other practical issues beyond this but here\u2019s a fundamental trade off: In order to have mass produced Standardized tests, you need to focus on questions trivial enough that they can be graded by machine. Thus, if you want to make sure - that is hold teachers and schools to accountability - our students learn as much as possible - quantity of knowledge - you focus their education around trivial, superficial knowledge. If instead you want creativity, have them create. How will you - the education czar - know if they are creating things you think are good enough? You won\u2019t. It will be up to teachers to decide what is best for their students. For the record I think a middle ground is best, but the way schools are incentivized you chase higher test scores, it tends to swallow up all the class time. ",
