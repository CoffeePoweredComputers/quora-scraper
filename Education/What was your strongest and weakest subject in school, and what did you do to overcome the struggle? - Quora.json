            "answer_text": "First of all, if my tenth grade biology teacher is still alive, I would like to apologize for the following. I barely passed tenth grade biology with a \u201cD\u201d, which was probably a gift. Just to mess with the teacher, I signed up to be his classroom assistant in 11th grade. Turned out, I liked that type of work and I could see things through his eyes. The stoned young man on parole, who was required to attend class, came and put his head down on the table and raised his head and left when the bell rang, the majority who didn\u2019t give a rip, etc. My great sin was stealing one of the fetal pigs from the lab and tying it to the back fender of a police car as they were checking the school parking lot for marijuana smokers. I have great respect for police officers and buy them coffee or pay for their meals when I see them in restaurants, it was a stupid teenage prank. After high school, I worked in a laboratory and they offered me a research position if I would get a biology degree. I told them that I hated science and was going to pursue a career in teaching. The teaching classes were boring and useless and I ended up getting my degree in Environmental Studies which I used to challenge timber sales on the national forest and cause general trouble. ",
