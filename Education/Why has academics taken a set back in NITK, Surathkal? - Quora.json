            "answer_text": "NITs are a strange set of institutions. They are neither upto the standard of IITs and they do not agree that they are like other institutions. The reason is that these NITs have been given the tag \u2018Institutions of National Importance\u2019 and that is the catch. MHRD has been too liberal in sanctioning faculty positions much in excess of what is required and the teaching work load of these faculty is less than 10 h per week on an average. The faculty on the other hand imagine that they are not required to teach the undergraduates and off load their teaching assignments to the research students or even M.Tech students. Unfortunately, the faculty have not been able to do well in their research activity also going by the number and quality of publications. The other factors that count to improve their ranking are also not easily taken care of by the NITs. As a result, the main activity of teaching-learning process suffers. With the kind of academic freedom they have, they are able to manipulate the success rate of UG output and continue to survive. Drastic measures are needed from MHRD and UGC to look into and evaluate these institutions realistically and address the issues firmly if we have to expect any improvement in the quality of engineering education.
