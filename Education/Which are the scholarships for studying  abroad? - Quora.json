            "answer_text": "Hey there! When we talk about scholarships to study abroad we need to keep a lot of things in mind, however, the following are the things to keep an eye for: Scholarships are of two kinds: Merit-based ScholarshipsNeed-Based ScholarshipsThere aren\u2019t any specific tests that one needs to appear for scholarships. All merit-based scholarships are available for the students based on their application. Some of them can have separate essays depending on colleges. Most of the universities assess the applicants and share the scholarships along with the offer letters. Need-based scholarships have separate applications. They are mostly provided by external organizations based on your essays and admits. Similar to the college applications, these scholarships follow a process where you must create an application along with your documents including your acceptance letter from the university. They also have separate essay questions that one must answer. Having said that, the questions are quite similar to the college application questions that the students have written in the past. To get scholarships, a profile must be holistically developed. Thus, an ideal profile must be a combination of strong academia, good work experience, active participation in extracurricular activities, some volunteer work, to name a few. Additionally, you can also pursue multiple online courses that showcase your skills that have developed over a period of time If you need any help with how to apply to scholarships and identify the best ones for your courses, then please reach out to Leverage Edu.
