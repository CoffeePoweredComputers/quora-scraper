            "answer_text": "The question is not whether they believe in education or don\u2019t believe in education. That is the wrong question. The correct question is how do views differ on who should receive an education, and what type of education is appropriate. Examples: Back before slavery was outlawed, in some places educating a slave was against the law. At one time people only thought men should be educated & not women. At one time families didn\u2019t think every child needed an education \u2026 most typically in rural or farming communities. Significant differences still exist today in what form of education is considered appropriate, which is the reason communities have private schools \u2026 some for gifted, some for inclusion of religious content, and some just because they don\u2019t like what the public schools teach, or they don\u2019t like the public schools hands-off attitude towards discipline [notably bullying], or any other reason.

            "answer_text": "There are some who are rather paranoid about indoctrination vs education. They believe that some great conspiracy is trying to brainwash children or even college students and so they oppose education unless it is they themselves who are doing the educating. There is no doubt that education can indoctrinate. But too often the problem is not a conspiracy trying to turn our children into communists or liberals or (whatever other thing people fear) but, rather, people fearing that their children will learn something that causes them to disagree with the beliefs of their parents. It is often the lack of education that indoctrinates. Sooner or later we have to trust educators to be trying to educate and students to be trying to learn. If we encourage our children to be open minded and to think critically we can overcome the problems of poor education and lack of education. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really, no. Although most people do believe that there are more important things like character, boldness, and \u201ccommon-sense\u201d (your ability to make decisions). But I\u2019ve never met anyone (other than religious nut-jobs) who would say that there\u2019s anything inherently wrong with education. We just don\u2019t consider it the most important thing. For example, many parents don\u2019t believe the primary purpose of school (K through 12) is education. They believe the primary purpose is to socialize their kids amongst their peers. I don\u2019t know that I agree agree with that, but a lot of Americans do hold that view. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know of anyone who thinks all formal education is bad or pointless. At some point, everyone decides that further education is not worth the time, cost, and opportunity cost. You\u2019d rather go out and get a job instead of more education. For some people, that\u2019s in your teens. For others it\u2019s at 18, after finishing (in the US) K-12 primary education. Some stop at 22 with a bachelor\u2019s degree. Others continue to a masters or PhD. Side note, I think in the US, just over a third of all people complete a 4-year college degree. The rest either aren\u2019t interested or would rather have wages now, not four years from now. ",
