            "answer_text": "In my childhood, there was no online programming course that teaches coding in simple and effective style. But Whitehat jr has now made it possible for today\u2019s kid. Karan Bajaj, CEO of Whitehat jr, has taken a lead by launching a platform where kids can develop a logical and creative mind along with coding. The start-up was launched in November, 2018 with a seed funding of $1.3 million from Nexus Venture Partner and Omidyar Networks. Tell me tell you my story: I am a computer science graduate and I create website applications and games for the company I am working for. It involves lots of programming(coding). My cousin used to see me typing different alphabets and symbols from my keyboard. He used to sit beside me and watch me do coding for hours. It was always been a fascinating sight for him to see me write the code and run it. However, he stayed confused as well as shock to see how the lines of meaningless words with lots of white spaces seems to turn into amazing apps, video games, interactive websites. One day he asked me to teach him how to write so many lines to create video games on computer. He wanted to play those with his school friends. He still didn\u2019t have any knowledge about what those so many lines actually are! However, I went completely blank on what to answer him. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to teach him(I would be the most happiest to see my little champ doing coding at 10) but I had no idea on how to proceed with this little kid. But at the same time, I didn\u2019t want to crush his dreams. Therefore, I just said him, \u201cI am quite busy, will tell you tomorrow.\u201d It was the best I could thought of at that moment. He smiled, gave me a hug saying thank you. He went outside to play with his friends. I did a thorough search that night to figure out some source where my little cousin can learn and grow. After hours of videos and reading, I choose Whitehat jr. I was still not very confident whether I should go with it or not but how will you know until and unless you give it a shot. Therefore, I decided to take the trial session for my cousin. And to my utmost happiness, the results were fruitful. Whitehat jr teachers not only made him understand about those meaningless lines and syntax but he has began scoring well in his academic too. After few months of learning and coding, he actually built a video game app. My sister always thanked me for this. She considered it the best gift I have ever given to her son. I am also thankful to Whitehat jr for making it possible! I can say that it is best programming course for kids. ",
