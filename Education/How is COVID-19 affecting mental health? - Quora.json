            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. Idk how others\u2019 mental health has been affected because of COVID, but I can tell you personally how it is affecting me. The main thing for me is stress; lots of stress, on top of the stress I already deal with on a daily basis. Ironically, I am not very stressed about getting COVID \u2026 I do everything I can to keep myself healthy, wear the masks, constantly wash my hands, etc, so if I ever get COVID, I know I did everything possible to prevent it. I am also not stressed about staying inside a lot more \u2026 that is something I have done before, and it never bothered me. When I was not doing well with the agoraphobia, I was inside of my apartment 6 out of 7 days every week, for a few years, before finally getting out more. So I have no issues with that. What really causes the most amount of stress for me, and while this might sound trivial to some people in the realm of how much COVID has affected everyone\u2019s (or almost everyone\u2019s) mental health, the tele-health appts with my therapist (2x/week) have really affected me. While I 100% understand why we are having tele-health appts, and that she has no control over when the offices will be opening up (they are still closed indefinitely), the tele-health appts are getting to me. And while I am thankful for them, because they are better than nothing, they have still added so much extra stress in my life. They didn\u2019t stress me out in the beginning, but as months have passed, they have started to. Compared to when we met in her office, I don\u2019t feel like I am getting as much out of it (in terms of therapy work) as I was back then. I am getting something out of the appts over tele-health, but it isn\u2019t anything like it was when the appts were in her office. I tend to say less than I did in the office, over tele-health; I don\u2019t want to say as much because the walls are \u201cthin\u201d here, and others can most likely hear if they are around. Sometimes the appts go really well, but that doesn\u2019t happen often enough. Also, with the tele-health appts being from our homes, there are distractions, mainly on her end. On my end the only distraction is the phone ringing, and I only answer it if I am waiting for a call (which I tell her at the beginning of the appt as a head\u2019s up). Otherwise I don\u2019t answer it; if it rings, I mute the ringer, or, it is already in another room. On her end, the main distraction is her puppy, who usually needs some sort of attention during my appts. By attention I mean being petted, barking at another dog or person he sees outside the door, etc, where she has to get up to calm him down or redirect his attention \u2026 something that takes her attention off of the appt. When the dog is barking (for whatever reason), and after she calms him down, she is back talking with me \u2026 but by then she sometimes has lost her train of thought, so the conversation we had been in the middle of is pretty much over. (I lose my train of thought very easily, especially when I am distracted \u2026 and in general, I don\u2019t have very good recall unless I am prompted/reminded what we were talking about). One time she put her dog in another room and closed the door to the room she was in, because he was barking so much \u2026 however, after doing this, he just kept barking and barking until she opened the door again, letting him back in the room, because the barking itself became too distracting. Since then, the dog comes and goes as he pleases, but usually stays in the same room as her. Since her dog has gotten older, his bark is now very loud. When he barks non-stop during any of my appts, I asked her to please stop the dog from barking because I can\u2019t hear anything she is saying, and I can\u2019t talk over it. One time I was getting very frustrated by it (not only because it was happening, but also because the barking happens a lot), and she said, \u201cMelissa, he\u2019s going to bark.\u201d What am I supposed to say to that? And this happens at many tele-health appts. The dog is always there and needs some sort of attending to, which interrupts my appt. Rarely does he not need attention in some way. If he causes a lot of time for her being away from the computer during my appt, she will add on some extra time to the appt. But that does not stop the barking. Anyway, I think you get my point. So it stresses me out to have the tele-health appts with my therapist. I know I can choose to not have the tele-health appts, but on the other hand, they are still my appts, so I shouldn\u2019t have to choose anything in the first place. I can\u2019t choose to not have therapy. For me, it doesn\u2019t work like that. Without therapy I would be much worse off, so I stick with it, despite distractions, because it is better than nothing. I have voiced to her about the barking and it being distracting, and that I hate the tele-health appts in general (when she has asked me how I like them), so she knows. She has told me that she really likes the tele-health appts because they are, to her, more personal (or a word similar to that). The whole thing also is anxiety-provoking for me. So to answer your question, how is COVID affecting mental health, for me personally, COVID is affecting my mental health because of the tele-health appts with my therapist. They have added more stress to my life, for reasons given within this answer. However, I am not giving up. Like I was saying, this may seem trivial to some people, but when you need therapy for mental illness reasons (2x/week), and the appts become a problem, it causes a lot of added stress, with the pandemic still going on.

            "answer_text": " This is an excellent question. Most of them are facing mental health issues during this pandemic.  Fear,stress are normal when we are faced to with uncertainty or unknown. So it is understandable that people are experiencing fear during this covid pandemic.  Countries all over the world are taking the strict measures,to slow down the spread of the virus and to prevent transmission of the disease government has put lockdown,this lead to restriction of physical movement. And this restriction may ranges from no gathering in public places to stepping out of the house except for daily essentials.  Same like a coin has two sides; this also has two sides.  Talking about Postive side ; we are spending quality time with our family and having good communications with them during this lockdown,and of negative side constant viewing of the walls around us and being in the same place for a quite long time made people feel like they are living in a cage.  These Public health actions taken by government, such as social distancing, can make people feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety.  And also people are facing issues such as changes in daily lives, few losing job leading to financial crisis or fear of getting corona or already having it or they were being ostracised by their families and neighbours for having COVID-19 when they didn\u2019t have it, all of which affected the mental well-being of many.  Stress! Everyone reacts differently to stressful conditions. It depends on your background, your social support from family or friends, your financial situation, your health and emotional background, the community you live in, and many other factors.Mostly the vulnerable population are under going through stress more.  And it cause the following:  \u25aaFear and worry about your own health and health of your loved ones. \u25aaChanges in sleep or eating patterns. \u25aaWorsening of chronic health problems. \u25aaIncreased use of tobacco,alcohol and other substances. \u25aaWorsening of mental health conditions.  And we have also seen that there is spike in suicidal rates during this pandemic.  Dr Soumitra Pathare, a consultant psychiatrist and Director of Centre for Mental Health, Law and Policy at ILS said that \u201cMore than half of the people who die of suicide in our country don\u2019t have a diagnosable mental illness.\u201d  Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress and economic difficulties lack of food may lead to the development or exacerbation of stress-related disorders and suicidality.  \u25aaWe just never know what a person is going through...all u can do is be kind...show some empathy towards others....it costs nothing. Give moral support, talk with them, don't judge them or make fun of them over their imperfections or fears. \u25aaDo not shun or judge people with a CoVid infection.Remember they need  care and concern. Tell them about  precautions, measures they have to take and how to get medical assistance, if required. \u25aaSharing is caring. Understand if someone around you needs advice, food or other essentials. Be willing to share.   \"Minding your mind \" is important   \u25aaConnect with your friends,family and colleagues. \u25aa Disconnect from fake news. \u25aa Exercise regularly, Eat & drink well, Sleep well.  \u25aaPractice meditation,pranayamas. \u25aa Enjoy yourself.   Be good. Be happy. & Believe in yourself.  And remember, This too, shall pass.

            "answer_text": "Covid-19 is quite frankly, terrible for mental health. Especially if you are an introvert. Lockdown becomes an excuse to stay inside, to avoid others, and to isolate yourself at home, indulging in all the guilty pleasures. The problem is, humans are social creatures. We as a species are meant to be banded together in groups, living, laughing, loving, together. When this fundamental aspect of human social structure is stripped and derailed, humans suffer. We suffer immensely. Take prison punishment as an example. Solitary confinement is one of the worst, maximum-security containments there are to prison inmates. Why is that? It strips people of their ability to socialize. The intent of solitary confinement, of course, is to preclude the inmate from being a threat to other people, but the collateral damage is clear and deep. Let\u2019s take this back to introversion. Socializing in high human density areas drains the energy from introverts. They prefer alone time and like to relax by themselves. That does not mean they thrive from a lack of human interaction. As humans, we interact with each other in many different ways, most of the time mundane ways, such as asking that grocery store employee where the Brussel sprouts are, or exchanging niceties with the garbage man. Introverts, although they may avoid explicitly indulging in social activities, still obtain these small social interactions throughout the day. But not with Covid-19 lockdown. Lockdown takes everything away, almost like solitary confinement. And the introverts, although they may not realize it at first, are also losing even these mundane opportunities to interact with people. This becomes a big problem as time passes. Depression, anxiety, loneliness, and sadness can set in. But how to fix this? A positive mindset. Optimism. Trying new things and being thankful and showing appreciation for the little things. Convincing yourself that you are happy and that you get what you want can go a long way. Behold the might of psychology. Just know that the worst of life will pass, and that pain exists for the sole purpose of making the light on the other side brighter, sweeter to behold when the suffering passes. Stay safe. ",

            "answer_text": "Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19 is a disease which originated in China in 2019. Owing to it\u2019s huge widespread and enormous loss of life that was caused by this disease, it has been declared a pandemic. Countries all over the world are taking strict measures and are employing strict guidelines to prevent the spread of this infection. These restrictions may range from banning public gatherings to more stringent measures such as a lockdown, which means that nobody can leave their houses, except for essentials. COVID-19 has affected the mental health of all individuals, irrespective of their financial conditions and age. There is an increased level of anxiety, stress and helplessness in most individuals which is caused by the lack of knowledge about when this pandemic will end and when life will return to normal. The new normal of \u2018work from home\u2019 for most working professionals has created an immense amount of frustration, anger and distress as they are unable to match their pre-lockdown productivity levels, create a routine and maintain a healthy work life balance. At the same time, children and adolescents are confused and unsure of how to handle this time. They are worried and concerned of the widespread damage around them and some of them are unable to process this. Parents are flustered and unsure of how they can manage their work load along with their families. Isolation is leading to excessive feelings of loneliness and sadness, amongst the young and old, alike. The elderly, who have been hit extremely hard by the pandemic, are unable to cope up with the technology dependent world and are constantly looking for alternative resources to help them with their concerns. Social distancing has made it harder for them to interact with other individuals and this thus leads to feelings of isolation, loneliness and sadness. Alot of mental health organizations are working round-the-clock to provide mental health support to anyone who needs it during these difficult and unprecedented times. ",

I work with accountants and most of them feel overwhelmed, anxious, frustrated, fearful and most of all, helpless. Business is on hold, and they\u2019re caught in a knock-on effect because the cashflow has stopped. In human beings, the primitive instinct to counter a crisis is by going into our survival mode. In other words, as animals of evolution, we like to take action by ensuring the protection of ourselves and our loved ones.  But COVID-19 is devastating because it leaves us to do nothing. We\u2019re required to isolate ourselves, sit still in our homes while our finances crumple. Our lack of control is causing us anxiety, sleepless nights and damaging or mental health day by day. The thing is in our in our civilized worlds, the virus isn\u2019t our only enemy. Our survival is also threatened by the disruption in our finances and everyday functioning of business. Even if we end up protecting our bodies and health by remaining in isolation indoors, we\u2019re failing to protect other crucial factors of livelihood \u2013 like business and travel for essential purposes. To counter helplessness, we end up overworking, making poor rash decisions and leading to disheartening outcomes. We fall into vicious cycles of exhausting ourselves, further weakening our mental well-being. There\u2019s a useful podcast back me up on this too: COVID-19 Special: Podcast on Mental Health in Accountants with Karen Reyburn and Rachel Thomas Sadly, we don\u2019t pay attention to any of it and try to work through it. I think if we want to get through this we need to start practicing self-care. Protecting yourself from a mental health illness is just as important as protecting yourself from the virus. ",

Keeping the cliched jokes aside,this very situation around us consciously affects our physical state and subconsciously affects our mental state. The constant sight of the very same walls around us and the people builds two different psychologies.Speaking of the positive side,the frequency of communication and transparency in a family has increased and on the other side of the coin,\u201dtoo many vessels result in more noise\u201d. In such situations,the only bread earners would also be going through financial shortcomings along with a shift in their mental state.The students, who are far away in cities need both financial and emotional support. The vulnerables in society I.e the senior citizens, also are praying for a helping hand by their side and at most places their prayers are being answered . It is more likely that people are affected by the fact of fear that they\u2019ll catch up the virus than actually catching it http://up.So the number of psychologists are equivalent to the doctors. This virus will obviously change the psychologies of billions out there in the world,let\u2019s hope they change to more positive ones rather than to the non favourable. ",

As of July 2020, many states are requiring that masks be worn in public to prevent the transmission of the virus. This is a serious problem for those with anxiety. Masks can cause panic attacks, increased anxiety and depression in some people. Just wearing the mask makes them anxious. Some cannot return to work because they cannot wear a mask. Anyone that suffers from excessive worry now has a new threat to be concerned with. The increase in this affects all of their day to day activities. It\u2019s difficult to concentrate when you are constantly worried. Quarantine did a number on most people. Loneliness, depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts are on the rise due to having to distance themselves from friends and family. Those who live alone and are used to social interaction daily are really struggling. People need touch. It\u2019s an important part of a healthy mental state. Increased need for mental health treatment has caused a several issues as many offices were closed for month or months and the physicians need to create a new way of seeing their patients. This leads to longer wait times and decreased confidence in their treatment and treatment providers. On top of all of that, financial concerns aggravate an already fragile state of mental health. Those are just some of the ways that this virus has destroyed many lives. If you are struggling and you can\u2019t get in to see a therapist or doctor, try an online workshop to help stabilize your mental health and get through the upcoming months. I\u2019ve used these: Grounding Groups - MyWellbeing with success. Good luck! We\u2019re all in this together!!! ",

            "answer_text": "COVID-19 has made us more stressed, anxious, uncertain, and lonely than ever. Here are some practical ways to deal with the physiological stress reaction while in quarantine, or really, anytime. What can I do to combat stress? 1. Breathe in for 5, out for 5. Our average breathing pace is 12-16 breaths per minute, or ~4 seconds each. That\u2019s only 2 seconds in, 2 seconds out. When you\u2019re stressed, you may notice it speeding up even more. Slow it down and try to do it from your belly (technically, your diaphragm), not your chest. Deep, abdominal breathing activates neurons that detect blood pressure. These neurons signal to the vagus nerve, the \u201cbrakes\u201d on the stress car, that blood pressure is becoming too high, and the vagus nerve, in turn, responds by lowering your heart rate and blood pressure. 2. Do some push-ups, sit-ups, or pop in a YouTube workout video. Put that excess adrenaline to good use! Think of it as \u201crunning\u201d from your perceived danger. 3. Laugh. Studies show that laughter reduces stress and increases immune function. Instead of scrolling through feeds on Covid-19, watch standup comedy. In a study of cancer patients, the improvement from humor was even more pronounced than from other coping mechanisms such as distraction. 4. Affirm your values. Studies have shown that those who reflect on their values experience less stress and show a substantial decrease in cortisol compared to control groups. Do you know your top values? We cover this in the LIFE app under Mission 3, so I won\u2019t go into it in detail here, but highly recommend. Understanding your values is crucial not just for stress management but also for motivation, goal-setting, and decision-making. So, get grounded and more productive while in quarantine by thinking about yours. 5. Write three things you\u2019re grateful for. While it sounds cheesy, clinical trials have shown that gratitude can have dramatic and lasting positive effects, from lower blood pressure to improved immune function, to more acts of helpfulness and generosity. People who experience gratitude can cope more effectively with everyday stress, show increased resilience in the face of trauma, recover more quickly from illness, and enjoy more robust physical health. This scientific intervention is as simple as keeping a gratitude journal. 6. Practice progressive muscle relaxation, an exercise that involves clenching certain muscle groups one at a time and then slowly releasing them. People with insomnia often find this is helpful for falling asleep. Here\u2019s a full article on how to practice this and which muscle groups to clench. What can I do to combat anxiety? Anxiety provokes a much greater cardiovascular response than the slightly milder worry. Worry can trigger solutions and strategies, while often, anxiety borders on uncontrollable. Anxious thoughts in your head are hard to calm. Distracting only helps for so long; pesky thoughts sneak in any chance they can get. That\u2019s why, instead of dismissing or avoiding anxious thoughts, do something even tougher: train them. 1. Practice Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Pioneered in the 1960s, CBT has become the most widely researched form of therapy. The best part is, it's so easy you can do it yourself in five minutes. The cognitive model says that the \"reality\" we experience is just our interpretation of events, or our immediate thoughts about them. Change your thoughts, change your feelings, and change your behavior. For example, thinking \u201cI can\u2019t do anything right\u201d might create a feeling of hopelessness that leads to behaviors like giving up. On the other hand, thoughts like \u201cI could have done some things differently\u201d might create interest which encourages reflection and growth. 2. Do structured problem-solving. Breaking down a problem and deciding on a course of action can help you break free from useless rumination. Here\u2019s how: Define the problem. What is it you\u2019re really anxious about? Who is involved? List possible solutions. Think of this as one big brainstorm.Choose the idea you think is best and evaluate it. How much time and effort will it require?Write a solution statement.Then, to avoid overwhelm, break that solution statement into much smaller steps. What\u2019s one thing you can do this month? This week? Today? Right now? 3. Grounding exercise. Sometimes, we\u2019re so anxious that we can\u2019t even think through the above. If you are at the point of panic, follow the below exercise. Look around you and find: 5 things you can see4 things you can touch3 things you can hear2 things you can smell1 thing you can tasteLonger-term, here are things you can do daily to ward against anxiety. 4. Buy probiotics and stay hydrated. Serotonin is a chemical that transmits messages between nerve cells. It affects so many aspects of our well-being that it\u2019s commonly called the \u201chappy chemical,\u201d impacting our mood, appetite, and cognitive functioning. It is estimated that 90% of the body's serotonin is made in the digestive tract. From bowel movements to eating, your gut is like a second brain. Take care of it with probiotics and water. 5. Keep your sleep schedule. In quarantine, our schedules may be thrown out of whack. Without our regular morning commutes, we may sleep in, and perhaps stay up later as well. Like stress, sleep disruption has been linked to multitude of short- and long-term health consequences. Short-term, it makes us more susceptible to stress, depression, and anxiety; it impairs cognitive performance and increases risky behaviors. Long-term, sleep disruption can lead to heart disease, weight issues, diabetes, and cancer. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not the Covid- 19 that\u2019s affecting my mental health. It\u2019s the gypsy that\u2019s harassing me that\u2019s Dan, and his astral projection friends that are affecting my mental health, and my third eye being trapped to this house in California, and I\u2019m in Florida. I need the government to get rid of the house. The Virgin Mary\u2019s ghost channel me, and I don\u2019t know how to open, and close the third eye. I didn\u2019t know you had to, or really know much about mystical stuff. I was playing with magic, and I got stuck. That Gypsy Dan knew my clairaudience would open up, and the psycho gypsy has been stalking me since 2013, and now.. trying to \u201c USE\u201d me to upgrade himself, and trying to balance with Sylvia Browne, and has been harming me, and other people by threatening me to be noticed, and famous. He thinks he\u2019s some GOD, and wants everyone to worship him. He\u2019s really arrogant, and nasty. He\u2019s jealous of my brain ( third eye),and my \u201c heart\u201d because he\u2019s a pisces moon,a nd is a nusiance to the industry,and me. He keeps belittling me, and threatening me, and trying to prevent me from being balance with the industry, and insulting me, and telling me to not upgrade myself. Or telling other people to not upgrade me. He\u2019s been lying about me, and lying to the people in the house about me, and some already know he\u2019s lying, and lying about me too. He\u2019s trying to make me commit suicide, and go brain dead. That\u2019s his goal. He\u2019s a psycho path. So.. the people in the house are belitting me, and insulting me everyday, and calling me ugly, and saying how I\u2019m upgraded in the industry, and how arrogant, and mean it\u2019s mind, and heart is. That\u2019s all I listen to. I listen to identity fraud of pretending to be me, and constantly.. putting me down,a nd Screaming at me so I can hear it. This gypsy dan has telepathy, and is reading my mind without my consent,a nd doesn\u2019t like me.. because he\u2019s insulting me, and pretending to be me. He isn\u2019t my gypsy anyways, it\u2019s Joanne. This gypsy Dan came from Nick Wellner who\u2019s my enemy, and is a nusiance. He\u2019s been dumped from the industry, and he got back into the industry, and he\u2019s been dumped again, and he\u2019s yelling, and taking it out on me, and same with the people in the house. They\u2019re telling me how everything reflects \u201c BAD\u201d on me.. when they\u2019ve been the one dumped. So.. Amber is pretending to be me that\u2019s really Angela online. Amber get\u2019s dumped, and say\u2019s Amber is Angela that\u2019s me. How frustrating, and annoying to deal with a narcassistic girl. You dump her, and she throws it on someone else, and say\u2019s it isn\u2019t me. You tell her it\u2019s a no, and she tell\u2019s Angela it\u2019s a no, and it\u2019s not her. She say\u2019s I\u2019m balance with this Sultan of Brunie house, and say\u2019s I\u2019m balance with the industry, and say\u2019s I\u2019m not fat. I\u2019m balance with a tummy tuck, and they\u2019re going to remodel me. She\u2019s ugly, and she say\u2019s it\u2019s Angela that\u2019s her that\u2019s ugly, but yet she\u2019s pretending to be me, and that\u2019s Angela. Pretty manipulative, and cunning I say to pretend to be me.. that\u2019s Angela, and then reverse getting dumped, and throwing it on Angela. You\u2019re calling Angela ugly, fat, and hairy, and how your Girlfriend is a lot prettier then me, and I said many times I\u2019m not trying to upgrade myself, and I\u2019m told to stay away from the industry. So.. that isn\u2019t Angela who\u2019s Amber. If you were Angela that was Amber you would be modest looking, and not asking anyone for anything, and have a foul mean mouth, and is pompous looking. You would first off be some what chubby, and not really over weight that\u2019s fat. The other is Angela isn\u2019t ditsy, she\u2019s mono tone, and smart. The other is Angela is half white, and mixed, and Amber is full blooded white. The other is Amber isn\u2019t psychic, it\u2019s Angela that\u2019s psychic, but she thinks she\u2019s psychic, and she\u2019s been dumped, and told she isn\u2019t. She\u2019s a narcassist that\u2019s Amber, and Angela isn\u2019t a vain person. She\u2019s extremely humble, and has gifts for people in the industry that are victims of her bullying them, and the affect is about me because of Nick Wellner. The other is Amber keeps insulting me, and so how is she Angela? Amber is spiteful, and I\u2019m not. Angela has a scorpio Mars, and is self controlled, and not weak, and acting wacko with malicious intent all over the industry. Amber has a pisces Mars, and a Pisces Venus, and a Capricorn Moon. She keeps using people, and is a gold digger. Angela isn\u2019t asking anyone in the industry to upgrade her, and using people for it\u2019s money. Angela has a Capricorn Venus, but she\u2019s picky with love, and isn\u2019t a slut. Amber is pretending to be me, and trying to upgrade me as a porn star slut, and trying to balance me as some slut with screwing rock stars all over the industry. Well.. for starters I come from a conservative back ground, and I\u2019m not a slut. I have a brain, and isn\u2019t physical looking. I\u2019m drawing, and painting,a nd Amber isn\u2019t. If amber was me.. she would have art work to show people in the industry. The other is the gifts I bought people that are victims of being harassed. If I was inside the house with Amber.. she would have boxe\u2019s and have Jackie\u2019s address because she actually met her, and gave it to me. There\u2019s no gifts or boxes in the house, and so you\u2019re not Angela who\u2019s Amber. It\u2019s I create, and not I use. That\u2019s who\u2019s affecting my mental state of mind because I\u2019m psychic, and I have clairaudience, and I stuck listening to it\u2019s nasty mouth out loud. It isn\u2019t just her, it\u2019s the whole house. The people are morally indecent, and nasty looking. Love, Angela ",

            "answer_text": "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\u201d  As the COVID-19 pandemic rampages on through much of the civilized world, it\u2019s not an overstatement to say that our lives have been turned upside down in the past few months. As a species, we have been collectively forced to retreat to the hills \u2013 to abandon all illusions of control as we are reminded almost daily of the fragility of our existence. A timely reminder, that. Our approach to these life-changing few months has been interesting, to say the least. As a people, our response has see-sawed between the extremes- at times humorously over-cautious, at other times embarrassingly naive and inadequate. As a student of medicine and an avid follower of psychiatry, I have often wondered whether there exists a scientific model to explain the rollercoaster of emotions we have experienced over the past six months. Turns out, there is. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, a Swiss American psychiatrist, published her book On Death and Dying in 1969. Building on the work of earlier bereavement as well her experiences with terminally ill patient, K\u00fcbler-Ross theorized that those experiencing grief go through a series of five emotions: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Commonly referred to using the acronym DABDA, these stages of grief originally described the thought processes that human beings typically go through when confronted by the news of their own impending death, but was later extended to grieving friends as well, who seemed to undergo a similar process.  Though originally postulated to account for terminally ill patients, K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s theory was later extended to include any form of major personal loss- the loss of a loved one, the end of a relationship, loss of employment, and so on. Unsurprisingly, it fits the bill for our current predicament all too well. Denial is where it all began. As the whispers of a new respiratory illness in Wuhan grew to a buzz in January, most of us were unperturbed. Even as the first cases were reported in the Indian subcontinent, we didn\u2019t see cause for alarm. Surely the people in charge would figure it out. They did get the SARS epidemic under control, right? How is this any different? Yet, slowly but surely, the cases keep piling up, and it\u2019s no longer possible to dwell in denial, and we shift gears to anger. Much of it is taken out on unscrupulous NRIs who flunk quarantine measures and endanger others. The teenage son of a bureaucrat is lynched on social media for allegedly evading security measures. We\u2019re angry, and we need someone to crucify.  And as the panic truly sets in, the bargaining takes centre stage. Perhaps the virus won\u2019t be able to withstand the brutal summer heat. Perhaps a Janata Curfew will stop it in its tracks. Everyone, from critical care specialists to snake oil peddlers, has an opinion- and the banter is deafening. The imposition of strict lockdown measures follow, altering life as we know it. Bars and restaurants pull down their shutters, and streets lie deserted. It is life unlike anything we have witnessed before. As the novelty wears off and the new normal sets in with all its weight, it is hard not to be depressed. Death is ubiquitous, the present unpalatable, and the future bleak.  Which brings us to the final stage of our little play \u2013 acceptance. Everything wears off, even fear. Most of us have stopped obsessing over the number of cases. The mounting death toll doesn\u2019t shock us any more. As a medical student, I am resigned to the fact that, despite all the precautions, for most of us, it\u2019s a case of when, not if. From being repulsed by the monster in its infancy, we have graduated to sitting comfortably next to it in all its rage. David Kessler, the eminent psychiatrist, puts it succintly: \u201cThere\u2019s denial, which we saw a lot of early on: This virus won\u2019t affect us. There\u2019s anger: You\u2019re making me stay home and taking away my activities. There\u2019s bargaining: Okay, if I social distance for two weeks everything will be better, right? There\u2019s sadness: I don\u2019t know when this will end. And finally there\u2019s acceptance. This is happening; I have to figure out how to proceed. Acceptance, as you might imagine, is where the power lies. We find control in acceptance. I can wash my hands. I can keep a safe distance. I can learn how to work virtually.\u201d  Stay safe everyone, and have a good week ahead. ",

So the reason is that I left my first job (for some reasons) in the middle of the year after graduation so I have no college, no plans for future. Everyone and everything around me was running so fast and I was sitting at home from 3 months and was constantly thinking that what to do in future and I had just forgot to live in present and that thing started kind of depressing me. But then the whole world comes to lockdown, everyone around me become just like me sitting idle at home. The fast moving world stopped at the same time. Everyone started doing the same things (eating,sleeping etc \ud83d\ude02) without any guilt that I was doing from more than 3 months before the lockdown. Suddenly I become less tensed about my future. I begin to live in present. I started not to feel sorry about how and why I waste my time. Because everyone around me was doing the same thing.  I was fully aware about how this lockdown was going to be unfortunate for our world but still for my mind it gave me a kind of relaxation. From this I just concluded that what happens around yourself create a large impact on your mind. Sometimes our mood changes automatically with change in the environment around us !! It was easy for me to adjust in quarantine because I was already kind of in lockdown before the actual lockdown. \ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\ude1b ",

            "answer_text": "The pandemic has been quite unexpected for all of us. During the Corona-virus pandemic, it has been both a necessity and our responsibility to follow the rules of social distancing. Although, some relaxations have been made of Covid-19 lockdown, the restrictions are still being followed due to the increasing cases in the world. Amongst the major restrictions of the lockdown, not been able to socialise has been a limitation alongside the drastic change of plans for everyone in 2020. This has been a cause of anxiety and stress all around the globe. Many of us are feeling out of place, lack of routine, lazy, and often moody. At times like this, it becomes crucial and the first priority for all of us to take care of our mental health and of each other. Even though there are multiple helplines that are offering mental health help during Covid-19, it is essential to always start from taking care of your mental health at a personal level. Here are some tips on how to take care of your mental health during COVID and otherwise on a regular basis by following some simple techniques: Make a Routine: During lock-down, being at home most of the time makes it difficult to follow and stick to a routine. Until now we had been used to having a work time and then the rest of the time to relax at home. But since that\u2019s out of the window, let\u2019s try to make a routine to stick to by ourselves! Psychological Benefits of Routine: Having a routine reduces the uncertainty and helps manage the levels of stress. It helps reduce anxiety and keeps you motivated to do the daily activities. Once you stick to an everyday routine, you would experience an improved quality of sleep and a regular pattern of sleep that helps you in staying energised for the next day too. When you know the tasks to accomplish in a day, you do finish more tasks than when one does not follow a routine. Read more on my blog.

I go to the grocery store about every 10 days, and it is more crowded now, mostly because the restaurants are closed and people have to eat at home. My main outside activity is going to a park and walking on the trails. Seattle has a lot of good parks, but they are mostly closed now. The parks weren\u2019t crowded before but with schools being closed and other gathering places being shut down, lots of people started going to the parks. There wasn\u2019t any place else to go. The parks went from being mostly empty to having full parking lots. If my wife was still alive, it would be very stressful, she had Parkinson\u2019s dementia and was partially crippled. She watched the news and would have been very upset and worried. She had family in Manila and would have been very upset about the situation in the Philippines. Now it\u2019s just me, and being alone is no hardship for me. Covid-19 is very upsetting for most people, and disrupts their lives. My only inconvenience so far is the closing of the parks, which isn\u2019t very significant. I am 70 and have some of the health issues that could make getting sick, serious for me, ventilators sound painful and they say they aren\u2019t much use. Sooner or later, I\u2019m going to be exposed anyway. I\u2019m fortunate in that Covid-19 doesn\u2019t have much effect on my mental health. ",

I assume Muslims have had a quiet laugh about this. I have been following the \u201cdebate\u201d in the USA about how China is responsible for the USA\u2019s atrocious management of a pandemic that has all the characteristics of a pandemic, and which anyone with a basic education ought to be able to comprehend after an announcement by their 51 governments on what it is, and the actions that might be taken, as per pandemics in the world since the Black Death in 1369. I have seen the commentaries on Quora from the USA about how in due course the USA ought to punish China by measures including warfare, all published by Quora as click bait. This is very depressing, but pretty much reinforces my long-held view that the USA is full of insane warmongers\u2026 Fortunately, the Australian governments and political parties are working together (for the first time in decades) to tackle both the health and the economic issues of the pandemic with the potential that this could extend beyond the pandemic to make Australia even stronger and more resilient. This has included my wife working from home. I have been involuntarily retired since about 2012. So I have revived my computer expertise to get my wife\u2019s office set up, using Zoom and Skype, and to make our printers work properly for the first time in years\u2026 And finally, ta! da!, I have joined a university project to learn to play the piano. This started as a fortnightly lesson at a university campus half an hour drive away, but now is being done remotely. So I have connected up my Yamaha keyboard to my computer, and installed Zoom, Rosegarden and Audacity so I can participate in remote lessons, and store and exchange music between me and the university project team. So, I think overall the pandemic has fortunately improved my mental health. ",

These are just a few ideas (of the top of my head) of why mental health is being so impacted by the coronavirus. There are plenty more. I even SUFFERED from grieving this past weekend not because I lost someone, but because I CAN'T GET A HUG from anyone, let alone my newborn grandson!

They take one look at him being all fit and everyone else tired and skin and bone and think he is a traiter paid by the Japanese. That is how I feel.

Even though I take medication for depression, I have to be careful how much that med is increased, because if I take too much it throws me into a manic episode you. Not good either way. Mania has set in 3 times since the outbreak of the virus. Again, not good. Dealing with this has made me, via telephone , deal with my physician and my therapist on a more than regular basis. And is helpful. Stabilizing is definitely and seriously more difficult during this time. I try following all the rules, but even so, I could achieve better results with my mental health if I was not stuck here in limbo. Hopefully, it will be easier to manage after this crazy pandemic.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to claim that suddenly having so much free time has been both good and bad for our various mental states, but that honestly feels like a lie. So far, there\u2019s been very little good to come from it. I\u2019m just one of many in a host\u2019s multiple personality system though, so perhaps it would be best to try to answer this question for each individual alter. Personally, I\u2019ve been angrier this past week than I ever have been before. Our host\u2019s father refuses to clean up after himself in any way, and because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s the most affected by both messes and unfairness, I\u2019ve been constantly upset by having to maneuver my way through endless crumbs in the kitchen, washing up his dishes to even have a kitchen to work in, and walking over cat litter in the carpet that he\u2019s unbothered by because he left the cat boxes directly outside of our bedroom for over a week. I was so angry that an email I sent to our therapist made him hesitant to even continue sessions this week, and in our \u201cinternal house\u201d where all the alters live, my brother volunteered to spend a night sleeping on the couch just so that I could have a night alone to try to calm down. The alter who\u2019s normally viewed as the angriest in our system is actually doing alright right now, ironically. As a rarity, he\u2019s the one actually looking forward to being able to talk to our therapist about his genuine emotions rather than just having someone to scream at. He\u2019s been upset for awhile because of a relationship that exists between other alters in the system, and he feels like now is a better time than ever before to bring it up with our therapist. I just hope that he can control himself enough to be able to have the conversation that he wants to without devolving into rage and personal attacks. He\u2019s also been feeling a mix of emotions because, for the first time in a long while, he threw a metal tool at our host\u2019s father and created another hole in the wall before he went and tore up the living room as well. He got destructive and began making threats as a way to make our host\u2019s father finally clean the litter boxes that had been untouched for an entire month, and part of what\u2019s made me so angry is that the violence actually worked to get the litter boxes cleaned. Several of us have tried to ask for fairness in socially acceptable ways, and it angers me that our host\u2019s father just continues to prove that we\u2019ll only ever purposefully act out in evil ways because it\u2019s all that he\u2019s willing to listen to. Our host alter has been excited to catch up on his Torah reading because he\u2019s a few months behind on it. He wants to be caught up on the readings by Passover. On a couple of recent days, he\u2019s made progress, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to achieve his goal at this point, given how out of control some of the alters have started going. One alter has resorted again to stealing in this past week, and we\u2019ve also been arguing with her because we don\u2019t want to allow her to give into her eating disorder. None of us are able to work for money right now, meanwhile our host\u2019s father is actually gaining money off of our misery at this time because his work has been entirely unaffected, he\u2019s saving money on the doctors we\u2019d normally see and Lyft rides we\u2019d normally take, and he\u2019s receiving a full refund for this semester\u2019s college classes. Despite him having more money and us having almost none, he refuses to give us any extra for sanity (even though he\u2019d also hate having to pay for another hospitalization). So, the alter that doesn\u2019t have a problem with stealing went ahead and used over $100 to buy a new LEGO set to keep herself and others entertained, and then she stole about $200 more for delicious fresh food (mostly vegetables and fish) that isn\u2019t going to negatively affect our physical disorder any further. We have yet to face the full repercussions of her actions. One alter is more depressed than he has been in a very long time. I suppose the good that\u2019s come of that is that he\u2019s written some amazing poetry for the first time in several months, maybe even years. This alter normally has anxiety and finds it hard to smile, but, lately, he\u2019s basically lost interest in almost everything. I can\u2019t even convince him to work on the art projects that he\u2019s been working on for years, even though he finally has the time now to do so uninterrupted. He could probably even finish at least one with all the time we have now, but he can\u2019t bring himself to even try. It makes me sad that I don\u2019t know how to help him more. I can do my best to understand him and know him, but I can\u2019t help him. Another alter has been almost entirely silent recently, which in itself is somewhat scary. Oftentimes, we let her keep to herself because she claims that she doesn\u2019t want to be around most people, but I\u2019m worried about how she might end up if no one\u2019s paying attention to her for too long. The alter who\u2019s normally able to enjoy himself with alcohol and music and good food has also been upset as of late because he feels as though he was incredibly honest with our therapist for the first time ever last week and that our therapist then subsequently ignored all of his attempts to share genuine emotions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that our therapist ignored him; I think other alters got in the way of them being able to have a conversation at the end of last week. This alter was already feeling bad though, ever since our last trip to the psych ward (just before the massive COVID outbreak started). Watching a particular movie in the psych ward made him start missing home more than he had in a long time, and then being forced into isolation directly afterwards has been very hard for him, like he\u2019s in Psych Ward 2.0 now. He\u2019s openly said that he doesn\u2019t like going to therapy because he doesn\u2019t see a point in being vulnerable with other people, and now he feels hurt because he thinks that our therapist didn\u2019t value his attempt at sharing real emotions enough. The two alters that I\u2019ve left out at this point are the youngest and the oldest, and I think it\u2019s safe to say that both of them are mostly just tired. The oldest (my brother) is usually tired throughout most of life, but he\u2019s spent more time just lying in bed, doing nothing this past week than any of us have in years. There\u2019s not much other choice for him though, I suppose, since he always feels too tired and weak to accomplish anything. The youngest just wants to be able to play with his toys, but there hasn\u2019t been much time for that either amongst all the chaos that\u2019s been unfolding in our system and this household. Every day, I like to think that we\u2019ll get something worthwhile accomplished. There\u2019s so much to clean up and so many unfinished projects and so much good that could come from this time. Living with our host\u2019s father definitely makes everything worse though, especially for my personal ability to function, since I\u2019m the one who freaks out over the constant trail of messes that he leaves every moment he\u2019s awake. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s normally in charge of keeping everything together for all of us, and, I guess, more than anything, I\u2019m just afraid now that so long as I\u2019m living around that man and unable to simply walk to a refrigerator without being infuriated by his mess, every single alter in this system will progressively get worse until we truly don\u2019t have a therapist or anything else left. And if that were to happen, then I don\u2019t know how I would stop the suicidal alters. It\u2019s already becoming difficult, and I don\u2019t think I have the strength to hold on indefinitely. ",

In such times of uncertainty and stress, we can encounter a lot of negative feelings like fear, anxiety, loneliness, worry and more. We are facing a pandemic at present and to be concerned of its consequences is normal, we see huge number of people getting adversely affected by it everyday and it keeps increasing. Every aspect of our life has changed. Movements are restricted, we meet only a limited number of people, we cannot socialise, go to office or school, and cannot do activities that we are used to do. All this has definitely hd an impact on our plans and expectation in the year 2020. Due to this drastic change in our lifestyle, to adjust with it is very difficult and disappointing which has already led to a large number of depression cases, extreme steps like suicides and self harm incidences. We can clearly witness this affect that COVID-19 has on our mental health. But, we need to stay strong, help each other and be mentally and physically fit. We must ensure that our dear ones are doing well and are emotionally stable as All of us are Together, in this.

            "answer_text": "Greetings Miguel and Jay, The lock down caused by the stock market crash and the collapse of world\u2019s economic system as we knew it and the lock down caused by the flu virus aka Covid-19 did not affect my mental health. What I observed among people is the fear fuelled by what I would call Covid-1984: misleading information, contradictory information, media shooting fear into people rather than making informed scientific statements. For example, if there is a deadly virus, such as Ebola (71% death rate regardless of your health), you do not open public swimming pools, restaurants and bars when you haven\u2019t found the source of the infection (persons) and isolate them. Unfortunately, many people suffer from serious health condition(obesity, diabetes, cancer, etc)which makes them highly susceptible of deadly complications if infected by the flu virus, as they do yearly, pass-on from those complications. And that, generates fear, but not enough to make some of them change, and surely not enough to create a state of panic in the world\u2019s population\u2026So all the media coverage and the political counter truth, create a rather negative impact on people\u2019s mental health: from insecurity to shear paranoia and rage. It is rather challenging, mind boggling for most of us. We are homeschooling our daughter who is now in grade 11, so nothing new for us as far as staying home; we often wash our hands, nothing new there either. It is other people\u2019s reactions that are mostly challenging! In Peace and Friendship, Pierre ",

As a psychotherapist who has clients all over the world I am seeing a large increase in new clients coming to me for depression, anxiety and panic related issues due to the pandemic. Even my current clients have expressed deep concerns but they have the tools to deal with these issues and we just have to work on reinforcing those skills. I have even written an article and posted it about the consequences of change and panic and coping skills required for dealing with the depression and anxiety in this crisis. The majority of people are afraid of rapid change and the COVID-19 pandemic is creating rapid change in our world. Once the pandemic has ended and the virus is contained and there is a viable vaccine available to everyone there will still be millions of people with PTSD and depression as a result of the intense emotions and traumas associated with their reactions to the pandemic. It is extremely important to learn how to deal with rapid change in our world because this is not the last time something like this will happen. We can thrive through change or we can fail to thrive. I hope everyone chooses to thrive. I hope this is helpful for you. Take care, Jon  ",

Depression sets in from being alone, unable to visit compromised or elderly family. Kids are suffering not having their friends around. Deaths are constant and it is human nature for that to produce anxiety. That brings grief. It is also frustrating in countries with poor leadership and low scientific understanding because misinformation spreads faster than truth. In short, this pandemic is negatively effecting a large number of people psychologically because it is the equivalent to taking your very worst day ever, and having it on repeat for a year or more.

Less screen time.Tried doing nothing for the first 30 mins of each day. I\u2019d just sit in the backyard and look at the plants. I tried doing nothing, just sitting there and sipping my coffee.I drew boundaries at work. I was, of course, working more than ever initially, I wanted to find an escape and working till 4 am and starting back again at 10 am was becoming routine for me. I drew boundaries, I made some rules for myself. Now I hardly ever work after 7 or 8 pm.Built a routine: Eliminating decision fatigue by deciding exactly what I\u2019ll do each morning/night helped a lot.Communicated more with my husband: End of the day, we\u2019re all going through this together. He had his own ways of dealing with this life-changing event and I had mine. We were both suffering at the hands of this emotional turmoil and tried to communicate more openly and sharing more freely about our feelings helped a lot.I hope this helps.

The list doesn't end here. Personal life is on a different level screwed up. You have to stay home(which is necessary), meeting friends has been in the form of video call and voice calls. After 6 months, it has started escalating now. The naive me thought due to pandemic and lockdown, at least people would stay in their homes and crime rate would not increase. But boy was I wrong. Domestic violence cases has increases. Riots, hate crime, everything is just THE SAME. Nothing has been changed on the positive scale. Only good side I can think of right now is, people are working out, those who are working at home have time for their families and can pursue their lost hobbies or develop a skill. Freelancing is being encouraged and more and more people are migrating towards part time jobs.  I think everybody should at least consider therapy when vaccine will be developed and situation to be back to normal. This might take a while. ",

            "answer_text": "Our overall well being and health ,peace, happiness etc are all a function of our karmas (chosen by our Soul for payback before our birth , ) and the karmas ( good and bad ) we did in present birth , and our prayers to the Creator by chanting, meditation ,good philanthropic deeds ,charity , selfless social service etc. But all these present karmas and prayers are to be done with untainted hands . If prayers are done regularly with tainted hands they are just rejected and are of no use in mitigating our sufferings or undergoing chosen presdestined karmas for payback. If prayers are done regularly with clean hands of clean karmas there will be heavenly grace available for condonation by the Creator in addition to Angellic interventions of help in distress or in emergencies while we are on earth. So it can't be any different in Covid 19 pandemic situation \u2026 It is akin to \u201c Sadesathi \u201c period in Hindus which we consider a period of seven and a half years in a total zodiac cycle of past 30 years as the worst suffering period for any individual. During this seven and half years the person's concerned are battered in worst manner or get elated in the best manner depending upon thier karmas for the past 30 years . Similar is the case with Covid 19 pandemic scenario. Gist of the answer to this question is that Covid 19 pandemic or any witchcraft cannot alter our mental state or well being by overriding our karmas .

The enormity of living in isolation, changes in our daily lives, job loss, financial hardship and grief over the death of loved ones has the potential to affect the mental health and well-being of many. Even in this time of physical distancing, it\u2019s critical to seek social support and connection with others. It\u2019s also important to know the signs of anxiety, panic attacks, depression and suicide so you can easily identify them, not just among your family, friends and neighbors, but for yourself. I have found the tapping solution to be a big help! I discovered it through energy psychologist Mary Sise. In the video below you can try for yourself as she was recently featured in The Shift Network doing the EFT and explaining what it is.  ",

I know social distancing is for everyone\u2019s good. But I've also read that human beings that don\u2019t get hugged/ touched have a shorter life span. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll die if I don\u2019t get a hug in a couple of weeks ; I\u2019m saying maybe the hugs my friends gave me (that I've never felt how important those were until now) actually helped me have a healthier life. DAD? Also my Dad is a doctor at a different country ,which means he\u2019s stuck there as a citizen and helpful but at danger as a doctor. He usually visits us every 3 months or so but with the Corona condition I haven\u2019t seen him in 4 months already and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have to wait a lot more. I terribly miss him yet other people surely NEED him. THE IMPRISONING, AGAIN. Can I mention that we only open our windows on Fridays.( because most of our furniture is made up of very detailed wood- which has the ability to store a lot of dust apparently) I want to breathe. I need to breathe nevertheless the tiring cleaning. I want to feel the cold breeze against my skin. I've learned that gas particles are always in motion yet for the first time I feel all the carbon atoms still near me. suffocating me. I\u2019ve mostly only slept at home. After all I want me and my people to stay safe and not catch the virus, so I stay home. WHO I\u2019M IMPRISONED WITH. I also see the same people (my mum and my sister) everyday , which I thought was alright before but now that I\u2019m doing it I don\u2019t think I prefer it. they both keep questioning my habits. HELLO? Have you even ever met me? Turns out seeing strangers that knew nothing about you after all mattered. At least they don\u2019t give you instructions about how to not do the stuff you regularly do with your friends. I know my inability to do nothing facilitates my aggression towards them ,so I imagine this is all in my head and that I\u2019m over reacting. I want to run. You know what I\u2019m saying? Not runaway or anything. just RUN. MOVE. I need more movement in this utterly boring routine. I\u2019m only an eleventh grader (NOT REGULARLY HOME SCHOOLED) and I\u2019ve been taking daily tuitions with my friends after school for the past 2 years. I had a pretty busy life and now that I have nothing to do I acknowledge that I actually like being busy. My existence is futile right now. I\u2019m frustrated. NOTE: THANKS FOR ASKING! Is anyone else having trouble staying home? ",

Also in lockdown people had more time to think about things and worrying over their future and the getting of the virus. The power of the Hug is amazing and during the lock down there were no Hugs to placate to smooth, to ease the tension. Of the millions of people furloughed they are worried if also they will have a job to go back to also. No cup of tea no smoothing hand to comfort those mentally stressed out. I also believe to a certain degree ,but don\u2019t get me wrong that more and more people are claiming that they have a mental health problem were in a number of cases it was just anxiety. We have broken down the family in a lot of cases, fragmentation of it is the main cause of a lot of mental problems for people no longer have a shoulder to cry on anymore, and the lock down has brought this home so many today who are \u201chome alone \u201c ",

It can spread through close contact when an infected person coughs, sneeze, and some droplets are thrown out by the infected person. Many people have even lost their jobs. Having no source of income leads to stress and tension. Even suicide cases are increasing in many countries. Trapping in their own houses and not going out has affected the mental strength of people. The unbearable anger due to the imposition of quarantine may lead to negative outcomes. The fear the COVID is not allowing the infected people to fight against the disease.

They leave their garbage, they kill animals without reason, they bother others, they're way too friendly with my unfriendly dog so I've got to keep an eye on them, which wasn't the case before covid. Other than those disturbances, covid19 didn't affect my mental health. I'd be glad if people could go back to their activities instead of coming where I live though.

Staying in closed spaces has never felt as claustrophobic as this. Hence it is natural if you feel tired, lost or demotivated. Your life has entered the slow mode which our fast paced lifestyle could not handle. There were also many people who lost their jobs, homes and families. So if you think about it, you should be thankful if you still have a roof over your head , food in your belly and sleep at nights. Your pain and concern is not futile but you have to use your empathy to support you in this strange time. Our mental health is really important and underrated aspect of our life. This is an opportunity to work sincerely on it. Give yourself some space to breathe free and find motivation in the people around you or the nature just outside. This time is for your personal growth. Use it for things you procrastinated about and if you don't feel like it, that is alright as well. Even if you are able to sort a tiny issue in your life, you are sorted by all means. ",

Our existence has depended on it. As cave dwellers and nomads, we were in clans and tribes. Our \u2018old\u2019 or \u2018lizard\u2019 brains kick into anxiety mode if we feel isolated. This can set off pre-existing mental health issues or it can be a new issue. The trend I have noticed is just how narcissism is almost at a epidemic level in the US. It has been the norm in the Bible belt and has spread. (That's my opinion.) I see a trend where a lack of a social conscious is excepted. Rebellion and oppositional behavior is a way of getting attention and used to relieve boredom. These people feed off of each other's narcissism. We are in uncharted territory as a nation. We feel the lack of solid, intelligent leadership in the White House and that only feeds the anxiety fire. So, I see anxiety as the number one problem of this pandemic and it has been the spark that has ignited other mental health issues for those that are susceptible. ",

I worked in acute inpatient psych for 5 years, and while it was a rewarding experience, the hospital\u2019s lack of appropriate COVID response was one of the biggest reasons why I quit. I realized that I could not bear it if I infected my daughter, my husband, my in-laws (who are immunocompromised), and it made me realize what is really important in my life. I thought, eff it, and took a huge risk in starting my private practice. In a way, COVID made me take stock of what\u2019s truly important to me, and what I want to be doing with my life. On the negative side, I am increasingly sad, since I can\u2019t see my own parents and sister, since they live in another country.

They also noticed a rise in alcohol consumption and abuse along with increased marital and family issues including abuse of spouses and children. People are being fed exaggerated and false news increasing their fear and anxiety.

Due to ease in office hours and work from home facility, people are getting time for their hobbies and interests.

They have rents to pay, EMIs and daily expenses. They are survived by joint family. Thus, it has become difficult for them to handle the situation. They are having restless days and sleepless nights.

It is not even funny to the extent it has played havoc with the mental health of people triggering panic and scare. One needs to understand the situation and take the right measures, panic happens when we as individuals think that we can control everything specially. We need to focus on everything that is within our hands instead of regretting things that are not. ",

India\u2019s coronavirus infections have surged to overtake the U.K, becoming the fourth worst-hit nation, only behind the U.S, Brazil, and Russia. The situation remains dire, particularly in Delhi and Mumbai where state-run hospitals have run out of beds and are turning patients away. The Delhi High Court on June 11 permitted all the private hospitals in the city, which are equipped with labs to conduct tests and have the sanction of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It was imperative to allow private hospitals to conduct tests as there are just 17 labs in the public sector in Delhi, with the capacity to test only 2,900 people per day. In the private sector, 23 labs have been granted permission, which has a combined capacity of testing 5700 people per day. The decision comes after the Supreme court slammed the Delhi government for a low testing rate in the region which is reporting 1800-2000 cases every day. On an increase in the number of cases in the capital, Delhi\u2019s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia shared that by current estimates there would be more than half a million cases by the end of July, requiring more than 80,000 hospital beds. To reduce the burden on public infrastructure, the Delhi government has directed all the private hospitals in the capital to reserve 20% beds for admitting Covid patients. ",

I'm a regular church attender in an evangelical church and I love children. I'm missing the kiddos that I work with immensely. I also made myself reach out and be honest that I was struggling. I have a support team around me plus my therapist so I'm fortunate. It's hard to reach out for me, I'd much rather withdraw when I'm in trouble. I would suggest if you're struggling that at minimum you hear a voice if FaceTime isn't possible. I believe that sending texts is okay but you are really guessing sometimes if the person is kidding or serious. I find it better to at least talk so there's not so much misunderstanding. If you're a gamer, you still need stimuli outside of the game. Great to have a common interest but again I think conversation is important outside of game talk. ",
