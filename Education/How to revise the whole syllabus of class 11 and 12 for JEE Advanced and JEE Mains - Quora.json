            "answer_text": "I believe its the best time to answer this question because probably in 2\u20133 months, most people will be done with the complete syllabus and revision time will start. Being an ex-JEE aspirant, I should tell you one very important thing first. The duration of this whole revision phase is undoubtedly the most crucial phase of your whole JEE preparation. Trust me, you revise well and you can do wonders. You don`t, high chances that you will screw up things badly. Those who have already planned how to revise will always have an upper hand over others because more than skill and knowledge, revision requires strategic planning. Now how to revise: Solve problems which have troubled you in the past. No need to solve the ones which were just a cakewalk.Clear all your leftover doubts as fast as possible. Whatever doubts you had until now should be cleared as soon as possible. Be it with the help of teachers, elder brothers / sisters or any online platform. Don`t hesitate in asking now. If you do, you are harming yourself only.Don`t mess up. Take few chapters at one time. Read complete theory related to it from notes/books. Solve problems as written in the first point. Repeat it with all next chapters.Start with the ones which you studied long time before. Since most people start with Newton`s laws and Kinematics in physics, I guess its the best to start from them only because the picture of these chapters in your mind will be most faded. You need to make it as clear as it was then or better than that. Similar with other 2 subjects.Theory and problem solving are equally important. If you are just reading theory, nothing is going to happen and same goes with if you are just solving problems. Both of them should be given equal and ample time to achieve very good results finally.Stretch your study hours. If you were studying X hours till now, try to make it X+1 and increase it slowly accordingly. Make sure that its not exceeding 12 - 14 hours barrier. I don`t want you to become a geek. Its important to relax too during this phase especially.Read NCERT thoroughly. This point will be very beneficial especially when we are talking about preparing for Mains also.If you have not done past year IIT problems till now, solve them. They are a must to get the tag of a successful JEE aspirant.If you have already done those past year IIT problems, redo them or at least redo the best among them. Its very important to keep those tricks and unique concepts fresh in your mind because they will help you in your final paper also.Appear for at least 3 tests before Mains in your coaching. Coaching centres take a hell lot tests during this phase. Its very important to keep analysing your current level of preparation and keep on pushing yourself till the last day.So this all was the primary work you must do. I believe this should be completed before boards or max by Mains. This much can definitely help you to achieve 220+ score in Mains. A bit more punctuality and you will be able to cross the 250 marks barrier and those who will also take out time to practice some completely new problems will be easily able to touch 280+ score. A 300+ score highly depends on some other factors too in which you don`t have your control but I believe the less silly mistakes you do in Mains, the better chances you will have to achieve this benchmark. Okay so we have done the primary work now. Check. We have already got a good Mains score. Check. We are having a strong hold of all the concepts. Check. Now what to do for Advanced? Start solving new problems. Coaching centres provide hell lot workbooks along with practice sheets during this phase. Start solving those new problems. The more problems you do, the better horizon of thinking you will have while solving a problem on the final day. This will also help in making your theory concepts more clear.Keep on reading theory and revising all formulas/equations.Inorganic is the most pathetic thing in this world. I know it too but there is no point in abusing and cursing it. IIT will still put up questions from it and those number of questions (if not done correctly) are enough to screw your final rank. So read as much as you can. I have already mentioned all details about how to study Inorganic here.Don`t let your doubts increase. See its very important to solve new problems during this phase but never ever let your doubts increase during this time. If you have started solving a new book or a new sheet and you are getting consistent doubts, LEAVE IT. The time duration of 2 months is not so much that you will be able to ask a lot of doubts and believe me, if you will have doubts on the final day, you are not going to get a good result. In this case, its better to start revising things as mentioned in the 10 steps given above.Don`t lose hope. Never ever start feeling overconfident or less confident. Take it as an exam only. I know its important but its not the end of the world.Appear for at least 2\u20133 tests before Advanced to analyse your level of preparation.If you have got hell lot material from coaching and you are confused from where to start, take help from your teachers and start from the one, which is the best among them. Its not important to complete all the material. What`s more important is solve so that you are understanding each step what you are writing. For example, In FIITJEE, you get 3 review packages , GMP , RTPF during this time and its not possible to solve all this material so the best thing to do (which I also did) is to start solving review packages because they contains some good quality questions compared to the other two. Problems in GMP are either very easy or super tough. There is no point in practising it if you don`t have time. So make your judgement accordingly.This much should be enough to secure a great rank in JEE too. I am not going to mention the exact figure though because again there are some other factors involved but yeah, at least this is the most and best you can do from your side. Hope this helps. All the best :) ",

            "answer_text": "Your situation is just like a 800 m runner running his/her last lap. The last lap is your revision. Revision is the most important phase in your preparation. If you have ~4\u20135 months. I would suggest you start from the most basic topics. Solve close to 100 questions from each topic of each subject, Physics: Rotational Dynamics(RD), Conservation of Momentum, Errors and Measurement, Electrostatics, SHM, EMI and Modern Physics. Try questions which contain the following mix: RD+SHM, RD+Electrostatics, SHM+RD+EMI etc. IITJEE often has tough questions of the above type. Chemistry: Concentrate on topics like Ionic Equilibrium, Periodic Table basics, Thermodynamics, the p-block and d-block, General Organic Chemistry(The basics of Organic Chemistry), Hybridization, Organic reaction product formation, Alcohol Phenol and Ethers, Aldehyde Ketones and Carboxylic Acid, Electrochemistry. Mathematics: Complex Numbers, Integration, Functions, Probability using PnC, 3-D Geometry, Vectors, Conics(Circle, Ellipse and Parabola are important). Master these topics. Prepare revision notes for the last month. It should be prepared by yourself. During this time, I would suggest you to solve Resonance Rank Booster for JEE Main and Advanced and don\u2019t pickup I.E. Irodov during this phase. Solve all your doubts. Don\u2019t focus on what marks you get in A.I.T.S, focus on improving your mistakes. You should finish everything 1 month before the JEE Main exam.If you have ~1 month for revision. My suggestion will be revise all the topics in 10\u201315 days. Do not pick up any new book during this time. Attempt past year papers, take 3\u20134 JEE Main level tests and analyse your mistakes. Complete everything one week before the exam and just do a quick recap of everything. Take a test 2 days before the exam, and enjoy the day before JEE Main. Same applies for JEE Advanced.If you have ~10 days or less. Only attempt 2\u20133 JEE Main level papers, analyse them and just see the important formulas from each topic. Additionally, just see the MCQs of past year papers.Note: It is highly recommended to solve past year papers and analyse the A.I.T.S Papers. Do not get influenced by anyone during this phase. ",

If you haven't done yet, it's better to leave.Prefer your notes which you would have made through out your 11th and 12th class.In case if you don't have proper notes then go for hand books.Give a reading to all the concepts and theory.Learn each and every formulas by heart(specialy in physics)If you have your notes then go through the question which you have earlier solved in class(don't solve them again just go through them)For organic chemistry read all types of reactions and learn the work of different reagentsFor inorganic chemistry it's better that you only go through the notesAnd for maths, physics and physical chemistry just receive all concepts and formulasOn the last day that is on Saturday make your self free before 6 in evening and now it's better to relax and plan a strategy for tomorrow.Have a sound sleep atleast for 7 hours ( a day before exam)All the best :) ",
