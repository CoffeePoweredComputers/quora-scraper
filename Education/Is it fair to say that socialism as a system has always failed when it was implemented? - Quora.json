            "answer_text": "It is not only fair to say that socialism has always failed, it is fair to say it is doomed always to fail. Communes and cooperation, commerce and competition--these are standard behaviors of mankind for all time. These are behaviors honed in the folk games of children and raised to sophistication in adulthood. We compete one-on-one through a range of behaviors from high-hilarity sack races to aggressive martial arts. We cooperate in endeavors from raising barns to growing gardens and pot luck dinners. We cooperate with some in order to compete with others--team sports. We give food and shelter to the homeless; we also try to have a nicer yard than our neighbors. You can walk into bazaars in the far corners of the world and hear, \"Hey! Amereecan, come here. I geeve you good price.\" Competition. We shift gears in this world with hardly a thought, only somebody came along and tried to raise this most mundane human behavior into an economic-cum-socio-cum-political-cum-intellectual theoretical edifice. There's a reason there's no trace of Karl Marx anywhere in contemporary economics--no surviving theory, no premise, no doctrine, no analytical tool... because he botched it... big time. The Stumbles of Socialism A strange thing unique in the history of the world started happening toward the end of the Age of Enlightenment in the late 18th century. Ordinary people started getting wealthy. And, according to the new thinking of liberalism, that was okay. They would be allowed to prosper. A millionaire in US dollars in the early 1800s was worth about $30M today, and there were more than twenty millionaire farmers in Natchez, Mississippi, alone, growing the finicky sea island cotton for the mills of England (where Marx's future co-author Friedrich Engels was busy getting wealthy). There were a few more millionaire farmers in the swamplands of southern Louisiana growing sugarcane. Both crops grew in the Caribbean. Factories were making firearms, rail lines were being laid, machinery was being designed. There had never been anything like this, and it electrified the liberal world. Communitarian Socialism Early socialism can fairly be characterized as the effort to capture the seemingly random lightning of free enterprise in a bottle and make it accessible to all. Throw in class antagonisms and aspirations, and this sometimes took the form of anti-aristocracy as in the pre-socialist Paris Commune (French Revolution). The horrors of the French Revolution and the turmoil caused by Napoleon gave rise to the Counter-Enlightenment, essentially a rejection of liberalism. In this intellectual ferment, early socialism took the form of futuristic ideal communities, where all could prosper together. Marx and Engels heaped scorn on these experiments, calling them Utopian socialism in contrast to their own Scientific socialism. With the 1848 publication of The Communist Manifesto, communitarian socialism died on the vine, eclipsed by the glitz of a new scientific theory of how everyone would prosper in the future. Command Socialism As Marx saw it, feudalism had given way to capitalism (as his Russian translators would name it down the road) which would inevitably give way to communism/socialism (for Marx, socialism was the social condition obtained from the practice of communism, his form of scientific socialism). He had no brief against capitalism; it was just a station along the way to communism, which would be the culmination of history, the final social achievement of mankind. And that was mistake one. Marx presented communism in the form of a history to come. It was not a blueprint of how to run a communist nation. It was to become Dialectical materialism. In the salons of Europe, it was discussed fervently by young intellectuals from 1848 through the publication of Das Kapital in 1867. Three years later, the world's first socialist republic was born: Paris Commune. It lasted two months and some days. A number of other little-known and short-lived socialist republics were born in and after World War One. Finally, in 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was born and survived... until 1991. This was totalitarian communism or command socialism. A number of nations followed suit--North Korea (1948), China (1949), Cuba (1961), Laos (1975) and Vietnam (1976) are still communist, though North Korea has revised it to the unique Juche communism and recently to fascism, and China and Vietnam now incorporate appreciable capitalism. Some nineteen other nations gave up on socialism. As today's Marxist bitter-enders are wont to proclaim, real communism, Marx-style, has never been tried. For one thing, Marx had said communism would come about as capitalists exploited and impoverished workers (and Russia never had a capitalist class). Indeed, this seemed to be happening all around the world in the latter half of the 19th century. But that was a function of no major gold strikes from 1849 to 1896. Productivity rose tremendously but with no new gold and with all currencies pegged to gold, the money supply stayed the same. Purchasing power shot up some eighty percent in most western nations and put pressure on nominal wages to come down (resulting in a number of riots), and even though the prosperity was a demonstration of the power of capitalism, the attempts to reduce nominal wages stood for many as proof of Marx's warnings. Vladimir Lenin understood this discredited Marx but rationalized it as a function of the Western Colonialism of the era. So he decided to incorporate Imperialism too as well as other of his own ideas, such as Vanguardism. Also, the Revolution of 1917 had been preceded by three-hundred years of Romanov rule, czars who had brutally marginalized the nobility and ruled despotically through agents. Soviet communism would continue rule by Romanov-style ruthlessness. Lenin, for selfish reasons, also introduced the idea that socialism was a pre-state to communism. His successor, Joseph Stalin, possessed an even more bizarre, convoluted and murderous idea of the goals of a communist state. Fascism Marxist communism formalized and continued to take shape starting with the Second International of 1889. But during this period an alternative, anti-Marxist socialism began to take shape from among the syndicalist and social democratic thinkers of the day, particularly Georges Sorel, Maurice Barr\u00e8s, even Charles Maurras, a European conservative though not at all in the US sense. In place of a goal of class, the new fascism favored nationalism. In place of materialism, idealism. In place of history, myth. In place of nationalized industry, Dirigisme or effective control. And so on. Soon, following World War One, all of the countries of Europe had prominent fascist factions, and Spain, Italy and Germany soon gained fascist governments. The Italian Fascists and German National Socialists also fancied themselves the inevitable \"end of history,\" and took on the world in World War Two, pretty much ending the history of fascism. Social Democracy and Market Socialism The Social Democratic Party of Germany began life in 1875 as a Marxist party with the help of Old Karl himself. Soon, however, he was spitting mad at their willingness to compromise far short of a full Marxian workers' paradise. Soon they were in battle with Otto von Bismarck, who, in order to thwart socialism, helped it succeed by co-opting their goals and implementing them himself. This interplay captivated the imagination of the world as the Germans gave birth to welfare-state socialism. In the US, both parties became predominantly progressive, the term for the politics of pursuit of Social democracy, and Democratic administration after Republican introduced welfare reforms and even fully communist ones (an income tax is demand two in The Communist Manifesto). Starting after World War One, when both communism and fascism were at the zenith of their appeal in the US, John Maynard Keynes, a British liberal-cum-progressive, became very instrumental in persuading Americans away from communism and fascism, pointing out that appropriate government policies with regard to the private sector and taxation would have the effect of creating more wealth than the other two forms of socialism but distributing it just as fairly as if the workers themselves owned the means of production. With all socialism suspect in the US from Italy's invasion of Libya through the Cold War, progressivism was marginalized. The Democratic Party was actually truly liberal through much of my youth, at least the Northern and Western wings. The emergence of social democracy in the Scandinavian countries as the Soviet Union waned revived interest in progressivism here in the US. Sweden, Norway, Denmark and a few other nations seemed prosperous, healthy and happy. But cracks started to show in the 1980s. For one, their distribution of wealth and income is not that different from more capitalistic nations. Two, in democracies \"gains\" are lost when social democratic parties are voted out. Three, such high degrees of price and regulatory intervention distort markets. Four, formal centralized bargaining has all but disappeared owing to its inadequacies. Five, high marginal tax rates led to capital flight. Six, with so many going on the dole a culture of non-work began to take hold. And those are only some of the internal issues. The trend among social democracies has been more dependence on free enterprise. The Bug in Marxism There are many problems with Marxist theory. For one, as I outlined at the outset, it takes ordinary human behaviors and conflates them into doctrine that can only be followed with authoritarian controls. For another, there is the much discussed central-planning problem. Bottom-up market systems distribute information significantly more efficiently than do centralized top-down systems. But there is a little-known killer bug in Marx's thought. He famously valued only the labor component of a good. He denied that capital added value. Nevertheless, he held that labor productivity would progress. That would require a second variable, but he never gave it one. In fact labor productivity does progress yielding higher purchasing power for laborers. Just look at the building of the pyramids versus the building of skyscrapers. Look at the building of chariots versus the building of automobiles. Look at the concocting of herbal remedies versus modern pharmaceuticals. Look at any of the hundreds of modern innovations that have no antecedent in ancient times. And what is the variable that allows for higher productivity and, thus, higher worker wealth? Capital. Add that missing variable back in to Marx's work and he effectively proved that capitalism was more efficient than any form of socialism. Indeed, there is some evidence Marx himself came to understand this. The early works of the Marginalism school of economics, authors such as Carl Menger, William Stanley Jevons and L\u00e9on Walras, were becoming available in Europe at the same time as the release of Das Kapital. Marx did no further work on his ideas of capital. Joachim Reig, for one, suggests this may owe to realizing his own work was fundamentally flawed. And so the value of his own work has ended up being nothing more than dogmas and rationalizations for dictators. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow. I enjoy Quora because, in general, the level of discussion is a lot more thoughtful, interesting, and well-educated than something like Facebook. Not that I don't like videos of cute kitties....but as long as I stay away from the theist vs. atheist debates, I'm often delighted and informed by what I read on Quora. But the majority of answers in this thread that support your assumption (i.e. that socialism has \"always failed when it was implemented\") are appallingly misinformed. I know that the conservative Right has striven to distort and conflate the distinct meanings of socialism and communism (and the differences between State socialism and its other forms), but to have so many obviously articulate and (otherwise?) well-informed folks bluster so much inaccurate grandiloquence is really...well...wow. So here's a quick primer to set the record straight: Socialism, as it has been most widely implemented, is very different than Communism as that has been most widely implemented. \"Socialism is a social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and cooperative management of the economy,[1][2] as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\" (from Socialism). Socialism has had many different, successful large-scale implementations around the globe (more on that in a moment). Communism, though it also has different varieties, has really only been implemented on a large scale as Marxism-Leninism, which establishes an oligarchic/dictatorial form of State-capitalism that is run solely by the Communist party. There really isn't much \"socialistic\" about it at all. The original ideas of Marx and Engels were indeed fermented in a much more democratic vision of socialist philosophy, but Stalin basically made short work of their proposals, coopting the proletariat rhetoric and idealism to mold an oppressive, totalitarian regime. China, Cuba and Laos still maintain much of their own implementations of Marxism-Leninism today, but of course the Communist regimes in the U.S.S.R. and Africa have faded into history.Socialism has been most widely implemented along with democracy as a counterbalance to capitalism in a \"Mixed economy.\" In mixed economies there can be state ownership, worker-ownership and private ownership of the means of production; a market economy and central and/or social economic planning; competitive entrepreneurship and strong regulatory oversight; private financial and monetary systems and public ones. All of the largest economies around the globe represent some formula of mixed economy. In the U.S., for example, we have \"social ownership of the means of production\" - i.e. all the factors of production like labor, intellectual capital, production capital, natural resources and so on are collectively owned/funded by all U.S. citizens - in the case of the Postal Service, U.S. Military, FBI, Social Security, Medicare, National Parks, BLM and so on, and \"cooperative management of the economy\" with respect to the Federal Reserve System and other federal regulatory agencies (SEC, FDA, EPA, FAA, FCC, FDIC, FTC, ICC, EEOC, etc). This is the \"socialist\" side of the U.S. mixed economy. In other countries this \"socialist\" aspect is more pronounced and extensive (for example, in Switzerland direct democracy plays a role in economic planning), and exists along with the democratic process in counterbalance to capitalist markets just as it does in the U.S.So \"socialism as a system\" is alive, well and thriving around the globe. This is because, while free market solutions work well for many products and services, socialist solutions work well for others. Socialized medicine, for example, nearly always outperforms privatized medicine in terms of better immediate health outcomes, lower healthcare costs and longer and healthier lifespans. And for very large infrastructure and essential services issues, where collective benefit far outpaces the opportunity for profit, socialized enterprise just makes more sense (i.e. building and maintaining roads and bridges, fundamental science, monetary systems, childhood education, etc.). The debate over precisely what should be socialized, and what should be privatized, is an entirely different question, so these are just examples of what, as a common sense course of economic development in many countries around the globe (including the U.S.), have ended up on the socialized end of the spectrum. (BTW, you might want to check out this post for further elaboration: T. Collins Logan's answer to What are the differences among progressivism, socialism, communism, and liberalism? And also this: T. Collins Logan's answer to What are the different types of socialism?) ",
