            "answer_text": "FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOULD BE DETERMINED FOR CRACKING SUCH A COMPETITIVE EXAM. SECONDLY YOU SHOULD REMAIN MOTIVATED THROUGHOUT YOUR JOURNEY TILL THE DAY OF NEET 2021 These 7\u20138 Months is the ultimate time for your exam. So utilize that consciously. It's time to pull up your socks and get ready for your journey with full devotion and maximal hard work. Some important points while preparing ; 1. Don\u2019t Study Biology all the time.Most of the student think that by studying more to biology, they can gain a good Rank in NEET. But it is not true because you have to gain good marks in Physics and Chemistry also. Without scoring good marks in Chemistry and Physics you can not secure a good Rank. Therefore If you think that your biology is ready for the exam, then give extra time to physics and chemistry. 2. Make Aim For 620+Make your mindset that you have to score 620+ since the NEET exam is going to be easy next year thats what it seems from this year and the last year for which you have to solve at least 35 questions of Physics 40 questions of Chemistry 85 questions of Biology 3. Join Test SeriesJoin Test Series and analyze your capacity in solving the maximum questions. Join any Online test series (Allen\u2019s online test series) since they provide you with syllabus for each tests which are on every alternate sundays. By preparing each test , giving exam with proper environment helps a lot in facing the real exam.Do prepare for each exam properly as said earlier so that your won\u2019t face any problem in last months. 4. Never Avoid Biology NCERTAlways remember that In NEET, Maximum questions come from NCERT. If you really want to solve more than 85 questions in Biology, you have to read NCERT thoroughly and with full attention. Remember Each and every line of NCERT , Each diagram and its description is important for the exam. 5. Do not avoid Physics and Chemistry NCERT Read the NCERT chapters thoroughly and revise all the concepts properly. Since most of the questions even in these 2 subjects are from the NCERT books. Physics and Chemistry NCERTs are equally important as the biology one. So dont ignore it. And Do solve the examples , intext questions and the exercise questions given at the back as they are very important since direct questions have been seen from them. 6.Try to Solve more and more questionsTry to complete Previous year questions chapterwise for each subject thoroughly atleast 2\u20133 times. Since this time there were many questions which were directly picked up from the previous yr papers. Solving them could be an advantage over others. If possible Do give a try to NCERT EXEMPLAR problems in all 3 subjects. They are very good in clearing concepts. 7.Avoid StressThese days many students start to think unnecessary negative things regarding the exam and result. Try to avoid stress since these thoughts can hinder your final performance. I am sure these tips would definetly help you. ALL THE BEST !! ",
