            "answer_text": "I think you may be alluding to the pastoral role of the teacher here. When you meet a group, it is all about expectations, them of you, and you of them. As part of your getting to know each other it might be a good idea to tell them how you like to operate. For example: let them know about your accessibility in terms of supporting them. This might be in the form of \u2018open\u2019 tutorials when you have availability to see students on a \u2018drop in\u2019 basis. Or you might have timetabled slots when you can offer them one-to-one support. Find out about what the students can offer each other in terms of support too. There is only one of you, and your time is as important as theirs. Some teachers have some concerns about the pastoral role, e.g. students who come to you for support about social issues is difficult. However, I think concerns like this should be dealt with by the experts. There may be student support mechanisms in place in your school or college that you can tell the students about. In addition, let them know when you are not available e.g. holidays and weekends. You can only give so much of your time so be sensible and say NO. ",
