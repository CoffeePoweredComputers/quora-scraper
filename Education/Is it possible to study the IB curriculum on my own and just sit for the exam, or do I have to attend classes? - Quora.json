            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a bit confused by the question, but I\u2019ll answer it the best I can. If this question is asking, \u201cCan I skip my IB classes (just not attend them) or not pay attention in them and learn the material on my own?\u201d Partially, but even at you\u2019re best, you most likely will not do well. IB requires 6 classes (3 HL/3 SL or 4 HL/2 SL), in addition to TOK. HL courses are meant to be taught over a two year span (sometimes 1.5 years). That is a lot of material to cover on one\u2019s own, especially if studying an HL Group 4 Subject like Chemistry or Physics. Additionally, TOK is most likely not going to make much sense on one\u2019s own. Also, IB Subjects requires students to write IAs, which teachers need to grade. You aren\u2019t getting around that one. Each Subject requires one. TOK requires the TOK essays. Then, we haven\u2019t even discussed the Extended Essay or CAS\u2026  If this question is asking, \u201cCan I just take IB exams without taking the class?\u201d Nope. Only AP exams are like that. Those things I mentioned before; IAs, Extended Essays, CAS\u2026 If you don\u2019t turn in an IA, you fail the subject automatically, regardless of how well you do on the exam. You fail you EE? You aren\u2019t getting the Diploma. Don\u2019t finish CAS? No Diploma for you.  There is no easy way to do IB on your own without failing in some way, whether not knowing the material well enough or not completing the extra requirements. If you want courses that you can just sit for the exam, do AP.  A2A ",

            "answer_text": "Technically speaking you are supposed to attend a specific amount of hours of class time for both SL and HL subjects. However I have never read that attendance is mandatory. I have never met a student who could do SL or HL chemistry without guidance. I am sure I have had a few that could have been given materials, met with me periodically and done well, but that is an exceptional student and circumstances would have to be just right to allow that to happen. I have had students who have the intro material down cold and are itching to go faster, only to beg me for more time when we get to Organic or learning IR and NMR spectra. You would need to arrange this with your teachers and school and you will appreciate the monitoring and meetings if they even allow it. Good Luck. ",
