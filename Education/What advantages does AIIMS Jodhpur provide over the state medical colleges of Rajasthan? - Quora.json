            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking me this question. 1) Research- The main objective of establishing all the AIIMS was to improve research facilities in medical science.Availability of Computerised Patient Management System (CPMS) has opened a new facet for conducting research in OPD and IPD setting.Hence aiims jodhpur got an extra edge over state medical colleges. In addition to that, several conferences have been organized in collaboration with IIT Jodhpur in order to broaden the area of technology in the field of medical science. 2) Batch strength- The batch strength of most of government medical colleges in Rajasthan is 250. This is very important factor(from my point of view).Here we have 100 students per batch in AIIMS Jodhpur. So students are able to connect well with the professors. For an example, the anatomy department has a ratio of 40\u201350 students per cadever in the state's medical colleges. I don't consider it a very good ratio. Here at AIIMS Jodhpur there are 10-12 students per cadever. This will help you to acquire skills and provide better learning. Apart from this, AIIMS have got some technical stuff like sectra and anatomage etc. It gives you 3D dimensions of the body. Most of the state medical colleges lack these things. This small batch size also helps in acquiring adequate communication skills for proper interactions with: (a) Patients and Attendants (b) Seniors (c) Peer Group (d) Other paramedical workers. 3) Curriculum and exam pattern- Salient features are as following - There are 3 Professional Exams instead of 4 unlike in State medical colleges.Multiple choice questions will contribute to 25 % of the total theory marks.Clinical subjects (medicine and surgery) are taught from 2nd year onwards.Every Saturday there are only two lectures. One from 9:00am to11:00am and another from 11:00am to1:00pm. First lecture is a collaborative lecture in which more than 2 departments used to teach together like physio-patho-medicine, Anat-surgery-anaesthesia etc. Secondnd lecture is called as UNCLE (Unconventional Learning Experience) in which a group of students have to deliver a lecture based on clinical scenarios. 4) Mentorship programme- As a new entrant to the professional courses (MBBS ,B.Sc. Nursing) at the AIIMS Jodhpur, students have a unique opportunity to be mentored by a faculty member. The mentor encourages the mentee to actualize his/her full potential by sharing knowledge and experience, and providing constant support and encouragement. The purpose is to provide them opportunity for holistic development, to make them comfortable in new environment and to get familiar with the college life, so that they can better achieve their full potential in all the spheres. 5) Infrastructure- Being a central government institute,it is well funded. Hence AIIMS Jodhpur has a top class infrastructure. I have written many answers on this topic. Naveen Lakhara's answer to What are the latest facilities which are provided in AIIMS Jodhpur? Naveen Lakhara's answer to What are the various students committees in AIIMS Jodhpur which look for activities other than studies like drama club etc.? 6) fee -  You can see it is very cost effective when compared to state medical colleges. Academic fee for state medical college = 36000 (excluding mess fee) - - - Thank you for reading. ",
