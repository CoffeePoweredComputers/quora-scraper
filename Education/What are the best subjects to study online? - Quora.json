            "answer_text": "Any course that has a \"learn by doing\" or repetitive iteration model is ideal for learning online. For example, programming lessons on sites like Code Academy offer simple, testable ways of practicing and checking if your code is right. This type of educational product is faster and more efficient than human assistance.  For subjects that are deeply rooted in discussion,like Literature, History, and Business, the learning process in more about discussion than it is iteration. Therefore, courses like these also need an active community and discussion to reach comparable quality to a live experience.  Therefore, I think the first types are more bang for your buck, if you will. ",
