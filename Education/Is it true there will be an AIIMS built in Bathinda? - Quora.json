The cost of the project will be Rs 925 crore. However, the above cost estimate does not include recurring costs (wages and salaries and operation and maintenance expenses). The cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave its approval to the AIIMS which will be established under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) and have a capacity of 750 beds. This will include emergency and trauma beds, AYUSH beds, private beds and ICU speciality and super speciality beds. The project will be completed in a period of 48 months from the date of the approval. It comprises a pre-construction phase of 15 months, a construction phase of 30 months and stabilisation and commissioning phase of three months. It will also have an administration block, AYUSH block, auditorium, night shelter, hostels and residential facilities. \u201cThe institute will also conduct research on prevalent regional diseases and other health issues and provide for better control and cure of such diseases,\u201d an official statement said. The recurring expenditure will be met by the respective new AIIMS from their annual budgets through grant-in-aid to them from plan budget head of PMSSY of the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Under the PMSSY, AIIMS have been established in Bhubaneshwar, Jodhpur, Raipur, Rishikesh, Bhopal and Patna while work of AIIMS at Rae Bareli is in progress. Also, AIIMS in Nagpur (Maharashtra), Kalyani (West Bengal) and Mangalagiri in Guntur (Andhra Pradesh) have been sanctioned in 2015. Modi had recently laid the foundation of a new AIIMS in Gorakhpur after the cabinet gave its nod for the establishment of the institution there. ",
