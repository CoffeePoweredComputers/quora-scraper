            "answer_text": "Music education online is limiting due to the format Students need feedback and the ability to have questions answered. In my experience with online music appreciation, I think much was missed when listening to a piece of music; because in class students can ask about instrumentation or form as its occurring in the piece. This led to in depth discussions and better understanding for students. It is limiting online because you don't get to know students personally. I find that knowing your students helps you to plan meaningful and interesting lessons tailored to their interests and needs. This makes the class more enjoyable and the information is more likely to be retained for longer periods of time. Online just becomes information to remember long enough to pass the class. ",

            "answer_text": "I think online education definitely has it's own general limits, but when it comes to music a lot of it is hands on and requires a good deal of feedback. Being able to get that feedback right away from a real-time class is an invaluable benefit of taking a class in person rather than online. In addition, it's certainly harder for an online course to be tailored to the student(s). I find music courses really need to resonate with the student to be truly effective. Finally, music requires practice, so the course is limited in that it can only teach so much. The student has to practice in their own time to make significant progress. That's assumed right off the bat, but it certainly is a unique limit to learning music. ",
