            "answer_text": "Seriously brother, If it is possible then it will be no less than miracle. Just imagine, a child who is working day and night for his dream for whole one or two year and then you say how to do for Neet level in 2 weeks. If anyone is able to do it in shortest time then what about other hardworking children. Should not they get advantage of studying whole year? Actually, I also had same query as you are having. My teacher told me what I have written above. He said, what will the hardworking children get for working 2 years when you will take a seat with just 1 month. If you want to, then you have to work hard then they are working. Always remember, whenever you feel like taking a break, imagine how much hard work your enemy would be doing in that time in which you are being lazy to go on any more. ",
