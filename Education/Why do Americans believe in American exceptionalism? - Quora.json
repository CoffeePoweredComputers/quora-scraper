            "answer_text": "American Exceptionalism is a tricky topic, because how someone views it is largely formed by their own experiences and upbringing. It\u2019s true that American Exceptionalism can sound arrogant and irrational\u2014but that\u2019s only one interpretation of it. The original (and, one may argue, true) interpretation of American Exceptionalism was actually an analysis among scholars for how American culture differentiated from European culture. The use of \u201cexceptional\u201d here was just another way of saying \u201cdifferent.\u201d For a lot of people, American Exceptionalism isn\u2019t so much about thinking that we\u2019re superior somehow, but rather that we should strive to be as successful as possible and to accomplish as much as we possibly can. Ambition is highly prized in American culture, especially when one considers how low most people started when they first arrived here. For what it\u2019s worth, American citizens are often held to unreasonable standards in comparison to other nationalities. If someone from another country critiques something about the US, they\u2019re considered cultured and insightful. If an American critiques another country, they\u2019re considered narrow-minded and ignorant. We\u2019re held personally responsible for the sins of our ancestors in the court of public opinion (remember slavery? Remember the Trail of Tears? Remember George W. Bush?), all while ignoring the fact that there isn\u2019t a nation on Earth that doesn\u2019t have shameful history. We\u2019re often accused of ignoring our country's darker past, but the truth is, how could we possibly forget? The rest of the world is more than willing to remind us at any given opportunity. So while non-Americans may find the concept of Americans believing their country to be exceptionally good enraging, at the same time, many have no qualms about viewing us as exceptionally bad. It\u2019s one of the many ironies that make up our world. For anyone interested in the original interpretation, I would recommend reading Frederick Jackson Turner\u2019s thesis on the American West. It goes a long way in explaining how this idea took root in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "Because we've been told it exists over and over. Our relative isolation makes it easy to believe, as relatively few Americans travel to other countries; if you don't count brief trips to Canada and Mexico, the number is tiny. So we don't have any real experience with what other countries are like to counteract what we're told. And frankly, we do a lousy job of educating people about what the rest of the world is like, and there's an organized jingoism telling people lies daily about the rest of the world because it serves their political purposes. What \"American exceptionalism\" originally meant is that America was an exception to the general rule that nations formed based on territory, race, or tribal lines, that America was based on an idea and that anyone who accepted that idea could be an American. Sadly, it became corrupted to mean \"America is better than anywhere else\" not because of what we believe or what we do, but simply because we are. That's what far too many Americans believe in, and it's ugly. ",
