            "answer_text": "Hello . So after a long while I came across someone interested in our history. Very well , so yes for becoming an archaeologist you have to choose humanities/arts in class 11 and of course choose history and sociology as one of the 5 subjects . History will surely help you in discovering archaeology and later in graduation you can also take anthropology as a subject. Good luck .. Hope my answer have helped you!  ",
