            "answer_text": "I remember mom holding my hand and my brother's as we walked to Bass elementary. My baby sister, that is how I still think of her although she's sixty, watched with my great uncle as we walked down the sidewalk. The three of us go into a large building and talk to some people in an office. They ask my brother a series of questions, such as, \u201cwhat color is this? How much is one plus one. \u201c My brother, who had two missing front teeth, didn't want to answer their questions, he thought they would laugh at his missing teeth. So when he went speechless, I answered for him. \u201cIt's red,\u201d I enunciated primly, \u201cand one and one is two.\u201d my poor embarassed mom had to explain I was not the one who was signing up for first grade, but kindergarten. She then had to nearly forcibly make me be quiet by putting her hand over my big mouth, so my brother could answer the questions himself without my \u201chelp\". We started school the next day, and walked the route to school with the other little kids. It wasn't very far, maybe three blocks. Of course I managed to get lost the first day. I also got in trouble with the crossing guard. I was barely five. The next year we were at a completely different school. The year after that, two different schools. We went to eight different elementary schools, two junior high's, and three high schools, in total thirteen different schools until everyone graduated. The schools were located in two different countries and seven different states. Thus is the life of military dependent children. ",

            "answer_text": "Kindergarten. We were all lined up in the front hallway near the entrance. I had learned to read some thanks in part to my great-grandparents (they taught me to read by reading road signs) and my parents through some books and probably signs on the side of the road. I remember seeing a sign above a door that read \u201coff ice\u201d. That\u2019s how I pronounced it: \u201coff ice\u201d. I looked around. I didn\u2019t see any ice that I needed to keep off of. Maybe there was ice behind that door that we were to keep off of. Later my teacher, Mrs. Tollman, and her assistant, Ms. Hill, warned us about the \u201cawf-iss\u201d. It\u2019s a bad place, this awf-iss. We don\u2019t ever want to be sent there, for we could get into serious trouble. Our parents would be called, and then we\u2019d get into more serious trouble. This was back when parents could spank their children without any repercussions. Principals could also spank the students back then, so there was a chance you\u2019d get a double-whammy. Mrs. Tollman wrote the word in a corner of the board. \u201cO-F-F-I-C-E\u201d. Anybody who\u2019s name was written underneath that word was sent there immediately. As she pointed it out, she read it aloud. \u201cAwf-iss\u201d. So that\u2019s how it was pronounced. ",
