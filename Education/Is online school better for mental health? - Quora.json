            "answer_text": "To be honest with you, it is not. Due recent events and outbreak of Coronavirus aka COVID-19 all schools in my country are closed including colleges etc. Two weeks ago we got a platform where we new materials are posted every single day. First two days were ok, because everyone had to catch up with few thing including teachers and us, students. But then it got worse. Teacher are sending multiple homeworks, materials and we have to do all of it for max 3 days, and to learn those lectures because soon it is going to be an exam season. I mean 3 days would be perfect if I had 3 subjects, but I have 15 of them and I have to do all of those thing in 3 days. My teachers are also pitying themselves for amount of homeworks that they have to do. I do not know what do they expect from me more\u2026 Maybe to check my homework aswell after I finish writing it. I do not have time for my family anymore, because they send me more things than we usually do at school. I do not even have time for myself during weekends, because they send materials over weekends too. Last night I got notification on that platform at 3 AM. If thats not crazy I do not know what is not. For two days I have been crying over these stupid homeworks and having mental breakdowns because nobody wants to, at least, stop sending lectures during weekends P.S. I do not go to an American highschool. I go to the school in Europe where all my classes are AP. ",
