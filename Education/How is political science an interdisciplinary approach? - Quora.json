            "answer_text": "Political Science is interdisciplinary in that it draws from multiple disciplines in order to study the thing (politics) that it is interested in. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but political institutions (meaning the structures, values, norms and whatnot) did not appear out of thin air. They emerged out of an historical context, so political science needs a firm understanding of history and historical research methods. Since politics is also about the interactions of people, sociological, psychological, anthropological and like fields also contribute their approaches and methods. Since politics is as much about what people think should be as it is about beliefs regarding what is, it draws heavily on political philosophy in framing its theories. Since politics is also about who gets what (or who should get what), economics is a strong influence. And since the dominant methodological approach in the field is positivist/empiricist, it draws heavily on statistics and statistical methodologies. The TL;DR version would be that political science exists at the intersection of multiple disciplines (I listed a few earlier, but there are others) because politics is not wholly one thing. To use one of those $2 college terms, it is a nonreducible emergent phenomenon. IOW, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but cannot be explained without those parts. ",

            "answer_text": "I consider that all social science subjects are inter-related as their prime motive remains the study of human-beings in any form. Therefore, Political Science is no exception as it does not operates in vacuum. Ethics and Political Science for a long time considered as one and inseparable which can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Plato. Marxist Theory talks about the inherent relations between the Economics and Politics when it asserts about the Base and Superstructure. In the words of Sir John Seeley: \u201cHistory without Political Science has no fruit, Political Science without History has no root\u201d. It shows how inter-connected Political Science and History are. In a similar manner, it can be observed that Political Science is part of the larger social sciences and adopts interdisciplinary approach. ",
