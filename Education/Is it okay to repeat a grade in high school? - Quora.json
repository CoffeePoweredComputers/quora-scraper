            "answer_text": "As someone else mentioned, you don\u2019t actually repeat a \u201cyear\u201d as you might in the lower grades. It\u2019s not unheard-of for a student to be \u201ckept back\u201d in 2nd Grade if he or she hasn\u2019t reached the emotional, social, or intellectual maturity required for 3rd Grade. However, in High School, even though we refer to Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors, those are just references to your year in High School. Traditionally, one would finish High School in four years. We often have students who struggle with the rigors of High School, especially when transitioning from Middle School/Junior High. We have many mechanisms in place for intervention when a student is in danger of failing a class, and even more for when that student actually does fail the class: Tommy fails Freshman English (or whatever it\u2019s called in your school). Tommy can: 1) Go to Summer Academy (summer school), where he can work on those areas where he did not meet proficiency and hopefully receive a passing grade prior to the beginning of his Sophomore year; or 2) If Tommy was completely lost and passed NONE of his proficiencies in Freshman English, then Tommy will be repeating that class the next year. In this scenario, Tommy will either have to double-up his English classes one year in order to get back on track, or Tommy will be on the 5-Year Plan - four years of English are required for graduation in most US schools. Now, if Tommy did poorly in ALL of his classes - English, Algebra I, Earth Science, Health/PE, French or Spanish, Visual/Performing Arts - and managed to fail ALL of them, then Yes, Tommy will be repeating his Freshman Year. And, no, this is not OK, but not because he\u2019s going to be in high school for 5 years. It\u2019s not OK because there was a larger failure on the part of the school not to recognize that there\u2019s a major problem here and to get Tommy into a 504 Plan or other Special Services to intervene and help him to succeed. Of course, there are students who fail classes their Sophomore/Junior/Senior years too - this is just one scenario, and the most common. Bottom line: you pass classes, not years. You won\u2019t be \u201cheld back\u201d as you might in 1st Grade. Whether you succeed or not is up to you and your teachers. But it is incumbent upon YOU to seek out help when you\u2019re struggling - others might not always advocate for you as they should. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It is nothing to be ashamed of. A good friend of mine, is a really bright student. He knows his shit. Let\u2019s call him Tim. Now, Tim is really clever. But unfortunately, last year he had some pretty bad circumstances. I never asked him for details because I figured, if he wanted me to know, he\u2019d tell me. So he is now in he unfortunate position of having to repeat Year 10. And he gets so much shit from the asshole group of Year 10s now. They call him names. They\u2019re mean to him. But what he needs is a good friend. So I try to be one. I always talk to him, I never talk to him about school stuff, just generic stuff. And he is having a much better time because all the members of his actual cohort (the current Year 11s) still talk to him, still consider him a part of it, and are still nice to him. And I think he\u2019s a really strong dude for coming to school every day, repeating a year and putting up with that shit. So if you ever find yourself in that position, be strong. Be like Tim. ",
