These lectures are very easy to understand and will fall in love with Physics. Made Ejee Chemistry YouTube channel is the best for chemistry. This channel is operated by Sir Arvind Arora. His teaching in Chemistry is excellent . For Maths I Suggest you to study from Unacademy. There are almost all topic lectures from different teachers. I Couldn\u2019t find any particular teacher for Maths. Unacedamy is always open for online learners. :)Thanks.! ",
