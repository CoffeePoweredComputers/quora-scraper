            "answer_text": "I assume you are from outside the U.S. The answer to your question is yes, you can go to a university with poor grades. There are a few paths if you are in America. You can score well on your SAT scores, or you can go to Community College and get good grades for a year or two (two is better than one). You could probably attend a community college as a foreign student, though I don\u2019t know about that for sure. Perhaps the best thing about the U.S. Education system is the fact that we allow people to do poorly, and still come back and get a great education. ",
