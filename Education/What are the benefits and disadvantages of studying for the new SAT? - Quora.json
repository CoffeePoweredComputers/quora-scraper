            "answer_text": "Hi there! This is a good question and an interesting hypothesis, that taking the new SAT will reduce the effect of coaching on scores. However, I have some additional considerations: 1. The last few months of the old SAT will see many retakes by less confident test takers \u2013 people who feel that they will not be able to adapt to the new exam. This could theoretically have the opposite effect. 2. Some of the first people to take the new exam will be those who are very confident (test whizzes and test prep professionals). 3. However, please keep in mind that the College Board employs robust statistical methods to keep scores fair from month to month, and will do the same to normalize scoring on the new SAT. When the SAT changed in 2005, and when the GRE changed in 2011, people who took the new exam actually did not receive their scores for a couple of months, so many people's scores could be used to construct a curve. They've got this on lock and you're not going to game it. 4. Just as old canards like \"It's easier to score well in March than in June\" or whatnot are (or should be) irrelevant to your individual decision making, whatever speculation you and I produce about this will have a negligible effect on the outcome of your test-taking. The effect of your own skill and preparation will far dwarf any effect of slight variations in the curve.  You should take the test you will be more prepared for and do better on, and don't worry about everybody else. My parents never could have afforded tutors or expensive test prep for me. I got some books from the public library and went into my room for a couple of months. You know what money can't buy? Motivation. Concentration. Hunger. Urgency. Rich kids mostly lack those things. You'd be amazed at how a couple thousand dollars in prep resources can just glance right off the privileged. Sit down, study, take your own notes, concentrate, fail at things and take that as motivation to keep going. Let's also consider that the new SAT has the advantage of many free prep resources \u2013 the \"blue book\" (4 practice tests with answer explanations) is available entirely online for free as downloadable PDFs or delivered online through Khan Academy. Khan Academy also offers additional free online practice. ",
