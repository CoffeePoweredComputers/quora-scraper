            "answer_text": "Re-registration in IGNOU has two meanings. Meaning 1: When you are taking admission for 2nd year or 3rd year, it is known as re-registration process. You have to pay for the course fees and you get re-registered. The fees here is the programme course fees which is divided in the equal number of terms. For e.g. if you took admission for BDP course, then the total fees is \u20b9 6000 which is divided into 3 parts, i.e. \u20b9 2000 for each term. You have to pay \u20b9 2000 as re-registration fees. Meaning 2: There is a maximum time period for every programme course. If you are unable to complete your programme course in the said time period then your registration for that programme course gets over. If you want to complete your course after the said time period, then you have to register for that programme course again by paying reregistration fees. I hope this satisfies your query. ",

            "answer_text": "It is the process of applying for next semester through online or offline to IGNOU by paying the define amount by IGNOU according to the degree. Re-registration allows you to fill up for next semester classes to complete the degree. There was also offline process, Don\u2019t know, Are they still accepting the DD at counter and not? So love to go with online also It\u2019s easy to do or comfortable. Also, If you due to any reason, Don\u2019t fill up for re-registration this time then you can easily pay in next semester. There would be no any problem just you will be back for 6 month. So avoid doing it. Here is the process\u2026 Step 1 : Go On Ignou Website at www.ignou.ac.in  Step 2  Step 3  Step 4  Step 5  Step 6  Step 7  Step 8  Step 9  Step 10  All done! Cheers! ",
