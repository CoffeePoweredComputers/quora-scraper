            "answer_text": "Yes, there is an actual scholarship! I scored 65% with 96.4% percentile, and got a 75% scholarship on tution fees (there is no scholarship on other things like labs and i-tutor facilities sadly \ud83d\ude41). With 75% of on tution fees, it amounted to 51% off on the total fees for my 4 years program. That is, the price came down from Rs. 5,00,000 something to Rs. 2,55,000. So, if you are interested in studying at Aakash, I recommend taking ANTHE, as it will help with scholarships at Aakash, as well as you will get to you your national standing amongst all students of India your age.
