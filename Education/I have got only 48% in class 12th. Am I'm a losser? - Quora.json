            "answer_text": "No, not at all. Grades matter but that doesn\u2019t define whether you are a winner or loser. I will give you my example here. I have always been a brilliant student till my 10th standard. But was not able to score well in my 12th. I scored 54.6% in my 12th standard. My rank in AIEEE was more than 350000. I lost all the hopes and even thought of repeating my 12th. But somehow in second counselling, got admission to an engineering college. In my first sem, i got a back in one exam. At that time, i felt very guilty and i was like what happened and how did I failed in an exam. Then, my parents calmed me down and supported me unconditionally. I sat down, relaxed and thought on what went wrong. I realized what went wrong. I took my lesson from the mistake and moved forward. I never looked back again and just put in all the hardwork and efforts to study. Thanks to god, and my parents, i topped my college during b.tech twice consecutively in two semesters. There is still a lot more for me to achieve and i have also just begun my career. Shared my story because it somewhat relates to the question. So, excerpts from the story is: Just think about what went wrong and take your lessons correct. It\u2019s just the beginning of life and career for you. You are here to prove that with your hardwork, perseverance and learning you will fight back and win. So, stop thinking all this, move on and act on where to take admission and shape your career accordingly. P.S: Don\u2019t listen to anyone who demoralize you and just think how you can make yourself & your parents proud. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, let's see. I know you must be aware of the innumerable motivation stories where people who were academically poor went ahead to do great things in life. So, listen to mine instead. Always had been a topper, amazing at everything, the star of the school. And then came 11th standard. Got caught up in messes people usually do in such age. Took medical stream, as i always wanted to be a doctor. Because that's what I thought would get me a good life and lots of money. Failed in 11th. Passed on grace. 66% in 12th. Such a shame to my parents. Got enrolled in B.Sc. Left it after a year. Got enrolled in a medical college on donation. Never joined it. Finally, got into NIFT. In the first attempt itself without any preparation at all. Just because my neighbour was doing it and I thought it was cool. The worst part now is, that I got two year backs here as well. Now, I am in my 3rd year and I'm doing exceptionally well. I still act lazy, and postpone things and fail in a lot of my plans. But then I get up and try again. Same thing goes for you. As long as you can get back on your feet again and try once more, you can never be a loser. The one who quits for forever and never gets up is a loser. Okay? :) ",
