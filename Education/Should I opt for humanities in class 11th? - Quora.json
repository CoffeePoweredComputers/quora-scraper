            "answer_text": "I want to start by saying that your approach towards studies is very narrow. Your high school and college education is for your skill development and not for creating you for a job. Still going ahead, Humanities students have a lot of job prospects now. With the growth of consumerism and the demand for services, humanities students are getting more and more jobs. Studying just your courses in humanities migjt not land you a job. You will have to work hard on your co-curriculars and vocational skills to get a good job, but there are a lot of job opportunities out there. I got 9.8 CGPA in class 10th and took humanities surprising a lot of my teachers. But now currently studying in my second year, I think I made the right decision. Humanities gives you a lot and not just grooming you for a job. It gives you an ideology, an outlook towards life and a sense of individuality. As per of jobs there are extremely lot of jobs Subjects like Economics, Political science, Psycology, English, History and Philosphy gives you a wide variety of jobs. You can become an economist, a consultant, a research scholar, musician, dancer, psycologist, historian, policy maker, a HR recruiter, sales head, a teacher(please never look down on this job), an administrative officer, a lawyer and idk a lot of professions. There is no dearth of opportunities in this field, you just need to develop your skills to become suitable for the job. Hope you make the correct decision :) PS - There is a diminshing growth rate in science fields. ",
