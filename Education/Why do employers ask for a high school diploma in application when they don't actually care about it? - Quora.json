            "answer_text": "Most of the time it\u2019s just corporate policy and a way to screen candidates (discourage those without diplomas, so they don\u2019t bother applying). Even if the manager doesn\u2019t care, HR tends to be concerned with who is being hired. If the job has specific qualifications, like a diploma, that was determined to be the requirement after money was spent and companies don\u2019t like to waste money. In other businesses, specifically smaller businesses, they tend to follow those requirements as well. They do so, because it typically means better candidates in general. These candidates are more likely to follow basic directions and communicate at a higher level than someone without a diploma (though that\u2019s definitely not always the case). ",

            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER!!! MY OPINION MAY BE OR TRULY IS WRONG I do not go into High school yet, but I am more than 90\u2105 sure that employers seek for an employees with a diploma 'cause they want them to be able to speak and work with co-workers. How you may already know, to get a high school diploma you really need to struggle and communicate a lot with teachers and classmates. So, by having a diploma you show employers that you will not have any problems with accustoming to a new work place. For people who are probably at rage 'cause of my grammar and/or vocabulary: Do not write hateful comments how awful I am in English. To not see this anymore you should write a CONSTRUCTIVE critique in the comment section. Or downvote this answer. Whatever you prefer. ",
