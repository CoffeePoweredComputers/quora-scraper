            "answer_text": "I am a third degree Master Mason and have been for 37 years. Among all the Freemasons in the world, a third degree Master Mason is the highest official degree you can possibly have and it is bestowed in what we call a \u201cBlue Lodge\u201d which are the most abundant number of lodges that exist. Freemasonry also has what are called \u201cAppendant\u201d organizations associated with Freemasonry, they include The Scottish Rite, The York Rite, The Shriners and other smaller organizations. These appendant organizations also have degrees that range from 4th degree to the 32nd degree in Scottish Rite. The York Rite has ten but I am not aware of what the Shriners have. And, there are also organizations for women, and young men and women. The thing I am most proud of are the charities the Freemasons support such as, everyday the Masons give two million dollars to hospitals all around America that care for children who have no medical insurance. Consequently, Masonic hospitals are called, \u201cHospitals without Cash Registers.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The term 'degree' could be Freemasonry's biggest confusion. All full-member Freemasons are Master Masons (3rd degree). There are two probationary degrees, Entered Apprentice Mason (1st Degree) and Fellowcraft Mason (2nd degree). After becoming a Master Mason, there are easily over 100 other degrees one may receive. None of these is higher ranking than Master Mason, they are just additions - think of them as toppings on your three scoops of ice-cream. You can choose to go for flavored syrup, or go for sprinkles, or both, or neither. The choice is up to you. Personally I have received many separate degrees in Masonic bodies, including: Entered Apprentice MasonFellowcraft MasonMaster Mason Installed Master Noble of the Mystic Shrine Hillbilly [one of my favorites] Mark Master MasonMost Excellent MasterRoyal Arch Mason Master Traveler (4th degree)Secret Master (4th degree) Builder (4th degree) [The Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite changes its degrees occasionally. I\u2019ve received 3 completely different versions of the NMJ Scottish Rite 4th degree.]Master of the Temple (9th degree)Master Elect (10th degree) Sublime Master Elected (11th degree)Master of the Ninth Arch (13th degree)Grand Elect Mason (14th degree)Knight of the East, Knight of the Sword (15th degree) Knight of the East and West (17th degree)Knight of the Rose Croix, Perfect Prince Freemason of Heredom, Knight of the Eagle and Pelican (18th degree)Brother of the Trail (19th degree)Master ad Vitam (20th degree)Patriarch Noachite (21th degree)Friend and Brother Eternal (26th degree) Grand Inspector (30th degree)Knight Aspirant (31th degree)Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret (32th degree) ",
