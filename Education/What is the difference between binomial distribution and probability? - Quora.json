            "answer_text": "The binomial distribution is the spread of all possible outcomes for a repeated Bernoulli trial. The probability of a specific event is derived from the distribution. If you toss a dairy coin 3 times and do it over and over again,counting the number of heads showing, the frequency of results will be approximately 1/8th of the time there will be either 0 heads or 4 heads, and 3/8ths of the time there will be either 1 head or 2 heads. If you did this an infinite number of times, those probabilities would be exact and you would have the distribution. Then, from the distribution you can determine the probability. For example, the probability of at lest one he\u2019d qould be 3/8 + 3/8+1/8 = 7/8 which is 1 minus the probability on ho heads (1\u20131/8=7/8). ",

            "answer_text": "The binomial distribution is the function that given a particular outcome provides the probability of that outcome occurring. You could say the binomial probability is the the result of that function given the parameters that describe the outcome whose probability is sought. ",
