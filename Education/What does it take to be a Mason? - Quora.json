            "answer_text": "What skills do you need to be a Mason? There are not strict guidelines giving prerequisite skills for Candidates to become Freemasons. That said, there are some basic expectations. What are they? You need to have have relative fluency in the language your prospective Lodge conducts meetings. Also, you must be literate as a lot of the ritual work involves studying and committing texts to memory. You also need a few social skills. For example, discussion of religion or politics is strictly prohibited in Lodge, so you need to be able to refrain from proselytizing or advancing your view point about religious and political topics. For many of us, that is a skill not an innate trait. Also in the social skills category, you should be able to function in a group of men socially and be polite. There are lots of opportunities to be jovial and laugh and joke or even be playfully rude, but you do need the skill to know when that is appropriate and when it is not. Some might think of that as a character trait, but I am going to put it forward as a skill. Intellectual skills? You should have an open mind and a certain amount of tolerance for ritual and repetition. Remember, the learning and teaching methods that are traditional preserved in Freemasonry predate widespread literacy. Freemasonry has advanced and now all the ritual is no longer passed only orally, but that was the case for many generations. I count having the patience to learn by repetition as a skill. Not requirements but to mention as good skills to have, if you are skilled at committing text to memory it certainly would be of value. Also an interest in history and some knowledge of the Judeo-Christian Bible wouldn\u2019t hurt, but isn\u2019t necessary. Some old Bible stories are referenced and used as allegory in some of the ceremonies. To join Freemasonry you need to have a proposer and a seconder. It is unlikely that you would be able to find those men if you did not have the requisite social and intellectual skills to be a successful candidate. If you didn\u2019t have the language or intellectual ability (and those are not high bars) whoever you asked would probably just tell you it wasn\u2019t the kind of thing you would enjoy. Clearly, if you can read this I am confident you would be considered literate and to have adequate language skills. There are few particular and specific other things necessary to be a successful candidate. Those are discussed in detail in my answer to \u201cWhat are my chances of being accepted as a Mason?\u201d I hope that was informative and answered your question. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "1) You must ask.  No one should ever ask you to become a Mason2) You must be a adult male (over the age of 18 in California.)3) You must believe in a supreme being that you hold yourself accountable to and some sort and an after life. (The after thing is often overlooked and ignored as some Jews don't yet are still admitted.)4) You must be of good moral and ethical character.  In California this also means that you were never convicted of a felony.  Even a recent DWI can prevent it. Drug or alcohol addiction is a nonstarter. 5) You must be recommended by two brothers of your lodge. (This isn't as difficult as it might seam.  Usually if you contact a lodge they will arrange to meet with you and after getting to know you a little, you will get your recommenders.)6) Although it isn't officially listed, you must be financially secure.  We do guard against those who would become Masons for no other reason than so we will financially take care of them. 7) In CA you will be investigated by three different people and if none of them finds you objectionable the lodge will vote on you.  It takes a unanimous ballot to be elected to receive the degrees of Masonry.  This may seem rather ominous but the vote is usually a \"rubber stamp\" of the investigating committee's decision.  I personally have never seen a no-vote. (or at least one that wasn't an accident) If you notice, everything I write here is based on California.   This is because each grand lodge is independent of all others and the rules change based on the jurisdiction.  Prince Hall which share jurisdictions also has their own rules.  (In CA we recognize PHA as Masons some jurisdictions don't) ",
