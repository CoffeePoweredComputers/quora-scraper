            "answer_text": "WEIRD. Especially if you have never interacted with south indian people. (don't worry the same happens with them too in a North Indian college) Just keep an open mind and observe students out there. First thing you will face is grouping. Especially if they feel you don't match their level (in any way be it studies, dressing anything) Second is (most important) language. This is really going to be problematic in any college of south for students of North. Third is food. Expect rice in every possible way. Its going to be your staple food along with sambhar. Only thing I can suggest is be friendly. If you feel anything as weird better don't show it by your face or body language. Try understanding them show them you are trying. Trust me once you manage befriending them you will really enjoy your stay in college. South Indians can be really funny and great study partners too. And once they see you as a friend then you can joke about anything (even joking about their language will not make you an outcast). All the best for you experience. Enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly a totally different kind of food than that in north. You will not like that taste at first. Most of the food are made in olive oil or coconut oil. So the smell is a bit different but you will adjust to it slowly. Secondly the language problem. I have been to South twice and I found that Hindi and English is not that much popular. They don't prefer these languages much. So you have to learn the local language if you want your 5years to go smoothly. Climate is hot with high humidity. Lastly, welcome to the profession. ",
