            "answer_text": "I was there , done that. First its not difficult ,and you don\u2019t have to so much practice like maths.we had lots of questions with diagrams like the heart related question etc.. I was good with diagrams and labeling them , so I used to go for questions with diagrams (although most of them had diag) . Make sure you don\u2019t leave any chapter, I know how we study , but at least cover some parts of that particular chapter which you are planning to toss out , may be some diagrams - so you can write something out of it (worst case scenario ) Diagrams, labels and time management . Biology papers are lengthy usually, So write enough but sorted specific Asked points. Don\u2019t worry about the margin, prepare for full marks . RELAX and give your best shot. Good Luck . ",
