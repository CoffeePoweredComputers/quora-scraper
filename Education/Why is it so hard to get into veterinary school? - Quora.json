            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I believe there are several reasons why they set the bar so high for entry to study veterinary medicine in most countries. Cost. Veterinary study is very expensive. So in order not to waste money teaching students that may not complete the course and graduate, they restrict entry only to those who really want it. Smaller classes tend to give a higher quality of education. It is better to be close enough to the action to be able to observe techniques than to be so far away that the instructor could be peeling potatoes for all you know.Oversupply. In the past older vets have complained that there are way too many vets being trained. This did several things. It created many people willing to work part time; suddenly there were jobs where a mother can do a few hours a week and still be there for her children. But the older vets could not forsee that. Oversupply does tend to keep salaries low. Vet clinics have popped up on every street corner, so it seems. This intense competition has restricted individual vets prospering enough to afford quality modern equipment and instruments.Any reasonably bright student can become a vet if they are sufficiently motivated. I knew one fellow who managed to get accepted on his 16th attempt. He was late 30\u2019s when he started practice and has done very well.Notice that I have not written that the entry standards are so high because the course is so difficult. It is not difficult. There is an enormous amount of material to absorb but none of it is difficult. I read somewhere that the average person uses 2500 words of English but vets have to learn an additional 4000 words. Sort of like learning another language!",

            "answer_text": "Of course, an obvious reason is because we tend to want doctors to be very intelligent and reliable, but many people believe that our standards are much too high. It is very likely that even a person who can\u2019t ace organic chemistry 1 and 2 will still be a good doctor if they have a passion and aptitude for investigative and practical work, and a strong desire to help animals. I think a large part of the difficulty is due to what I call \u201cprofession guarding\u201d. The administrators of veterinary programs are usually veterinarians and they set the bar high to keep the supply of veterinarians low, which in turn keeps their wages high. Demand for veterinary services is always high with the companion animal obsession in the developed world, so as long as the supply of veterinarians is low, salaries will continue to be relatively high. As far as being a doc goes veterinarians get the short end of the stick\u2014their schooling is likely harder than human medical school and they don\u2019t make nearly as much. The tendency to profession guard is probably driven by this fact as well. ",
