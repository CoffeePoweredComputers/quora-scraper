Patiala now enjoys the benefits of having the CM from the city.In terms of education - Patiala, any day.In terms of Infastructure - Patiala is better here with new projects coming up. The only thing it lags at is the Hostel facility.Overall both are like opposite sides on the same coin.Select one based on your location and city preference.If this helps, How is life in GMC Patiala in terms of the people and surroundings?
