            "answer_text": "Depends what you mean by \u2018reputable\u2019 . They are genuine and have to be earnt - but the \u2018test\u2019 part of the course I took was relatively easy. However, you have to go through each part of the programme to finish ( and earn the certificate) and it has to be done within a timeline. The content for the course I did was great, in-depth and relevant. I came away from the course a lot more knowledgable on the subject. However, it would be easy for someone to get the certificate and not really understand fully the content. ( in my opinion) . If you are wanting to do a course to learn something - then I would highly recommend it, if you are looking at hiring someone based on the certificate then I would ask a few pertinent questions to ensure they really did \u2018listen\u2019 to the course. Hope that helps ",

            "answer_text": "Cornell is a reputable University for sure. That said, I think currently their certificates would have a similar perception as a Coursera certificate (whether the course was taught by Harvard, Stanford, etc..). It\u2019s my opinion, that the value of these certificates is only going to continue to rise and rise. As the pace of change continues to escalate and job/skill demands continual learning, I believe these certificates are going to be a major factor in keeping people up-to-speed and play a significant role in job placement. Hope this helps some! Kevin ",
