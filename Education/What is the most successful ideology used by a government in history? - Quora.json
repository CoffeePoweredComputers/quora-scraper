            "answer_text": "Governments don't defer to \u2018ideology\u2019 as defined or coined by Antoine Stutt de Tracey. They defer to doctrine at best and naked practicality at worst. Whether rationalised or inexplicable assuredness, it doesn't matter; it's still blind. What was the most successful doctrine? I'd say the various forms of Marxism that held the Soviet Union together until 1989. Now, not only in terms of population, but because the Soviets were exporting tyranny. Ideology has never manifest as much of an organised movement. I'm keeping the flame alive whilst most people have abandoned the concept. I don't because the history of \u2018ideology\u2019 is just as interesting, in terms of why the statist \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018Left' wanted to destroy it. It goes to the origin of individualism in France and the United States. Thomas Jefferson was corresponding and met with Antione Stutt de Tracy. These were important people. They were snuffed out in terms of their influence by lesser men, who wanted to use social mandates to elevate their own importance at the expense of individuals. ",
