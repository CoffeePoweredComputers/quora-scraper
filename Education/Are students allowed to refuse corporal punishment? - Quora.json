            "answer_text": "In practical terms, in most US public schools that still use corporal punishment, I\u2019d say students can refuse. Forcing an uncooperative child or adolescent to submit would open the individuals involved to the possibility of both criminal charges and civil litigation. Even in the 1980s when I went to a Texas public school that made frequent use of the paddle, a student who refused was not held down. Refusal simply meant suspension. However, a disturbing case happened in San Antonio, Texas at a charter school in 2004. School staff used actual force to hold down a young woman, Jessica Serafin, who was over 18, and who, therefore, insisted she had the right to refuse corporal punishment. (Her mother had signed a consent form while Serafin was a minor.) Serafin suffered injuries during the paddling and tried to sue the school. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed her case, and the Supreme Court denied her case review. In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit essentially said that Serafin\u2019s rights weren\u2019t violated. [1] There are probably other cases in which a school forced submission. While rare, schools have denied students the right to refuse corporal punishment in the US, and federal courts have upheld their actions. Footnotes[1] Student Rights",

I'm only laughing cause I heard a guy started a school shooting afterwards. So if you don't believe that this is good for you and there just trying to help by all means leave and I'm not being sarcastic or cynical. Or do what my mom did and throw a chair at the teacher. You don't always have to be the good respectful kid, trust me it gets boring. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe we can. We just need to find a way to politely ask for another type of punishment, like doing several push ups, doing extra homework, organizing the classroom, writting an essay of why what I did was wrong. If that doesn\u2019t work (since i haven\u2019t tried them) then we go on the logical one. Check for a video to be made recording cellphone or anything that you could use to prove that you have been hit by that person on that ocassion. The second phase is blackmail that person\u2026 You know what? just find his/her higher up and speak up. If that doesn\u2019t work, then look for a lawer and demand no money, but that the EQ be removed, thus not allowing that person to work what he/she studied.(Exequatur, the code number they get when they earn their licence degree) I\u2019m a strongwilled person on justice matters, so i believe that\u2019s worse than paying for money.
