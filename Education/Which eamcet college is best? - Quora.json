Everyone know the bitter truth behind JNTU but no one told me. infact all the students who have studied under JNTU AFFILIATED college suffered from this trauma and I don't want the upcoming batches to get into this crap. Joining in it may affect your academics and mental health very badly. They make you convince that you're a below average student by giving just pass marks even for a bright student. trust me JNTU never fails to surprise students with the marks. ",
