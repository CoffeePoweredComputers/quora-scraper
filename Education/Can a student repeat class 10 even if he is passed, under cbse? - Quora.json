            "answer_text": "I would concern that passing marks are not just enough in class 10th. I would like to focus on two circumstances. First I you want to repeat class 10th your 1 year will be wasted but you would this time score good marks which will help you in future as marksheet of 10th is concerned very important nowadays in colleges and jobs. So doimg 10th again will help you for your future but on the other hand if you will not repeat the class you may suffer in the future, so I would consider that go for it again and this time focus for a target of 10 cgpa. Best of luck** ",
