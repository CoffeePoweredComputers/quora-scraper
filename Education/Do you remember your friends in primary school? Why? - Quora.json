            "answer_text": "This is weird. I lived in the same city for Elementary, Junior High School, and High School, and went through grades K-12 with many of the same people. Fast forward 20 years from HS graduation. At my 20 Year HS reunion, I easily recognized those students that I had attended Elementary School with, but had a very difficult time recognizing those students that I had met in Junior High or High School, although everyone had \u201caged\u201d equally. Now getting closer to my 50 year reunion, that dynamic remains. When I see one of my old elementary school friends, I recognize them almost immediately. High School friends I don\u2019t recognize at all. Recently I\u2019ve lost a couple of my close Elementary School friends, and as I reflect on our time together, I can vividly recall many memories of those individuals and most of our shenanigans, even though I haven\u2019t seen them in almost 45 years!!  Additionally, I think that elementary school is a much more innocent and less \u201cbusy\u201d time in life. You go to school and hang out with the same people before, during, and after school most days. You also \u201cshare\u201d a single classroom most of the day with the same people. By Middle School and certainly by High School, populations become much more diverse, schools are substantially larger, and classes shared are few. ",

            "answer_text": "I do. Partially, it\u2019s because I still know some of them, and was close with them for quite a while. I also didn\u2019t have many friends in elementary school. I wasn\u2019t bullied, but I was that annoying girl who either never talked or always talked, read the other fifty percent of the time, and would rather watch Nick Jr. than Disney until I was in fifth grade. The speech problem probably didn\u2019t help either. I never really moved, and all of my friends were from school because my parents were homebodies with a really big backyard and I had a little sister to play with at home. I was stuck in my own head or in a book most of the time, anyway. Basically, I didn\u2019t have many friends to remember, and I still go to school with most of them. There\u2019s one girl whose name I can\u2019t really remember, and we weren\u2019t even really friends, anyway. ",

Not all of them but some of them, like my best friend from second grade, we went all through school together and I was her Made of honor in her wedding, then we lost track of each other as well as many other classmates until Facebook came out. I'm still not as close to them as I was in school, but I love knowing about their life and every once in a while they have good advice. ",
