            "answer_text": "I wonder how someone can hurt the economy in simple terms\u2026 Oh, you mean that I need to use simple terms to describe how socialism fails and hurts the economy. I get it. It does not.  (note that the USSR started out in a much worse place than America, which was dominated by educated bourgeois people since the colonial days).  The USSR started out poor, but then it became the 2nd richest country in the world; it was a country that defeated the Nazis even after the massacres that the Soviets received. The military was strong enough to scare the shit out of America, and womens\u2019 rights were championed. Hell, the 40-hour work week was invented in the USSR from the start, while we still have Americans working 3 jobs every day just to pay for the bills. There was universal employment, so nobody was a \u201cparasite living on welfare\u201d. Welfare did not exist in the USSR, as most \u201cwelfare programs\u201d were rights in the USSR that those who worked (except children, elderly, and disabled; they got their needs even without working) had. China also succeeded. After the Great Leap Forward (which was mainly caused by drought), there was not a single famine. Mao educated the people, and he led the people to more social progress. Before Mao took power, women were forced to bind their feet.  After him, women were liberated, and they enjoy privileges women in \u201ccapitalist utopias\u201d (India, Bangladesh, etc.) still lack. Unfortunately, with the return of capitalism in China comes the return of exploitation, but China is more fortunate than in most countries near it. Socialism works. ",

            "answer_text": "Well why do you think it goes that way? Because socialism doesn\u2019t exist and is a term made to be an excuse for jealous idiots, thugs and lazy degenerates who aren\u2019t happy with their lives and need to see other people suffer because they are psychopaths themselves, who are too damn lazy to work their backs off on their own, and who want to seize the control over the society by force. You see, the idea of universalized social welfare under a supposedly \u201ccooperative\u201d, authoritarian regime is practically inconceivable. Those who preach it lie to the lazy dumbfucks who in turn aren\u2019t even genuine with their stand point and don\u2019t even wish to follow Marx because all they care about is being noticed by the society around them or being fed free Doritos for the rest of their lives. And what I mean by lie, I am referring to how they have you convinced that this demonic, serpentine, capitalistic tyranny is the opposite of their socialist utopia, only through which can we overthrow the rich\u2026 That is where they fail\u2026 They don\u2019t realize there are people like me who perceive communism/socialism according to how it is supposed to be portrayed which is literally totalitarian capitalism with Amazon\u2019s employees and private banks\u2019 shills replaced by armed soldiers who work for the so-called \u201ccomrades\u201d who live like kings alongside the former elites that helped them overthrow the previous regime, and the international trillionaires\u2026 while you get to work until your clothes fall off and you die a skeleton, with no one caring for you. Understanding this, it is clear there is no difference between the two because at the end you die and get shackled by high powers. Having explained the hypocrisy of socialism I shall continue so as to explain its economic failure. The core elements that we see in social countries are: universalized health care, money welfare, heavy taxation, mob-rule policy which discourages any form of discrimination, open border and birth right citizenship, all of which encourage people not to work and to stay home and get paid, and do attract international opportunists who will come running at your offer, with no shame on their part concerning how taxes are collected from your people to create those social Look-Afters. With the luxury of free market system gone or nearly totally eclipsed(by foreign businesses your commie govt invites or the commie govt themselves), people are left to no opportunity of flourishing in their private business or getting rich, so, knowing their lives aren\u2019t going to prove being more worthy than daily-bed-rolling, early rising, and giving what little they have earned to their children and nothing else, they finally realize they are just living economic units who inherently don\u2019t have their own will or the means to execute it into action at all and lose all the hope of self-making and fulfilling their dreams\u2026 ie they lose interest in life, in being \u201chumans\u201d. When your employers refuse to pay your bills once you have cleaned his apartment for him, will you not feel depressed and losing energy? The same thing here, people will lose the push and will seek help from the social cares they are guaranteed and at the end there will be no one working and the economy will collapse on itself, and we see this still unfolding infront of our very eyes\u2026 With this occurring, quite desperately, our rulers decide to get the migrants in so they can work on our behalf, but the problem is, they aren\u2019t stupid or gullible and demand as much or even more rights than we do, exhorting governmental health care for themselves, leading to massive economic collapse. After they(the govt) have screwed everything up, by inviting units that won\u2019t work to our countries in the wet-dreaming hope they will replace us in business systems, they will implement censorship and another policies to regulate the locals\u2019 freedom of expression in order make the disaster they have to face easier to manage on their part(when you limit the criticism to newcomers whom you expect to be the replacement workforces of your people there is a higher chance they will be happy and will not , through conflicts and misunderstandings with the locals, destroy your countries), and that is when shit hits the fan; people will get lazier, more stressful, crazier and more confused; the low-IQs who used to have nothing going for them in your domain will have to be accepted and will have more roles they don\u2019t deserve to be play, namely positions like lawyers, representatives, mayors, advisors, heads of institutes and etc, in order to keep the system running in the line, and partly as the result of the fact that real talented folks will likely get too paranoid of the shit that you have brought so they will not work for you; cultural changes will occur so harshly in an attempt to stabilize the society, in the way it will backfire heavily because you won\u2019t be able to cope with them; tax will get heavier and you will lose more rights towards properties because the govt is desperate for money, when you don\u2019t even work for them anymore; all the promised healthcare\u2019s will result in absolute disaster with no quality personnel treating you or willing to do it; promises will be broken and you will not be able not to hate the government though you know well they try all the cards so as to prevent this shit, thus heating the existing enmity even more intensely; and the dictatorship will grow stronger as they need to cope with the chaos going below \u2014\u2014 and finally you will end up like China, where they ran back to the most shameless form of capitalism: \u201c you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get to eat\u201d, with all the rich you hate still swimming in their pools and lying under the Sun in Fiji and you delivering French fries for McDonald under a 40 degree hot weather, all while the military and the elites(foreign and domestic) remain in full control. They couldn\u2019t afford their shit so they make you work for it and you get nothing but a totalitarian government who never had to be there in the first place\u2026. Clearly, it is a failure in marketing system everyone should stay away from\u2026 Do not treat your colleagues like living economic units but treat them like family and you will have a thriving future and so will your country. The little girls that serve food in your restaurants aren\u2019t \u201csomeone else\u201d, but are your daughters, the chef that cooks for you is your big brother, and your janitor is your son. That is how you should treat others\u2026 Without political system aimed to distribute(only among the poor because the rich get to keep everything) wealth and force you to live in poverty so others may live a bit longer you will still have a great workplace if you follow my instructions and your folks will love you more than ever and will feel like living and having unknowable futures to fight for, and for this they will help you out. Now you see why it fails, and why anyone preaching it is an idiot.  ",
