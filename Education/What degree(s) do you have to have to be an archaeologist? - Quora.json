            "answer_text": "Candidates for an entry-level archaeology position typically need at least a bachelor's degree, although the type of coursework completed is more important than the candidate's major field of study. Archaeologist candidates who major in anthropology must complete studies in all of the field's sub-disciplines, which includes physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology and cultural anthropology, in addition to archaeology. Candidates with an interest in ancient civilizations might pursue a degree in interdisciplinary studies, including art, history, ancient languages and theology. Candidates with an interest in a specific historical period might include studies in the architecture, folklore, oral history and linguistics of the period. Archaeologists who wish to direct field crews or work for the government typically need at least a master's degree, while positions that require significant expertise or leadership skills require a doctorate. Master's degree candidates can pursue either a master of arts or a master of science degree. Both educational paths require approximately two years of study beyond the bachelor's level in a specialized field of archaeology. A Ph.D. in archaeology is typically required to teach at the university level or to work as a museum curator. Archaeology Ph.D. programs usually require two to three years of study beyond the master's degree. Archaeologist candidates have a wide range of majors to choose from. For example, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management requires archaeologists to hold either a degree in anthropology, or a degree in a different major field of study that included studies in the history of archaeology, archaeology of a major geographical area, regional archaeology, theory and methods of archaeology, archaeological field school and related coursework in geography, geology, history, environmental studies, scientific writing and surveying.

            "answer_text": "Archaeology is a multi disciplinary occupation. Obviously an archaeological qualification is a great stepping stone, but nothing is more important than field experience, and lots of it. History offers a clear and discernible pathway, but you need to ensure that you are studying the period and civilisation in which you are interested most. If your archaeological ambitions are broad, my advice would be to study whatever subject interests you most. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s chemistry, maths, physics, or art, any advanced study is an advantage, because as an archaeologist you will be trying to put sites and finds into both an historical and social perspective. From many years of practical experience I can recall a number of situations in which another perspective was invaluable in interpreting what initially seemed a \u2018cut and dried\u2019 interpretation into a completely different solution. Keep on going with your \u2018favourite\u2019 (and best) subjects, and when you are ready leap into archaeology. As soon as you can (i.e. tomorrow) join your local archaeological society, if there is one, and get some field experience. Archaeology is not what you might see in films or read in books; there is a lot of hard physical work involved involved in removing layers of soil or other debris to uncover the layers in which you are interested. Meticulous record keeping of the stratigraphy is essential, so any exposure to geology is an advantage. To sum up, professional archaeology is not a pathway to fiscal magnitude. It is a very rewarding and stimulating occupation and you will meet some amazing people. I hope this doesn\u2019t put you off, we need archaeologists to help us become better civilisations by building on the successful achievements of our predecessors. ",
