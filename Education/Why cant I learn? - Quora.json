            "answer_text": "Forget about you spelling -I have a PhD and am a notoriously bad speller. Isn\u2019t that what spell checker is all about or a dictionary although today, I would say any browser can get you the correct spelling of anything. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I learn?\u201d is such an open ended question. People learn in four different ways, auditory, visual, tactile, and kinesis. Or to put it simply, listen, read, feel, and doing. Tactile (feel) and kinesis (do) could be put together. It may also be that you have ADD, ADHD or dyslexic. If you haven't looked into these aliments, don\u2019t call yourself a \u2018difficult learner\u2019. If you know you have a problem, you can correct for that. For example, I have two problems, I\u2019m slightly dyslexic and I have had migraine headaches my entire life 5 years young to\u2026NOW :). I have had to overcome these problems and the migraines in particular have not been easy. I went through my MSc in one and a half years and my PhD. in two and a half years. Migraine every day so, yes, I was into some strong meds throughout\u2026however, I did get through. While I have migraines to this day, I have never let them stop you. DON\u2019T STOP LEARNING. And don\u2019t listen to people who want to talk about your language skills, yes, in the long run you will need to address that but for now just learn the language. In my heart, I know everyone can learn AND this is IMPORTANT -we learn differently, we learn at a very different rate. You get out there and follow your \u2018different drum\u2019 and learn what you can, what you want, and in your time. Good luck ",
