            "answer_text": "YouEDIT. :VERY LENGTHY ANSWER sorry if any grammatical mistakes Now alright here listen my story then u decide what is best for you (meaning which subject to choose) I can't remeber the date so Day. One :in class 10 : I took the leap of faith (meaning took a random subject) It was going like hell I was writing notes reading each and every single line though already done I was underlineing and many more( by the way it was history and civics i'll tell you in the end why) Day 5 : i was like sooo inspired by the acts I am doing like I can get high ranks mean cuz I was NEVER like that before Day, exam resultday :defenitely my marks decreased BY a LOT cuz I was totally blacked out because of civics it was a very VAST subject (u know the guys studying in icse ) Did the inspiration die like that day DEFINETLY A BIG NO It kinda doubled Yet I couldn't get full marks but hey got 67/80 Compared to the previous exam marks 34/80 It was the exams before the final board exam \ud83d\ude2c But I took a step back and realised what was the blockage of me getting full marks Simply it was that I prefer more hard topics than lengthy ones I mean the hard questions which have one word answer By that. Yes u can say I am SUPER LAZY Here I literally by the heart hated this subject and couldn't get a grip of it : Telugu (second language) it was the WORST But and mildey griped subjects are Yup history and civics. And geography and yes biology( it gives me criples cuz I hate seeing organs ,by eye which u totally know why I hate it) Remaining they i ricked it like hell Approx got a out off (almost got a 80/80) physics and chemistry and maths even commerce and loved English. But it was hell alot tougher Then I realised I love physics and chemistry (chemistry more cuz we can end it by one word and physics cuz it's more logical) Now I decided after the pandemic we are having complete the other board exams (2020 covid -19 pandemic)   U gotta say chemistry and physics were alot logical this year and I never seen a previous year paper this hard (meaning not stright forwardor u can say time consuming or hard to think ) I got to know this by seeing the faces of my friends after exams lol \ud83d\ude02  Image sources : google Oh by the way I chose H/C cuz I got VERY less marks First get to know which field are u better at (i am not talking about subjects) which way u read and study smarter or harder choose the subjects and take your leap of faith WISELY my friend Signing off ",
