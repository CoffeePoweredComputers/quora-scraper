            "answer_text": "Computer Science. Cause I learnt it. And am still learning. AS I have not done the same for other subjects I cant tell for the others. I think it depends on your taste. Just because Someone said subject X is the best doesnt mean that it is the best. Everyone is biased and no one has read all the subjects. So I don\u2019t believe there is any impartial answer possible for this question. So my partial answer is CS. Hope that helps. ",
