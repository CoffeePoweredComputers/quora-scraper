            "answer_text": "There is no straightforward way of answering this, because you simply do not provide any of the necessary information that would make a sensible answer possible. Much would depend on what other subjects you are going to be taking for A level, and what you want to do after A levels. For a start, you tell us in your Profile that you are a student in China, and I answered a Question from you over a year ago about perceptions of Chinese students in the UK. But I don\u2019t know if you are now coming to the UK to do A levels (I think you must be about 16 by now), or if you are at a school in China where it is possible to take A levels there. Let\u2019s assume you are now 16, and are coming to the UK very soon, to do A levels here. Most sixth form colleges would advise you to take 3 A level subjects, plus English as a Foreign Language, and Further Maths as one of only 3 A level subjects is a risky choice. Unless you specifically want to do Maths at university, doing Maths with Further Maths plus just one other subject can be a problem; some universities prefer to see three completely different subjects, and except for Maths at university as your main or only subject, Further Maths is not needed. And Further Maths is a tough subject; lots of students who get really good grades in straight Maths get very ordinary grades for Further Maths. It can make your overall results look much less good than if you just took (for example) Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The only other situation where you might need it would be if you were taking (for example) Physics, Economics and Maths; you might need to do the Double Maths approach, to give you the Mechanics side to support the Physics, but the Statistical side for the Economics. The other point I would make is that even if your English is good, studying in English, in England, is very different from the way you will have been working in China. The whole approach is very different, and that can be quite demanding just because it is so unfamiliar. Do not insist on overloading yourself. One thing you may find surprising is that your timetable in the UK will have spaces in it where you do not have lessons. This is quite intentional, and entirely normal. You are expected to do a lot of independent work outside classes, and to manage your free time well; it is all part of preparing you for university. Do not try to insist on having extra classes on your timetable to fill up the gaps; you do not need them. I hope this is helpful; as I said, I am having to guess at your situation. If it is noticeably different from what I have assumed, please tell me, and I\u2019ll try again. ",

            "answer_text": "Further mathematics at A-level is one of the toughest courses to take. This is because you must finish the entire regular A-level mathematics in one year so you\u2019re able to do further maths in the second. If you think you\u2019re mathematically able enough as seen by your GCSE grades then I would go for it. Universities find it very impressive and it helps your chances a lot when applying for literally any course they offer cause it shows you can put in the effort and are a hard worker. If you want to study mathematics at university, then further maths is a must. It is not essential to apply for physics or engineering but it is still preferred if you do. My advice, take 4 subjects at the start including further maths to see if you are comfortable with the workload. If you feel like you can handle it then drop one of the other subjects and continue studying further maths so you still have 3 A-levels at your disposal. Remember further-maths is considered a completely separate A-level subject to maths so this is safe to do. Depending on which science you want to do, I would pick from biology, physics or chemistry for your third. It all depends on which university you wish to apply to. Make sure to check the entry requirements on their website to be sure. I hope you found the answer useful and good luck when making your decision. I wish you all the best. ",
