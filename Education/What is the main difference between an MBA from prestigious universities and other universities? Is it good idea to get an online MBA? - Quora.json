            "answer_text": "A top MBA can school can give you the following: Quality learning through top notch professors and a diverse batch of peers.Alumni network which is usually helpful on a long run and sets benchmarks for growth.Brand name which opens a lot of possibilities in career in a long and short run.Personal transformation - good time to improve on communication, leadership and academic potential.This does not imply that everyone does an MBA from a top B-School. Getting an admit from top schools is not an easy task. One should do an MBA if they are interested in a business career path. For lot of professionals, an MBA is not a value add, hence it does not make sense for them to spend 1\u20132 years with a huge financial investment. For someone, who is looking at only the academic learning, an online course should be good. ",

Accredited, established MBA programs at universities are valuable. Online MBAs are better than no graduate degree, but they are inferior to any classroom, instructor-led MBA program. ",
