            "answer_text": "Yes, you can learn programming without going to class. Here I will tell you some tips. You can follow these to learn programming. Choosing a Language You can start learning with any programming language. So, you can start by asking yourself what you want to achieve by learning the programming language. This will help you decide what kind of programming you should try. Read some basic tutorials for different languages. If you\u2019re still not sure which language you should start learning, read some tutorials for some different languages. If a language makes a little more sense than others, try it to see if it clicks. Grasp the basics for long term benefit As fundamentally as they may show up from the start, programming basics constantly need to start things out: the better you understand them, the simpler it is to adapt further developed ideas. If your fundamentals are clear, then you can learn languages quickly. Code by hand PC screens become more slender, hard drives are lighter. Programming languages all the more dominant. However, coding-by-hand still stays one of the best strategies to figure out how to program. Be it on a whiteboard or note pad, coding-by-hand requires further alert, exactness, and plan behind each line of code. Creating Your First Program One of the first programs writes for any language \u201cHello World\u201d program. This is the first and simple program you need to try. The program teaches programmers the syntax for creating a basic, working program for the first time, as well as how to handle the displayed output. By changing the text, you can handle the basic data by the program. Check the syntax The syntax is the way in which language is written so that the compiler or interpreter understands it. Each language has a unique syntax, although some elements can be shared in multiple languages. Learning syntax is essential for learning how to program in a language, and what people often think when thinking about computer programming. Experiment with changes Make changes to your example programs and then test the results. By experimenting, you can learn what works and what is not quick by reading a book or guide. Don\u2019t be afraid to break your program. Learning to fix errors is a key part of any development process. Start debugging When you\u2019re programming, you\u2019re always going to fall into bugs. These are errors in the program and can be shown practically anywhere. Bugs in the program can be harmless, or there may be major errors that prevent the program from compiling or running. Reducing and correcting these errors is a major process in the software development cycle, so get used to it quickly. When you experiment with changing basic programs, you are going to come up with things that don\u2019t work. As a programmer, you have the most valuable skills to find out how to take a different approach. Comment all of your code Almost all programming languages have a \u201ccomment\u201d function. It allows you to include text that is not processed by an interpreter or compiler. This allows you to leave short, but clear, human-language interpretations to leave the code. This will help you to remember what your code is actually working. Practice regularly Mastering a programming language takes time above all else. Even a simple language like Python, which can take only a day or two to understand the basic syntax, takes a lot of time to really become efficient. Like any other skill, practice is the key to becoming more efficient. Try to spend at least a few time each day in coding, even if it\u2019s only for an hour between work and dinner. Ask for help There are a lot of programming communities dedicated to specific languages or topics. Finding and participating in the community can do wonders for your learning. These communities are generally seen as a place of collaboration and discussion and not simply Q&A. You will gain access to a variety of samples and tools that can help you in your learning process. Reading other programmers code can inspire you and help you understand concepts that you haven\u2019t mastered yet. Just don\u2019t read the example code and run it too Reading the test code is not enough to see how it works. To make an actual understanding, you need to run the code and tinker with it. With the increase of comments and instructions, the test code is bundled to be effectively edited by the reader; However, in reality, it is quite difficult to represent without preparation. Persing is not equal to the compensation and attempting to write the code yourself, or if nothing else is running, will adequately encourage the learning process. Take breaks when debugging While bug removal, there is no guarantee that you will fix the problem. To avoid this, it is best to move away from the bug for a few hours and come back with a new approach. Not only is this a guaranteed way to solve the problem, but you can also save yourself from hours of headache. Evaluate some online courses If you need more power on your learning plan. You can go for online courses or online classes. In any case, different online classes show the same programming language, and it can be very difficult to understand which is exactly what\u2019s worth your time and cash.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Here\u2019s my advice: I strongly recommend a good teaching language. Many of the common recommendations (Python, JavaScript, C, Swift, etc.) are industrial languages that were never designed, nor intended, for instructional purposes. They all carry a lot of baggage that can distract a beginner who should be focussed on learning the basic programming concepts. The best teaching language, in my opinion, is Smalltalk. It was designed by Alan Kay and his team at Xerox PARC for teaching programming to children. The language is supremely simple. Its syntax can fit on a post card!  And yet, Smalltalk is unbelievably powerful. Read Why Pharo Might be the Future of Software Development. After you\u2019ve learned Smalltalk programming, picking up subsequent languages like Java, Python and JavaScript is a breeze. That\u2019s because you now have a solid foundation.

So i recommend you t learn python programming from the Online Courses. I can also recommend you to learn Python programming from the Online Courses. The Best Python Online Courses are #1 Python for Everybody Specialization by University of Michigan #2 Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3 In course one, you will learn all basic for Python and you will also learn how to write a program in computer by using Python. Instructor will teach you about advanced Python 3 programming.In course two, instructor will teach you the core data structure in Python and you will also learn how to use Python in build data structures like tuples, dictionaries, lists.You will learn how to access the web data by using Python in the third course. You can access the data and can also read the data by using the APIs. You will learn how to work with the data formats like JSON, HTML in the Python.In course four, they will teach you all basics for data based design for storing the data and also you will learn the basics of SQL (Structured Query Language).In course five, Charles will teach you by using Python how to build retrieving, visualizing data and processing.",

            "answer_text": "Most certainly. To give you some context I started coding (very simply, like we all do!) when I was around 8\u20139ish. Back then, I started out on an Intel 286, with a classic DOS prompt. The most I ended up doing was BASIC. With some time under my belt - many hours of Prince of Persia, and several 5.25\u2033 floppies\u2026 I advanced to Pascal. Fast forward to the present - the barrier to start learning to code has been reduced a HUGE deal. You can straight away start learning Javascript -Learn JavaScript Online | Code School (https://www.codeschool.com/learn/javascript) which is pretty much the lingua franca of the modern web. I\u2019d suggest spending sometime picking up the basics; get yourself a good book (read through Amazon reviews) and really make an effort. Once you\u2019ve spent some time, try a different language say Ruby - Learn Ruby & Ruby On Rails Online | Code School Rinse and repeat - this time, I\u2019m throwing you in the deep end - Some basic ANSI/GNU \u201cC\u201d - Learn C - Free Interactive C Tutorial Then progress on to C++14/17 - Beginning Modern C++ (C++11/C++14) | Udemy You also want to learn some Python, Go (Go Lang), Rust, Elixir\u2026 \u2026and guess what, if you\u2019ve come this far - you\u2019ve got a wonderful 20+ years ahead to dive in deeply into these languages - where you\u2019ll certainly have favourites, and then broaden your horizons into other verticals such as virtualisation, DevOps, app development, AI/Machine Learning, and the list goes on. Oh you also MUST pick up an Arduino and learn some basic microcontroller \u201cNinjut-su\u201d. Thinking at the \u2018register\u2019 level, especially in ASM (Assembly), will ultimately determine the sort of developer/engineer you\u2019ll become as well as give you an insight that others may struggle for years to acquire. Last but certainly not the least - pick up Linux. If there\u2019s one key bit of advice I could impart to every newbie, 9\u20135 cubical code maestro, or Comp Sci student \u2014 Make Linux your sole OS for at least a year. I\u2019d actually even take it to the next level - do not run X11/gnome/KDE. Just live in a pure shell (or tmux ideally!)\u2026 Another must have skill is `git`, which is a MUST in today\u2019s space; working with Github/Bitbucket should become second nature, without using a \u2018fancy GUI\u2019 - just from the command line. You might ask yourself, what about University degrees such as Comp Sci - well, you have to also _study_ the science of Computing as well, theory such as SOLID, CAP etc etc the list goes on. This is what makes top-end Engineers standout from the rest really; but it doesn\u2019t mean that those who may struggle cannot grow with pure-elbow grease and \u201cfailing\u201d a lot. Do it for 20+ years\u2026 Try some of these and you\u2019ll be on your way to becoming a pro in no time. ",

That\u2019s how I learned, and that\u2019s how I still do it. Can you do it without any external reference, book, website, online course, or similar resource? NO. You will ALWAYS have teachers. You will ALWAYS learn from someone. The fact that you never get to meet them doesn\u2019t change the fact. So, whether we like it or not, there\u2019s always SOMEONE teaching us. Many things have change since I learned how to program. Many people still suggest to start with a \u201cstudent friendly language\u201d like Python. I strongly disagree. Not about Python, but at starting with the programming language. If you have no knowledge of programming whatsoever, your best starting point is Karel the Robot (google it). It\u2019s simple as a kid\u2019s game, but excellent to explain what programming is about. Once you learn the concepts, you can jump into a programming language. Learn the trade before the tool. Karel the Robot is so good, Stanford University uses it to teach new students. Once you understand what programming is about, you can jump to learn a language. There\u2019s where Python is great. But it\u2019s not your only choice. Good luck. ",

Formal training doesn\u2019t hurt, but it\u2019s really not where you will acquire the most useful skills. All of these are extremely helpful: Books, Web sites, code examples, discussion boards. But it\u2019s most helpful to just do it. Grab some sample code, sit down with a free IDE, and just start typing it out, modifying it, trace it line-by-line, and try extending it, especially to do something it was not meant to do in the first place. For example, Guess the Number game is a very common and relatively easy game to write. Grab some free sample code for this game, and try changing it: Extend the range, including negative numbersChange it to only allow even or odd numbersChange it to Guess the LetterKeep a temporary (session) high scoreKeep a permanent high scoreStart small and don\u2019t try setting outrageous goals, like \u201cI want to create the world\u2019s greatest MMORPG.\u201d Start with something very small and something that may appear to be simple.

            "answer_text": "Programming today is pretty easy to start by yourself without a lot of academic input from formal education. The journey from being a non-programmer to a programmer in pretty easy. In terms of material, all you need is an average computer (does not have to be top of the line, just anything that's not 5 years outdated will do) and an internet connection. There is however the personal input of time and effort, like there is in learning a new language or sport. Some motivation also helps. The 10000 hour rule applies : if you want to be a really really good programmer, then spend 10000 hours programming. But like all other hobbies or interests, it has to start with the difficult first step, and the effort to make it into something joyful. For me, things are joyful when I see them as serving some purpose while doing them. For example I feel working out in the gym is tedious and boring. But ask me to play some active game instead, and I am all for it. Making it fun can be easily achieved by starting with making a simple game or coupling programming tasks with writing Raspberry pi apps that do something. The key is not to get bogged down by the plethora of languages in learning to program. Most languages are either functional or declarative. Just choose declarative languages for starters (like C, Java, C++, Python etc) and run with it. ",

If you are completely new to the field, I find that just reading and practice will only take you so far. A good online course can ease your entry into the field and might help get acquainted with concepts before you start reading books on it. With that said, when i started with programming about 4 years ago, i started with python. I used Coursera's Intro to programming with Python taught by Charles Severance of university of Michigan. It's now taught as a speciality of 5 courses. You can apply for financial aid for each individual course and you can take them for free. Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) | Coursera Once you are through with aleast the first course, I would suggest using Automate the boring stuff which is a free book online to get good amount of practice: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python This would take you about 3 months in all. If you start tomorrow, then by the end of March you would have some sort of grip on major programming concepts. Once you have some control over these concepts, switching languages just becomes a matter of semantics. ",

Learning anything require a few elements (outside of what you have to bring to the party). The first is some information on the subject you wish to learn. Ideally organized into structured lessons, but that is not an absolute requirement. The second is a way to apply what you are learning so you internalize the information and be sure you really understand it.  The formula is simple: read about a concept, then practice it until you can think in that concept. If you run into a roadblock, that is where having real people available really helps. A different point of view often is all you need to get past a block.  Learning this way may not be as effective as school, but is certainly possible. ",

It has taken me a very long time and though I can barely remember the kind of logic I used on some of them, all it took was Google.

If you want to learn a specific language, google it! There are loads of people that have written good, lengthly tutorials on almost every language you can think of. If you want something more formal that gets into some more advanced topics, check out the programming courses on OCW.

I began programming at an early age by copying BASIC programs from some magazines. I think it was almost only way for a small-town boy in 80's like me to learn how to program. It was really fun, but I couldn't acquire any systematic knowledge even after a decade. I had to learn how to program again after I began to work as a programmer.

The only way to learn programming is by crunching out code and solving problems (whether they are toy problems such as in-place reversal of a linked list in C++, or real problems that you envision). What you get by going to class is hopefully, access to a good teacher who will introduce you to the abstract concepts, as well as guide you through learning how to reason about complex problems that programmers need to be good at solving. Much of it can be self taught, of course, and a class taught by a bad teacher would often require you to study everything on your own. The risk of being a self taught programmer is that you were never exposed yourself to the abstract reasoning, mathematical thinking aspects of computing. Can you teach yourself algorithms? Yes :) Do you have the patience and self discipline to do all of that on your own? Therein lies the challenge. ",

But the most difficult part is debugging.      Most people who start doing programming leave programming because lack of debugging skill. While doing programming the programmer need to learn debugging also. This will help the programming to master programming and do programming consistently.       If you are really serious about programming and if you need a help for an industry person to start then I can help you. ",

However, what\u2019s best for me is not best for you, as we are at different places in our lives and aiming for different things. Many books can be had for free at your library. Also, many older edition books are available for free online. Take a look at the Quora questions related to your question. I particularly like many of the answers to, What's the best book and language to learn computer programming? I particularly like Brian Yoder \u2018s answer. When trying to choose between which of the many free books you\u2019ve found to study, my suggestion is to go to Amazon -- not to buy from them, but to read the book reviews. Online tutorials and references are also free, and \u201cGoogle is your friend.\u201d (Just skip over the ads.) However, often learning on your own can be frustrating. You may get stuck and need some live feedback on how you\u2019re doing. For that you need programming friends. If you don\u2019t know any, search for a computer club in your area. ",

Learn the language(s) used in the tool(s) in the process. (And buy the books written by the folks who developed those tools.) Then start learning how to write new code from scratch in the same language - study good practices (tools, structure, build chains & packaging, testing, documentation). Wash, rinse, repeat with a language that uses a different programming paradigm. Somewhere along the way, take a few introductory courses on EdX. ",

It\u2019s available on the Google Play store and on the App Store. It is the best method to easily adopt any language. It has a bunch of different choices and has a simple way to learn them slowly. Also, on your profile page on the app, it shows your proficiency in each language and a bunch of other stats! Coming from someone who (eventually) wants to go and get a job at Google, this is a great step to learn coding languages in my opinion! Good luck and have fun on your journey!\u201d Hope this helps, let me know if you learn anything or need anything else ;) ",

I myself learned how to code, just as the question implies, from mostly-free resources. The most recommended websites IMHO for my ( Javascript ) and other programming languages are Learn to code - for free | Codecademy and SoloLearn: Learn to Code. If you like more advanced text tutorials, TutorialsPoint - Parallax Scrolling, Java Cryptography, YAML, Python Data Science, Java i18n, GitLab, TestRail, VersionOne, DBUtils, Common CLI, Seaborn, Ansible, LOLCODE, Current Affairs 2018, Apache Commons Collections is your way to go even for some advanced stuff. Then, for specific issues, StackOverflow - Stack Overflow - Where Developers Learn, Share, & Build Careers might be useful.
