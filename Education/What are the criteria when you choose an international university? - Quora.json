            "answer_text": "I will address an international student attending an US university as an undergraduate: First one must get admitted. Less than 10% of the US universities will provide any substantial financial aid to international undergraduates and of that 10%, 90% will hold asking for financial aid Against you in the application process. Therefore, being able to pay, in full and in Cash anywhere from $180,000 to $300,000 for four years of undergraduate education in the USA is almost essential for most international undergraduates to study in the USA. Once admitted (and there are self-imposed quotas on international undergraduates), then the freshman must: take the I-20 form from the college to the nearest US consulate (Outside of the USA) along with proof of ability to pay and apply for a F-1 student Visa. Once the student visa is approved, the applicant should plan on arriving in the USA at least one week prior to freshman year classes starting to get acclimated to the region. Of course this assumes that the person has researched the college completely and has visited the college before accepting the admission. It is exceedingly important that the freshman candidate fully believe that she/he is a great fit with that college and vice-versa. And fit has more to do with the undergraduate student community, the local region and the regional climate than it does with the academic reputation of the university. The international freshman should know that she/he is not allowed to work off-campus for the first academic Year. However, she/he is allowed to have an on-campus job of not more than 20 hours per week. NOTE: I strongly recommend an on-campus flexible hours job of not more than 12 hours per week. That is very doable within the 168 hours per week and the studying requirements for a freshman. Good to make some spending money and to meet other people and increase acclimation to the USA. NOTE: Half of an undergraduate education is maturing from a raw teenager into an Adult. Half. Remember that and participate in some activities with your fellow undergraduates. Graduate Student: Coming to the USA as a graduate student, means you are a Full Adult and are looking to enhance your knowledge in a niche area and to work as a research employee. There are No self-imposed quotas on international graduate students in the USA, and many are fully-funded. It is Far Easier to be admitted as a fully-funded graduate student in the USA than it is to be admitted as an international freshman in the USA. ",

            "answer_text": "I am answering this question with a scope only limited to MS. I may not answer this question perfectly but I will definitely try to give my best possible answer. Always understand what a good university means to you. The requirements of a research student are not always similar to that of a Student going in a professional track. After knowing the type of degree you want, i.e., either a thesis track MS or a non thesis track MS, you will start looking for universities.  If you are on the research track, go through the active research happening in the university in your field of interest and understand the research requirements and the professor's requirements. Contact the professor stating your research interests and asking him for a suggestion on your admission. If he is interested in your interests he will recommend you to apply. You will work closely with the professor once you get admitted to the university.You can get the list of universities in Google. This track may not give you a high paying job at the end of your course but, what you gain is much more than that! 2. If you are on the professional track, search for universities with students getting high paying jobs. These universities are almost located in international cities, industrial areas, silicon valley, etc. Check the student teacher ratio of each class and the proximity of an international city such as New York or LA.. Check the number of companies in your field that are set up and being run in that area. You will always end up with a job that more or less satisfies you. Always check the departmental rankings rather than the university rankings.A good research university may not always contain a rank as good as a normal university and vice versa..
