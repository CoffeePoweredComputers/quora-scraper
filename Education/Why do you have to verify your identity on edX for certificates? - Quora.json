            "answer_text": "The value of certificates or any credential is in being able to demonstrate that the person who has the certificate is the person applying for a job. It is possible to hire someone to do the certificate work for you, then you could claim you had knowledge that you did not have. This would make the certificate worthless because employers would never know if the person had the qualification or not. Identity verification is designed to provide some credibility that the person doing the certificate is who they claim to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Just a guess, but they probably want to maintain these as an official record that people can use on resumes and be verified. I would guess it is a good, or great thing! It means those certificates might have real value long-term. I always use the free options and audit courses because I just want to learn what I can, but for people building up their skills from a ground level, these things can be great at presenting what real effort is being put in on what professionally.
