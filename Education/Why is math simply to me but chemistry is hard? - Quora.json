            "answer_text": "I am in the same position, and I would bet that we're simmilar ages taboot Obviously I can't be sure about your case, but I can shed some light on why I find maths easy and chemistry hard, and possibly even help you improve the situation (I think) I find maths easy because it is logical. This isn't a purely shedlon-style 'autistic' stereotype; I think it genuiney makes the subject easier. This is because, if you're good at it, the logical nature of maths makes it very easy to extend knowledge, especially at a high school level. For instance, if I know how to answer one type of question on a given topic, I'm quickly able to answer them all. This is something you seldom get in other topics, except things like art and music, because maths is a skill based topic in a knowledge based school system. This means it gets much easier if you're just good at it. Chemistry, on the other hand, is fundamentally knowledge based. You can be as good as you damned well please at chemistry, but if you don't know the definition of a lewis base then you don't know it and you will loose marks. On a related note, the way (at least in England) that you are supposed to answer questions can be counter-intuitive. In maths, you just need to make it so somebody else can see what you've done, which is easy, because you just did it. In chemistry, on the other hand, they want you to hit four points, in the right phrasing, in as many minutes. My chemistry teacher even encourages us to bullet point answers at some times! Don't get me wrong, there are logical aspects to chemistry, and logical thinking will certainly help you, but its not enough, and for smart people like yourself, or weird maths nerds like myself, this can be a stumbling point. Knowledge assimilation is easy at GCSE because there isn't that much anf its all pretty simple, but at A Level (and beyond) it ramps up quickly. Ultimately, you need to learn the way of assimilating knowledge that suits you, and this is really important to do, especially if you want to go to university. However, a few things that have helped me: 1. Learn the logic If you know why everything you learn is true, chemistry becomes 1000x simpler. A good teacher will help you do this, and so will asking good questions. Good questions are about asking stuff that you need to know, in a way that's open for the teacher, that doesn't alienate the rest of the class, thats rigorous for the teacher but also for you. Don't blithely accept stuff: if there's something you don't understand, or couldnt explain from first principles ask. Do it straight away (as long as your not rude). Don't feel embaressed to admit what you don't understand 2. Learn the exceptions I find that, because I like to remeber things systematically and logically, rather than in some kind of memory palace, there are often certain things that trip me up. Exceptions to sensible-seeming rules. Things you have to consider in one area but not another. Little logical steps that get left out because the class isn't ready to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Often the logic will stay with me pretty immediately, but the exceptional points will get me over and over. Learn them, explain them, conquer them. 3. Flashcard the details This is something that'll always be personal, and you need to find your own way of doing, but for me flashcards (especially spaced repetition software like Anki) work really well. More generally, you just need to knuckle down and memorise stuff. I know its dull, and to a maths-headed person it may seem pointless, but it will help so much. Not only will it help pass tests, but often having knowledge on the tip of your tounge helps you make connections faster and learn new stuff more easily. 4. Learn to answer well Partly this is arbitrary nonsense decided by the exam boards, but I do think it can be a valuable skill Ask your teachers how to set out your answers. If you lose marks on a question, don't only ask what you should've said instead, but also how you could've said it better. Learn when exams want descriptions and when they want explanations, and when they want something in between. Learn to distill your ideas clearly, neatly, simply. Do past papers, mark them yourself, and get your marking checked. Read mark schemes, try to write perfect answers, and get your teacher to check them. I know it sounds weird doing this a long time before exams, but it lets you do it slowly, means you'll already know it when you come to revise, and often helps boost your confidence as you work through a course. Confidence is king. If this sounds unspeakably dull, try helping/teaching other students, explaining what you learnt every lesson to your parents, or even answering Quora questions ;) Teaching is an incredible learning tool 5. Learn ahead Find an area that you find interesting and that makes sense to you and learn something at a higher level. Surf the internet. Go to the library and pick out a university text book, or a college one if you're younger than I assumed, or one from a year or two ahead if you're older. Learning advanced stuff, actually learning it, helps reinforce the structure around your knowledge, helps keep your passion for the subject alive, and helps boost your confidence. I have a friend in chemistry who, every single lesson, will rattle off some crazy nugget of knowledge about hybridised orbitals or superacids or whatever and, given how insecure and anxious she is normally, the energy and confidence it gives her is palpable. Sometimes your teacher will help you with this, sometimes they want you to focus on core material, often dependant on how youre keeping up, but I would recommend it to everyone Sorry for rambling, I wanted to crystalise where i am with my own learning becore going back to school from the holidays. Hope it helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "That's interesting because I find math to be difficult but chemistry to be fairly simple. Math has always been presented to me in such a way that I find myself wondering what the point of it is.  It's a lot of memorization of formulas and very little real life application.  I often have to trick myself into staying awake because my brain isn't a fan of paying attention to things that it sees as irrelevant.  Chemistry on the other hand, is a subject that's tangible enough for me to wrap my head around.  We're dealing with real substances and real particles, not a series of made-up equations.  It's easy for me to visualize each object in an equation and apply the rules.  I don't reach a specific answer by doing this, but once the math is done, I can intuitively determine whether the answer I've reached is appropriate.       So even when I'm sucky at math, I can do well in chemistry by: -Understanding the fundamental concepts entirely -Realizing there is a motive behind each question and identifying it -Visualizing each part of an equation as if they were in front of me -Applying my general knowledge of what should happen -Making sure my answer is cohesive with my predictions ",
