            "answer_text": "I might start by reading Mere Christianity by CS Lewis, which is an excellent read. I\u2019ve recently been revisiting it and it\u2019s quite enjoyable. Here are some other possibilities in terms of category of reading: Read a quality book on the Christian worldview which considers the key questions one should ask.Read a quality book on the Resurrection and/or historical Jesus. You could consider Lee Strobel\u2019s A Case for Christ, which is impressive in terms of it\u2019s content and it\u2019s proof. It\u2019s a decent introductory text for these issues.Perhaps read a book on answering objections to the Christian faith. This is certainly the way to deal most directly with the issue.Or perhaps an over type book like Tim Keller\u2019s Invitation to Skeptics. His Reason for God is decent as well.Consider talking to someone who you trust who understands the overall issues.Pray about it. You may not get instant answers. Be patient.Read your scripture. Stay engaged in church and Christian community.There are free Christian apologetics training courses available online. I really like Cold Case Christianity\u2019s videos. I\u2019m guessing his free classes are pretty good too. Check him out.To me, the challenge is all atheist arguments on one level or another assume one or more of the following ideologies at an assumptive level: (Reductive) MaterialismScientismRelativismReductivismSkepticismAnd if they don\u2019t, they likely engage in some kind of fallacy: StrawpersonConflationCategory MistakeFalse Dilemma/Framing ErrorMany also don\u2019t fully think of the opportunity cost of a particular practice. They engage in (reductive) skepticism versus say: \u2022 Free will \u2022 Inferences in philosophy \u2022 Institutions or Authorituy, when Institutions and Authority are an inevitable part of life. I hope that helps. If you have any more questions, feel free to email me on Quora. It\u2019s also worth noting I run a Space on Worldview Questions, so overlaps your question. You could also follow me, if you want to learn more. I hope the above helps you \u201cdoubt your doubt\u201d in a better way. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply, talk with our Creator and tell Him what your doubt is! Ask Him to give you understanding to take away your every doubt, and to build greater and greater trust in you, for Him. After you talk with Him about these things, trust that He'll answer you! If a person is actually Christian, they are \u201cSaved & Reconciled\u201d to our Creator, and at that moment in time, God the Holy Spirit enters into our heart/core and never leaves us, but guides, directs, and protects us. Thereafter, our first mission, is to learn our Creator's Word to us, that's vital and one of those vital reasons is that, as we hear His Word, we will start to realize His Word proves itself true, and removes our doubts, one-by-one! Our Creator also has His own unique & astonishing way AFTER we are \u201cSaved & Reconciled\u201d to Him and His protection, to bring about answers to dissipate our doubts. It's an astounding thing! Anyone can easily learn what our Creator's Word says and does not say, by taking notes while listening to any of the CERTAIN scholars listed who are incredibly accurate & interesting to hear on TV & YouTube mostly on Sundays from around 7am to 1pm: David Jeremiah, Jentzen Franklin, Adrian Rogers, Benny Tate, Samuel Rodriguez, Tony Evans, Creflo Dollar, Gregory Dickow, Charles Stanley, Rick Warren, John Hagee, Jonathan Hagee, Franklin Graham, Luis Palau.

            "answer_text": "Ironically, the first step in dealing with your doubts is to actually acknowledge that you have them. No one has all the answers, and so it makes perfect sense to question your beliefs regularly, in an effort to improve them, and to move closer and closer to perfect truth. By laying your doubts out on the table, you are able to expose them to what we might call counter-doubts, i.e. reasons for doubting the doubts. I have found that each time I have started to consider what I would believe if I found some of my most cherished beliefs to be false, the replacement ideologies start sounding really hopeless by comparison. The whole process usually has slight impacts on my overall belief system, but on the whole, my faith in God (for example) comes up stronger than ever. ",

I deal with myself not allowing me to hate anyone\u2026. life is hard, we know. ",
