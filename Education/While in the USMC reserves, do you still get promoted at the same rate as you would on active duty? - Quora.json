            "answer_text": "All the answers from the Devil Dogs below are correct. I was a 4 year Lance Corporal (and dues paying member of the Lance Corporal Mafia ;) ) as an 0311, which is Rifleman. The backbone of the backbone. 3/5 Kilo Ooh Rah! Anyway, after my time was up I went and did the Reserves for another 2 years. My \u201cDrill\u201d site (Drill is your 1 weekend per month, 2 weeks in the Summer obligation) was right by the Airport, Lambert Field in St Louis. It was a Navy/ Marine base there. More Navy than Marines. When you\u2019re in the Marines there are 4 Divisions. 1st (the best Division) is based out of Camp Pendleton California. The 2nd Marine Division (great bunch of guys to fight with but real chip on their shoulders because they weren't assigned to the 1st Marines) are there based on the East Coast at Camp Lejune (known for its poor weather and drinking water that will literally poison you to death\u2026all jokes aside Lejune is polluted). Third Marines are in Okinawa Japan. The 4 th Marine Division is the Reserve Division and they\u2019re spread out at Drill Sites throughout America from Detroit, Miami, LA, St Louis etc. When called up for war the Reserves Assemble at a Combat Warfare School to train up like 29 Palms and arrive there to form up from all over America. One thing about promotion is that you may not end up being even operating in your MOS (job you\u2019re trained for). I was an 0311 Rifleman in the Fleet. Arriving at the Navy Marine Corps Center in St Louis (which is a Detachment of a Weapons Company..or was at the time of the 3rd Battalion 24th Marines) I was assigned a new job. 0352 Anti Tank Missleman. So now with no training I\u2019m handed a Dragon Anti Tank missile and my training was basically\u2026\u201dyou point it that way\u201d and dont take the sights off until the target is dead\u201d.  I had no problem with it. They were very amusing to fire and most weapon systems are made to be idiot proof so. No big deal. The problem was I was the lowest trained Lance Corporal there working in the wrong MOS. Odds of picking up Corporal in the Infantry are somewhere on the order of 1 in every 8,000 Marines. Picking up Infantry Corporal performing a job other than your MOS? Nil. If you sign up for a 6x2 enlistment and do 6 years in the Marine Reserves then 2 years inactive \u201cready reserve\u201d you will be a 4 year Lance Corporal. There will never be a reason to promote you. There will be Corporals coming from the Fleet with CAR\u2019s (Combat Action Ribbons) that will be taking that Squad Leader Job. They won\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d you as a Lance Cooley to fill a billet. You will make all time in grade promotions as usual just like out in the fleet. Time in Grade are guarenteed promotions given when you reach a certian ammount of days at the previous rank. After X amount of days as Buck Private you will be made Private (one stripe). After another year or whatever it is you will be promoted Time in Grade to Lance Corporal\u2026one Stripe (Chevron) with crossed rifles below it.   After Lance Corporal there are no more Time in Grade promotions. You can only be Meritoriously Promoted to Corporal (the lowest of the NCO Ranks). This will generally never happen in garrison\u2026in the Reserves. Especially an Infantry Reserve Unit. If you\u2019re in a POG job that is technical and important you may very well be promoted Meritoriously many times while serving only in the Reserves. The Majority of Reserves are 03\u2019s (infantry) so the vast majority are never promoted. This includes Officers. Usually the worst Officers at the bottom of the class at Quantico are sent to command Reserve Units. The best Officers go Fleet Infantry, then a bit lower scores go Artillery, then Supply\u2026then Reserves. Officers in the Reserves are career and are desperate to get out of that Division. Their vehicle is your sweat and tears. Rank in the Infantry in Reserve or Fleet isn\u2019t easy to come by. Especially in times like these when were drawing down from 200k to 174k in numbers as the War on Terror winds down. Only the best of the best will be retained in Tier 1 and 2. ",

            "answer_text": "Not always. Reserve cutting scores include members of the drilling reserves and those on inactive reserves in the entire MOS field. If you were an 0311 as a reservist, you\u2019re competing with all the reservists in the 03xx field of you rank (ie, to pick up Cpl-Sgt). Cutting scores for promotion will usually be higher than active duty because there are less slots in the reserves than active duty. Active duty, you only compete with those in you exact MOS field. As an 0311, you\u2019re only competing with those in the 0311 MOS (ie, to pick up Cpl-Sgt). If you do what you are supposed to do, then you\u2019ll increase your odds of getting promoted sooner. Sometimes it\u2019s purely a number\u2019s game though. ",
