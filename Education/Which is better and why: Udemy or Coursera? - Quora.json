            "answer_text": "That depends on what you\u2019re looking forward to. When it comes to price, now that Coursera has a fixed monthly payment option (you pay US$50 to make as many courses as you\u2019d like to), I think it\u2019s all a matter of deciding how much time you\u2019re willing to spend on online courses every month to see which of these will end up being cheaper to you. Udemy may be cheaper if you take courses at a slower rates or in smaller quantities, but not so if you have lots of spare time to invest in lots of courses. However, the differences aren\u2019t only in price and payment methods. For example, whereas Udemy has courses developed by individuals, Coursera has mainly academic courses from top-notch universities. This may seem like a huge advantage for Coursera, as you know, *CERTIFICATES*, but it comes with a few problems. For instance, you will never see an university offering a \u201cMicrosoft Office Course\u201d nor anything like that. Of course, universities teach their alumni to use this sort of software, but always as part of some bigger subject. So, if you\u2019re looking forward to understand a software that may be useful to your career, be it Excel, Autocad or Photoshop, it may prove hard to find the right course for you in Coursera. Even though I\u2019ve learnt many functionalities of Excel by doing courses related to developing models to simulate business scenarios in Coursera, this is different from being taught how to use the software per se. There are many \u201cadvanced\u201d and/ or even \u201cintermediate\u201d things on Excel that I may not be able to use, even if some tools that I\u2019ve been dealing with are considered advanced. And anyone who tries to use Coursera to learn how to use a given software is going to experience these problems. Of course, this more \u201cfocused\u201d way to learn software has its bright side too. If you know exactly what you\u2019re going to do with Excel in real life, you\u2019re only saving time by skipping everything that isn\u2019t useful for your specific case. But Udemy proofs to be a better contender if you want to learn how to use a given software in a more complete fashion. And this is only an example of how these platforms are different from each other and of how both of them can be the best for you in different situations. ",
