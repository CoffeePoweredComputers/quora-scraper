            "answer_text": "I'm a freshman CS major at CMU (which you should be considering! the courses available, faculty, resources, and so on are incredibly cool), and in brief: I got into web design, wanted to build more complicated and even cooler stuff, and realized I enjoyed programming. Obviously, CS comprises a lot more than that, and I got quite interested in exploring things like HCI, cryptography, NLP\u2026I didn't feel that any other discipline would lead to the kinds of really cool jobs and research and topics that I enjoyed. Further elaboration below. In (perhaps) unnecessary detail: When I was a young whippersnapper (seventh grade), I started learning HTML & CSS because Neopets <http://www.neopets.com > allowed users to customize certain profile/shop/&c pages. (I still maintain Myspace and Neopets raised a generation of amateur web designers, because my story isn't all that uncommon.) I started following the web design & development blogosphere online and got foolishly obsessed with trying to emulate what the pros could do, and then at some point it wasn't enough to make static pages or lightweight Javascript animations\u2026so I enrolled in a few CS classes at my high school so I could learn to program the really interesting things. During this time I religiously read the business & technology section of my newspaper, and I started following news about tech & internet companies (startups, acquisitions, generally cool innovations and product launches). And then I could go bike around Palo Alto's downtime and see all these newsworthy names in real life. It felt very cool to be embedded in the Bay Area tech culture and I ended up modeling a lot of life goals around it: wanting to work at certain companies, build certain kinds of apps or things, learn about certain ideas, being able to affect the future and people's lives in a certain way. CS and its applications just seemed incredibly fascinating. It appeared to be the most challenging out of the other fields of study I was considering, and I just wanted to build really cool stuff. Mostly virtual. (Un)helpful flowchart: Neopets \u2192 web design & development \u2192 programming \u2192 Bay Area startup culture! \u2192 \u2026I guess creative writing isn't that profitable. My other life goal was to be a much-beloved novelist or screenwriter who could touch the hearts and minds of the masses with prose. But I felt that I needed a formal education in CS, and I could always do writing on the side. ",

            "answer_text": "A while ago I would have given you a long answer involving a middle school attempt to read through my local library, the thrill of the math history section, GaiaOnline, a small online community of gamers and hackers, and a professor with a touch-sensitive pen in a bookstore. But last summer I reread Diana Duane's children's fantasy novel High Wizardry, and realized that answer is longer than its moral is worth, because the wizard Dairine Callahan made me a computer scientist. Rereading High Wizardry, I realized this book was the first place I had encountered the word \"hacker\" to mean a skilled programmer who can bend computers to their will (as opposed to the action-movie definition). It was the first place I read about programming as something one can do for fun. It was the first thing that told me that computer science (and hackers) were cool. It was the first place I heard about even command line interfaces! Nontrivially, it was one of the first -- and sadly one of the only -- stories that depicted a female hacker as cool, something to aspire to, and not just a sex object in leather. (Come on, people, this came out in 1991! Can't we do better?) I think once I read that book, it was only a matter of time. Whatever innocent stumbling occurred after that really occurred because I wanted what lay at the end of the road in computing: a journey around the Universe with an all-knowing backpack computer, the thrill of personal creation, and the smugness of one who doesn't HAVE to do the boring kind of math because they have something else to do it for them. TL;DR: A wizard did it. ",
