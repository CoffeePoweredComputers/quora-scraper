            "answer_text": "As a former teacher and now a private tutor I have made my points on homework before and why I have never agreed with it. Here goes: 07:30 - Wake up for school. 08:30 - School begins 05:00 - School ends 05:30 - Child gets home 06:30 - Child has been fed now homework 08:30 - Almost time for bed after the chores it\u2019s oversimplified but my point is that these are children and how are they expected to actually learn anything when got six hours or so information on a variety of subjects is hammered into them and then at home more information is given. When do they get time to soak up what they have been taught. In my mind children are not \u2018learning\u2019 anything but what are doing is remembering them. When they finish school it flies off like a spider web in a hurricane. What makes it worse are those children who\u2019s parents think the child isn\u2019t already doing enough and they get chores on top of that. I\u2019m not a great advocate of chores for children, because for five days straight they don\u2019t get time to be children or to soak up what they were taught during the day. I might be alone in my opinions but that\u2019s nothing new. But think on this. If a child is LEARNING then why should they need to revise. It rote learning and not teaching. People have said that they need homework to get through the curriculum. Here\u2019s my take. When I was in school I took history which I liked. One drawback was that the majority of what was taught was agriculture and farming, weaving and other mundane issues that one would never use. I self taught myself far more interesting stuff. However if teachers were permitted to shorten how much information was needed on The Spinning Jenny and how arable farming works they could easily get through the curriculum in school. As I stated I\u2019m a tutor and I have not once given my students any ounce of homework. That\u2019s the \u2018short\u2019 answer ",

            "answer_text": "No. It has never been a good reason to give a daily homework to students. Students have to learn so many subjects in addition to outside-classroom activities such as sport or private tutor. However, it does not necessarily rule out that homework is not important. Homework is designed to help student review the material and fortify students\u2019 understanding over the material. Homework can also be used to train students to think deeply and critically over issues. ",
