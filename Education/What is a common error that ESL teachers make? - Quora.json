            "answer_text": "Focusing too much on form (language correctness) when their learners aren\u2019t planning on doing a language exam/test. I\u2019m not saying that correct forms are not important. But when someone wants to be able to use English while traveling abroad or communicating with their foreign colleagues, grammar and pronunciation drills shouldn\u2019t be at the core of the learning process. After all, it\u2019s much more practical if you, for example, can explain a thing/concept you forgot or don\u2019t know the word for rather than all the time getting the 3rd person sing present simple -s endings correct. In my experience, too often, teachers forget that functional language, is not less important for English learners if we want them to be able to USE the language outside the classroom, and not just merely cite the irregular verbs.

            "answer_text": "Not focusing on accent correction . They need to be shown explicitly how to use their lips to form certain sounds. They need practice, not a teacher who just lets it slide because she/he understands. There are actual mouth muscles which need to be developed to make sounds in varying languages and this has to be taught. Those who are really advanced need to be corrected in the moment when they make small errors. ADVANCED students only. While they are talking I keep a pencil in my hand and when there is a serious error that impedes understanding . I tap once one the table to stop the person and wait and see if he or she can correct it. They always thank me for that because they say, \u201cNo one ever corrected me before\u201d. ",
