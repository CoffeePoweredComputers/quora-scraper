            "answer_text": "I think I am qualified to give an unbiased answer to this question since I attended MIT for college and Oxford for a MPhil. Many years ago, I was accepted to Oxford for the PPE. I was also accepted to MIT, Princeton, Columbia, and Chicago, among other top universities in the U.S and U.K. If I hadn\u2019t gotten into MIT, I would have chosen to attend Chicago, Princeton, or Columbia before choosing Oxford over the next best alternatives\u2014Berkeley or Northwestern. There was a time when the choice would be obvious. I think the world has undergone a paradigm shift since the time of the British Empire. WWII was the catalyst for this change, and for good reason. You can read up on all the nitty-gritty of how top scientists and scholars from all over the world travelled to the U.S in droves, and how some of these scientists, whose research were conducted in schools such as Columbia and Chicago, had arguably put an end to the war. The U.S grew incredibly rich as a result of the war. The Cold War also induced massive investments into all branches of scientific and technological research. By the end of the Cold War, the world was starting to use the word \u201cHarvard\u201d as a generic noun that meant \u201cvery prestigious university\u201d. i.e Beijing University is the Harvard of China. Oxford and Cambridge held their reputation, but a part of that mystique started to wither. American universities and their enormous endowments and resources were starting to develop a monopoly over all of modern research. They were no longer scallywags and hill-billies, but people who were sophisticated, educated, and also winning Nobel Prizes. America and her liberal immigration policies was the magnet for talent escaping war-torn Europe, and former Soviet citizens escaping the tyranny of communism. Oxford and Cambridge are esteemed universities still. But as Stanford is to Harvard, England just isn\u2019t \u201ccool\u201d anymore. That coupled with a curriculum that is inflexible, seriously lacking in emphasis of practical applications, and hopelessly archaic, creates a very hostile environment for any prospective world-changer. I was excited to study at Oxford when I graduated from MIT. As someone from Singapore, there is a great deal of reverence for Oxbridge that is still held by the older generation of British subjects. After I graduated from Oxford, I realised that I am far more impressed with myself that I had graduated MIT, than the fact that I have a MPhil from Oxford. Oxford made me feel like a smart kid, but MIT made me feel like a prodigy. The \u201ccorrect\u201d academic culture was completely absent in the U.K. People in MPhil or PhD (or DPhil) programmes even at Oxford were relaxed, and relatively cavalier about their studies and whether or not they can get a proper academic job. They seem to expect that things will work out, and prefer to continue doing whatever it is they have been doing, i.e having fun and studying for exams at the eleventh hour, instead of using all that free time to work on a proper job market paper. In the U.S, prospective academics have a \u201cpublish-or-perish\u201d mentality, whereas this urgency is non-existent in the U.K. Somehow, the British understanding of a PhD is just taking a few courses and passing a few exams, before starting to think of their dissertation after they are done with their MPhil. Contrary to popular belief, the first two years of an American PhD programme is not entirely coursework. 5 years is a basic requirement to socialise students to the culture of academia so that they can write a worthy JMP, which would determine their placements. One of the DPhil candidates in Oxford whom I have spoken to told me that Oxford shows a high level of favouritism towards their own graduates for faculty positions, so he shouldn\u2019t have an issue getting an academic job in the U.K. It\u2019s no wonder few Nobel Prizes in Economics have come from British universities. I come from a junior college in Singapore that is the number one feeder of Oxford and Cambridge in the world \u2014 Raffles Institution. When I was applying for college, I had 5\u20136 different close friends with similar profiles to me who were applying to the same colleges I was. All 5 of my friends got into Cambridge or Oxford, while only one of us got into MIT \u2014 me. This anecdote was not meant to illustrate any sort of qualitative difference between Oxbridge and American universities, but it does have an interesting point \u2014 elite American colleges are exclusive and extremely inaccessible. Whereas most high-performing students can stand a realistic chance at Oxbridge. American universities will only become more popular in the near future as Britain loses its influence. Stanford\u2019s acceptance rate has already gone under 5%, so has Harvard\u2019s. In the era where almost everything we use can be traced back to a teenage hacker in an American college dorm, there are very few things more appealing. ",

            "answer_text": "Many reasons. But they all essentially stem from the fact that after World War 2, Europe (and Great Britain in particular) faded as the center of power and influence in the world, and America\u2019s empire rose in dominance. With that, its academic institutions also became more powerful. Before the 20th Century, an Oxbridge degree would be considered more prestigious than a Harvard or MIT. Here are some specific factors to consider: Harvard and MIT have endowments that dwarf Oxford and Cambridge. They are quite literally the best educations that money can buy (along with other Ivy Leagues in the U.S. like Princeton).Objectively, MIT outclasses Cambridge in STEM fields. This is largely because of MIT\u2019s dominance in engineering and applied science, neither of which have been strengths of Oxbridge. But even when comparing pure science, MIT is likely the winner because it has just so much more money to fund research.Comparing strength in \u201cfuzzy\u201d scholarly pursuits, like the humanities, is more subjective. I would say that Oxbridge will always have some advantage because of its very long history of being the centerpiece of Anglo culture. However, in terms of how education is performed, Harvard and the American Ivy Leagues focus on providing a much broader traditional liberal arts education, intended to create well-rounded educated individuals aspiring to the ideals of the Renaissance Man. Emphasis on the word traditional, which is very ironic, because this model of education was originally directly copied from Oxbridge. In other words, today Harvard and Yale carry the torch of an education model that Oxbridge (for whatever reason) mostly left behind.",
