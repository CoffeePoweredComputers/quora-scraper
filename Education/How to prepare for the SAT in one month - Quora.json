            "answer_text": "One month is not a lot of time, but if you are really determined and disciplined, you could easily improve your score - maybe not a full 200 points, but certainly any improvement is good. Your first course of action is to make sure you are using OFFICIAL SAT practice tests, either from the College Board website or from the official College Board SAT prep book. You do NOT want to waste your time using non-College Board materials. So here is what I would suggest you do, since you have limited time and I assume a large course load, to boot. You need to take one practice test, timed and mimicking the conditions of test day - this means uninterrupted and with as few distractions as possible. Answer EVERY question, even the ones you don\u2019t know - but MARK each one you guessed or were 50/50 on it. Also mark which ones you second-guessed yourself on. Once you finish the test, go over all your answers and specifically focus on those you either a) got wrong, b) guessed on, or c) were not sure about. These will be the ones you will have to work on in order to improve your score. Now ask yourself WHY you got each question wrong or why you had to guess/weren\u2019t sure about. Here is a great summary of how to review your mistakes: The Best Way to Review Your Mistakes for the SAT/ACT After you\u2019ve identified why you are making mistakes or running out of time, practice some of those strategies (I suggest one section at a time) before trying another practice test. Once you feel you\u2019ve got the hang of it, try another full, timed practice test, again marking anything you didn\u2019t know, guessed, or second-guessed on. Repeat the process above, identifying your mistakes, correcting, etc. The goal is to NOT keep repeating the same mistakes, NOR creating new ones. The more mistakes you correct by your next practice test, the more likely you are to raise your score, provided you do NOT create new ones. You could easily go through this cycle three, even four times over in the next month, if you set your mind to it. By doing this up to four times, you will hopefully be able to address most if not all the causes of your mistakes, and will most likely raise your scores. Good luck! ",
