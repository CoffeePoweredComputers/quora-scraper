I am telling with increasing order of budget, skills and popularity:- on your own youtube channel, private tutions quora, private school/institutions, On paid websites like chegg, clarity, unacadamy etc on paid applications like linkedin learning, udemy, youtube kids, byju`s etc. If you develop and improve your skills side by side, than with help of a consultant you can make your personal brand. This way you can now charge more. After attaining much of wealth, you can go for bigger institutes for yourself. This takes time. Other shorter process requires lesser time but little more money. Contact me if you want to discuss about that also. ",
