            "answer_text": "Every business has gestation period, so business has to be sustained during this period and this period can even be frightful if you are working with shoe string budget. Normally a businessman will estimate this gestation period and accordingly first arrange finances for worst case scenario during this period i.e. he/she will assume no profit in this period but rather invest from his own resources. For coaching this period can be around 3 years. Also it will depend upon connectivity of your coaching institute i.e. should be easily approachable by public transport from various location, number of coaching institutes on similar lines in few Km radius, stability of faculty at your institute.Coaching has two aspect namely academic and business. I can safely assume academic delivery is good as you say your results are good, but that is not all for business. For business you will have to develop good interpersonal skills like cracking some jokes or some interesting incidents during lectures, don't unnecessarily scold students, be friendly with them, try to understand their difficulties as a friend. Time to time keep on giving one or two challenging problems such that students/faculty of other coaching class can't do it or have difficulty solving it, this way your institute will get highlighted and then you can boast about it. Every month you can give attractive awards like recharge coupons, movie tickets etc. which connects with students day to day life. Become very friendly with bullies, as they have ability to hold masses and at times party with them. If possible keep a very trendy hostess that will act as honey to business. Once your are established in business then you can further experiment. ",

            "answer_text": "When we do something for a living, we need to focus on the foundation first. ie Before building floors, the foundation should be made strong. The idea is to let the students understand that you're unique and special. It's not about results. students don't care about results now a days. but when a physics sir, explains the theory of light with an exciting real world example, they get attracted. And getting a good number of students is not a big deal, getting a small number of students who stay with you is a big deal.  Till you attain this stable set of students you need to revise your way of teaching by noticing the way students respond to your teaching and Advertisements are not at all needed (my opinion) because a student who is attracted to your way of teaching will bring all his friends to your class within the next few days and the strength increases steadily and this number doesn't fall. Because it's not some random traffic of students. these students came to you after realizing your talent. Period. ",

First let me tell you how to promote your coaching classes in terms of mobile brands for better understandment Apple-create your own strategies like your own materials,new way of teaching and innovative ideas. Samsung-Copy everything what a top most coaching centers does(place your coaching name ) MI-again copy other strategies and let the fee or cost be low.students wil promote your institutions(you need not do marketing ). Oppo/Vivo- just keep on marketing-(newspaper,social media etc) till it becomes household name. One plus five-Just be perfect at what you know-if you know maths then teach it like other institutions does not teach(deeper learning). Nokia- dont follow the old techniques .it wont promote you. Create a website,give low fees compared to other coaching classes i hope you will easily understand what i have told.thank you for the question. ",

If you are thinking that they might be getting good marks just because they were your student, you might be wrong in it. They studied hard. Don't you think?  You don't need to publicize yourself in newspapers, pamphlets and all that. word of mouth is much more convincing when it comes to education. If a student is taught well, he/she will refer you to another one and the chain will continue. What you need to do now? You may need to change the way you have been teaching so far. Be more approachable, teach the way in which they can understand. Give practical examples while teaching, trust me it's the most emphatic way to make someone understand. Make them practice more, not by being a bully but in a tender way. Take regular tests. Make the classes more interesting and interactive. Ask the students about their doubts, give regular feedback. Last but not the least, think of it as a duty, not only a way of earning bread and butter.  Take some time alone, place yourself in your student's shoes and try to realize what is missing in your teaching. You will definitely get an answer. Hope I could explain myself. All the best! ",

It won't be hard to find out the reasons. I am sure that there won't be one. Now after knowing why are your students leaving, you improve on those aspects.Some tips that van be useful Improve your communication mediums. Use videos and interactive things.Interact with parents. Talking to parents is always useful.Teach new and different concepts eg. Vedic mathsOrganise sessions on topics like goals, time management etc.If you don't provide worksheets then start providing printed material.Think of each session like a TV serial episode. The episode end always excites us for the next one. Make sure the students are excited for you class the same way. ",

If there is any problem correct it before students decide to leave you. Keep your fees low in the beginning so that you are able to attract students. You can work with average students and get them decent scores.  You can even associated with some coaching center in the initial stage and later on move to working independently. ",
