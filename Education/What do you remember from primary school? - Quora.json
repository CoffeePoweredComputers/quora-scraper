            "answer_text": "I remember learning quickly that I was not one of the \u2018in\u2019-girls. That my preference for books over people lost me friends. When I finally got my nose out of a book, and tried to actually make friends, I never fit in, I never figured it out (I still haven\u2019t but I\u2019ve improved). I remember writing cringe-worthy stories for an informal class tabloid. One of which was actually read by our teacher. Think tiny little papers folded up, scribbled on in sparkly pens, coloured in. I still have a copy I believe. I remember changing schools, trying to get away, and trying to accept validation that I actually was smart enough, that it would be an improvement. I remember awkwardly attempting to socialise with the other girls that had gotten into Gifted Education Programme, and were thus changing school too. I remember exchanging phone numbers with them, promising to keep in touch. (Those promises weren\u2019t kept, on either side.) I remember learning that there was a divide between boys and girls and that crossing that divide made you weird. I remember trying to find a balance, and then just not giving a hoot and befriending some of the guys anyway. (Or trying to, some didn\u2019t want to befriend me because I\u2019m a girl ysee.) I remember once again never having a clique, and just clinging to one of my only friends at first, until I realised she found me annoying and had been telling people that behind my back. I remember finding my first best friend, only to lose her again after a year, when she moved. We stayed in contact, or tried to. I miss her. I remember going on a school trip to Melbourne, and that being so darned cool. I remember seeing everything on my own, calling my parents, and rooming with one of my friends. I remember talking about crushes on her at night as we lay on our beds, and tried to guess who they were. I remember making puns with her at all sorts of random times, and dealing with other people of my age for extended periods of time (A.k.a. Alyssa\u2019s guide on how to sleep on an airplane when you\u2019re stuck between to people who argue all day about everything. Useful life skills no.) I remember eating with and talking to people from a school in Melbourne, and just comparing our experiences. I remember preparing for Primary School Leaving Examination, or PSLE. I remember the stress, as I was reminded again and again that this would determine my life. I remember being always on breaking point, and knowing I wasn\u2019t good enough. I remember seeing how I got less than I expected, and how amidst my cheering classmates, my heart sank, weighed down with dreams and expectations that never took flight. I remember my teachers. Good and bad, they were. Some were really cool, and patient, and really tried their best to help and link and make things interesting. Some were obsessively anal, and who I got in trouble with because filing as a skill was lost on me. I remember my file being hurled out the door as I was booted out after, because I couldn\u2019t find a worksheet. I remember the humiliation of being screamed at in front of all of my classmates, and just kicked out, and how hard I had to fight to hold in my tears, and not break down, because I had tried, I really had, but it was never good enough, never a \u2018good girl\u2019 or a \u2018teacher\u2019s pet\u2019. That was one of the worst days of my life. I remember Science practicals, where I never figured stuff out, but did it somehow, some way. Those were fun, especially when we had to go out to the garden and the boys were all screaming because there were ants. (Oh the horror!) I remember the old tree where I used to go and sit in while waiting for my mother to pick me, or just when I needed a break from life, or when I just wanted to talk in peace with my friends. TL;DR: A lot. Some good, some bad, but I miss some parts. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A @Jayashree Satish Rao I particularly remember only the embarrassing moments in my primary school. Who doesn't right? But I remember only that. Not too many though. I remember celebrating my birthday on a day which wasn't my birthday. Not even close. It was like months apart. Oh! It's a long story. Not my best time.Half the teachers knew me as a kid who just won't talk. My parents didn't think so.My dad used to make a nuisance in all those parent teachers meeting. You see he was outspoken. And I felt like hiding 50 feet underground the same class room.Both of my parents are working. I do not remember the time I had ever studied anything as a matter of fact.Do you guys remember the shoes we wore on Wednesdays and Saturdays? The white shoes that has to be more white than the fur of the polar bear or the great white pearl, lets say mine had a tinge of brown and yellow. It looked so old all the time. I always used to carry a white chalk with me. Just in case. I used to end up outside and running 3 rounds around the campus. Lets say most of the times. No I am not writing the incident from \u2018Taare zameen par\u2019. Please!I was really bad at all the sporty events. My dad used to push me into every athletic activity. I am stubborn in such things. I never sport. Its not my thing. Except he used to push me into a pool. Well there I had no choice but to learn.I never had long hair during my school days. There were no beauty saloons back then ( which is very fancy). My grand dad used to take me to a barber's shop and make me get a military haircut in front of 10 and odd old men staring at you. I was young. And no its not funny.I just don't want to embarrass myself more. Thank you. ",
