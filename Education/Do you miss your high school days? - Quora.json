            "answer_text": "I have a mixed response to missing high school. Currently, I\u2019m in my third year of college, and I have a few things that I miss about high school, but mostly, I miss the period of time. To explain, I do not miss the weekly tests/quizzes. I do not miss the students who constantly make derogatory/disruptive comments out loud as a way to get laughs from their classmates. I do not miss the gossip about teachers and other students. I do not miss the congested hallways, and people messing with lockers (putting Vaseline on the locks) or destroying expensive school property (painting over security cameras. Yes. They did that). I do not miss the lunchtimes where sitting alone was seen as bad, and being in a group with people who gossip about others was not enjoyable. I do miss being able to go home after school. I miss the friends I had back in high school who I can\u2019t see regularly anymore. I miss how incredibly easy the work was. Being able to do any assignment the night before and still get a good grade (the assignments I do now are too challenging, and require much more effort). My free time as a result has decreased. I used to hang out in the yard until it got too cold, and I can still hang out outside, but not in a backyard. I can\u2019t roast marshmallows on a fire pit because there are none where I am now. I can\u2019t touch my pets whenever I want. I have to adult now. Student loans, thinking about my future career, and working to pay off everything plus leaving money for spending. I miss not having to worry about such things as much. That part of high school I miss. I like the freedom college gives me in terms forming my own schedule. The courses I attend are far more interesting and the I can be more free with my assignments (whereas high school requires a sort of filter or censor for some things, like curse words, or nudity, or what not\u2014nudity for art I should mention). Being treated as an adult. There are certain things I miss from my high school days, but mostly I enjoy what I have now. ",

            "answer_text": "I graduated high school ~2.5 years ago, so it hasn\u2019t been too long ago. When I look back, I have generally good memories, but also some that weren\u2019t good at all. In general, I would say that I miss being with my peers from high school, but I do not miss being a high school student. Here are some reasons why: Cliques are much less prevalent after high school. In general, people evaluate you by your character, not by who your friends are. Anyone who does the opposite is not worthwhile.After high school, you have much more freedom in how you spend your time. There were several classes I took in high school that I had zero interest in, but were required for me to graduate. As a result, I did not enjoy being present in those classes. As a college student, I can take classes in almost anything that I am interested in. I am lucky to have the chance to truly choose my own education.People are less judgmental in general. When you\u2019re surrounded by the same people every day, it\u2019s much easier to pass judgment when you see someone going against the grain. It\u2019s also much easier to feel intimidated and let judgment affect you. But in the real world, no one cares. If you\u2019re the odd one out, that\u2019s cool. If not, that\u2019s cool too.The best thing about high school is how it is really just life on training wheels. You get a chance to learn about who you are as a person, and see what habits, goals, and relationships you find rewarding. And if you mess up, you can start again after a clean slate. I also made some great friends in high school, some of which I still talk to regularly to this day, and hope to continue to be in contact with for a long while in the future. I wouldn\u2019t trade those friendships for anything. ",

            "answer_text": "All in all, a big YES. Yesterday (13th December, 2018)- the last day of my high school? We departed with hugs and kisses, success wishes from teachers, goodbye letters from friends, keep in touch and many more that eventually made me cry. I feel it's just yesterday I was promoted to high school. These many years have passed like a snap of a finger. I still can't believe. I feel it's just yesterday where I was so excited to get admission to a new school, wear new uniform, make many friends\u2014 and today, as I open my eyes, I have actually graduated from high school with its essence never knowing my thoughts have grown mature over these years. High school days\u2014 days I learnt to vision teachers as my friends where I could trust the confidentiality without any doubt. Those golden days where fights and arguments turn to laughters and cries, hugs and kisses. At times sorrows and miseries when our good friend turn to \u2018We used to be friends\u2019, anyhow, life must go on. I miss err\u2019thing. From the early social work bell till the last lesson- all tired and exhausted. Yet in between there were always memories, be it good or bad but those are memories one day it will make me laugh. I miss my best friend so much. Her \u2018good morning\u2019 call as soon as I enter the class. Her \u2018See you tomorrow\u2019 as we walk down the stairs to our respective homes. Her tiny jokes, her love story going crazy over korean Ikon, our hide and Seek chocolate eating from teachers and rest of the mates, our never ending talks during recess, her patient listening to my story on completion of a new novel, our canteen snacks and lots of fun. We were a family. These had become our daily routine. With her I could act werid and stupid, I don't care at all. She is my comfort zone. Today, I feel different because I have come out from my comfort zone? Here I am, glued to my phone. I know I will get accustomed to this life style. I know the entire world is for me but this so called HIgh School Days will always have a special place in my heart no matter how old I may grow. Thank you :) ",

            "answer_text": "Actually I didn\u2019t care much about my high school experience. I went to high school in 1997 and graduated in 2000 which meant, it been 19 years since I left my high school and all memories I had before. However having watched a local movie about a romance story that happened in high school, suddenly something drove me to miss my high school experience again. That movie depicted a love story between typical high school students in 1990\u2019s. A bad boy who fell in love with a pretty girl. At first she ignored him and gradually he managed to get her attention and they both then fell in love each other. The movie was adapted from a local novel that was believed based on true events in one of high schools in Jakarta. I opened my high school year book again and checked the people who were previously my friends. It\u2019s unfortunate we didn\u2019t have social media at that time like now. So there were only few photos and pictures from that time. I even still had my first love letter that I kept and when I red it, those memories came again. The moment I had with her, her smile and what I did to win her attention. I tried to find information about her in Face Book and found that she is now happy with another man married to her. I remembered my old friends, when we joked in the class, when we had lunch in cafeteria, when we talked about girls and other funny and ridiculous things we did in high school. I also remembered the best top grader in my classroom who was the favorite of all teachers, the cheerleader girls who thought that they were the prettiest girls, the nerd with thick glasses who made everyone dropped their jaws when he demonstrated his coding skill by creating a software that could solve math problems. Also, some stupid senior students who thought they ruled the high school and they created idiotic rule which was no junior zone at some areas in high school. My high school experience was full of fun things and memorable things. However I also had bad experiences in high school like when I was depressed due to grade problems during my second year of high school because I was stuck in competitive class.  Do I miss my high school ? yes I do. If I had a time machine, I would use it to go back in time to the time of my high school again. ",

            "answer_text": "High school was a long time ago for me and I was an excellent student, so the answer is clearly NO! I attended two different high schools. The first was University High School in Illinois, which was similar to magnet schools today. This high school offered many advanced courses not found in small high schools and opportunities to such as playing a in orchestra, creating biology experiments and an English class in which I created my own curriculum, etc. Some of my instructors were professors, and we where often taught by student teachers. Children of at ISU professors/employees and teenagers who were wards of the state from the Home for Soldiers and Sailors children had first priority in admission. I fit into neither group. Still, it was interesting to float between the relatively privileged students whose parents had high expectation of them and students who parent were not even part of their life. However, we moved to Avon, Ohio outside of Cleveland in the early 1970\u2019s. Ninety five percent of the children had grandparents (and a few parents) who had immigrated from Eastern Europe after WW2. The students had more access to the expectation of US culture than parents, and they hung together, forcing outsiders out (They would not let any black people or Hispanics move into the town). I realized not fitting it was both a challenge and a boon to becoming a unique person known for creativity, intelligence and willingness to include other unlike me. The first high school was tolerable, even though I an outsider. I would dread returning to my days at the second one. ",

I wanna be clear about one thing: I like being an adult, and if someone offered me the chance to go back and re-do high school, I would soundly decline. I have no desire whatsoever to go back to school and learn Algebra or any other math, or a science that won`t help me. I wouldn`t even take the classes I like; I`m definitely happy to move on and progress with my career. Here`s what I do miss, though. I miss my social life of those days. Not necessarily because every friend I had in high school was such a close friend, but hanging out was just easy back then. Everyone I knew was in the same place, we all knew each other, so it was just easier to have fun and get a group together. Having friends as an adult is sometimes almost as much work as your actual job, on the other hand. I`m thankful that among all those people I went to school with, a handful were keepers, as I`m still close with a some high school chums. It`s just nice to remember all the stuff I was able to do when not hampered by the demands of society. ",

I do not miss my high school is because there was so many stupidity, corruption, cliques and high school dramas. There was also lots of immaturity happening so\u2026I am not a fan of immature high schoolers. While I made some great friendships that lasted a lifetime and even developed my deepest crushes, I do not miss high school. I had a couple of verbal fights in high school, fake bullying and some stupid drama that was speculating around school. Yeesh. I believe high school was just a phase of mine that I wished to not repeat again. I had my cringey, awkward, horrible, fun and beloved memories in high school. Some of it stays behind, while others follows me around and made me the person I\u2019ve become today. Not to mention but I look waaaaaaaaaaaaaay quirky, awkward and had low-self esteem back in high school. It took me a year in 9th grade to gain confidence as who I am and not give a damn f*ck of what people says about me. I mean, look at my high school selfies\u2026\u2026ugh (some do look decent, I mean it.)    Good bye high school, you were once part of my teenage hood. Now, I do not want to go back into time thank you. Say hello new me and new life in college and university. Cheers. ",

Wasn\u2019t cool enough to be asked out by boys who admitted much later they really liked me but I would have ruined their cred. Skipping lunch every day because either the food was disgusting or my parents couldn\u2019t afford to pay for it. Being groped by teenage boys and having faculty say that I should get over it, boys will be boys. Never being able to go to the bathroom because I may be accused of smoking and suspended just because I was in there while someone else was smoking (I have IBS, this was not an easy task). Riding the bus for over an hour to and from school. Being hit in the face with a softball in PE was fun. Extremely limited electives because I lived in Bumfuk, Egypt. Dealing with sibling abuse at home and not being protected by my parents. Wasn\u2019t allowed to get a license because I was a girl and didn\u2019t need one. Lived with a huge double standard at home. Everyone in my house smoked but me. I could go on. I think you get the point. ",

It has become a smaller and smaller dot in my rear view mirror as time goes by. It sinks down farther and farther on the trash heap of history. I did learn some valuable things there, stuff I still use over 40 years after the fact. I put high school into the proper perspective by realizing that it had absolutely nothing to do with the real adult world. I was relieved to be free of its social architecture, it\u2019s caste system, where one had to act, look, behave, think and not be smarter that the collective. I was free of the indoctrination masquerading as education. I was free of the Petri dish of personality disorders called the staff lounge. I was free of the failed individuals who thence sacrificed themselves on the alter of the teacher\u2019s union. Some were really great people and gifted teachers. I was free to do, think, learn, behave, succeed and fail on my own terms. All of which I am grateful for and am reaping the benefits of this very moment and for years to come. I used to pass by quite regularly until my parents moved from the area. I never felt any sentimentality or longing for those good old days, because they were not. ",

I participated in the football tournament my senior year to raise money for one of our teachers who\u2019s breast cancer returned (Rest In Peace, Mrs. Jones). But other than that, I wasn\u2019t super popular, my social life was frankly lacking, and I had very little life experience. I had one boyfriend freshman year, I\u2019d never gone to a party, I didn\u2019t even get my driver\u2019s license until I was 18. College was the total opposite, which you can read about in various other answers. I think I grew more as a person in my one year of college than my 4 years of high school. So, no, I don\u2019t miss high school. I hope this answered your question! ",

I had both successes and failures, joys and sorrows, in each stage of life. I wouldn\u2019t trade any of them because they made me who I am today, but I focus on the present and the future and try to avoid elegiac longings for any past time because we all tend to romanticize our past and gloss over the difficult times we experienced during those times. Set your sights on the north star of the future and just keep looking ahead and you\u2019ll find that is the best path to success and happiness. There is nothing sadder, in my opinion, than someone who feels they peaked in high school. ",
