            "answer_text": "Was just thinking on similar lines is knowing understanding or understanding knowing to me they're very different things knowing can be most often is being part of the hivemind believing what you're taught at school and what society tells you that is not understanding that is brain-washing and the main reason why humanity takes so long to realise it's mistakes we really don't want to understand we like our simple lives the simpler the better eg god did it if you don't know something make something up you and your children are much happier that way living in ignorant bliss as the dinosaurs learnt lol or didn't life can't continue that way. Giving us life its need its drive for understanding we will be doomed like the dinosaur without it but for some reason we believe ignorance is bliss well it is till that day a stone hit u on the head. It may be a dyslexic thing I was never good at school they teach knowledge believing it will lead to understanding well it does their way of understanding the brainwashing. None of this has ever been my way of learning to me understanding is knowledge not the opposite and should be taught in that opposite. Leaving to the old saying knowledge is power government and religion only teaching people what it wants them to know in order 2 montane control the power over the masses plus they get a nice comfortable life some still have servants wiping their ass nothing much has changed since the Dark ages in that sense. Iost track full understanding of understanding first we need understanding in the first place we don't have any all we do is make shit up to bring us comfort there is no actual proof anything we know is real or true we only have the one perspective or is that 4 xyz & time, time we don't understand we only see left and right up and down time gives us movement backwards and forwards we understand movement but that is not time if we moved with time there would be no movement as we know it so we have to conclude that time is moving we are not understand? Pictures in time sounds like memory that is all we have, memory how's is a joke we only see things how we like to or are beneficial to ourselves for our own survival don't forget the ones in power always trying to delete and change their memories to suit their needs. I keep coming back to power the all powerful a god in our eyes something with all knowledge & understanding an entity not part of our existence seeing, controlling our very existence time matter the universe. So if u believe in a god then Yes there is such a thing as understanding of understanding. We on the other hand can understand whatever we like doesn't make it true though what ever suits humidity best, the dream for full understanding is to be gods ourselves who wouldn't want to be a god and entity that can be anything at any time what would a god choose to be now if I was a God what would I be mmm how about time the universe and all life. Cool right Teach that in school assholes. ",
