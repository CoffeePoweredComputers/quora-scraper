            "answer_text": "So this is a tantalizing question for right wing pundits in the great U.S. of A. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could shift the cost burden for education from all taxpayers to just those with kids in school, through privatization and vouchers (the latter of which wouldn\u2019t completely shift away from all taxpayers sharing a little of the burden, of course, but it would substantially help, and it would, in their dream worlds, create competition where there is none and, I suppose, make all us lazy public school people get in gear with our hard-working private counterparts\u2026?). None of that is true, of course. As a state employee I\u2019ve been lucky to meet educators from public and private schools across the state, both affluent and high-poverty districts. Public school teachers aren\u2019t lazy; private teachers aren\u2019t somehow magically better than public teachers because they perceive any sort of competition. The classroom just plain doesn\u2019t work that way. But the question \u2014 can private schools replace public schools? Sure, on the surface. Teaching is teaching. Public schools, the funding comes from public coffers, for which the public school must bear significant scrutiny, which is part of the reason public schools tend to have more admin staff than private schools do. Private schools bear no such scrutiny (and are thereby very much less accountable for methodology and results). But you\u2019ll notice that there is no massive cry from private school organizations to have them replace public schools, right? You want to guess why that is? They know that at the end of the day, public schools must do something they do not: educate the public. That\u2019s\u2026all the public. It\u2019s not just those who would self-select into private schools in the first place. It\u2019s the kids coming from first generation American homes, the kids coming from poverty, the kids coming from abuse and neglect. It\u2019s the kids who are academically way ahead of their peers, and those who are well behind. Nobody in the private school system wants that charge/burden. Nobody. Many in the public school system see that as our calling, our (almost) sacred charge\u2026to take whatever the American communities send our way and shape those individually into successful high school graduates. But it is a burden, fiscal as well as emotional, and it\u2019s not one that private schools are ready to take on. ",

Subsidize 100% of this curriculum: my answer to What are some things schools should teach but don't? Subsidize less important subjects less.(Consumption subsidy)Turn all public schools into private schools. (Privatization)Students buy each course from any school or home teacher of their choice. When they pass the course, they receive the study credit reward money and pay the course with it (if the price is less than the reward). Any extra price they pay out of pocket (or some percentage of exceeding price is subsidized to avoid causing market failure with a sharp cutoff). (Free market)Failing students/teachers (it\u2019s a collaboration) receive a smaller subsidy. (Penal damage fee)Test result checking is separated from teaching to make passing everyone regardless of results impossible.(Separation of powers)Students rate the courses. Professional course evaluators do the same. Best rated course suppliers get popular, raise prices, and grow to serve more students. Bad schools and teachers stop getting new students and go out of business. Good schools fill the open opportunity.(Invisible hand)(Inspired by Finnish drug subsidies that can be used in any private pharmacy of your choice. Pharmacies decide their suppliers and pricing freely. Customers are free to vote with their feet.) ",

If public schools disappeared, tens of thousands of poor and disadvantaged children would be even worse off than they are now. And, a lot of those poor children would be left to their own devices. Their parents have to work. There would be no way they could afford private schools after rent, utilities, transportation, food, and insurance. Those kids would probably be running through the streets unsupervised causing chaos. Moreover, the children would be in grave danger of imminent harm from any number of things. From sex offenders, to fire hazards! When these kids grow up what kind of future do they face? There are almost no jobs for unskilled workers now! None that pay living wages anyway! Plus, it would just perpetuate the ruling class-private school educated people, against the servant class- non educated people! Sounds great huh?! ",
