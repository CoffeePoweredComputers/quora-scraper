            "answer_text": "Multidisciplinary is a general term referring to a course of study, usually ending in a degree, or describing the institution that offers it. All universities are multidisciplinary. Interdisciplinary instruction is much more specific. It is a strategy of curriculum development and its instruction occasionally popular in the United States that requires collaboration between teachers of different disciplines all serving on the same team teaching the same students. These curriculums and their instructional strategies are usually project-based, often focused on problem solving. An example of a projected-based interdisciplinary curriculum unit would be a study of a particular river by a group of high school students say the Mississippi River. It should preferably be a river nearby that the students can actually visit and exam, to bring the unit to life. In this example, the science teacher may focus on drainage and expect a student, or group of students, to demonstrate how tributaries and waterfalls are formed over sedimentary rock beds below the river. Students may work in the science lab with large tanks of diatomaceous earth to demonstrate and measure flooding and erosion.  Then eventually go to the real river to identify and examine the sedimentary layers of rock. Other groups of students my pursue a whole different avenue of investigating and explaining how dams are built around these natural structures to generate hydro-electric power. The science teachers designs a rubric that measures how well students demonstrate in their constructed projects an understanding of, what in the United States are called, \u201cstandards\u201d. These state defined expectations of how geological science or perhaps physical science or a biological system \u201cworks\u201d.  In coordination, the social studies teacher will be laying out a rubric to measure the same students\u2019 understanding of geography standards. The students may be expected to explain how and why human settlements are built up around the same geological formations in the river, and why cities are where they are. The social studies teacher may focus on economic understandings and how river power and river transportation plays a role in building an economy. Also in coordination, the English language teacher collaborate in the project design by teaching the literature that has been developed around the same river, perhaps a novel and/or play that centers on that river and its larger meaning to the society of the people that have lived there. I live and taught in St Paul, a city on the Mississippi River. Mark Twain wrote one of the most famous and important American novels, Huckleberry Finn that was about a boy and a man running away by floating down the Mississippi. The English teacher must focus on the English standards proscribed by the state or school district and expect students to demonstrate that they understand those larger ideas.  The math teacher chooses the social studies and/or science teacher\u2019s standards and creates a small or large math unit that teaches and measures those mathematical skills that will help the students create an presentation in those disciplines. These skills and understandings can dominate the math teacher\u2019s teach or may only be tangentially incorporated, but it relates and shows how this math is relevant to understanding the real world river and our understanding of it. For example, the math teacher might focus on the math around the proportional relationship between area, volume, inclination and flow rate to help students understand river flow. The math teacher has the hardest job because math tends to be so sequential, one skill building on another and application in classrooms is not even addressed. Often the team of teachers will focus on a problem to be solved that is relevant to issues in the news. For example, it might be a problem around sustainability, sustainable aquaculture, power generation, agriculture and economics in terms of the river and its use by humans. The problem could be, how is the river polluted, what are the consequences of the pollution, and what is one solution to make it less polluted, while still maintaining a healthy economy? It is easy to see that there is fertile academic learning opportunity in science, economics, math and literature with questions like this. The student presentations of the products of their projects are a major event that families, community and university experts are invited to, and asking and answering questions plays an important role in the students demonstrating their grasp of the learning goals. So this is all very highly skilled teaching, and teachers must be very knowledgeable about their discipline. The task requires excellent collaboration & group skills and flexibility in accommodating & complimenting other teachers and their agendas. It requires extensive preparation but a great deal of flexibility in implementation because each student and each group of students are different, with differing needs, backgrounds, interests and gifts. Realistically it takes years for teams to develop effective, challenging and interesting units, and if they don\u2019t hold together and move to other teams the process must begin again. Not every teacher is capable or interested in this kind of teaching. Many less skilled and less imaginative teachers find it easier to teach from a textbook and check tests. That does not depend on the skills of their colleagues nor the interest of their students. But the student learning on an interdisciplinary team is profoundly different. The hidden curriculum is the creativity and enthusiasm that the teaching team brings into the classroom. The very obvious skill of effectively working on a team is an incredible preparation for life in the real world in a real job on a real team of professionals and this skill is on display everyday when the students see their teachers\u2019 preparation. At the same time, interdisciplinary projects are extremely flexible for different kinds of students. One student may find a particular aspect of the topic very interesting, like electric power generation and find the opportunity to actually build something, discovering that she has a gift for mechanical things. While another student may discover a particular interest in water sports and follow a completely different path in her project. I was an English teacher and my immigrant students were learning a English as a second language. I saw my students an hour every day, but the rest of the day, their science, social studies and math teachers were teaching them English. The great advantage to me, was to be able to target manageable domain of English, in this example, the vocabulary around \u201crivers\u201d and help them rapidly develop language that would help them succeed in every classroom. For students who were just learning basic English, i was able to encourage projects at a very fundamental level where students were constructing river art, for example, demonstrating basic English vocabulary and learning basic grammar to talk about it in their own presentations. In addition, the fact that every culture has important rivers and a culture around that river usage, my immigrant students could display and proudly teach their prior knowledge that gave them a unique role in the classroom. Interdisciplinary teaching is a completely different approach to education, that challenges the teaching team to focus on the students rather than the textbook. ",
