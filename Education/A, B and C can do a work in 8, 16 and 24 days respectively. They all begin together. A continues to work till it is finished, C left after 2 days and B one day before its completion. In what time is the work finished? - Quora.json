            "answer_text": "This problem can be solved using chocolate method. Given that A, B and C can do a work in 8, 16 and 24 days respectively. Let us calculate the LCM of 8,16 and 24 which is equal to 48. Now, we have got 48 units of work out of which A\u2019s piece of work = 48/8 = 6 units B\u2019s piece of work = 48/16 = 3 units C\u2019s piece of work = 48/24 = 2 units It is mentioned in question that C left after 2 days. so, C\u2019s piece of work = 2*2 = 4 units. out of 48 units, C has done 4 units of work. Therefore, remaining work = 48\u20134 = 44. This 44 units should be completed by A & B. But B has left one day before completion of work. This can be represented in equation form. Let A worked for x days, then B worked for x-1 days. so, 6*x + 3*(x-1) = 44 9*x - 3 = 44 9*x = 47 x = 47/9 = 5.22 days. A has worked for last and completed in 5.22 days. Hope this aswer would be helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "HA,B & C together in 1 day can do 1/8+1/16+1/24=11/48 part of work. So they together can complete the work in 48/11=4&4/11 days. C left 2 days before completion of work. So C left after 2&4/11 days. So A,B & C in 2&4/11=26/11 days completed 11/48\u00d726/11=13/24 part. So work remained 1-13/24=11/24 part. B left 1 day before completion of the work. So in 1 day A& B did 1/8+1/16=3/16 part of work. So work remained 11/24-3/16=13/48 part . A alone completes 13/48 remaining part of work. A 1/8 part of work completes in 1 day so 13/48 part of work will be completed by A in 8\u00d713/48=13/6=2 & 1/6 days. A will take total 48/11+13/6=(288+143)/66=431/66=6&35/66 days as A remained start to finish of the work. Ans: 6&35/66 days. ",
