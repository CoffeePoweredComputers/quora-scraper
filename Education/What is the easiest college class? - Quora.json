            "answer_text": "Statistically speaking, STEM majors are the most dropped, and this is likely in part due to the less forgiving grading system. It is also due to the rigours and course load of subjects in fields of study such as engineering. The answers are black and white, so students don\u2019t typically get marks for effort, although professors frequently grade students on a curve to even things out if everyone gets low grades. STEM majors, such as engineering, are of course going to be tougher than non-STEM majors, because schools don\u2019t want just anybody to graduate and build bridges. Humanities majors, psychology, languages, and arts majors are, statistically speaking, the easiest in terms of average GPAs among students. I have taken a few arts courses and have frequently been rewarded marks for good effort, regardless of whether or not my quality of work was there. It makes sense that such majors should be more relaxed in terms of grading, because some students simply go to school for the experience, for enjoyment, for learning, for increasing their skills outside of the workforce, or they attain an undergraduate degree as a stepping stone to graduate studies in a field such as MBA or law, etc. In short, generally speaking, there are differences in the level of difficulty among different majors, although ever student has strengths and weaknesses and personal aptitudes and shortcomings do make a significant difference.

            "answer_text": "If you are looking to just complete a degree as easily and quickly as possible then you have two options: Complete a degree in something you are extremely comfortable in, or get a degree in General Studies. The first is pretty self explanatory. The second is a little more difficult as you have to make sure the college or university you are applying to has the degree to begin with. General Studies degree plans vary from school to school. Sometimes they were the catch all for a student who just missed a major by a few classes, or had too many gaps to fill in so they could declare an official major. I have heard of schools removing this option and in some case they replaced the General Studies with a broader degree like a BA in Liberal Arts or Liberal Studies. From my experience these degrees allow the student to pick courses that are relevant to their interests without dedicating fully to a single subject field. The BLA, or Bachelors of Liberal Arts, at one school I attended consisted of a student getting essentially three minors ranging from the Humanities to the Social Sciences. By now you should also be seeing a pretty significant downside or two. The Humanities and Social Sciences require a lot of writing and reading for most of their introductory courses. If writing is not your thing then you may reconsider this option. Keep in mind this was based on my experience having been through five schools before earning my degree. (I earned a significant amount of college credit while in the Army.) YMMV. ",
