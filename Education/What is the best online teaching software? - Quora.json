Learn a foreign language with videos Video Conferencing Apps to Keep You Connected Conferencing apps give you the ability to video chat with anyone in the world for free\u2014opening up unprecedented opportunities for language teachers. You can use it to introduce your students to your friends and acquaintances living in a country that speaks their target language. This gives students the opportunity to speak with someone with the expertise to chat with your class about food, holidays and language differences. You can even include Partnerships with other classrooms around the world can enrich your language lessons through online conversations with other students learning the same language. 1. Skype online-teaching-tools As an online teacher, you have probably already harnessed the power of video conferencing to chat with students or content area experts all over the world. And you probably already know about Skype, as it\u2019s been around for at least a decade. Effective and easy to use, Skype has helped countless online educators bring language and culture to life in their classrooms. Some teachers even enjoy the fun of a unique activity called Mystery Skype, in which classes converse and have to guess what country the other class is from based on their conversation. Skype has undergone many changes and updates over the years, and has some new and compelling features that you may not know about. For example, it\u2019s \u201cCapture\u201d feature allows you to easily add images, attach funny GIPHY comments and add videos within a message thread. This can give online conversation a whole new dimension of realism. Imagine a lecturer on Spanish architecture including real-life photos and video of the buildings as he talks about them, or a conversation about French food enlivened with real video footage of a meal as the speaker describes it. 2. Zoom online-teaching-tools In addition to Skype, another free video conferencing tool called Zoom has recently come on the scene. It functions similarly to Skype, but offers a number of extra features that lend themselves exceptionally well to collaboration. Its unique \u201cZoom rooms\u201d make group calls a breeze, facilitating collaborative work as well as conversations with other classrooms around the world. Another advantage that Zoom has over Skype: you can record conversations to use for later assessment and feedback, an invaluable tool for helping your students improve. Collaborative Planning Tools to Help You Stay Organized One of the toughest and most important tasks of teaching, whether online or face-to-face, is planning lessons that align with your content standards. Related to that, it\u2019s equally important to communicate your expectations clearly to students and parents, and ensure that they can access the materials they need. Fortunately, there are some great platforms out there which simplify this process for you. 3. LiveBinders online-teaching-tools Remember those old three-ring binders? They were stuffed with lecture notes, handouts, worksheets and homework in various stages of completion. The idea was to keep everything needed for one class organized in one place\u2014but sadly, this commendable goal often went awry. LiveBinders is technology\u2019s answer to all that old-school paper wrestling and desperation. You can easily upload presentations, documents, worksheets and web resources, appropriately organized under relevant tabs. This makes it easy for students and parents to see what they need to work on and to track their progress. As an added bonus, it greatly simplifies co-teaching, as lesson plans can be easily shared for collaboration. 4. Planboard online-teaching-tools If you struggle with finding or creating just the right template to use for your online lessons, Planboard truly is a lifesaver. You can set up easy-to-use templates aligned to your curriculum standards, which can be used over and over again. You can even add an entire semester\u2019s worth of lesson plans to be tweaked and used again next year (with some improvements, of course). Attachments and images can be added to your lessons with ease. Even better: you can access the app from any device, so it\u2019s easy to make adjustments to your lessons while you\u2019re on the go. Apps for Presentation and Review to Help You Engage Your Student When presenting or reviewing content, engagement is key. Finding ways to learn material in a way that\u2019s fun and memorable is often a challenge in any environment. Here are two wonderful apps to make your content more engaging and enjoyable. 5. Prezi online-teaching-tools A takeoff on the old standby slideshow presentation, this app is an online whiteboard that lets you interact with information visually as you speak. It allows you to move to any place in your presentation that you want, instead of moving in a linear fashion from one slide to the next. This organized and visual method of presentation can help make even the driest topics more memorable to your audience. 6. Quizlet online-teaching-tools This digital flashcard app makes vocabulary memorization more interactive than it ever was before. Students can use the fun, easy-to-use flashcard sets to quiz themselves or each other, or to play games like Matching or Gravity (keep asteroids from destroying your planet by typing the correct vocabulary word). You can create your own flashcards or choose from the pre-made sets. Quizlet has been around for a while, so you may already be familiar with its functions. But if you haven\u2019t used it recently, you may not be aware of a new feature called \u201cQuizlet Live,\u201d which is especially great for online teaching. With this app, you can put your students in teams to face each other in a live competition, adding an elusive element of personal interaction to your virtual classroom. Quizlet also offers opportunities to connect with other language teachers via forums and discussion boards. Help Students Improve Speaking with Audio Recording Apps Verbal communication is a foundational element (if not the foundational element) of language teaching. Not only that, but the ability to record your students when they are speaking is important for meaningful feedback and assessment. But giving your online students the same quantity and quality of verbal communication that they might engage in and receive in a face-to-face classroom can seem like a daunting task. Fortunately, technology keeps adapting to make the process of creating and using audio recordings ever simpler. Here are some apps that allow you and your students to communicate with ease. 7. Vocaroo online-teaching-tools This popular online recording platform makes the process of creating and uploading voice recordings beautifully simple. Best of all, it allows you to easily link voice comments to student work in a blog or a cloud document service like Google Docs or Apple\u2019s Pages (if you and your students are using Macs and iPads), making for meaningful and personalized assessment and feedback. You can also make your lessons even more personalized by creating podcasts of your instructions for an activity or a homework assignment. ",

            "answer_text": "With COVID-19 gripping the world, the question about the best online teaching software has become much more relevant to people\u2019s lives than ever before. I think the utmost importance of this question doesn\u2019t need an explanation, but the question itself is still here. Actually, it has become a matter of the first magnitude for all of us since the coronavirus outbreak caused shutdown of schools almost everywhere. And almost everywhere - where it\u2019s possible technically - schools and universities have shifted to a new educational format - E-learning, since it seems to be the best possible option for the ongoing education process during global emergencies. But how do we know what platforms and what software to choose? E-teaching at the primary level cannot be compared with E-teaching at senior level. Most parents lack confidence regarding \u201chomeschool\u201d education and don\u2019t really know how to create the right environment for their kids. Children themselves are being stressed because of all these changes and might not respond adequately to the new studying requirements. Basically, the only people who can make decisions about the best e-teaching software, who can explain to parents what exactly needs to be done, and who can provide the newbies of distance learning with support and knowledge are the teachers. The real frontier heroes who are reaching out to their students using all possible tools that can be found online and engaged into the educational process. I am not a teacher, but I will try to do my best to answer this question. Yes, as many have already said, we should consider video collaboration tools like Zoom, Adobe Connect or Blackboard Collaborate. In my opinion the third one is the best for e-teaching because it\u2019s been designed specifically for educational purposes, not for corporate business meetings. You may also give a try to TutorRoom - the virtual classroom and online learning management system that allows you to customize it. This option is not for free but a possibility to have a teaching platform that has been built in accordance with your requirements sounds great. Another virtual platform for teaching and conducting interactive lessons online is LearnCube - intuitive user-friendly software suitable even for the youngest learners. It would make sense to take a look at Tovuti - a really powerful and advanced cloud based learning management system that has all the necessary tools for productive online teaching. Considering that in today\u2019s world affected by COVID-19 teaching is based on technology, we should keep exploring digital tools and resources. Software that wasn\u2019t initially intended for educational purposes can be successfully implemented into the educational process. For example, multifunctional apps like Animation Desk, NoteLedge, Write-on Video, PDF Reader and MarkUp will help a lot to those teachers who are experimenting with some creative ways to teach remotely in order to create an enhanced and stimulating learning environment.
