            "answer_text": "I would recommend starting out by building a desktop. Why? Because it gives you some respect for how the hardware functions, and a better idea of how software works on different hardware set-ups. Plus, you can configure it how you want. Even if your parents aren't helping out with the computer's cost, it's a reachable goal for a teenager. Between Amazon, Newegg, and perhaps some refurbished externals, like a fat monitor, you can build a great system for cheap, and learn a ton in the process. Now, learn Linux. It's the OS used for just about everything. Learn it, live it, love it. I'd recommend a dual-boot system since your school work will likely require Windows applications. Hacking is being curious about everything. Why are these tools written in Ruby? Or Python? What types of exploits are most common? What toolsets do I like to use the most? How good is my open source intelligence methodology? Do I like to play with wireless tools? What is the scope of work? What's my end goal? What toolsets will get me there within my scope of work? No Starch Press[1] is a great publisher for any type of computer book: programming, hacking, networking, etc. And it's really easy to find free PDFs of their catalogue, because they encourage inexpensive learning. ;) Read some old blogs, and listen to security podcasts. Bruce Schneier's blog is a classic, as is Krebs on Security. Bleeping Computer is one of my favorites for basic IT security news. As for podcasts, that's highly individual, because you need to like the voices! Find a few that you like, and fact-check their coverage. Is it legit? Cool, keep listening. Be skeptical of sources that cannot be verified anywhere else. I've been censored before for recommending the use of a certain g00d search engine, but use the advanced options, and learn how to set up an incredibly specific search string that won't spit out millions of pages, maybe only a few hundred. That's googlefu! And it comes in handy. Learn keystroke combos, or bind your own, so that using a mouse is almost optional. It's liberating! Always be curious. Always be learning.

            "answer_text": "Programming languages for Web Hacking and Pentesting If you\u2019re interested in web hacking and pentesting, then you must learn learn below mentioned languages at-least basic and intermediate level. 1. HTML Always began with basic basic and HTML is important and most basic markup language. One should know it very well to understand web action, response, structure and logic. HTML is static markup language. 2. JavaScript JavaScript : JavaScript is the most used as client-side programming and for web development. You should learn it on high priority mode. Understanding JavaScript code logic can help you find web-apps flaw. 3. SQL SQL is database programming language. Each and every data is stored in database so you should know about database programming and vulnerability as it is the most sensitive part of Web. 4. PHP PHP is most popular dynamic programming language, unlike JavaScript It is server-side programming language. PHP is strongly recommended to every beginner in Hacking and Penetration testing. 5. Perl Perl is worth learning for practical reasons; it\u2019s very widely used for active web pages and system administration, so that even if you never write Perl you should learn to read it. Programming Languages for writing Exploits Exploit writing is advance part of Hacking, It requires higher level of programming language. Every professional hacker must know Exploit Writing, It can be done in any programming language like C, C++, Ruby, Python etc. 6. C/C++ The mother of all programming language, C is most used in software creation for Linux, Windows etc. However it is also used for Exploit writing and development. Although C++ is more powerful language than C and is used in a lot of programs, like games. Here are some basic examples of C programming. 7. Python Python is most used language for exploit writing, It is highly recommended you to learn Python Socket Programming because it helps lot learning exploit creation. 8. Ruby A simple but complicated object-oriented programming language. Ruby is very useful in exploit writing. It is used for meterpreter scripting and do you know Metasploit Framework itself programmed in Ruby. 9. Java Java was originally released with the slogan \u201cwrite once, run anywhere,\u201d which was intended to underscore its cross-platform capabilities.You can make tools using Java and it can also be used to create backdoor exploits as well as exploits that can kill a computer. 10. LISP Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. LISP is absolutely wide open and flexible, makes it hacker\u2019s favourite. You can define your own syntax, and often do. You can create any sort of programming paradigm you like and include it in your programs. Programming languages for Reverse Engineering Reverse Engineering, also called back engineering, is the processes of extracting knowledge or design information from anything man-made and reproducing it or reproducing anything based on the extracted information. Reverse engineering is also beneficial in crime prevention, where suspected malware is reverse engineered to understand what it does, and how to detect and remove it, and to allow computers and devices to work together. Reverse engineering can also be used to \u201ccrack\u201d software and media to remove their copy protection. 11. Assembly Language Assembly is low level programming language but very complicated. One can instruct a machine hardware or software using Assembly language. Reverse Engineers uses Assembly language, and if you want to learn Reverse Eng, you must need to learn Assembly language. Finally one more thing, programming languages for hacking also depends upon what program you want to hack then you can\u2019t hack it using PHP knowledge, although you can understand logic but it will be harder, so always make sure what you wanna hack and in which programming the app is coded.
