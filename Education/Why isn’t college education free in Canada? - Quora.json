            "answer_text": "Why should it be free? Oh yes because students want free education. We have free Medicare now you want to increase taxes to provide free education? Sure, I get that education is a right as some people put it, but we get roughly 13 years of free education from k-12. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to improve secondary education so Universities don\u2019t have to spend so much bringing students up to the level they should be at to enter university? Ok, what would it cost? There are about 2 million post-secondary students in Canada at University and College. About 75% are full time and 25% part time. The federal government says the total cost of post-secondary education is $35 billion. 50% is from all levels of government and tuition is 25% $9 billion). The rest is donations, grants, commercial enterprises. So where is the incentive for Canada to spend at least $9 billion more on free post-secondary education and keep increasing the budget over time as costs rise? Plus it would be the provinces that would have to come up with the funding because education is a provincial jurisdiction. But the Feds would have to increase transfer payments. Canada has about a 30% university completion rate ranking Canada about 7th compared to peer countries. So will free university improve that?  Of the countries that provide free education (let\u2019s focus on Europe), how sustainable is the free tuition model? So recently, Newfoundland has moved to lower tuition fees and Ontario is selling free university for low income students. But the government of Saskatchewan just hit the U of S with a 5% cut (actually 10% or $40 million if you include the moving of another $20 million from the University to the College of Medicine). Cuts to Colleges has been the result. Is there political will at the federal and provincial levels to consider free tuition? Not right now. It is a great idea but operationalizing it is the issue. My fear is that Colleges and faculties across the country are not correctly funded as it is and you want free tuition? It is doubtful that a proper reckoning would take place to set a proper level of funding before instituting free tuition which then robs universities and their subunits from generating more revenue from tuition.

            "answer_text": "I must answer with my opinion not hard facts. Here goes: Governments don\u2019t have enough money to do it, and taxpayers are already paying close to 45% of their incomes to all three gov\u2019ts and are loath to pay more.It\u2019s a North American idea that by the time one turns 18, the age of majority, attending college or trade school becomes a personal choice and responsibility depending on what one wants to do in life. Of course, financial support for college can be negotiated with one\u2019s parents. Opinion: The state is far too involved with education as it is and should not be enticed further. I believe education should be a parental and/or personal affair, not one of other taxpayers. \u2018Teens or older students should think about their lives, save money and work their way through college.",
