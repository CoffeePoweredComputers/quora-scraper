Take this as my little contribution towards the society. Hallelujah. Set one of your favourite rock songs as an alarm ringtone. (It will drastically refresh your mind)When you turn off the alarm-Switch off the fan.Switch on all the lights you got in your room. (Just this little effort honey)Keep the curtains open before going to bed. (Shine bright like a diamond) Drink lots of water before sleeping. (This will make you jump off your bed)Exercise for 15 mins atleast. (Now don't ask for the motivation to exercise)For first few days instead of studying, spend the early morning time on what you love doing the most. (Your hobbies) Ater you open your eyes in the morning, swear to god, your mother, your father and every person to whom you don't want to lose ever, that you are going to get out of that bed in 5 seconds.Believe that if you break your promise, all of them are going to die.(creepy? No!)And then count back. Surprise!! You are on your study table before 5 seconds are over. Well these really work for me. So I shared. Your wish after all. But don't complain later. Wink! ",

Quick Tips: Don't just read, write it downDon't sit, standUse creative visualization, make neat notes Other tips:Read in public places. I am sure you won't like to get ashamed while in public.Read with your friends or your love interest. Again the same logic.Read with heads down, legs up. I bet you won't sleep.Rope technique (Was used by brahmins in ancient India): Tie one end of a rope to your hair and other end tightly against a nail on the back wall. Now if you get sleepy your hairs will be pulled and you will stay awake.Some more tips if you read late at night or early in morning. Dip your head vertically in a bucket full of water. Try to stay underwater and look inside the water for 10 seconds. Cold water will be excellent.After that stay away from any furniture around you and don't sit anywhere. Just stand in middle of the room.Preferably don't switch on the fan/AC.Drink hot coffee after that.Donts : Don't listen to silent or slow music.If you are thinking of doing meditation, beware of not sleeping while eyes are closed.Don't sit on bed.Best wishes from Yash Gumaste Take care @User-9653068777085231261 ",

            "answer_text": "Just try to observe yourself when you wake up. Are you at your best, while doing anything once you get up? Some persons are simply not morning persons. They are typically called as Night Owls. They are up late in the nights, and are usually their creative best in the nights. Early mornings for them is a nightmare. If you generally dull when you wake up, it can be concluded that morning is simply not your \u2018Prime Time\u2019. Prime Time is generally that time of the day when you feel very energetic, and you can do anything efficiently. For some people it is early morning, for some it may be late nights. If you are not a morning person, I suggest you shift your study hours to your Prime Time. Try and draw a time table which allows you complete control over your \u2018Prime Time Hours\u2019. They are very precious, and must not be spent on anything else but study, to score good. If you feel that in the mornings it is only studies which bore you, and you can tackle rest of activities efficiently; maybe it is subject matter you are studying which is not very exciting. You may have to then find some solution regarding overall motivation of studies. ",

First of all, keep this in mind that you cannot do both night studies and early morning studies parallely because our body needs minimum 6 hours of sleep. So if you are planning to do studies in the morning then develop the habit of sleeping atleast till 12. Now when you wake up and after all other activities , go to your study table. Studying in bed will make you sleep for sure. Now before starting, *wear your shoes* and wear those clothes which you generally wear in the examination hall. Doing all this will definitely provoke the feeling of study in you and since you are wearing shoes , you will definitely do not go to the bed again. I have practiced it and believe me SHOES WILL HELP! ",

Wash your face with soap ( just splashing water is not that efficient) 2. Coffee- Could definitely help you from getting sleepy 3. Walk for about 10 minutes ( inside the room ) 4. Still you feel uncomfortable then head straight to take bath 5. But before all that you need to sleep early at about 9pm - Get accustomed with this that will suffice All these would definitely help you study well in early morning Cheers R K Rohit ",

It gives you an \"alert and awake\" effect.  Preparation before taking a cold bath= physical exercise.  Rationale = i'm not talking about going to the gym, or a 3 km run. I'm talking about moving your body. Stretch. Push ups. Squats. Jumping jack. Dance to Just dance on youtube. Sweat. Increase your body temp. Feel your heartbeat. Hear your heartbeat. Feel the sweat. Breathe. Relax for a bit. Then take the cold bath. Rationale for physical exercise and cold bath before studying= you need to jolt your mind. If the subject you are studying is not interesting, then you need to do.something about yourself. You need to put your mind on alert mode. Make the subject interesting to. Try to look at the subject differently. ",

Even mark out concepts you don't understand and need to refer or ask help for.Do NOT read in bed. Not only will the soft fluffy pillows tempt you back to sleep, in the long run, your bed will no longer be associated with sleep and relaxation.Hence it may get difficult for you to get sleep at night.",

For example : 8hrs Then what you should know is you can never make yourself sleep early unless you are sleep deprived so deprive yourself of sleep for a whole night / wake up early than your usual time. Then the whole day make sure you don't sleep during the day time, so instead of studying that day go out and play sports or indulge in physical activity. Now if u wanna wake up 5 o clock in the morning and your sleep cycle is 8hrs. Go to bed at 8:40pm. And make a habit to doing physical exercise as your first activity of the day. This will wake you up. Then you can do your studying. Keep trying this , till you can wake without an alarm at the time you want. Do exercise just after you wake up atleast till your sleep gets regulated. So the concept is you need to shift sleeping hours, by making yourself sleep early. Try to set you alarm by following this site : http://sleepyti.me/ ",

For students it\u2019s too difficult to take this one but if you will practice, you can get that. To do so try to sleep early in the evening and set alarm. After some days you will get habit of that. One more thing we prefer only those things which makes any sense in our life, so try to relate your study with your future and set importance of it in your mind. Definitely your worry about your future will be a power for you and you will wake up early without getting sleepy because this will force you to study. And in morning we can memorise things easily so prefer reading in your morning study and specially those subjects in which you have interest. Best of luck for your study!!! ",
