            "answer_text": "Do Nothing but Study the whole damn year ! ( Seriously) You actually need not score 100 percent in PCM under any circumstance to be honest. Well maybe if you have an OCD for marksheets then Sure, why not ? Solve maths daily, Try to solve 150 questions in 2\u20133 days of span. IF you talk about boards its relatively easy to score in Math (If you practice enough). Solve questions from last 10 years question papers. Solve the whole damn textbook atleast 2 times. And you can score 100 ez. When it comes to Physics. Notch a dial up when it comes to theory. Theory is everything. If you understand Physics and the basic of \u201c How this shit works\u201d then you can easily score above 90. Now Scoring a straight 100 is really difficult task when it comes to Physics but there are people who score 100. Solve Numericals from Textbook, NCERT and HC. VERMA if you have the balls of steel. For Chemistry, I\u2019d suggest spending some time with physical chemistry, solve the numericals and dont worry much about the theory for physical chemistry. The big dog in the house is the Organic part. NOW AN IMPORTANT NOTE : YOU SHOULD NEVER UNDERESTIMATE ORGANIC. Whatever you do, spend a lot of time on Organic Chemistry. Buy books by the author O.P Tandon . Once you master Organic theres nothing to really fear about I hope I have helped you. Do get yourself checked if you have a clinical OCD. Joke! In the end, nothing matters but your love for the subject. Best of Luck ! ",
