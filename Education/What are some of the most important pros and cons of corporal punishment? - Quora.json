            "answer_text": "Pros: 1)It is very effective. At least in the short run. Children are conditioned to react to pain. 2) It takes little time 3) If you do it \u201cright\u201d it leaves few physical marks 4) The child will still love the parent but might show more fear (mistaken for respect) Most people I talk to who have been found to use corporal punishment HATE child abusers. They see abusers as people who senselessly and without cause hit the child and may harm them seriously. They don`t see what they do themselves as abuse, but as \u201cspanking\u201d or disciplining. They love their child and most of the time show them love and care. First. Don`t use the word spanking when it comes to hitting a child. The term has light hearted connotations an trivializes slapping a child. Secondly. Try to put yourself in the childs place. They are powerless and depend on you for survival. Imagine you live in a tiny kingdom with a 4 meter tall king and queen. What feels like a small physical reprimand from the king will feel much worse to you. Third. Even if you are loving and caring most of the time children learn to associate great love with a certain amount of fear and pain. You do not want your child to go in to an adult relationship with this association. A woman I talked to had a good childhood with loving parents. Once her mother in anger pulled her pants down and gave her what some people would call a \u201cspanking\u201d. To this day this woman remembers this incident with great detail and it elicits a feeling of anger and helplessnes. The incident is \u201cburned into her memory\u201d in a way that the other experiences did not. The people I talk to who use corporal punishment usually say that their parents used the same way of discipling and it did not hurt them. It is sad but most child abuse is not the result of evil, but a lack of understanding of the developmental dangers of fear. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m American and my answer is based on what I know about the system we have here. The cons: The worst thing about it. Errors: The system can make tragic mistakes. As of now, 156 wrongly convicted people on death row have been exonerated. We\u2019ll never know for sure how many people have been executed for crimes they didn\u2019t commit. DNA evidence doesn't even exist in the overwhelming majority of homicide cases . It is often irrelevant and can\u2019t guarantee we won\u2019t execute innocent people. Keeping killers off the streets for good: Life without parole, on the books in most states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending the rest of your life locked up, knowing you\u2019ll never be free, is no picnic. Two big advantages: -an innocent person serving life can be released from prison -life without parole costs less than the death penalty Costs, a big surprise to many people: It's well known that the death penalty costs far more than life sentences. Not many people know why. The upfront part of the legal process, as well as appeals, are much more complex in death penalty cases, because the punishment sought is irreversible. We know that innocent people were executed in the past (in the US and elsewhere.) The largest costs come at the pre-trial and trial stages and they apply whether or not the defendant is convicted, let alone sentenced to death. Crime reduction (deterrence): Homicide rates for states that use the death penalty are consistently higher than for those that don\u2019t. The most recent FBI data confirms this. For people without a conscience, fear of being caught is the best deterrent. The death penalty is no more effective in deterring others than life sentences. Who gets it: The death penalty magnifies social and economic inequalities. It isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. Practically everyone sentenced to death had to rely on an overworked public defender. Victims: Like no other punishment, it subjects families of murder victims to a process which makes healing even harder. Even families who have supported it in principle have testified to the protracted and unavoidable damage that the death penalty process does to families like theirs and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.  The plausible pros: retribution and revenge are served. ",
