It would be appropriate for children of Ages 2 to 7 2. Hungry Caterpillar Play School A calming intro to the digital world, this app features familiar characters from Eric Carle\u2019s books, along with clear directions and slower-paced play. Many activities focus on math or reading, but the relaxation techniques, like using a Brown Bear to encourage mindful breathing, come in handy. It would be appropriate for children of Ages 2 to 5 3. Moose Math The Pet Bingo game and making smoothies are disguised counting lessons. Rewards entice kids to keep playing. It would be appropriate for children of Ages 3 to 7 4.

Montessori Crosswords for Kids Using picture clues and phonics sounds, our testers moved around letters to spell short words like jog and dog.

It would be appropriate for children of Ages 4 to 8 6. Quick Math Jr. Quick Math Jr. is an app for kids with 12 different math games that feature fundamental math skills and concepts. It has unique graphics and buildable characters to keep kids engaged, and all answers are handwritten or drawn on the screen so kids can also practice handwriting.

Download a few and let the kids tap, tap, tap away so you can get just a little bit of time to yourself.
