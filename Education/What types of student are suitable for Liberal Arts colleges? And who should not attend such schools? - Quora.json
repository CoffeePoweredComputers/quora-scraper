            "answer_text": "If you may not be exactly sure what you want to do, a liberal arts college is a great place to get a great well rounded education so you can try a few things out and declare a major. Also, liberal arts colleges tend to be small, so if you prefer more engagement with your professors and face to face time, this is a great option. It\u2019s hard to say there are people that shouldn\u2019t go to a liberal arts college. Some would say STEM shouldn\u2019t, but many liberal arts schools have very respectable math, science, and engineering programs. If you want to go into a highly technical field (robotics, specific engineering disciplines, etc), you should probably go to a more robust university that has the faculty for that. Further, if you want to go on to graduate school, liberal arts colleges are great at that type of preparation. Again, you have greater access to faculty for guidance and will have a better established relationship with them so they can give you stronger letters of recommendation. If any of these things don\u2019t appeal to you then you may want to look elsewhere. If you do not want to be recognized, part of a smaller community, or participate in class or on campus, then a larger university would be better. Also, liberal arts colleges don\u2019t have big names and any graduates end up working with other alumni or go to graduate school. If you do not want a diversified core class structure, this also wouldn\u2019t be for you. For example, I went to a liberal arts college and studied economics. My core consisted of a foreign language, 3 sciences, math, history, philosophy, psychology, etc. Business students on the same liberal arts campus had a similar core, but took 1 less science and fewer humanities in exchange for some marketing, accounting, etc. At a university, you won\u2019t have as many requirements beyond your college on campus\u2026 some, but not as many.

            "answer_text": "To put the answer in phraseology common in 2018, if you want to have high emotional intelligence you should definitely obtain a liberal arts degree. If you want practical, job related school work that will help you obtain a high paying job right out of college without getting further education you should probably not get the liberal arts degree.
