            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s make it clear - you cannot edit/change your teachers\u2019 recommendations. I actually think that even the teachers who wrote them cannot do any editing of the recommendations that were already submitted to the Common App. A guidance counselor can submit a midterm update and/or a report with the fall semester grades and include any recent accomplishments there, but it would an additional material, not editing already submitted files. So the question should be about the way how the recommendations could be updated for your new application, for Fall 2018. You have to double-check it (because College Board changes the rules sometimes, and also because you have to verify everything you see on Quora), but I think that you will have to start your Common App from the very beginning for the new application season, and it will require submitting all new supplemental material - high school transcript and school report, and all new recommendations. I\u2019m not sure about SAT scores, but I think you might be required to resubmit them also. You remember, when you filled out your Common App for Fall 2017 college start, you chose \u201cstarting college in the next 12 months\u201d or something like that? And you submitted this application to some colleges. I\u2019m pretty sure that means your application will expire in summer 2017 and, to apply for Fall 2018, you will have to start a new application, ask the teachers to upload their new recommendations etc. ",

            "answer_text": "NO. In the first place, I don't believe there is any way for you to physically do that. The recommender uploads the application in any common information application, usually through a separate link that is sent to the recommender by the body governing the application service. Once that application is uploaded, you have no access to it. You can't see it, and you can't change it. Secondly, any such efforts are likely to get you accused of fraud. If you have legitimate accomplishments to add to an application, there are two ways to do it: You can meet with your recommender, show evidence of the achievements of which you are speaking, and ask the recommender to upload a revised recommendation.You can send an email to a school to which you had previously applied, inform them that you have additional accomplishments of which your recommender wasn't aware, and ask their advice.Any other effort to change a written recommendation runs such a high risk of accusations of fraud that I would never even consider attempting it.

If the teacher wrote the recommendation once, they would probably be happy to update it. Email the teacher and ask for an update. Honesty is the best policy. ",
