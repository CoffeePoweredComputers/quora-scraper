            "answer_text": "It is one of those jack of all trades but with mastery of about four type of careers. You definitely need to master biology since the study of life is part and parcel to environmental science. That is what my undergraduate degree is in. I also minored in economics and history. I did not know it at the time but history actually halped me solve some fairly nasty problems later in my career. With mine site remediation it is extremely useful to know the history of the site to be able to restore the land and the watershed to something appraching the original undisturbed land. .I had a couple of choices as an undergrad. I had the opportunity to study either anatomy or microbiology. I initially chose anotomy and had no problem until we got to mammals. I had to dissect cats. I was raised with cats and the sight of 30 of them in plastic bags soaked in formaldehyde, stiff as boards was too much for my youthful mind. I dropped the class and took what was available, bacteriology. Now I am not sure that I did so well in that subject because I liked it or if I did not want to handle dead cats. Economics came into play a bit later when I had to submit cost benefit analysis to customers ( industrial polluters ) . I won a fair number of contracts because I could sort of speak the same language as business folks. I understood their bottom line. Geography was real helpful because it taught me how to read contour maps. I can still look at a contour map and figure out where the water will naturally flow. I soon discovered that skill saved me time in preparing proposals. I did not have to walk the site and make notes. I could do it all in the office with a fan on. That is a distinct advantage during hot summer months. Bacteriology led to mycology wihich led to soil ecology which led to chemistry, organic chemisty, soil chemistry, water chemistry and lastly instumental chemical analysis. Also during the summer off months I worked constuction. First carpentry, then plumbing , and finishing up with electrical. After each of those I took physics. I was a lot more into that subject than my friends because I could apply what I learned in the trades the following summer. So, yeah. If you want to be a jack of all trades then environmental science may be for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Environmental Science is an interdisciplinary science because Environmental Scientists rely on so many other disciplines to carry out their research. Environmental Science is broadly the research to understand the impact humans have on the world around us. Otherwise known as anthropogenic impacts on the environment. To do this the research draws mainly on the fields of Chemistry, Geology, and Biology, though the research also regularly uses studies from the Ocean Sciences, Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, as well as social science disciplines such as sociology and human geography to name a few, to evaluate not only what impacts we cause, but also how they can be avoided, reduced and fixed. The interdisciplinary nature of environmental science varies from research paper to research paper, as well as between different researchers and instituitions. ",
