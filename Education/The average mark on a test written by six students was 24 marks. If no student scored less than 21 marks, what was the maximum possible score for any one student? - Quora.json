If 5 students make the lowest possible score of 21, that would produce 105 points ( 39 points shy of 144), meaning that the Sixth student could score 39 points to maintain the group average of 24. The answer is 39. ",

            "answer_text": "The maximum possible score for any one student is 39 marks. From the given information we can write an equation and solve it. Solution: Let x = the maximum possible score. The total number of marks is 24(6). Assume 5 students made the minimum score, i.e., 21. The total number of marks is equal to 5 times the minimum plus the maximum. So, 24(6) = 21(5) + x. Solving, 24(6) - 21(5) = x Therefore, x = 39 ",
