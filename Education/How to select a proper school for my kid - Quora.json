            "answer_text": "I see on your profile that you live in India\u2014-and my answer is driven by what I know, which is education in the United States. I have no clue whether it is relevant to your situation or not, but here are my thoughts: It all depends on your situation and your child\u2019s needs. Consider location, convenience of transportation, size of the school, teacher:student ratio, social interactions among students in the school, cost of attending, particularly when looking at private schools, whether there is a specialized \u2018magnet\u2019 curriculum or a general curriculum, etc. Note that I did not say \u2018check the reviews and test score reports\u2019 yet. If I were seriously debating between two or more schools I would check those, but they would be last on my list of things to look at. Ideally, talk to students and parents of the schools you are considering, and get a feel for the comfort level they have with the atmosphere of the school. Sitting in a lobby, waiting to be interviewed for a middle school teaching position in Arizona, I was able to hear several parents discussing how unhappy their children were, and the reasons for their unhappiness. I had two thoughts 1) Is this where I want to work? (And the answer soon became \u2018not just no, but hell no) and 2) None of these parental concerns have anything to do with academic excellence; they all had to do with school/administrative culture, and that was borne out in my interview. , I see on your profile that you live in India\u2014-and my answer is driven by what I know, which is education in the United States. I have no clue whether it is relevant to your situation or not. Best Wishes! ",
