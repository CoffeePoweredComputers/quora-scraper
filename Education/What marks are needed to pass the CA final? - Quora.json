            "answer_text": "Hi, So there are 2 groups in CA final, of 4 papers each(8 papers in total) and you need to score, 200 marks or more in each group to clear both groups individually maintaining the score of all subjects at or above 40. You will also be awarded exemption, if in any or more subjects you score 60 or more marks. And even if you fail, you need not to give the exam of exempted subject for given number of attempts ICAI has granted. & even if your total in any group is more than 200, but you failed in one subject(your score is below 40 in that particular subject), then in this case you will be declared fail in that group. You will also be benefited with set off policy. Say for example, your score for 1st group is 230 marks(i.e you have 30 more marks) and your score of 2nd group is 180(given you're pass in all the 8 subjects individually, i.e score above 40 in all subjects), then 20 marks of 1st group, will set off with 180marks of second group to make it 200 and your total will be 410 in both groups, and you will be declared pass, in the given condition. Hope my explanation helps:) Good luck for finals ",

            "answer_text": "CA final as you know contains 2 groups with 4 papers each. If you attempt for one group at a time than in individual subject minimum marks required are 40% whereas the aggregate should be 50% minimum. In case yoi don\u2019t pass the group but you score more than 60 marks in any one or more subjects, than you are exempted to not to give that paper for next three consecutive attempts. In case you attempt both groups at a time, the rules are still same, but you have a slight advantage that if you score above 40% in all individual papers of one group but not another, still your aggregate for that group doesn\u2019t make 50%, but aggregate of both groups is 50% or more, than you are declared pass in that particular group, but not the other one. In your next attempt you will only have to go for the other group you lost. ",
