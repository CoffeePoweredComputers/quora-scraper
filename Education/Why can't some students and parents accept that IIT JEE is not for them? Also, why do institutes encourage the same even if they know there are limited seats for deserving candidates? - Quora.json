            "answer_text": "Well I am not qualified enough to give this answer. But since you have requested an answer to this question then I will surely try. You must be knowing who is he(every Indian knows and these days even foreigners know).  Mr. Narendra Modi . The person who has recently took oath as 17th prime minister of India. Now think for once from where he has come. A poor boy who once sold tea came that far that now he is the P.M of the largest democracy. Why didn't he accepted the fact that he is poor and has to live like that selling tea . Why didn't his parents understood that the dreams of their child is too high and can be achieved. Why did he never stopped and just moved forward everyday. A person who once don't had enough money to eat is now the person whom everybody wants to meet. Today even if we hate him or like him we appreciate his efforts. Now you will think why I am telling you this as you know this already. But the answer to your question lies here only. Why should someone accept something that is not true . If a student studies then he can clear IIT-JEE . It's not like he stop trying. He or she should continue to fight the world as MR. Modi did. He never left hope and same should be with students. The parents support their children like Mr. Modi parents did . Why should they accept something when they have faith on their child caliber. Why will a good parent stop his or her child to achieve their dreams. And also the institutes you are talking about. These institutions are like our constitution which gives a fair chance to everybody to come and become what they want irrespective of caste, religion . Hence there is nothing wrong in these institutes motivating students. In which place you have found unlimited seats. Everywhere the seats are limited. There is nothing like seats will be unlimited somewhere. Ps. I am not a modibhakt if somebody thinks so. I just appreciate his way to success. I thought his example can best explain the situation and hence took his example. ",

            "answer_text": "well human beings have brain ; the brain thinks what is the best thing for him/her ! thus often leading to dreams ! that is where the problem starts ! before dreaming we don't think much and after dreaming we don't want to think against the dream as a parent of a child in 11th/12th you will be stressed and worried for the child\u2019s future ; you dream for him/her a good job , financial independence and good health and many such things ! but during these dreams you forget your child\u2019s actual capabilities and once it is dreamt it\u2019s game over ! see coaching institutes are not the Gurukuls from ancient India that are a hub of learning and science ! they are a business run by people who want to earn more and more money ! so to earn more you need to admit more and make more people see this IIT dream even though it might be luring them into a pit ! most of the institutes boast the selections and the percentages ; their top ranks etc but they never tell what happened to the students who didn't get selected that year what are they doing , how many are there ? that worries me a lot ! next reason is the lust for money in people\u2019s mind ! people think that colleges like IITs are a \u2018stairway to heaven\u2019 you will get rich and prosperous ! they get excited when noob Indian journalists and misguiding newspapers publish \u201cIIT student gets placed at Microsoft with a 1.5 crore package\u201d - failing to mention the break-up of the package and the cost of living in the U.S. ! learning science is something that is pure; and the greed for money is like the dirt that spoils the this pure thing ! let me make you realise the reality of IIT placements ; no matter they may be better than the rest they aren't that great and many students end up with a meagre 5 lac p.a. package ! do you think if you knew that you will even prepare for IIT-JEE ; \u201cJEE nikaalne se kuch nhi hota, Zindagi iss se bahut badi hai mere dost, JEE success ki koi guarantee nhi hai !\u201d - this translates to \u201cjust clearing an exam like JEE doesn't mean anything, Life is long and hard and much more challenging , Success you dream for isn't guaranteed if you clear JEE\u201d yes, IITs do mean better access to facilities, research or startup funds and many other amenities but if you think you will benefit from these without hard-work then you have a big misconception that will lead to your doom! people think when they hear about the success stories of IITians that their colleges made them who they are which might be true to some extent but it is majorly their effort that made them who they are ! the sooner you realise that life will be rewarding and punishing you based on your efforts the sooner you will be at peace and stable ! now so far I have discussed about the reasons like : misinformation !greed and malice !one other reason is - \u201cnot letting children do what they want to ! - terming their interests as \u201chobbies\u201d not realising that these hobbies can also turn into good and rewarding careers with safe, prosperous and healthy life for your children ! hence thinking forcing them on this \u2018secure path\u2019 is the right thing to do as good parents\u201d - well let me tell you you might think you are right and in some cases you may be right to but generally this develops a sense of \u2018regret\u2019 in the child that if I had tried, then what my life would have been ?! S/he starts doubting him/herself and this self-doubt isn't a nice thing ! we all know India is the leader in suicides due to academic pressure ! I hope you get my point and think about this more and not commit any mistake ! I wish you best of luck in your life and jee journey and a prosperous and healthy life my friend ! yours sincerely - Aditya Shankar Garg (thanks for the A2A Dharmesh Harshwal ) ",
