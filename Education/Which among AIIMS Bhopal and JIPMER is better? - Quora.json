            "answer_text": "I'm from Aiims Jodhpur and I know you are enquiring about Bhopal but every Aiims is basically similar so Il be discussing based on my college if that helps. Being a South Indian Who wanted to study among people from different parts of India Was the main reason for me for choosing Aiims. Aiims Bhopal has almost 60% south indians as far as I know Or maybe more. Academic wise both colleges are equally excellent clinical exposure is something very overrated in MBBS time. Unless u want to work as a junior doctor clinical exposure is not going to benefit you much. The amount of exposure we get in AIIMS is definitely less compared to Jipmer but just the right amount an MBBS student needs. Campus infrastructure hostels are New here but when I went to jipmer Campus I saw a lot of construction so I'm guessing they have a lot of new buildings and renovations as well. hostels are single rooms with attached bathrooms. Something I really wanted for my college life. If you are someone who prefers the dorm experience Jipmer might be better. Student life is fun here and we have enough college fests and programmes but cannot be compared to a college like jipmer with its landmark fest Spandan. research is highly promoted in Aiims and since student teacher ratio is less every student gets individual attention and I cannot think of a better place to pursue any research. The teachers here take out time for you and help you in each and every aspect. sports facilities are very good in Jodhpur Aiims but I don't know about Bhopal. Jipmer being established would be having more equipped Facilites. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say JIPMER over Bhopal as the later is still to have major facilities like a blood bank. I have been treated by the interns in JIPMER whereas Bhopal is yet get complete infrastructure. JIPMER is well established unlike Bhopal. Thirteen years after the foundation stone was laid and five years after the first batch of students was admitted, Bhopal\u2019s AIIMS is yet to get a licence to open a blood bank. Without a blood bank, the emergency department cannot be operational. Other crucial departments like surgery and gynaecology are not functional either. All of which, students say, has affected their learning. Some faculty members share the students\u2019 frustration. Explained a professor, requesting anonymity, \u201cTo get into AIIMS is not easy. These are among the brightest students in the country. From the third year on, students are supposed to spend the first half of their day in hospital, learning practical skills, and attending lectures during the second half. Not a single one of my students has learnt these practical skills or assisted in surgery. They have only observed surgeries in other hospitals.\u201d According to Dr Srinath Reddy, former head of Cardiology at AIIMS, Delhi, and visiting professor at Harvard Medical School, \u201cLearning only by observation without assisting (in the operation theatre) is like trying to learn swimming only from reading a book.\u201dAccording to AIIMS, Bhopal\u2019s annual report, of the 305 positions sanctioned, only 57 are filled.
