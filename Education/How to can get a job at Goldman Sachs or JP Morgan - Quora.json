            "answer_text": "More informations : Education I am graduated from a not really target school (we just have some partnerships with KPMG & EY) with a major in International Business & a Minor in Finance.Languages I am french native speakerI was born and raised in the french countryside, I did not have the chance to study in an international high-school. My parents are small clothes merchant. However, my Bachelor was taught in English. I don\u2019t definite myself as a fluent, but I would say I am a full professional proficiency (or almost).Experiences I studied for 6 months in Taiwan as an exchange student. ( mostly finance and few business classes )I joined the french military reserve at the age of 17 for 2.5 years ( soldier ) : Vacations & some week-ends. It is one of my most valuable experience at all. I develop many skills such as organization, strategic planning, advantages to play with a team\u2026When I was in high school, I started my own business, very basic business model : Online retail. I make around 5,000 euros (profit) and I decided to invest this money into securities (stocks) with a strategy of growth investing.I started to work at 16 in a farm (summer job of course). I never wanted to stay home for holidays and I never had many friends, so during every school holidays, I worked for different company as a different positions.I was intern for 6 months in a french Middle-Size company as a CFO AssistantI am CFA level one candidature for June 2017.My goal Long-Run : I want to open my own business, but most of the start-up fail. However, I would like to have an experience in a big company. And in my opinion, if you want to open your own business, you need to have a expertise, someting valuable to bring. That\u2019s why I think most of the start-up fail. Young fresh graduate just open their own business after they get their degree whiteout any experience. For the moment, I don\u2019t have any competitive advantage. So I want to work for a prestigious company for a while to build a network and to get more recognition/credibility when I will start my own company.I am really proud of my missions in my company, it\u2019s a small consulting boutique company based in Bangkok but I have a lot of responsibilities : Financial modeling, creation of speech, meeting with clients\u2026. I learned to work with pressure and short deadlines.At the moment, I am little bit lost about my future, I am working for the CFA, I get some recommendations letters from ex-teacher and ex-boss but I don\u2019t know if I can get a job in a prestigious bank for the investment banking department.What is the best strategy to increase my chances to get an interview ? How should I apply ?",

            "answer_text": "First correct your English. Then worry about how to get there. Title is grammatically incorrect. Unfortunately, not a lot can be done now to get into those investment banks. You would need a high GPA. From the best universities in the world. And have sufficient relevant internship experience. Having networks within the bank may help. The rest is just a normal process. In terms of interview etc. That is why most wealthy parents who send their children into private school at a young age get into those banks. Because the qualifications you do when you are in your teens matters a lot in terms of analyst roles at GS or JP. There is one other way where you do a masters degree lets say at Oxford, Imperial, UCL, LSE, Cambridge, Harvard, Wharton, Bocconi etc. That way it will impress them. This is from a London perspective of joining such banks. In case, you are looking for an analyst role here. Why are grades, internships and networking important. As well as, working hard to succeed in the application process. Because it demonstrates work ethic. Investment banks are known for their long hours. Hence, the big salary. When you have a solid work ethic from a young age. You will get internships, grades and everything else. Simply because you put more time in than others. They want to see this before you join ideally. The only way to prove that is your grades, internships and networking skills such as knowing a VP in the Investment bank. Would also help if you are good at Mathematics as well! ",

What I see in your experiences so far don\u2019t show interest in the industry: Boutique consulting firm, InternMilitary experienceStart upHaving your BBA with a minor in finance is a good start. When you get your CFA completed, that will be another good indicator that you\u2019re serious about going into the financial industry, but you\u2019ll need more work experience. Try joining other large banking companies (i.e., Morgan Stanley, Deutsche, Credit Suisse, BlackRock, etc.), grow and succeed, then if you\u2019re still interested, apply to GS/JPM. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, you do have the background to be a candidate for a career at JPM and possibly GS. You are young with what appears to be fantastic real world experience. Why not start by walking in to the local JPM office in Bangkok and speaking to the HR person - or even better - the head of the office. Sometimes they are looking to hire locally. Then if that doesn't work, get on the JPM website and apply to their Paris office. My feeling is that you at least get a phone interview. However, before you get too excited, really think about whether working in banking makes sense. My feeling is that over regulation has taken the fun and excitement out of banking. You might build a better career through the more entrepreneurial opportunities you find in consulting. Still try the JPM route. The interview process is excellent experience and you find out lots about yourself along the way. ",
