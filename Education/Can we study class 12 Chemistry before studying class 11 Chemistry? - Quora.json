            "answer_text": "Rhetoric it may sound , but i can\u2019t prevent ! Can you build the first floor of a building without the ground floor ? I reckon \u2018NO\u2019 is the legitimate reply . And so must be the answer to your question , however chemistry wont say \u2018NO\u2019 in absolute sense . There are few units from class 12 that are pretty much independent, and they can be covered parallel to class 11 . Once you have covered the basic units of 11th including Mole Concept , Atomic Structure , periodicity and Chemical Bonding , it means you can finish more than 90% topics of organic and inorganic chemistry from both 11 and 12th . That accounts for almost 65% of chemistry . Other units of class 12 such as Solutions , Kinetics , Electrochemistry will be dependent on the physical chemistry units of class 11 . So its better to develop a proficiency in class 11 first rather than an unsystematic approach .

            "answer_text": "Nope, as in class 11 chemistry all basic chapters are given like chemical bonding which is the backbone of inorganic chemistry, nomenclature, isomerism and reaction mechanism which are backbone of organic chemistry and mole concept is essential for physical chemistry. So u cannot have command over chemistry if u didn't study class 11 chemistry. Best of luck\u2026. In case u find any trouble u can buy study materials and in case need any further help u can ask me. Thanks ",
