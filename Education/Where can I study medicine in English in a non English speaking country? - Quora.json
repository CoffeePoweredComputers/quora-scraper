            "answer_text": "Well, there are many non-English speaking countries on this very planet. A lot does depend on your country of origin and your budget. My answer is Europe-centric. The world is to big to be covered in total. The goal of Medicine study programs is to educate doctors of the future. In order to work as a doctor in a country you will have to speak the language the people in that country speak. Therefor, most non-English-speaking countries have non-English medicine programs. Which is very straight forward, considering that they want to have doctors for their own domestic market. Studying medicine will also include to work with patients during your training. For that, you will also need the local language. For example, you can study medicine in Italy in English. I only looked at the University of Milan but there are other programs at other universities as well. However, in order to become a fully recognised doctor, you will have to sit through a state examination. And that is, you might guess it, in Italian. So you can get an English medical degree there but not become a fully recognised doctor. Although, they over language courses to help you with that. There is also a medical program in English in Poland. Programs in English language I don\u2019t know how they overcome the problem of communicating with patients. In the Netherlands in order to become a doctor, you will need a master degree in medicine. The Bachelor degree will be no problem since it is taught in English. The master program, however, will be in Dutch (since it includes working with Dutch patients). Many other European countries don\u2019t even offer a medicine study program in English. Important to consider: Think about where you want to work after graduation. Medical degrees are not always fully recognised outside the country they were issued. An exception of that are EU-country degrees which are recognised in every other EU-country (however, in order to work in another EU country as a medical doctor, you will have to prove skills of the local language). So if your goal is to study medicine abroad and go back to your home country after graduation, you want to research whether or not your home country will recognise your degree. ",
