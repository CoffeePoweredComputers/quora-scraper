            "answer_text": "Depends om the teacher/test/specific assignment Some teachers will curve grades if a lot of kids failed or if it was a difficult assignment. Some tests have a really low paasing score. For example in Texas every student has to take STAAR test (state test, I have no clue what STAAR stands for, though) The minimum score to pass the biology STAAR is a 45. Minimum score for algebra 1 is a 55 I believe. To pass a class in high school you usually have to have a grade that averages to a 70 for the year (or semester for the semester long classss). In speech I used to strategically skip out on lengthy assignments because I knew taking a zero on certain assignments would bring my grade down but it would still average me at a 56 for the six weeks and an 85 for the semester. (I've been up for 23 hours so forgive me if this sentence doesn't make sense!) So in other words, sometimes a 60\u201369 can be passing depending on the occasion. Sometimes a failing grade doesn't matter in the end because of how the overall grade averages out. The important thing though is that a 60\u201369 is a much better grade to have than a zero ",

It is different school to school. Some say 55% and up is passing while others say 70%. It would not hurt to ask your teachers or counselors the passing grades for your school. ",
