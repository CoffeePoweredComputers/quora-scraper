            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Now before writing this answer I\u2019d specify that I had a few friends during my preparation time who relied on self study for NEET. I\u2019ll be enumerating what all I had observed from their methods of studying. It\u2019s possible to get a good score in NEET UG without joining a coaching institute but there are a few things which are an absolute prerequisite for preparation and which you mustn\u2019t bypass. You\u2019ve got to join a test series. A single institute\u2019s would do. Why is it necessary? Because of obvious reasons, besides giving you some handful of quality questions, it will tell you where you stand among the swarm of people preparing for the same competition.Get at least a teacher for doubt clearance. Tuition teacher or some school teacher or anyone who could help solve your queries especially for physics and chemistry. Doubts are notorious, since they pile up easily and erode your concept understanding as well as confidence.After you\u2019ve fulfilled these two obligations, you\u2019re good to go even without joining an institute. How do I prepare from the very beginning? Make a daily and fortnightly schedule. You should plan the number of topics/sub topics you must complete daily. Also make a similar fortnightly schedule. Take help from the syllabus of the mock tests you\u2019re enrolled to, to plan the number of topics you should complete every 14 days.Try getting the materials of premiere coaching institutes. It\u2019s easy. Editions which are 1/2 years old are easily available second hand in many markets these days. You can also ask your seniors to provide such materials. If you don\u2019t object digital resources, you can find a lot of materials on internet and telegram. Coaching modules aren\u2019t necessary as such, but they can be used since they\u2019re crafted by experienced teachers who know the level of NEET exam better than most of others.One of the drawback of self study is being unsure about the \u201camount\u201d of materials/books one should have. Limit yourself to just sufficient books. If you\u2019re using Allen/Aakash modules, then there is no use going for 3\u20134 more coaching institutes modules, it\u2019s a waste of time. Don\u2019t buy Resnick Halliday, J D Lee and other such books unnecessarily. Keep only 1/2 books for each subject other than coaching materials(optional too). Nothing more than that.NCERT for biology. It\u2019s easily gonna fetch you minimum 330/360 if you\u2019ve done a double digit smart read. Apart from this use only one extra book for MCQs solving. Fingertips/Disha/Most Wanted/Aim4Aiims anything would work.For Physics and chemistry too, choose one book which has good theory in it with lots of questions. H C Verma/S L Arora/D C Pandey/Errorless. Whatever you solve, solve it single-mindedly. Stop the habit of doubting the book you\u2019re using. It\u2019s the number and quality of questions you solve, which determines your performance in NEET and not the Author\u2019s name whose book you\u2019re referring to. However, if the book is abundant with errors and you find the level of questions in it below NEET level, don\u2019t hesitate from changing it. Inorganic chemistry only requires NCERT. The more you go for deeper theory from other books, the more you forget what is within the syllabus.Don\u2019t be totally cut off from others. Make one or two good friends with whom you could discuss anything synergistically. However, everyone\u2019s a competitor these days, so it\u2019s best to make your guardians your best friends. Keep yourself updated with all the latest developments regarding NEET dates/syllabus/pattern etc, since you aren\u2019t a coaching student who can rely on the teachers for such information.Utilise YouTube for video lectures of tough and tricky topics. It\u2019s a resource at your disposal, which should be hunted smartly. Follow good channels and learn the concepts which they disseminate to understand the topics better.Vibhas K. Gupta's answer to What is the best channel for preparation for the NEET and AIIMS on YouTube? (Read other answers to this question too)Revise what you\u2019ve studied, on every weekend/every second weekend. When you keep on advancing and keep on forgetting older concepts, your efforts turn out to be a futile one. So it\u2019s wise to take a break to revise what all you\u2019ve learnt after a sufficient time gap.Staying at home makes you prone to distractions and demotivation. Sandeep Maheshwari Sir wouldn\u2019t help in this case. Motivation comes from within and is not infused by external sources. When the reason of your efforts is strong(The Why?), you don\u2019t need any other source of motivation.Lastly, don\u2019t search for examples, rather set an example yourself. :)Good luck.

            "answer_text": "This answer is subject to newer edits, which are given right at the end. It is possible to crack NEET exam just with self study. Tuitions provide good guidance and a regular rhythm to your studies, but you can get through without them as well. On one hand, if you aren\u2019t interested in attending a tuition for NEET, I\u2019d sincerely advise you to be regular with your school. You can probably study on your own, but you\u2019ll need teachers to clarify your doubts, moreover, regularly attending your school will help you build rhythm in your study. Now with the study part: 1.Biology Make NCERT your core book\u2026.. Honestly, as simple and basic NCERT appears, it is that more important for NEET-UG.Since you aren\u2019t up for coaching, you\u2019ll need some sort of book to elaborate and build upon your concepts. I advise you to consult regarding this with your school biology teacher, because I don\u2019t know of any book out there that will build up sufficiently needed concepts in biology, probably because it isn\u2019t there.Trueman, DLP programmes and everything else contain way too much than what\u2019s necessary for NEET, so don\u2019t dive into them\u2026\u2026..You\u2019ll only waste your time. For practice, I advise you to refer MTG Biology Guide, previous year chapterwise questions. You can also purchase Balaji books for Botany and Zoology, since you aren\u2019t obtaining practice material from any coaching.Do purchase NCERT Exemplar book. It is an indicative material of good questions that are based on the concepts that you can form from NCERT.2. Chemistry A. Inorganic Chemistry NCERT, that\u2019s it! NCERT is the best thing you can study for Inorganic.In inorganic, there\u2019s already a lot to cram, and using NCERT not only can you save yourself from wasting your mind and stressing over a lot of unnecessary material, but you can also save a lot of time!For reference, you can use GRB\u2019s Inorganic chemistry.B. Physical Chemistry Physical Chemistry needs a lot of practice and conceptual understanding, and NCERT doesn\u2019t suffice, but it doesn\u2019t mean, that you should ignore it. It has to be covered.For building proper concepts, use GRB\u2019s Physical Chemistry.But remember, you don\u2019t need to browse through the entire book! You just need to study the topics mentioned in NCERT and syllabus of NEET.You can study the rest if you feel like to gain an additional edge. C. Organic Chemistry Organic chemistry is divided into 4 branches: IUPAC nomenclature, Isomerism, General Organic Chemistry-1 (GOC-1) and GOC-2.IUPAC nomenclature and Isomerism - You need to build crystal clear concepts to do well in both these topics. It is advisable to use a refresher, so that you\u2019ll learn a wider variety of concepts that are necessary, and also will gain exposure to questions. Both these topics are relatively easy to understand and you can score well.General Organic Chemistry 1 - GOC-1 involves understanding basic molecular properties like nucleophilicity, electrophilicity, resonance,etc. which are necessary to predict products of a reaction. It is important that you build these concepts well, and again I recommend using a refresher for this purpose.General Organic Chemistry 2 - GOC-2 involves important organic chemical reactions that you have to learn. For this part of organic, I sincerely recommend sticking to all the reactions given in NCERT, both of class 11th and 12th. All that\u2019s given in those NCERTs is enough for GOC-2 to crack NEET. When I gave NEET, I only failed 1 or 2 questions in organic, and I went in just by studying all organic reactions given in NCERT, 2\u20133 times.3. Physics Physics is the most crucial part of NEET, and is the ultimate rank deciding subject. Most students who give NEET, excel at biology and Chemistry, but falter at Physics.NCERT won\u2019t suffice for physics. You\u2019ll need to build strong concepts, because success in physics can\u2019t be achieved with rote memorization. But it doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore NCERT. You should ideally give it a glance but not make it your core.I advise you to attend physics classes at your school regularly or join an only-physics coaching, because in physics a teacher\u2019s input is invaluable.In physics, you\u2019ll need to make a refresher as your core book for understanding physics. You need to ask your teacher for advice regarding this, else, if you join a physics tuition, refer the study material that the tuition teacher provides and make it your basic conceptual material.BOOKS TO REFER GENERALa. MTG NEET Explorer b. Previous Year Chapterwise (to be dealt with as you cover chapters by yourself) BiologyCore concepts - NCERT Practice - MTG Biology Guide, Balaji books for Botany and zoology 2. Chemistry Core concepts- Inorganic - NCERTOrganic - NCERT and any other reliable, understandable sourcePhysical - NCERT for basics and GRb for advanced concepts and better understandingPractice: MTG Chemistry Guide MS Chauhan &/or GRB for organic GRB or other relevant material for inorganic (doesn\u2019t need a lot of practice,just sufficient cramming capacity) GRB or other relevant material for physical 3. Physics Core concepts - Tuition notes, every material out there is exhaustive, so I sincerely advise you to join a physics tuition rather than try physics out yourself. Practice - Tuition practice questions, MTG Physics Guide, HC Verma (for higher level practice) QUICK TIPS IN CONCLUSION Since you want to embark on a NEET journey all by yourself, I advise you to join a national level test series like Allen or Aakash\u2019s AIATS, to stay competitive and know your position nation wide.Note- You may score poorly in these tests, because some questions come way out of NCERTs, based on concepts given in NCERT but are way out of what is necessary for NEET. 2. Practice You can\u2019t ace any subject without practicing sufficient questions. This is even more pronounced with regards to subjects like physics , physical and organic chemistry\u2026.. So do keep practicing questions regularly. 3. For later stages/ preparation finales - solve timed question papers on an OMR sheet, for learning better skills in time management, that you\u2019ll need when you ultimately take up the exam. Also gaining more practice on the OMR will minimize your chances of wrongly filling answers in the examination. 4. Don\u2019t study material that is unnecessary, that are way above what\u2019s necessary for NEET, just because someone recommends it to you. 5. It is a common mistake among students to consider NCERT as a simple, basic book and disregard its importance for NEET, thinking that they should have way higher knowledge. Remember, you don\u2019t need a PhD, all you need is sufficient knowledge to crack the exam. This exhaustive answer would have served its purpose, even if it can become a part of someone\u2019s successful journey to cracking NEET. Best of luck! Yours sincerely, Prateek EDIT 1- USS is also a good book for practicing physics EDIT 2 - MTG\u2019s NCERT at your fingertips can also be referred in all three subjects. Should be referred at least in biology and chemistry if possible. Also NCERT exemplar books are recommended for all subjects\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "To prepare for NEET, you need proper guidance. If you are a brilliant student then I would suggest you take your preparation alone. NEET 2019 will be held on the 5th of May. Along with NEET examination, you also have to prepare for your board examination. You also have to manage your syllabus as well. NEET exam comprises both class 11 and 12 syllabi, whereas you have to study only class 12 for your board examination. Therefore, you have to focus on particular chapters strategically to score good marks in NEET. To take admissions in government medical colleges, you have to score above 550. For such a huge score, you should have clear ideas about concepts. The ways you can prepare yourself for the examination A proper study plan is required where you can easily get a clear idea about the important chaptersAs per requirement, the students can manage his time. During the time of class 12 examination, the students can focus mostly on those chapters of class 12. Due to this a proper revision can also be managedNCERT books are the best way to score good marks in the examination.Practice question papers from previous years. Regular mock tests can also help you in scoring good marks in the examinationFor board examination, you have to practice maths as well, whereas for NEET examination there are only 3 subjects. If you are passionate about MBBS then think how to score good marks in these subjects: Physics, Chemistry and BiologyThe most difficult subjects in NEET is considered to be Physics. So the students have to study all the three subjects regularly. Physics can be improved only by practising calculations. Chemistry and Biology are all about theories. Focus on basic areas where you can score good marks. Suppose you are good at Biology, try to answer as many questions as possible from the subject. Similarly, for Chemistry, there are problems coming out of the formula. You should attempt those questions. The students are scared of Physics due to its difficulty level. Make a proper study plan without which you cannot understand your preparatory stages. Go through the link Ananya Chaudhuri's answer to What should be the daily routine to crack the NEET 2019? Other Issues faced by the students Usually, the students are stressed out during this time due to study pressureA regular revision is hampered due to board exams, therefore, the students should make a routine for grasping the concepts clearlyThe students suffer from sleep deprivation due to the strenuous timetable of preparation, they have to focus on how to utilize minimalistic time for learning new thingsIt is better to spend hours to engage in extracurricular activities. In this way, the students can enjoy the study as wellNEET 2018 difficulty level is also analyzed below, go through the question matrix and you can understand how to plan your timetable Ananya Chaudhuri's answer to What is the difficulty level of Physics Chemistry and Biology in NEET?

            "answer_text": "Learning from my own experiences, I can say that self study is the crux of sailing u through in this examination. For me the 3D\u2019s to crack any exam is: DesireDilligenceDedicationAlso, LUCK is invariably a crucial factor. No doubt, I have got much benefit from AAKASH teachers and their study materials in my drop year. But if i have to look back, I probably could have made it without coaching. As the syllabus for the boards and Entrance exam is almost similar (except the question pattern), it would be a wise decision to start preparing right from class 11. Go through the NCERT textbooks religiously and certain reference books to make your concepts clear. For Biology, NCERT is more than sufficient. But in case of Physics and Chemistry, reference books helps a lot to grasp the concepts easily and solving numericals. I used to follow SL ARORA for physics, and N. AVASTHI for physical chemistry, NCERT and MODERN ABC for organic chemistry. Devote equal time to all three subjects especially Biology as it will ensure your selection. Now dont run after the books with which u are not comfortable with. Stick to one particular book rather than buying several books (and then later ending up doing nothing) and study regularly. You may complete the entire book, but if u dont revise it\u2019s of no use; there is no substitute for REVISION. Try to practice MCQs daily to make yourself acquainted with the paper pattern. Previous year papers prove to be a boon in this case. NCERT at your Fingertips is also a nice book to be followed both for NEET and boards. Make crisp notes which u can revise few weeks before exam, as it isnot possible to study the entire book under such a limited time. \u201cYour own handwritten notes are your best companion for study\u201d If u really want to crack NEET in ur very 1st attempt without any coaching, u have to study smartly and religiously. Coaching institutes just provides u a direction and it is you who makes it upto the final list. Have a little faith in yourself, and study according to your own plans. Remember, success isnot a destination, it\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s high time now that u realise your dreams and with ur efforts and hard work bring the best possible result. Chase your Dream! ",

            "answer_text": "Dear, First of all just forget about the fact that \u201cWITHOUT COACHING YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO CRACK COMPETITIVE EXAMS\u201d. The most important thing that you should have during this time period is \u201cYOUR CONFIDENCE\u201d. Look the syllabus of neet and of class 11-12 are completely same but where the difference lies, is the pattern. In neet there are 180 questions and you have to solve that within 3 hrs/180 minutes. So the most important factor is speed. If you are in cbse board, things will be a little bit easier for you because you will have to read the same NCERT book for both NEET and boards. For biology don't go for other side books(like Trueman) . Stick to the NCERT and notes which you are making during your preparation phase. And solve more and more questions. If you don't know the answer of a particular question, bookmark that question for revision. If you have any doubts regarding any topic ask your school - teachers or seniors or you can watch a video regarding that topic from YouTube or unacademy app(I'll prefer unacademy app because it helps me a lot during my preparation). From chemistry point of view, if you read only NCERT you can easily solve the questions of organic and inorganic part which covers approximately 22-25 questions in Neet. Make your own notes and stick to that as well as NCERT. Solve questions from a standard book like GRB PUBLICATIONS /MS CHAUHAN(for organic) and also try to solve previous question papers of JEE MAINS and NEET. For physics, to be very frank NCERT is not going to help you. In my preparation phase I used to keep that book in the store room. Try to make your concepts crystal clear wrt physics. If you are weak in physics then make a copy in which you write all the possible formulas of each and every chapters and go through that copy everyday. Solve a lot of numerical as well as practise the previous question papers of NEET AND JEE MAINS. if you have a particular problem regarding any question throw that in front of your teacher. Don't hesitate to ask because questions can be asked from that topic. So you have to make your concepts very clear. And lastly - practice a full neet based question paper once a week during your boards exam and after boards try to solve a full 720 marks question paper per day. Trust me it will help you to boost your marks a lot. Thanks for reading. Hope it's going to help you :) ",

First of all,a big congratulations to you that you are planning to study without any tuitions and that too from the very beginning! Great!keep it up! See,Preparing for neet is not a very easy job.Though not impossible as well! So see what i suggest; Make sure u be high and elevated from day 1Read whatever taught on the same day, if u r a school student whatever taught in school should be bought to a very high Level by you at home.Buy neet books like USS for physics and other subjects.After working upon your concepts hav ample amoumt of practice from these books.Make sure you cover everything and dont waste ur precious time learning and mugging up stupid things ;best example is animal kingdom in zoology( toooo bad)For biology NCERT is more than needed! U hav to be very through wit it..i too scored 345/360 in biology section\u2026by doing nothing.I would assume that if u dont like physics\u2026work on it more until it falls in love with uConsult your friends going to such institutes for notes or any material help..true friends will definitely help.Make ur surroundings calm and peaceful.Practice practice practice\u2026till u achieve ur goalSubscribe some website which i used do. Thats what going to work . I hope u will work hard\u2026im there to help u \u2026best of luck. ",

Don't be feel demotivated even if you don't complete your task , but learn from that , I have wasted time in these bad things ( whichever are you facing like fb,insta,movie etc.) which I shouldn't do. Means you should use less as much as.During the preparation of lessons ,keep the latest paper or any paper of neet with you and see the mcq , how they are set or they twisted .so you get the idea of neet preparation clearly.Use First Ncert for biology ,then use trueman for theory understanding and mcq from errorless , for chemistry use errorless and op tandon and yes refers Ncert ,for physics use errorless or SL Arora.Always try to complete lesson from any reference which you have selected ,after that if you have time then refers another reference . Do tick or star which question are very good ,which help during your exam.You should buy the dlp of allen that test your command on subject and weakness .In mornings or during night (no problem ) try to meditate for 5 or 10 minute and think about what have you learn .And yes it advice that bring more reference for three subject ,try to refers lessons from any reference , so not bored with it.Last thing revison is very important ,you have to revise weekly .Ok, if you demotivated then see ,the mind transforming channel of sandeep maheswari or you can see albert Einstein biography in national geography channel .Virag Chaudhary's answer to What is the best way to prepare for NEET 2018? ||Thanks for my reading answer|| ",

            "answer_text": "This year paper was like walk in the park so there High chances that next year it's gonna be a bit harder and if you are 2022 aspirant you have enough time but it's better to play on safe, considering 2022 NEET cut off gonna be high again. Yes, you can do it by self studying only but if you are fresher you must take some guidance from those having experience. Recommend you to take YouTube help and if you have any friend who has appeared NEET. How will you prepare?  Focus more on Physics. Obviously here you don't require theoretical reading like Biology, so concentrate more on MCQs, solve at least 100 to 150 MCQs daily. Gradually increase the level (hope you have Idea about MCQ books) starting from your basic level to advanced. Don't forget to solve previous year questions.Biology: Read NCERT text book as many times as you can. Ready every single line every corner and all the diagram, tables and flow charts perfectly, because almost 80 to 85 questions are asked from NCERT itself. These 80 to 85 questions can make you score 320 to 340 marks if won't reduce your score in negative marking. Since 2 years all 90 Questions were asked from NCERT only \u2192 refer the above image. You can secure your negative marks if you have solved so many MCQs and previous year questions.Chemistry: Do focus more on organic chemistry because it's easy to understand but the questions are tricky. Again solving MCQs will help you to develop tricks to solve the reaction quickly. Inorganic chemistry is more scoring if concepts are very clear.Must solve MOCK PAPERS or TEST SERIES before 20 to 30 days before exam. Keep some 7 to 10 days to revise complete syllabus.If required any help feel free to direct contact on telegram channel \u201cNEET queries\u201d link in my profile Swapnil Dange Wish you the great success\u2026 Thank you so much!!

            "answer_text": "Thanks for requesting. Yes..madam..u can crack NEET easily through self study..I did.. And if I can u will definitely able to..so let's get started.. BIOLOGY: u have to read NCERT line by line . cover to cover..diagrams..labellings.. everything..Actually u have been told same thing again and again..Now be specified..why it is so? As I had witnessed NEET 2019..there is around 82\u201383 questions came directly from NCERT..And I who can't be considered even good in biology scored that well..And if u just finish NCERT alone then also u r confirmed to get 300+ at any cost..So,my advice is\u2026..Read NCERT..solve NEET pyq(upto 2000)..solve AIIMS pyq(upto 2006)\u2026NCERT at your fingertips..and read also Rahul chawla's handbook of biology..that's more than enough..CHEMISTRY: now for physical chemistry..focus more on sums as it comes often..1stly if u have any module..then read from them\u2026And if u r like me(\ud83d\ude01)..then read from NCERT with some online short videos from YouTube for doubts..now focus more on NEET 32 yrs pyq than Fingertips or any question bank..As I found the concepts are more or less same for many questions every yr..Now for INORGANIC,read NCERT textbooks..(now some tricks can be consulted from ATP in YouTube specially for chemical bonding..bond angle problems etc.)\u2026.read Intext questions (I found one in NEET from group chemistry)..again more focus on NEET pyq and AIIMS pyq..finally.. ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, my fav \u2026.focus deeply on GOC , HYDROCARBON..It has to be understood well..read from modules or read NCERT and do consult YouTube videos..also read NCERT..(in 2017, hydrocarbon configuration based one question copied from NCERT lines)so bttr to read..For class 12,solely dependent NCERTs..name reactions mechanisms of important ones..solve a lot.. from NEET pyq,JEE MAIN pyq(upto 2003)..MS chauchan can be solved if u have more than enough time..otherwise not preffered by me..PHYSICS:solve a lot..get formula book of Ur own..study from NCERT or modules \u2026thoroughly solve NEET pyq..they are going to save u when u r revising as well as if u r slight weak in it..solve AIIMS pyq also..note the mistakes..solve same concept sums..solve NEET guide more than enough if u solve that much also and revised with every concept..Now..have u mentioned I suggested NEET pyq..in every sub..u will understand why once u cracked it..As if NEET is a big exam blf me it has its weak points..it's own previous year papers..There rarely changing any pattern..And u have to identify just it..Harm the host with its own parasite.. Be ready..be focused..u will get Ur drm..if u have any problem..msg me in inbox..will try to solve it.. Hope it helps..!! ",

            "answer_text": "Just follow this as much as you can.. And you will be there :) - Read this overall guide for your preparation: The Complete NEET-AIIMS Guide: 1. Be sincere in your efforts (Half hearted efforts do not give fruitful results!) 2. Practice from limited and standard books like SL Arora HC VERMA, etc. Don\u2019t go for too many books. Do limited books, and do it more number of times. Become perfect in them. The end objective is to gain confidence. If you are able to get good marks and have gained confidence\u2026 That\u2019s it. You are there.. One should create a balance between doing and non-doing\u2026 One should not over-do anything! Over-doing brings dullness and self-doubt. 3. Get a good Guru, if you can find ! Guru is the person who knows what should be done and what should not be done. He/she is the best guide. 4.Focus more on previous year questions of NEET,AIIMS and other medical exams that were conducted earlier (statewise). Books to be used for theory and numerical: Chemistry: NCERT-most important. Other than that, for reference, use OP Tandon, MS Chouhan, Himanshu Pandey, Pradeeps, Morrison and Boyd, SN Sanyal etc. For Physical and Organic, you need to refer some books. In that too, NCERT will cover 80%+. Refer other books for that 20% left. Otherwise NCERT is brilliant for Chem. BIO: Start with NCERT, . Then go ahead with previous year questions. You can also refer to Trueman\u2019s for that little extra thing. 70-80 % NCERT will do. For that 20-30% extra, you need to refer to books like Truemans. Physics: Start with SL Arora and HC Verma. Then go ahead with previous year Questions directly. Also you can skip doing some questions of HC Verma if NEET is your target as they are meant for Engineering only.. Practice from MTG Books(as they are best for Medical with best solutions and almost all the answers are correct): MTG NEET Champion, NCERT at your fingertips, NEET Guide, MTG AIIMS Assertion and Reasons, MTG NEET 31 Years, MTG AIIMS 25 Years for all three subjects ! And if time permits, practice IIT JEE Mains questions too from Arihant 40 years (because many times questions repeat in Medical from IIT JEE). No need to do any other book!! No modules etc needed after this. But as I said, you should feel confident after this. That should come from within. Till that comes, keep practicing questions. Practice previous year questions MANY TIMES. Become perfect in them. Solve other people\u2019s doubts. That will help you score better :) (Whatever we give to the world comes back many times. Example: If you keep smiling, then people smile at you. That\u2019s the law of nature. You give Soan Papdi in Diwali to people and Soan Papdi will only come back. World is nothing but a reflection of you. Whatever you start thinking, starts manifesting. So always be positive. Be Happy and Spread the knowledge and it will come back to you !) People run after so many modules and crap test series (which are many times intentionally made tough by coaching institutes just to show off and students lose confidence after that. Just know one thing in life: Most important rule: WHATEVER YOU DO, WHATEVER HAPPENS, NEVER LOSE YOUR CONFIDENCE. Even if you fall, stand up again. And only those people fail, who try!). Instead you should focus on limited material and do it more number of times!! Many questions ask only basic concepts but a good clarity in them. Self study is definitely most important. But one thing I would like to say, even diamonds need to be polished to shine. So coaching brings that effect. If you have potential, a good coach can help you perform on that potential. So find one good Guru for yourself if you can! Time Management: Never look at what the clock is ticking.. You should study in a target based manner. A good candidate should do atleast 120 questions per day (PCB Combined) (and whatever time it takes. If it takes 2 hours, well enough. Enjoy after that. But if it requires whole day, be ready to give it. After all, its about your dream and your whole life!) . And every week, one should revise all his/her self made notes. If that happens whole year, marks my words: Result is guaranteed.. J Also, don\u2019t be so harsh on yourself. Life is a combination of being rigid and being flexible. You can take a day off every week in this process. That\u2019s not a problem at all. Mind should be happy too.. Otherwise if you just overuse it without giving it enjoyment and rest, then one day your mind will ditch you! It won\u2019t listen to you ! So keeping the mind happy is also very imp. Also from every chapter atleast 150-200 questions are a must to gain confidence.. More to remember: 1. Mantra: Arise awake and stop not till the goal is reached :) ~Swami Vivekananda 2. This is what Bruce Lee used to say: I do not fear the man who has practiced 10 thousand kicks once but the one who has practiced 1 kick 10 thousand times ! :) So do limited things and become prefect in them ! 3. Also, I recommend all my students to practice Sudarshan Kriya of the Art of Living. It gives you very good clarity of mind and keeps you focused in exams. In fact Nishita Purohit (AIIMS Rank 1) used to practice it daily ! Watch my video \u201cExam Tips\u201d on our youtube channel (Satnara IIT AIIMS Academy) to know exactly what to do in exam time..

            "answer_text": "Q- Can an average student crack the NEET without coaching? If yes, then how? A2A. Forget about NEET, forget about coaching centers. first try to understand that why a student is said to be an average student ? whats the problem with an average student ? so the problem with an average student is constancy and understanding. they lack constancy means they are irregular in studies like they start study whenever they want and stop whenever they want. It will just decrease the efficiency of understanding. second thing is they dont want to understand the topic they just learn it like learning physics derivations and learning math answers without understanding. so lets come to your question, if you wanna clear NEET you need constancy and understanding both together and yes, then you can clear NEET without any institute. it you want some other suggestion about NEET check out my previous answer. Hope this Helps. ",

            "answer_text": "To crack a prominent exam like NEET students require a lot of hard work and dedication. If a student aims to get a good rank in NEET he/she has to put in a lot of effort. He/she has to prepare their concepts thoroughly, solve a lot of problems and understand everything they are studying. Most people end up going for coaching because they believe that they can perform better if they join coaching. If you are not going to attend coaching you must have the ability to be able to study on your own. If you are studying on your own you must put in extra effort compared to when you go to a coaching. You must understand everything on your own or you must have someone who can explain whatever concept you have not understood even after repeated studying. You must have someone who can solve and explain how they did it to the questions that you were unable to solve on multiple tries. You must not lose concentration easily. You must also familiarise yourself with the exam environment so you must attempt a fixed amount of new problems in a fixed amount of time in an environment similar to exam. One method that students can try is check out some good online courses. The popular online courses are kaysons,etoos and byju. The best one among these is definitely kaysons. They provide very good online and downloadable video lectures and they explain the concepts wonderfully. Their study material includes books,a portal with over 30000 good questions and an efficient study planner. They also conduct regular mock tests and doubt removal courses and the best thing about them is that the course is exclusively for getting good scores in NEET and is very affordable. So if you are preparing for NEET without coaching you can definitely check out some good online courses. ",

Now if we talk about study material then firstly clear your all concepts from NCERT and i know its not much difficult task for brilliant students and i know you are one of them,so firstly clear all the basic points from NCERT or i say cramm it and be careful about the scientific names of various organisms given in NCERT. Now we further talk about some high study material then follow these points:- -for physics :solve HCV and also USS but its not enough, you have to solve a lot of questions or i say u have to solve atleast 100 numerical based on the concept you read that day. -for chemistry : Pardeep's is more than enough and also try to solve USS. -for biology: read as much you can ,i mean read from anywhere you got some informative thing and also try to cover truemen and GRB. At last prepare brief notes of every concept and also of formulas. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely u can do it believe.. Just believe in yourself.. Cracking neet from this year is not enough.. You have to score high to get a government seat in 2018.. Scoring high in Neet is not an easy task but it's not impossible also\u2026 3 things you need to fulfill your dream are- Sincerity.Motivation.Dedication.As you are talking about scoring high then you must be thinking about AIR also. Actually word AIR is the answer of your question because according to me AIR stands for A for attention I for intention and R for repetition. If you follow this thing you will definitely get high score my friend. Now you are going to do the most difficult task that is beginning. Most difficult part of any journey is beginning, my friend as you are ready to begin so it seems like your passion for your goal the people who have passion the greatest achievers. You have around 8 months so you have a lot of time to study just make a plan study two subjects a day but revise Bio on a daily basis because it covers the 50% of your Neet score card and for revising Physics and Chemistry just solve 40-45 questions daily but solving questions isn't enough set a time limit for you suppose first try to solve 45 questions in 60 minutes then from next two three days start solving 45 questions in 45 minutes then try to do it in 40 and so on. For the revising bio you can prefer mtg NCERT on your fingertips as your basics should be clear so you can use this book in biology. The most important thing that is don't use too many books just stick to your NCERT and some NCERT based reference books because the key point is neet is not about knowledge it just test your basic knowledge about the subject but what it actually test is your speed in examination hall in such a pressure you have to solve 180 questions in 180 minutes so there is only one key for scoring high in NEET that is speed and accuracy. I hope my answer helped you I have written this answer with whole of my knowledge and experience.. So please upvote if it you because your 1 second and one click will keep me motivated\u2026 and please follow me at Saksham Sharma to read my latest answers.. Keep reading\u2026 Thanks!

            "answer_text": "In neet 2020 there are many students who scored 650+ without taking coaching.Thus,proving that neet can be cracked without coaching too. Concentrate on completing the ncert of chemistry and biology and do questions which are strictly ncert based. For physics,refer notes made by you. U can take online classes on you tube which are free of cost so that u can make appropriate notes for yourself and clear ur concepts. Practice more and more questions.U should do reference books as u may not have modules,if u have them then practice from those first and then go for other books. U can prefer MTG FINGERTIPS for all subjects(personal choice,u can go for others also). Stick to only one reference book for one subject each as using many of them will lead to confusion and u will not be able to practice much. Do not forget to read ncert books atleast 60 times before the exam date. Study 8 to 9 hours daily,be consistent towards studies,make a perfect strategy and time table to manage ur time,give equal time to every subject and spare sometime for yoga or any sport as it will make u healthy and will relieve stress.Work hard on ur weak sections,practice them more and more Procrastination is a big No. Have believe and self confidence in urself. Hard work,dedication and determination are the key factors to win everything u desire of. Hope this helps.Let me know if it does! All the best!! ",

            "answer_text": "NEET without coaching can be a difficult task as a person can struggle for motivation due to the lack of severe competition that exists in the coaching classes. But if you don't have problem finding motivation you can easily crack NEET and even AIIMS. Refer to the following books, you don't even need to buy a DLP PHYSICS Resnick Halliday- just for reading theory and get a grip on concepts HCV and DC PANDEY for problem solving. This will give you a good grip on subject and you'll start enjoying physics. Also read the NCERT for AIIMS a&r. Inorganic Chemistry Nothing but NCERT. For AIIMS you can supplement it by Modern's ABC of chemistry Physical Chemistry NCERT and R.C. MUKHERJEE ( some might say that this book is not required, as it is jee level and all, but I find this to be the best book for self prep) Organic Chemistry This is tricky. Start with the NCERT (sufficient for NEET), take a book just to understand the mechanisms as for AIIMS you'll require an in-depth knowledge of mechanisms. You can refer to S.N. Sanyal, Solomon's or Morrison and Boyd. Any one. Biology Just the NCERT and some book to practice MCQs like NCERT at your fingertips or any book of your choice. There are plenty of publishers like Disha, arihant etc. Also join a test series and try and give the tests on schedule if online. This helps you keep on track with your syllabus. Also don't worry about the marks that you get in the tests initially, trust me that is the biggest mistake you can make. Rather just try and improve with every test. ",

            "answer_text": "NEET is a very knowledge intensive exam and it completely depends on how well you have grasped the syllabus of class xi and xii. If you don't want to take classroom coaching then u must -Enroll for a distance learning or a e learning program from a good institute.the advantage of this is explained in below points. Make NCERT as the base of your preparationFor each topic first do the ncert. That will help you build a strong foundation. After ncert do the same topic from the e-learning or distance learning module. This will further build upon the concepts. Solve lots of questions of the topic including the ones that have been asked in previous years exams. Take doubts clearing support from e-learning or distance learning institute.You must cover all topics like this. A good test series is absolutely necessary for success in NEET. Attempt the test series as per the schedule.NEET needs a dedicated preparation. If you are in class 10 as of now then start your preparation immediately after reaching class XI. The xi class year specially the summer holidays are the most important and must be utilized to the fullest. If you are in class xi as of now, this is the correct time to start. Don't waste even a single day now. If you are in class XII then preparation needs to be balanced with class xii boards. Dont make the mistake of ignoring class xii boards.The competition is fierce and only a focussed and dedicated plan with relentless execution is the only way for success All the best ",

            "answer_text": "You require a lot of self discipline if you are to do it all without coaching. Those who go to coaching just get an edge over you and they stay regular with their studies as they get lesser time to self study, which is not the case with you. I would recommend the following- Keep weekly targets. This is because this is exactly what coaching classes do. They have weekly tests conducted each week.Your weekly targets should include MINIMUM 3\u20134 chapters PER subject per week. Be very strict with your targets.For every chapter, do ncert first. Even for physics, just go through it at least. Then, go for other reference books for theory. While for bio in theory maximum focus should be on ncert, you can use trueman for relevant extra points, for chem, you can use GRB books, while for physics, HCV or SL Arora are good. Do not waste too much time on theory though.Take one standard objective book. Keep practicing every chapter. You may add more objective books, though.Join a test series. You haven't joined a coaching institute, that's fine. But test series is of utmost importance as it gives you an idea about the exam, the questions and most importantly, about where you stand.Do not lose track of what you did last week. Keep revising.Attempt to finish the whole neet syllabus by January. If you're in class 11th right now, finish the 11th syllabus by December this year.",

            "answer_text": "It will be tough. Stick to NCERT course. Revise bio every morning for atleast an hour . If you are in a dummy school or a dropout, then you will get atleast 5 hours more to study. To strengthen concepts of physics, buy Halliday -Resnick -Walker for strengthening concepts. Keep remembering the constants value. Strengthen your basic concepts of maths like logarithms, differentiation and integration, power and general maths which will happen only when you keep solving questions. Buy Arihant , MTG and other MCQ books of your preference. Keep asking questions and solving questions. For chemistry NCERT is a must. Try to remember every fact as there is a high probability that any minute fact can be asked, especially in inorganic. Understand physical and organic. Each and every reaction is important. Solve MTG and Arihant. I would suggest Bhakta and Ghosh for solving organic. For biology rote learning is required. Understand the physiology learn morphology. Baki sab moh maya hai. Solve questions and note extra information in the questions. For those who are in school I would suggest making a time table. Peace. ",

I advice you to keep away from social networking sites specially facebook and if you have internet than deactivate it now and plan your whole 2 year. As i observe during my journey there are lot of my friend who don\u2019t make their own plan and just time pass on facebook and always says me that why you not come online are you dumb like that comment. But i persist on my words which i say to myself and now i achieve what i want to achieve. Take a test series so that it checks your performance.

Where they take weekly test at a particular test center( no matter where you live they will allot you a test center) . Study according to the test. Focus on syallabus.

Be prepared for a tough competition as the increment of seats in medical colleges is also expected to be very less for the next 2 years. First, from my personnel experience shut all your future travel plans as it could be a major distraction for you. Secondly, have a firm time table for your studies. The timetable question I\u2019ve answered down below. Thirdly, make your basics and foundations as strong as possible and practice as many questions as you can. Memorize Biology NCERT of 11th and 12th STD by heart and give ample amount of time to physics and chemistry questions. Make your organic chemistry as strong as possible as it carries maximum weightage. Last but not the least, have fun studying the subject and have a fixed relaxation time everyday. Make good friends who can help you with your doubts. Clear your queries with your lecturers at the same moment and don\u2019t pile it up for the last. Remember, becoming a Doctor for the world is a privilege on itself. All the Best and try to score above 600 out of 720 in NEET UG. ",

            "answer_text": "Though you require specific preparation strategy along with guidance to ace NEET, disciplined approach towards preparation and consistency are keys to crack this exam. Coaching is considered to be a 'must' for preparation of the coveted exam. Coaching centres actually don't teach anything new to the students, rather they just brush-up their skills. All you need to succeed in NEET is belief in your hard work and consistent preparation. The main purpose of coaching is to bring in a sense of competition among the aspirants so that they put continued effort in outsmarting their peer group member. But self-study is something that you can't do away with. This is the path that will help you in clearing the coveted medical entrance examinations.Regular Studies is a mustAs you go without coaching classes, the first and foremost thing to keep in mind is your self-discipline towards your preparation strategy. NEET aspirants must understand that it is only their hard work and determination that will help them crack the exam. A sense of self-discipline in following preparation strategy is the key. Requirement of Quality Study MaterialSince you will not have a mentor guiding you every time, selecting best study material for your preparation journey is important for you. Refer the books which are considered the best during their preparation time. Students are advised to necessarily go through NCERT Books, practice from previous years\u2019 question papers and refer the other important books. Solve a lot of questions and get the doubts clarified from your teachers. Analysing the past years' question papers and solving a lot of MCQs can help you get success. ",

In coaching classes you have no excuse of anything and for those 7\u20138 hours you are solely dedicating your time for studies.Self studies are the best choice to clear any competitive examination as you are teaching yourself and would be knowing everything about it.If you are that much dedicated towards your studies then you should go for self studies.Firstly get any of the online course popular these days, assure it with them that these classes had already covered the whole course. Because they fraud students with half of the content of NEET/IITJEE/NTSE course.Before purchasing any video course ask for the course content and then decide whether that course would be enough for you or not.These course will guide you just like coaching classes does. Just ask for the updated version and keep asking for updation what so ever comes in those two years.After you get any of these online course, Make a timetable.Make slots of studying and revising.Practice the solution as many times you can.Understand the theory portion in your regional language and which ever you are use to and after understanding write it down.Take proper meal.Take light meal at night.Keep a distance from gadgets, they consume a lot of time.Keep yourself updated about all the news regarding your exams and course.I would still recommend to get yourself a coaching class, but if you have the will to do self studies go for it.Self studies are the best option but only if you are serious enough for that.

You need to attend coaching classes to get a teacher led instruction to tackle NEET exam. At the same time, you need to supplement your NEET study and preparation with good tools. There are a few Apps that can help you in NEET preparation. One of them I highly recommend is 'The Victo NEET Challenge App'' This App has has NEET challenges. NEET challenges are nothing other than the timed mock NEET exams that are pre-scheduled. Just like your real NEET exam, several students or NEET aspirants take the exam at the same time. So, this gives you the feel of a real NEET exam. The best part is once you submit the exam, You will come to know your score within a short period of time after you submit your NEET challenge and you can also gauge where you stand in the competition among your peers. This will help you change your studying strategy, concentrate on your weak areas more and you will also come to know the difficulty level of questions. With constant practice on this app, you will be mastering not only the syllabus, but also the complete exam pattern. ",

Be sincere in your efforts (Half hearted efforts do not give fruitful results!) 2. Practice from limited and standard books like SL Arora HC VERMA, etc. Don\u2019t go for too many books. Do limited books, and do it more number of times. Become perfect in them. The end objective is to gain confidence. If you are able to get good marks and have gained confidence\u2026 That\u2019s it. You are there.. One should create a balance between doing and non-doing\u2026 One should not over-do anything! Over-doing brings dullness and self-doubt. 3. Get a good Guru, if you can find ! Guru is the person who knows what should be done and what should not be done. He/she is the best guide. 4.Focus more on previous year questions of NEET,AIIMS and other medical exams that were conducted earlier (statewise). Practice previous year questions MANY TIMES. Become perfect in them. Solve other people\u2019s doubts. That will help you score better :) (Whatever we give to the world comes back many times. Example: If you keep smiling, then people smile at you. That\u2019s the law of nature. You give Soan Papdi in Diwali to people and Soan Papdi will only come back. World is nothing but a reflection of you. Whatever you start thinking, starts manifesting. So always be positive. Never forget hardwork always defeats talent eventually. ",

And if you want more stuff to be added along with latest exam patterns and the topics that you haven't covered earlier, then go for coaching. There are number of institutions and coaching centres to teach along with online platforms. So, search within your city, if you belong to metro cities. And if you are from any of the towns or districts, then also search online for best platforms that coaches for Neet exam. Aakash Institutte for Jee/medical, Kota of rajhasthan, and some other institutions left In Bangalore, Hyd etc. Note- Please discuss about this well with your school teachers, your seniors who attended the exam, your mentors, any college professors near to you.

However i wish i had this amount of courage to do this because now the way i see i understand that it was my self study that helped me clear NEET. However this doesn\u2019t mean the coaching institutes are useless. The teachers there give guidance to you which is very important. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t join any classes but there should be someone who has experience in guiding you towards your goal. You have to do regular study with quick revision tests and a whole lot of MCQ. ONE should not be afraid of the challenges that will come in your way. The main point i would like to stress upon is that preparing for any entrance exam requires a lot of regularity which is lost by most of the aspirants. If one is regular with his/her studies it doesn\u2019t matter if you are in a coaching class or not you will get through the difficult path and towards your goal. Some of the books i used are given in the link below: What are the best books and materials for NEET? However you can take the online or offline test series of either Aakash or Allen which will help you to see where u stand between your fellow aspirants. Thanks for reading\u2026 All the best ",

But really telling you there are lots of coaching classes and you never know which classes is really good. So the best way is self study. I qualified Neet with a score of 573 without coaching classes. All you need to qualify neet is regularly and aim oriented study which means a daily if minimum 6-8 hours. First of all you need to be thorough with ncert especially in biology and chemistry because these are the subjects in which you will have to mug up a lot. Talking about physics its just about how much you practice the sums, the more you practice the better you get the concept. Books which you must follow is Ncert for biology and chenistry and fir physics I would prefer HC VERMA as this book teaches you the concept. And remember neet can never be qualified in 2 days studies it requires a lot of dedication and years of hard work (at least 1).So daily you must be revising both your 11th and 12th topic and till last you have to do the same. This way you can easily qualify for neet. Best Of Luck for your Neet. May you get you dream college\u2026 ",

He should maintain sincerity and give much time for self study but not in board oriented way as its not a paper which you can solve by learning but by giving max time in understanding He should follow Ncert strictly as neet is mainly ncert oriented. He should at least take test series as it maintain continuity of study and mark out all difficulties any student face during exam. But if is not able to take test series then he should try to solve more questions but in smarter way. And at last he should solve at least 15 years question papers many times. ",

So forget the fear and get started well begun is half done For neet : Chemistry - ncert texts are more than sufficient Physics - go through ncert problems and theory and then solve mock tests for grip over solving Biology - complete ncert + any master resource book which is published by standard publications Practice is key Solving mock papers is must Once theory is done from textbooks solve past year papers if you have less time then go through solved past year papers that makes the work faster but make sure you understand fully Doubnut is the best app when you come acrros doubts For mock no need for external source use NTA app Keep motivated and do well !

No out of the box thinking is required unlike exams like JEE(Adv) and the erstwhile AIIMS/JIPMER. Command over NCERT is the only prerequisite for this stereotype exam, which is quite attainable even if you are not enrolled in any Coaching Institute. The only thing which may stand in your way is the relative lack of test practice. Therefore, it is advisable to enroll in a \u201cTrusted\u201d test series if you do not opt for Classroom Course in any Coaching Institute. That'd give you the X factor you need apart from your regular consistent studies. I've always believed that the best way to revise something is to give a Test and then analyse it \u201cComprehensively\u201d. All in all, you could say that cracking NEET will surely be a cakewalk if you follow the right strategy. It hardly matters whether you join any specific coaching or not. All the Best!! ",

            "answer_text": "Well answer to your question is definitely Yes. I gave neet last year and dropped this year and took coaching from Aakash JanakPuri that to in the batch in which HOD(Head of the Department) takes class. It was way better than my previous coaching which was Aakash only but a Franchise branch. I don't know that if you will be giving Neet for the first time but if you are in 12 and will be giving for the first time i would suggest to join a coaching to get the exposure which is very crucial it gives you a reality heck and help you in deciding how much more you need to work hard. If you have already have, had the experience of coaching then i guess it becomes a bit easier for you to decide how you should prepare. At the end of it , It doesn't matter from where you took coaching your self study and hard work are the only things which will take you to your dream. So the bottomline is if you already have experienced the coaching or you are a dropper you have already have enough exposure and you can achieve it by your self study and hardwork , your previous coaching study material would also help you alot. well i can tell you about Aakash package its good and its section A and C are must that to atleast 3\u20134 times and then you can do other objective questions. if you have decided to do it without coaching then i would suggest you atleast 10 hours self study that to with full concentration and you would be sitting in a govt medical college next year. I know 10 hours daily sounds insane but if you manage that then you would be able to achieve your target no matter what. Please aim for 600+. But if you would ask me personally i would suggest you to join a coaching as it kinda makes it easy to fight depression to which you are very prone at this phase. In coaching you meet others just like you and it helps you and competitive friends are always a boon. That are the insides i know and hope it helps you to decide best for yourself. P;ease try to include other info about you like if you are a dropper and if you have already taken coaching would have helped me to answer you more precisely but its ok hope it helps you and Best of Luck for your future. In the end if you dont join any coaching please definitely join Test series of Aakash Or Allen can join both but i would suggest allen . ",

The only purpose of a coaching is to provide you material, some basic concept clarity, a proper schedule and tests for practice. These things can be arranged for at your home as well. As far as material is considered, ask someone who has cleared the exam for their books. Those books will also be marked for important questions! NCERT can give good concept clarity at home itself. You just need the patience to read it twice or thrice. After this you also have various youtube channels which give free lectures. Use Khanacademy for plant physiology, they give amazing and simplified lectures for free. You can also find several sample papers online. Previous year NEET and state PMT papers can also be downloaded for practice. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "NEET is a challenging exam and both self study and coaching classses are equally important. You need to attend coaching classes to get a teacher led instruction to tackle NEET exam. At the same time, you need to supplement your NEET study and preparation with good tools. There are a few Apps that can help you in NEET preparation. One of them I highly recommend is 'The Victo NEET Challenge App'' This App has has NEET challenges. NEET challenges are nothing other than the timed mock NEET exams that are pre-scheduled. Just like your real NEET exam, several students or NEET aspirants take the exam at the same time. So, this gives you the feel of a real NEET exam. The best part is once you submit the exam, you will get the score instantly and you can also gauge where you stand in the competition among your peers. This will help you change your studying strategy, concentrate on your weak areas more and you will also come to know the difficulty level of questions. With constant practice on this app, you will be mastering not only the syllabus, but also the complete exam pattern. ",

Always give priority to the study and be regular.

Also joining a test series keeps u motivated to finish the syllabus in time. good luck ",

Clearing neet from this year is not enough.. You have to score high to get a government seat in 2018.. Scoring high in Neet is not an easy task but it's not impossible also\u2026 3 things you need to fulfill your dream are- Sincerity.Motivation.Don't be a follower and join the coaching classes if you have the will power and passion about it then you can definitely crack it from your home itself.All you need is a good support system to help you and guide you the right direction to go on. In my opinion go for M-Learning India online classes where you are taught online and given lectures on each and every topic by qualified teachers. They have interactive class and don't use the traditional methods to teach where you get to sleep. In this way you will save your money and time as well. They have their own M-Learning Study Material which is effective for the preparation of competitive examination like NEET, IIT JEE. They also keep you updated with the new pattern in which questions can be put up. To test your knowledge go for their question series and test series. Don't worry about the doubts each week they conduct their doubt classes where you can get all your confusion done. I hope my suggestion works for you. Good luck ",

Yeah but for a few topics I did hire some tutors. Well you can join distance learning programmes of institutes like Allen and akash or you can use their i tutors. Read biology textbook multiple times so that your concepts get clear. For physics and chemistry 1st try to understand the concepts take good time to do that. Thenafter look at several solve examples. You can use HC Verma for physics to see solved ones and then practice as many questions as you can. The ones you cannot solve see the solution directly and then understand it. Yeah but sometimes you would come across the problem that the solution isn't given then google. In the end solve as many test series as you can. Hope this helps. Thanks. ",

For that there should be some arrangement to clear your doubts. For this purpose , personal coaching for once a week may be useful during the last 2\u20133 months at home.
