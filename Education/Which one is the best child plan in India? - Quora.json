            "answer_text": "My humble request to all those who are reading this post , please please please don't waste your hard earned money in trash products like child education or marriage plan . Remember these are nothing but a toxic product called ULIP coupled with endowment plan. Example of these so called junk policies are Bharti AXA Life Child Advantage Plan HDFC SL YoungStar Super Premium Exide Life MeraAshirvaad Plan SBI Life Smart champ Insurance Plan HDFC SL YoungStarSuper Premium Exide Life MeraAshirvaad Plan SBI Life Smart champ Insurance Plan LIC Jeevan Tarun Max life insurance young genius and so on. Believe me these are nothing but junk. Which are only allowed in India. Remember you just cannot club insurance and investment together. Its like selling a fruit and a vegetable. Your entire premium will go in vain. Fixed deposits in India yield around 8% compounded annually. Whereas these junks have never returned more than 5% ever. You can verify these facts on their website. I believe that you are looking for a child plan because you think education will be very expensive or u have to save a huge amount for your child's marriage say 20years from now. Your requirements are absolutely justifiable, but if you ever fall into the trap of insurance advisors, your entire money will be wasted and under any circumstances you objectives pertaining to the future of your child will never be fulfilled. So what can you do? There are two distinct paths:- Say you want to build a corpus of Rs 15\u201320 lakhs for your child's marriage after 20 years. So all that you can do is buy a Sovereign gold bond each year worth Rs 50,000 i.e 10 lakhs/20 years.These bonds are sold by RBI every year through your bank. You can Google it. Not only that the entire amount you receive is tax free. Also RBI pays an annual interest of about 2% till you sell your bonds. Now gold has given over 50% returns . So your 10lakhs investment will grow upto 20\u201325 lakhs in 20 years.If you want to save money for your child's foreign education and ensure that his education remains uninterrupted in case of the death of his/her guardian, then take a term insurance policy of Rs 1 crore by just paying premium of 8\u201310k per year. I would recommend Max life insurance or Icici term plans because they have a great history of settlement of claims. Now this was the insurance related part. For your investment, open a mutual fund account in your bank or use apps like ET money or paytm money to invest money in mutual fund through systematic investment planHope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "I know why most of the people buy Child policies because they are SOLD SUCH POLICIES by near relative or neighborhood guy or friend who is working with a insurance company and finds the reason of child birth, to loot your money. I believe and I bet if any body can challange - Oy one insurance is right and that is child insurance. A typical child insurance is endowment product where major part of your premium goes towards paying commission and administration charges of company in first year. From second year major part goes towards savings and balance towards commissions and insurance. Major loot is - High commission - Many of the banks and corporate agents get 70% commission on first year prepremiumso it means your first year premium is not there at all.Savings at poor returns - most of the endowment policies end up giving 4\u20135% return on long term. Due to the fact that they have conservative investment in debt and some part in equity and that too with lot of opaque charges structure.Insurance - reason you buy child insurance is that in case something happens to father, your child will not suffer. But have you checked what is the insurance amount. You can get ten times higher cover by paying smaller amount of premium in case you buy term insurance.Bottom line is nobody buys child insurance. It is sold and missold to near and dear ones. I was chipkaoed a child insurance when I got a kid. It was forced gift to me by my neighborhood uncle who was unfortunately having lot of good wishes for me. But during the process he must have got 30000Rs commission by just been unshamfull ",
