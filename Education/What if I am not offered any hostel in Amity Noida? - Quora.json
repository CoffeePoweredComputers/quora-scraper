            "answer_text": "Actually it is very late now for Hostel admission. There has always been a problem of Hostel in Amity Noida. But no worries, there are other options, that are actually better than Hostel. There are many PGs near Amity, some of them are at walking distance and some of them are not(but those are too not too much far). But the point is that you may easily get a PG with some of them providing better services and facilties than the Hostel. They also has less restrictions and you can visit places(which you can only do on weekends if you opt for Hostel). You can also opt from many fltas that people give on rent, but that option is better for people who have studied at Amity for some time, because they can find some friends with whom they can share the flat and its rent so that it is not so much costly for them. So your best option for now is a PG, then after an year or two, you can choose a flat to live in with some of your friends. One of my friend opted for Hostel in his first year(he got a non-AC) and wasn\u2019t happy about it, so he now found a flat and some of his friends to share it with them. It will cost him not more than \u20b97\u20138 thousand including all bills(electricity and water etc) per person. So this option is much better for him because of less restrictions, more freedom, better friends to share the flat with, and AC(which he wasn\u2019t able to get in Hostel). If you are going to get in Amity Noida, I would like to make one thing very clear, there will be too much distractions, so it is better to focus on your studies rather than on those distractions. I am not saying that you don\u2019t enjoy your college life and have fun, but do that in a limit so that it doesn\u2019t affect you or your future. ",
