            "answer_text": "Online cannot replace face-to-face sessions in the skill-based learning areas (Music, Art, PE, Agri-Fisheries, Home Economics, Entrepreneurship, Industrial Arts), however with content-based learning areas (Values Education, English, Foreign Language, Math, Science, History) it can but requires a different set of skills for teacher and not all countries can do it. It requires a different set of skills for teachers because it requires us to think more creatively. You can compare it this way, we compare it to an NBA player with tons of achievements like maybe Lebron James (I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s good, I\u2019m not an NBA fan), even if he excels in the Basketball Court, you cannot just assume that he will easily beat you in NBA 2k19, because he needs a different set of skills to be just as good in a virtual world. Just like teachers, teaching online requires different set of skills, requires a lot more creativity, etc. It is also not doable in all countries because in some countries most learners don\u2019t have a computer, much less an access to an internet connection ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, incoming future if corona problem will not go away then definitely google classroom will replace traditional classrooms. Google Classroom provides the same feeling that you are in the classroom teaching, giving classwork or homework, checking and giving feedback to students work. Problem with google classroom is that you cant do face to face teaching, for this you can use meet, skype or Zoom. Using both apps you can have your virtual classroom anywhere and you can teach any number of students. Even in normal days, it's also very useful, suppose you are absent from your school and want to send some teaching material to your students so that other substitute teachers can easily manage your class and make your class time more productive. Just post that day work on google classroom and inform substitute teacher regarding this. This way students will be engaged in your class even you are not in the class. ",

During class, students can participate in real-time with teachers and classmates. This creates additional learning opportunities beyond the course content. Students can ask questions and get clarification on things they are uncertain of. Thanks ",
