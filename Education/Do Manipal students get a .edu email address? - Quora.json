            "answer_text": "No, Manipal students dont get a .edu email address. There are a lot of things outside .edu prerequisite. I agree you want to learn from good websites but if you could just learn properly in class/learn from books that will be significant enough. Email id is not a basic need and i personally think only basic needs have to be fulfilled. Its cumbersome to design a .edu email with gmail features and hence .edu will always take a backseat. If i design a better .edu then i'll start a competitive company to google or yahoo.                No, not having a .edu email has no impact while applying to universities abroad. Infact .edu email will be closed once you leave Manipal and admissions abroad normally happen months after you pass out. No NIT's give .edu email to students but still they are good. Even IIT students dont use .edu email as there are lot of issues in it.             Even IIT professors use gmail or other emails though they have .edu email. Instead of having a less useful .edu email its better to use better email IDs. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, one can get a edu mail prefixed with learner @manipal.edu. the regular.edu mail ID are meant for faculties of the university only, that gets blocked once the faculty resigns. However, the learner.edu mail can be used forever. Either of the mail id's are important for many purposes ns the most imp I felt was for higher studies application process and to have an access to follow scientific personnel, publications such as researchgate. For one to have a mail ID, one have to fill a form available with the IT dept with mandatory signature from the HOD. The regular mail ID request will be part of the duty reporting formality kit. ",
