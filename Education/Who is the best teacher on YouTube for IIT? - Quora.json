            "answer_text": "It's very good that you are going to get your preparation done through video lectures. Because it is more time efficient than attending coaching classes. But as we search for the best teacher in coaching classes\u2026 Similarly we also need a good tutor's video lectures for out well preparation. If you are searching for free video lectures on youtube then I would like to suggest you that stop this. Because none of the free video lectures are authentic and complete. If you are still searching for such free videos then you are wasting your time. You will only get advertisements there. Even if you find a good one.. You will get it as incomplete upload. Instead of searching for free video lectures \u0917\u094b for paid video lectures like Kaysons\u2026 There you will be provided a guaranteed and complete course of your syllabus. Instead of this you will also be given test papers, practice papers and other study materials. All video lectures are been taught by IITians and all teachers are well experienced. There you will also be able to complete your course in efficient time and get sufficient time for revision too. They also provide you opportunity to test your preparation by appearing in all India test series. So go for paid video lectures and do your best there. All the very best! ",
