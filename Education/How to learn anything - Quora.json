            "answer_text": "The best way to learn something is to first understand how the process of learning works. Eric Scott's story nailed it. There are key fundamentals behind his story that explains why the group who practised the most was the one that learned how to make the best pot. If you haven't read it yet, go check it. But don't forget to come back and read the rest of this answer. :) Most of us spend some good time trying to learn new things, but actually how many of us have ever stopped to think about the key principles behind the learning process? I was one of those who never thought about it. Not that my way of learning was bad. I just didn't know all the factors involved, so I couldn't get the most out of it. One day I stumbled upon a course called \"Learn how to Learn\" [1] and decided to give it a try. I am really glad I did it. Since then, I've been reading quite a few materials on the topic and trying to put it into practice as much as I can. So let me share with you my key learnings on learning how to learn: Let your diffuse mode step in If you want to learn something more effectively, you need to alternate between focused and diffuse mode. These are the 2 different modes your brain uses when you are learning, and you can't use both at the same time. The focused approach relates to intense concentration on a specific problem or concept, while the diffuse mode allows you to think more broadly and have the big-picture perspective [2]. The Diffuse mode is very helpful in learning, especially when you are learning something completely new. That's because it allows your brain to jump from one idea to another, without being stuck in your old knowledge. But how can you let your diffuse mode step in? One good way of doing it is just to leave what you are doing and go for a walk. When you stop focusing intently on the problem and go for a walk, you let your diffuse mode step in and work behind the scenes for you. Have you ever had a problem that you couldn't find a solution and then suddenly after a good night of sleep you woke up with a brilliant idea? That's because sleeping is another moment when your brain naturally falls into the diffuse mode. According to legend, Thomas Edison knew the importance of the diffuse mode. When faced with a problem, Edison would sit and relax in his chair, holding ball bearings in his hand. He would then relax away letting his mind run free until fall as sleep. Once he felt as sleep, the ball bearings would drop and make him wake up with the noise. He would then get back to his work and take advantage from the ideas he got while in diffuse mode. [3] Structure your learning before you get started Frequently, when there's something new that we want to learn, we tend to rush into it without properly structuring how we are going to approach the subject. If you spend some time planning and identifying the key parts of your learning before you get started, it will surely make things much easier for you. So, the first thing you should do is to clearly understand the big picture: - What are the most important elements? - How do they connect with each other? - Which ones should come first? - How your learning roadmap looks like? Building chunks is a vital part of this process. Chunking refers to organizing pieces of information together, and it makes information easier to process and remember [4]. So let's say that you are learning how to create instructional videos with Power Point, so you can promote your business online. In this example, you could have the following chunks: - Content - Design of Presentation - Record & Editing - Voice-over - Marketing Now that you have your chunks, let's choose one of them and break it down. I'll take the \"Design of Presentation\" for this example. The pieces of information or elements from this chunk could possibly be: - Typography - PPT Background - Formatting - Images Got it? The next step should be to connect the dots. Like I said in the beginning, how each point is linked to the others? Is it possible to work on the voice-over before having the content? Do I need to record the Power Point slides while narrating the story or I can do it separately? Once you start to see how each element plays with others, it will become obvious to you how the roadmap looks like. Now you see why it's essential to see the big picture before getting started? Another important aspect of structuring your learning is related to how you approach these elements. As you will see in my next point, spaced repetition is critical to form strong chunks. That's why it's a good idea to plan ahead the time that you allocate to your studies, and recall what you have learned. Spaced Repetition vs Over-learning One of the best ways to build solid chunks is to use spaced repetition. Spaced repetition means that you consistently practice what you are learning over a period of time, spacing out the repetitions to improve retention. What some people do instead is over-learning. In other words, they spend hours and hours studying a new material and then have the misleading idea that they dominate the subject. The problem is that a few days later these people won't be able to recall what they have studied that day. Well, this is the classic case of the student who studies a little every day and the one who leaves everything to the last days. Who do you think gets a better grade in the end? Like Hermann Ebbinghaus demonstrated in the forgetting curve [5], there is an exponential loss of memory in our brain, unless information is reinforced. Here is a graph to show you how to implement spaced repetition against the forgetting curve:  How spaced repetition improves recall [6] But please, don't fool yourself. If you use spaced repetition just to reread the material again, this will not really work for you. The best thing to do is to actively recall what you have learned and test yourself. This will not only help you to build more solid chunks but also to find your weak points. Shift your focus from the product to the process Procrastination... You know this famous word, right? In fact, procrastination is your number one enemy when trying to learn something new. Like we said above, in order tu build solid chunks you need to practice using spaced repetition. But what if when it arrives the time to study you just don't feel like doing it? Most of the time, a good reason for our lack of motivation is determined by the way we approach learning. We usually put our focus on the product, instead of on the process. Let's use Scott's story as an example: The first group put their focus on the end product: You have to come out with the perfect pot. Now think about it. How stressful is the idea that you have never done something like that before and then suddenly you need to achieve almost perfection? That's what we usually do when we start learning something new. We focus on mastering the subject instead of on small improvements every day. Can you imagine how the \"product group\" was afraid to get started with their pot? How much thinking did they put before even getting their hands dirty? And how much frustration they would feel when something wasn't exactly how they expected? In the other hand, the other group just had to make sure that they were creating pots. As soon as they created a pot, they accomplished something. When you accomplish something, you feel rewarded and motivated to keep going. The process ultimately led this group to create the best pot. Work hard on developing the skill - Deliberate Practice \"Deliberate Practice does not involve a mere execution or repetition of already attained skills, but repeated attempts to reach beyond one's current level which is associated with frequent failures.' - K. Anders Ericsson [7] In a few words, deliberate practice is what leads you to continual improvement. James clear once posted a quite interesting story from Kobe Briant [8], the basketball player, which can brilliantly exemplify this idea: From Robert, trainer for Team USA: I was invited to Las Vegas to help Team USA with their conditioning before they headed off to London. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade in the past, but this would be my first interaction with Kobe. The night before the first scrimmage, I had just watched \u201cCasablanca\u201d for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. A few minutes later, I was in bed, slowly fading away, when I heard my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up. \u201cHey, uhh, Rob, I hope I\u2019m not disturbing anything right?\u201d \u201cUhh, no. What\u2019s up Kob?\u201d \u201cJust wondering if you could help me out with some conditioning work, that\u2019s all.\u201d I checked my clock. 4:15 AM. \u201cYeah sure, I\u2019ll see you in the facility in a bit.\u201d It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and get out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor, I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn\u2019t even 5:00 AM. We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then, we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that, we parted ways. He went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow. I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11:00 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. (Thanks, Kobe.) I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility. This next part I remember very vividly. All of the Team USA players were there. LeBron was talking to Carmelo and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility Kobe was by himself shooting jumpers. I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, \u201cGood work this morning.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cLike, the conditioning. Good work.\u201d \u201cOh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.\u201d \u201cSo when did you finish?\u201d \u201cFinish what?\u201d \u201cGetting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?\u201d \u201cOh, just now. I wanted 800 makes. So yeah, just now.\u201d You see where Kobe was putting his focus on? He wanted 800 makes. Not 1 hour or 2 practising shoots. He was committed to continuously improve his shoot. Not to spend a certain amount of time shooting. This difference in approach can make a huge difference in your learning curve. Are you going to study Physics for 1 hour or are you going to solve 10 problems? James Clear also mentioned two other important points about deliberate practice in another article: [9] 1 - Each practice session should be focused on one individual skill. In Kobe's story it was on improving his shooting. 2 - Usually, each skill built upon the one before it. If you ever played basketball, you learned that the movement of your legs are crucial for a good shoot. Kobe Briant certainly worked hard on this skill before getting into the 800 makes. Einstellung and Illusions of Competence Well, the same way it's important to know what helps on your learning, it's also important to be aware of what works against it. Einstellung is a classic problem. The Einstellung effect is the negative effect of previous experience when solving new problems [10]. Can you recall a situation where you kept trying the same thing over and over again, even though it wasn't working at all? Einstellung sometimes works as a roadblock, where you can't see the problem from a different perspective. The best way to fight this problem is to basically avoid it for some time. Work on something else or just get out for a walk. Keep focusing on the problem will hardly help you to come up with a solution. There are also 2 illusions of competence that I would like to address before concluding this topic: Highlighting the text and rereading it. Highlighting and rereading are not effective methods for learning and retaining material [11]. Like any other passive technique, it doesn't help to strength the neural pathways associated with memory. You should instead focus on techniques that keep your working memory's abilities active. Note-taking and active recall are good examples. Practice in different contexts Context matters. Much more than we think. How many times you thought that you mastered something, but when you had to perform it in a different context your results were not the same? Think about tennis for instance. You can be a very skilled player. You have pace, balance, explosiveness, ball judgement and so on. You feel that you can be competitive against almost any other non-professional player. One day you have a bussiness trip to Russia , and one of your clients knowing about your interest in tennis decides to invite you for a game. When you arrive at the tennis court at 9am you check your phone and it's 3 degrees. You are used to play with 25, 30 degrees and you just can't stand this cold. You end up losing 6 x 0, 6 x 1. Your client was kind enough to let you score at least one point. This kind of situation happens all the time. You know when you are studying for a test and you feel that you know everything, but when it comes the moment to take it you end up not doing very well? That's usually because you didn't think about context when you were studying. You didn't put a timer like you have in your real test to limit the time you have to write your answers. You couldn't manage to put other 20 people around you so you could feel the pressure of everyone writing while you are still thinking how to answer your first question. The clues you have in an environment matters. The social pressure in different situations matters. The weather conditions matters. Context... matters. Master the subject Mastering the subject is obviously the last step in your learning journey. Checking if you have any holes in your understanding of the material is a good first step. Create a test checklist where you can go from each point and recall everything you learned. If there's something that is not 100% clear yet, then you probably still need to spend time on it. Sometimes we are blocked by our own perception or maybe our previous knowledge about the subject don't let us see other solutions - Einstellung. That's why you should also consider to review it with friends. They will not only be able to clearly point the parts where you are not at your best yet, but also show you different approaches that you couldn't think about by yourself. However, your real last step to master the subject is teaching it. If you can clearly explain something to someone else, then you can consider yourself a master in this subject. That's actually what I am trying to do with this answer. So, I hope that I managed to provide you a great and clear explanation about the the learning process. If you want more from me I am currently building an online coaching program to help people overcome procrastination and gain focus in their lives. If you are interested, please give me your feedback and you will be the first to know when the program is ready.

            "answer_text": "Someone stole $90 million from a company I was involved in. I'm a poor judge of people.  Some things I can't learn. I tend to like people too much.  So it's hard for me to be a good judge of people, no matter how much I try. So I find other people who are good at judging people and I ask them to help me.  Don't force yourself to learn something if you don't want to or it's not a natural talent.  What's the role of talent? Very small. But you have to start with it. Talent is the seed of skill.  How do you know if you are talented? If you loved it when you were ten years old. If you dream about it. If you like to read about it. Read the below and you'll know what you are talented at.  Trust me when I say: everyone is talented at many things.  In the past 20 years I've wanted to learn how to do some things really well. Writing, programming, business skills (leadership, sales, negotiating, decision-making), comedy, games.  So I developed a ten step technique for learning.  A) LOVE IT If you can't start with \"love\" then everyone who does love will beat everyone who \"likes\" or \"hates\".  This is a rule of the universe. The first humans who crossed the arctic tundra from Siberia to Alaska in -60 degree temperatures had to love it.  The rest stayed in the East Africa Savannah.  The very first day I wrote a \"Hello, World\" computer program I dreamed about computers. I woke up at 4am to get back to the \"computer lab\" and make even bigger programs.  When I first started to write every day,  I would write all day. I couldn't stop. And all I wanted to talk about with people were different authors.  When I was 10 years old I wrote a gossip column about all my fellow 5th graders. I read every Judy Blume book. I read everything I could. I loved it. Most of my friends got bored with me and soon I was very lonely. Except when I was writing.  - READ IT. Bobby Fischer wasn't that good at chess. He had talent but nobody thought much of him.  So around the age of 12-13 he disappeared for a year. He did this later in his 20s.  But at 13 when he came back on the scene he was suddenly the best chessplayer in the US, won the US championship, and became the youngest grandmaster in the world.  How did he do it? He barely played at all during his year of wandering.  Instead he did two things:    a) he studied every game played in the prior century. In the 1800s.  When he came back on the scene he was known for playing all of these antiquated openings but he had improvements in each one.  Nobody can figure out how to defeat these improvements.  In fact, the final game of the World Championship many years later, in 1972 when he was playing Spassky, he brought out his 1800s arsenal to become World Champion. Spassky desperately needed to win to keep the match going. Fischer needed to draw to win the title.  Spassky started with a very modern attacking opening (\"The Sicilian\")  But then around 13 moves in, all of the commentators watching gasped.  Fischer had subtly changed the opening into an old-fashioned very drawish 1800s opening called \"The Scotch Game\". Spassky didn't have a chance after that.   b) He learned enough Russian to read the Russian chess magazines. At the time, the top 20 players in the world were all Russian. The Americans didn't really have a chance.  So Fischer would study the Russian games while all of the Americans were sitting around with openings and styles the Russians already knew how to defeat.  Consequently, when Fischer competed in the US championship in the early 60s it was the first complete shutout, all wins and not a single draw.  Studying the history, studying the best players, is the key to being the best player. Even if you started off with average talent.  - TRY IT. BUT NOT TOO HARD If you want to be a writer, or a businessman, or a programmer, you have to write a lot, start a lot of businesses, and program a lot of programs.  Things go wrong. This is why quantity is more important than quality at first.  The learning curve that we all travel is not built by accomplishments. It's only built by quantity.  If you see something 1000 times, you'll see more than the person who sees the same thing only ten times.  Don't forget the important rule: the secret of happiness is not \"being great\" - the secret is \"growth\".  If you only \"try\" you'll get to your level that is natural for you. But growth will stop and you won't be happy.  - GET A TEACHER (PLUS THE 10X RULE) If I try to learn Spanish on my own, I get nowhere. But when I go out (and now marry) someone who is from Argentina, I learn more Spanish.  With chess, writing, programming, business, I always find someone better than me, and I set a time each week to ask them tons of questions, have them give me assignments, look over my mistakes and tell me where I am wrong.  For everything you love, find a teacher and that makes you learn 10x faster.  In fact, everything I put on this list, makes you learn 10x faster. So if you do everything on this list you will learn 10 to the 10th power faster than anyone else.  That's how you become great at something.  - STUDY THE HISTORY. STUDY THE PRESENT>  If you want to learn how to be a GREAT programmer (not just good enough to program an app but good enough to be GREAT, study machine language.  Study 1s and 0s. Study the history of the computer, learn how to make an operating system, and Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, Lisp, C, C++, all the way through the modern languages of Python, etc.  If you want to write better, read great books from the 1800s. Read Hemingway and Virginia Woolf and the Beats, and the works that have withstood the test of time.  They have withstood the test of time. versus millions of other books, for a reason. They are the best in the world.  Then study the current criticism of those books to see what you have missed. This is just as important as the initial reading.  If you want to study business, read biographies of Rockefeller, Carnegie, the first exchange in Amsterdam, the junk-bond boom, the 90s, the financial bust. Every Depression. All the businesses that flourished in every depression. Read \"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel. Watch \"The Profit\" on CNBC. Read about Steve Jobs. Read about the downfall of Kodak in \"The End of Power\".  Don't read self-help business books. They are nothing. You are about to enter a great field, the field of innovation that has created modern society. Don't read the average books that came out last year.  Step up your game and read about the people and inventions that changed the world into what it is today.  Read how Henry Ford had to start three car companies to get it right and why \"three\" was the important number for him.  Read about why Ray Kroc's technique for franchising created the world's largest restaurant chain. Read how the Coca-Cola makes absolutely nothing but is the largest drink company in the world.  Write down the things you learn from each reading.  - DO EASY PROJECTS FIRST Tony Robbins told me about when he was scared to death on his first major teaching job.  He had to teach a bunch of Marines how to improve their sharpshooting. \"I had never shot a gun in my life,\" he said.  He studied quite a bit from professionals but then he came up with a technique that resulted in the best scores of any sharpshooting class before then.  He brought the target closer.  He put it just five feet from them. They all shot bullseyes. Then he moved it back bit by bit until it was the standard distance.  They were still shooting bullseyes.  Richard Branson started a magazine before he started an airline. Bill Gates wrote BASIC before his team wrote Windows.  EL James (and yes, I'm including her) wrote Twilight fan fiction, before she wrote \"50 Shades of Grey\".  Ernest Hemingway never thought he could write a novel. So he wrote dozens of short stories.  Programmers write \"Hello, World\" programs before they make their search engines.  Many chess grandmasters recommend you study the endgame first in chess (when there are few pieces left on the board) before you study the other parts of the game.  This gets you confidence, it teaches subtleties, it gives you greater feelings of growth and improvement - all steps on the path to success.  - STUDY WHAT YOU DID The other day I threw everything out. Everything. I threw out all my books (donated). I threw out all my clothes.  I threw out old computers. I threw out plates I never used. I threw out sheets I would never have guests for. I threw out furniture (four book cases) and my TV and old papers and everything.  I wanted to clean up. And I did.  I found a novel I wrote in 1991. 24 years ago. It was horrible.  For the first time in those 24 years, I re-read it. I studied what I did wrong (character unrelatable. Plot too obvious. Deus ex machina all over the place).  Someone told me a story about Amy Schumer, one of my favorite comedians. She videotapes all her performances.  Then she goes back to her room and studies the performance second by second. \"I should have paused another quarter-second here,\" she might say.  She wants to be the best at comedy. She studies her every performance.  When I play chess, if I lose, I run the game into the computer. I look at every move, what the computer suggests as better, I think about what I was thinking when I made the bad move, and so on.  A business I was recently invested in fell apart. It was painful for me. But I had to look at it and see what was wrong. Where did I make a mistake. At every level I went back and wrote what happened and where I might have helped better and what I missed.  If you aren't obsessed with your mistakes then you don't love the field enough to get better.  You ask lousy questions: \"Why am I no good?\" Instead of good questions: \"What did I do wrong and how can I improve?\"  When you consistently ask good questions about your own work, you become better than the people who freeze themselves with lousy questions. Example: I hate watching myself after a TV appearance. I have never done it. So I will never get better at that.  - YOU ARE THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE PEOPLE AROUND YOU Look at every literary, art, and business scene. People seldom get better as individuals. They get better as groups.  The Beats: Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and a dozen others.  The programmers: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Ted Leonsis, Paul Allen, Steve Wozniak and a dozen  others all came out of the Homebrew Club The art scene in the 50s: Jasper Johns, De Kooning, Pollack, etc all lived on the SAME STREET in downtown NYC.  YouTube, LinkedIn, Tesla, Palantir, and to some extent Facebook, and a dozen other companies came out of the so-called \"PayPal mafia\".  All of these people could've tinkered by themselves. But humans are tribal mammals. We need to work with groups to improve.  Find the best group, spend as much time with them, and as a \"scene\" you become THE scene.  You each challenge each other, compete with each other, love each other's work, become envious of each other, and ultimately take turns surpassing each other.  - DO IT A LOT.  What you do every day matters much more than what you do once in awhile.  I had a friend who wanted to get better at painting. But she thought she had to be in Paris, with all the conditions right.  She never made it to Paris. Now she sits in a cubicle under fluorescent lights, filling out paperwork all day.  Write every day, network every day, play every day, live healthy every day.  Measure your life in the number of times you do things. When you die: are you 2 writing sessions old? Or are you 50,0000?  - FIND YOUR EVIL PLAN Eventually the student passes the master. The first hedge fund manager I worked for now hates me. I started my own fund and his fund went out of business.   But how?  After all of the above, you find your unique voice. And when you speak in that voice, the world hears something it has never heard before.  Your old teachers and friends might not want to hear that voice. But if you continue to be around people who love and respect you, then they will encourage that new voice.  There's that saying, \"there are no new ideas.\" But there are.  There are all the ideas in the past combined with the new beautiful you.  Now it's your turn to teach, to mentor, to create, to innovate, to change the world. ",
