            "answer_text": "The question is an extremely tricky question. Why? Because on the face value the interrogative seems straight enough but the difficulties increase exponentially while answering the second part of the question - \u201cWHY\u201d. As for the first part, I do not think I am qualified enough to answer as to which specific animal has the lowest mean central and/or peripheral blood pressure. I really do not know. As for the \u201cWHY\u201d part, it\u2019s a discipline by itself. Understanding of the factors involved in determining (and their reasons as well) the level of central arterial blood pressure in animals has been clouded by inappropriate allometric analyses that fail to account for phylogenetic relationships among species, and require pressure to approach 0 as body size decreases. Analyses show that blood pressure increases with body size. Nonlinear analyses show that mean blood pressure increases from 93 mmHg in a 10 g mouse to 156 mmHg in a 4 tonne elephant. The scaling exponent of blood pressure is generally lower than, though not significantly different from, the exponent predicted on the basis of the expected scaling of the vertical distance between the head and the heart. Having said that it\u2019s also crucially important to understand the effect of gravity on the overall natural posture of the animal body with respect to the surface in correlation to determining the mean arterial/venous blood pressure. I would like to encourage the OP to read this article on \u201cThe evolution of blood pressure and the rise of mankind\u201d[1], published in Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation in 2015 to get an insightful perspective on the whole notion of the blood pressure and the factors those contribute to its variations.

            "answer_text": "Animals blood pressure is based on heart beat upto some extent but not completely. Different animals have different blood pressures as they live in different conditions and blood pressure is also a type of adaptation. Warm blooded animals are more active and have high blood pressures and cold blooded animals have less blood pressures and it means not they are active but they change by conditions and certain conditions make them more active and some make less active. The mean blood pressure of different animals as small as the rat and jackdaw have been measured with mercury manometers (1, 2, 3). The pressures were as follows: rat 70 to 100, guinea pig 75 to 90, rabbit 100, dog 120, and horse 155 mm. Hg. Birds are credited with higher pressures: jackdaw 119, pigeon 130, crow 150, buzzard 170, and turkey 190. Cold blooded animals average between 30 and 80 mm. Hg. This is published in some American studies. So,A/c to this study cold blooded animals have lowest blood pressures. Cold blooded animals are none other than reptiles, amphibians,pisces(fishes),etc. I hope it helped \u263a\ufe0f. Thanks for scrolling. ",
