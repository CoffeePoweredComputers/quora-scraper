            "answer_text": "I\u2019m guessing you mean University rather than College? College in the UK is equivalent to the last 2 years of American high school, usually. There are roughly 30 universities in the UK that offer degrees at a similar top quality. Depending on the discipline of engineering you might get 10\u201320 which stand out amongst those 30, where disciplines offered by relatively few universities such as Biomedical will have ~10 top grade unis, and something like Mechanical will have more like ~20, maybe slightly more. Amongst those top X, it\u2019s really down to the person as to which is best. Each uni will have different teaching styles, different environments, different opportunities but give a similar quality degree. So you need to figure out the best combination of those for you. For example some people don\u2019t get on well with the collegiate teaching of Oxford and Cambridge, or they might not like living in a big city like London for Imperial or equally a smaller one like Durham, or they might be very interested in automotive engineering in which case they should find somewhere which does Formula Student.
