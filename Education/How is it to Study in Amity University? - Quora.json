            "answer_text": "\u201cAmity\u201d means friendliness and indeed the college justifies the meaning of its name. After reading the below points I will leave it on to you to decide whether Amity University is a good or bad university. I'm writing the pros and cons keeping in Universitie\u2019s Noida campus. Pros: Most people will talk about campus and its life. But the best thing in Amity is its faculities. 4 out of 7 professors from my course were from various IIM's. All professors were professional,well-versed and sound with the subject they were teaching.Curriculum is same in every college. But what makes Amity curriculum stand out is its extra credit courses which are manditory most of the times. Courses like Human value community outreach(HVCO), Military Training Camp(MTC) and various other Non-Teaching Credit Courses(NTCC) help student learn alot. They get a totally new perspective. Social Science subject also helps student deal with social pressure and tension.The term Ragging is totally absent from Amity's campuses. Amity is an Anti-Ragging campus. And by chance If some ragging case has been found, the perpetrator is chastised severly.Amity\u2019s Campus is sumptuous. It has various canteen that are both student friendly and hygienic. Library, classrooms, sports complex all are good. Gym is also fine. Campus is clean and serene. Campus has diversity.All the events whether it is freshers,annual fest, convocation is carried out in a proper and lively manner every year.Scholarship is giving to people who scored more than 90% in board(12th) exam, it is also given to national players.Rest online e-portal is now ubiqutous nowdays. Cons: There is an entrance exam or interview(dependong the upon the course which you opt for) for the university in which 95% of the students pass, as it is not that tough. If someone has required money he or she can get Admission through Sponsored candidate, who pay some 70\u201380% more fee than non- sponsored category candidate. Since purging is not done in a stringent manner. This makes college crowd vulnerable to non deserving candidates.As its a private university the fee for certain courses might burn a hole in many people's pocket.Many students come from affluent or opluent family they smoke, take drugs, disrespect teacher and all. To be candid these things are present in every college, but dont know why Amity name is tarnished always.The complusory Foreign Business Language( FBL) sometimes put unwanted onus on the students.Hope my answer will help you extrapolate whether \u201cAmity\u201d is a good college or not. Feel free to ask if you have any further doubt. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A The education environment for Amity is somewhat a mixed bag altogether. Some departments of Amity University are doing quite well like Business School, Law School, Foreign Languages School, Dept of Psychology, Nursing but then there are other depts like Basic Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Forensics, Animation etc which are present just cause the sake of it. Engineering and Technology is the worst and not the worth the money. Infact most courses are not except MBA and School of Foreign Languages. You won't find very competitive peers in your group, one or two might be exceptions. Everybody is busy with other activities and chilling out and coming to classes just for attendance. Faculties are also mixed bunches. There are very good, talented and caring ones. And there are ones who don't give a shit about you or the university. If you're going to stay in the hostel be ready to face alot of restrictions and unjustified rules which don't make sense. Apart from all these studies are pretty normal. If you can understand what's being taught in class and do some self study you won't go below 8.5 CGPA and if you do a lil bit of hard work 9+ CGPA. If want to know about people then, there are about 50\u201360 percent locals and remaining are from the rest of India. You'll find a major chuck of South Indians (don't know why they prefer Amity). Locals include cool decent people, uncivilized hooligans from nearby villages and obviously rich spoiled brats. So according to me it's an experience altogether. Good Luck if you're joining Amity! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I'm pursuing MSc statistics from Amity University Noida. I don't know much about other departments but Statistics department is pretty good. All the faculties are very supportive and encouraging. But the professors are quite syllabus oriented and they really need to put in more effort to get students in the research field. Amity University nowadays has become a brand in private institutions so opting for some decent courses wouldn't be regrettable. The university is bit harsh on your pocket as the fees is quite high. But the fees will be utilised if you know how to swim in the ocean of opportunities in the campus. It is a good place for studious kids because the attendance system makes sure you won't miss a class. However, that is also the biggest flaw. \ud83d\ude02 Amity guarantees 100% placement but the chances are that if you don't put an effort, you may remain unplaced. Other than curricular, you can indulge yourself in co-curricular and extra curricular activities, events like- Amity youth fest and Sangathan are perfect events to polish your skills. Amity provides a platform to showcase your talent. The infrastructure holds a world class central library that is a visual treat once you enter it. It has squash court, shooting range, basketball court, gym, swimming pool and THE ARCADIA for indoor games. It has cheerful environment and you will never get bored in the campus, the crowd is much alike the one you saw in Student of the year movie\ud83d\ude02. It has cafeteria for each block, food chain such as subway, Domino's, CCD, dosa plaza etc for appetite comfort. Rest I am enjoying here. So you can choose this college. ",

Infrastructure- As it states , it has an amazing infrastructure that was built initially but as every batch enrolls and pass out , they leave their mark by showing their love on infrastructure. :P Faculty- Some are amazing ; have in-depth knowledge of their subject and some are worst. Wi-Fi :- Don\u2019t depend on wi-fi , always have net pack in your phone. Sometimes you may get good speed but never depend on Wi-Fi. It won\u2019t work when you need it the most. Students:- You will find every variety of student over there , extroverts , handsome , beautiful, introverts, bimbos, studious , always high , extreme introverts with whom you may never talk in your entire duration of course, high maintenance, Apple\u2019s brand ambassador, teacher\u2019s pet etc etc. but you will make great friends over here because no matter from where they are or what they are , you all ended up in Amity only. Of course, I hated Amity from my step in that campus and I still hate it. But \u201c No matter how good or bad Amity was, I miss it.\u201d ",

In market name of Amity is not that good solely because it's intake capacity is good and hence people with low grades are also eligible to take admission but what's wrong in that? I have seen people with 95% as well as 70% studying together and there is no big deal. Amity\u2019s curriculum is vast, almost 8\u201310 exams per semester, including a foreign business language which is mandatory. It requires rigorous hard work to compete and 75% attandence is must for giving exams else you will get debarred. One more thing that I like about amity is fully online, as in, all your attandence, marksheets, syllabus, class schedules everything is available online and you don't have to line up in queue to get something done. Amity\u2019s administration is fully online. Though I admit that some policies of amity are completely irritated but in long run we all got used to it. Overall, a good private university which some day will have a great market value. Regards, Proud amitian. ",
