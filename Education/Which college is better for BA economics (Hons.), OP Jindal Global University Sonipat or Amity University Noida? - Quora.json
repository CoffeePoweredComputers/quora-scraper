            "answer_text": "Comparison questions are complicated and interesting. JSGP i.e. Jindal School of Government and Public Policy, Amity University, Shri Ram College of Commerce Delhi, St. Stephens College Delhi, Hindu College Delhi, Ramjas College Delhi, Fergusson College Pune, Loyola College Chennai, Narsee Monjee College, Mumbai, Christ University Bangalore are few of the good institutes imparting good quality Economics education. Calling something \u201cBetter\u201d is entirely dependent on your perception and expectation. To answer your question JSGP i.e. Jindal School of Government & Public Policy is a pioneer and a game changer when it comes to Bachelors program in Economics. Immaculate infrastructure facilities make JSGP the one which provides students with a great atmosphere for studying. Highly qualified & Experience faculty impart world class quality education in Economics, Compulsory internships give you the on job training required to enhance your skills. Top notch placements get success to your feet, extracurricular activities help students relax and freshen up. On the other hand, Amity University from what I have heard isn\u2019t at par with the infrastructure of JSGP. Also, the faculty at Amity isn\u2019t as impressive as JSGP. JSGP has a practical and holistic approach whereas at Amity the program focuses more on the theoretical aspect. From what I hear the internships at JSGP are compulsory whereas at Amity it is optional. JSGP seems to be better in every aspect and sits at the top of the pile. It holds a great reputation too. I would recommend JSGP for its high points. Hope this helps you choose the best one. Wish you all the success in life. ",
