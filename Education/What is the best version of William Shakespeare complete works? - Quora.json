There are so many to chose from but some with impressive sounding names like Yale or Oxford are useless and others like the Arden or Riverside may be overwhelming. It really depends on your level of familiarity you have with his works and how comfortable you are with the way the critical apparatus as presented. I would initially recommend not buying a complete works at all before you explore the options. If you were in my store, I\u2019d take you up to the Shakespeare section, grab a few editions of a play off the shelf, point you to a comfy chair, and tell you to read the first couple of scenes. I\u2019d probably hand you the Arden, Penguin, and Signet editions of As You Like It or Macbeth. I\u2019d tell you to see which notes best informed you and made understanding the play easier. Most of the time when I read Shakespeare for pleasure, that\u2019s what I use \u2014 a good single play edition. When you decide which version you like the best, buy it and read it. Then go back and glance through those other copies again and see if, having read the play, you still think the one you got is best. If you still like that publisher, grab another couple of plays. Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Midsummer Nights Dream, The Tempest, or something else you might already be familiar with. There are single play editions (that also exist as complete play editions) that you should steer clear of, I think. The Yale, Oxford, and Cambridge editions to me are next to useless. If you have not read much drama or are not used to the differences between Shakespeare\u2019s English and ours, then a basic edition like the Folger is a great start. Read a couple of Folger editions then check out the more scholarly ones. If you are getting what you want out of these single play editions you might not need to go for a complete works. If you do decide to pick one up, you should be familiar enough with how you want to read Shakespeare to make an informed choice. Check out the Riverside, Arden, Pelican, Norton, and Signet. You get lots of critical apparatus with these editions but you\u2019ll have to decide how deeply you want to dig in. Keep in mind the study of Shakespeare is filled with flights of brilliant analysis \u2014 and wildly insane nonsense. This is particularly true of the \u201cdid Shakespeare write Shakespeare\u201d lunacy and the hip new computer textual analysis. Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries would have known nothing about him as a person and you don\u2019t have to either. The secret to Shakespeare is finding your own connection to him through his words. And only you can guide yourself there. PS \u2014 when you get to the Sonnets, check out Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets by Stephen Booth. A good readable look at the history of our ideas about Shakespeare is Shakespeare\u2019s Lives by Stanley Scheonbaum. A good biography is Will of the World by Stephen Greenblatt \u2014 recommended even though he gave me a B- when he was at Berkeley 40 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh man, this question is a can of worms... It really depends on who you are and what you are looking for. What's really great is in the last 20-30 years, rather than each publishing house just trying to make the \"best\" version, each has their own ideology, their own target audience, and they've defined themselves accordingly. I'll also say that I go different places if I'm buying an individual edition (Arden, hands down) versus a full complete works. This answer will apply to the full complete works, since that's what I think you're asking about, but if you'd like me to go into the individual editions, let me know in the comments. My current favorite complete works is the Norton. Good notes, but there aren't too many/they aren't overwhelming. The introductory material is mostly useful, and the text itself is easy to read (a big plus). Norton is targeted at a standard undergraduate/graduate student studying Shakespeare. Bevington is the edition that my undergrad used, and so far as I can tell, it's also pretty accessible. Oxford has a different agenda, choosing the version they feel is closest to what Shakespeare actually wrote of all editions. They revert some titles (i.e. Henry VI Part II is called The First Part of the Contention) and some people complain that they tend towards less poetic readings of lines. I also own a Pelican that I quite like, but it's difficult to read. Their layout isn't the best. I don't really recommend the Arden Complete Works as they do not include any footnotes, and that's one of the best things about the Arden. ",
