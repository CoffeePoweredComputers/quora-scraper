            "answer_text": "You are asking the wrong people. You need to ask the people at your school. Only they can tell you what the rules are at your school. Do you have a guidance counselor? Ask them. Or have your parents call the school office. But, having said all that, the answer is \u201cprobably.\u201d A D is usually considered the lowest passing grade. You generally have to get an F to be actually considered failing. Not that you should be happy with a D. It is a very below average grade and (generally) indicates you aren\u2019t getting enough out of the class to do well in future related classes. At most schools and with most teachers, D\u2019s are so rare that it really indicates that you didn\u2019t really try or didn\u2019t turn in all the assignments. So figure out why you are getting D\u2019s and fix it. You should be able to find someone at your school who will be willing to help you figure out what the problem is. ",
