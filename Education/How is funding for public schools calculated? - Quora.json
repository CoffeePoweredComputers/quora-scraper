            "answer_text": "In the United States, this depends almost exclusively on where you live, as there is no centralized formula. Generally, for non-federal funds, it is a combination of local property taxes and state funds (sales tax, income tax, state property tax, etc.) Which are apportioned based on a formula of your system legislature's design. In some states, like Arizona, it's an \"equalized\" formula, where schools are paid a set per-student amount, which varies based on certain attributes (e.g. A school is paid more for a student with disabilities because that student costs more to educate. ) The school district will calculate how much of its formula amount is raised through its local tax base, the growth of which is constrained by law, and the state pays the rest. There are also separate formulas for transportation and capital. The system actually works pretty well. The complaint is that the growth in the formula does not keep pace with the true cost of educating students. Other states have different ways of doing it. For whatever reason, it seems like as you move west, you see systems more like Arizona 's, while states back east seem to allow individual districts much more leeway with financing if their constituents will support it. Federal funds are the same everywhere. The biggest pot (Title I) is aimed at low income students and are based on U.S. Census data. Next biggest is IDEA funding for special education, and is based on data reported annually by schools. Then there is school lunch, which is means-tested by the school, and federal funding is provided on a reimbursement basis for actual meals served (provided you meet all the appropriate regulations) Make sense? No? Perfect. \u263a ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about primary education, K-12th grade then for the most part it is the local government. I live in NH and we have property taxes that are relatively high (granted no state income tax, no sales tax). The majority of the property tax in our town goes towards the local schools. We also get state aid for our schools that helps to pay for the cost of education. The nice thing about local control is we get to vote every year on the school budget and also warrant articles such as building a new school or building an addition etc. In my town, we have 3 schools (a High school built in early 1990\u2019s with an addition for technology classes added 10 years ago, that is shared with another town. A Middle school built only 8 years ago and an elementary school also built in early 1990\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "Funding for schools comes from a variety of sources. Some comes from the federal government, and is collected through our taxes. Then funding comes from the state, and it is collected through taxes. At the state level, some states also use lottery funds to add to the coffers. We are taxed at the county, and city levels as well, and some of that goes into education also. Then, cities, counties, and states can sell bonds to find projects. These are ballot measures and must be passed by voters \u2014 who almost always pass them!! So, in its simplest form, the answer is taxes, loads and loads of taxes. ",
