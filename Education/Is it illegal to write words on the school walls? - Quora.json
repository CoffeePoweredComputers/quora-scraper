            "answer_text": "Were you given permission by the owner or manager of the building? If not, it\u2019s vandalism, and yes, it\u2019s illegal. Look up the laws where you live and you can find how vandalism is defined and what the penalties are. As a school principal, I occasionally had kids write on the school walls, and one time on a teacher\u2019s car. I always called the police. They always investigated and prosecuted. Penalties usually involved a fine, about $500 for the first offense, plus money paid to the owner of the school or the vehicle to cover the cost of restoring the item vandalized to new condition, and that could be several hundred dollars more. Not a good idea. ",
