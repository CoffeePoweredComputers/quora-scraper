            "answer_text": "In most public school systems, your pay is based on 2 variables: Years of serviceEducational attainmentThe base point of entry is a BA or BS degree. If their is a shortage of teachers, anyone with a simple BA can apply for an Emergency Teaching Credential and with such you will be paid at the lowest possible rate. From that point on you will receive an increase in your pay scale for every class towards your credential. If you enter the profession with a credential, you will receive a pay increase for every additional graduate level course. In some districts you will also receive a pay bump for taking additional upper division undergraduate courses if they apply to your teaching. If you earn a graduate degree, your pay will increase substantially. Here is a sample salary schedule for a California District.  Keep in mind that a teacher in the bottom-right of the salary schedule doesn\u2019t just cost $48,000/year more than the teacher in the upper-left. With pensiion and other benifit costs the older and more experienced teacher can be more expensive than the public realizes. Schools generally don\u2019t pay for teachers educations because every course the teacher takes after employment will cost the district more money. My sister-in-law has been teaching for 24 years, yet only earned her MA this year. By waiting so long to earn her graduate degree, she may have saved the district close to $200,000. ",

            "answer_text": "Public Schools don't want to pay teachers. Why do you think that they should be paying a teacher's education? It's the teacher that makes the decision to become an educator and so it is their responsibility to go to the right institution to be certified to teach a subject or a grade level. That is on their own volition. However it is the public that needs to push the politicians especially the school board trustees to properly pay the teachers so that they can make a living without having to take on a part-time job to put food, shelter, clothing for their teachers and not to have to use some of the salary to pay for the supplies for their classroom. The classroom needs are not part of the responsibilities of the teachers. It is the responsibility of the school board to provide play students names for learning as well as the parents. ",
