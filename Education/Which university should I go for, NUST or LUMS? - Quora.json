            "answer_text": "I have done my bachelors from NUST (CEME) in Computer Engineering and now I am pursuing my masters degrees in Electrical Engineering from LUMS. After studying at both institutions I have come to this simple conclusion : If you want to study engineering and other sciences you need to go to NUST. On the other side if you want to go towards business studies, management, economics, law etc. LUMS is the best place for you to be. That being said, you asked about the social life, facilities, parties and all nighters you can pull off. Well I ll tell you one by one The facilities provided in both universities are very good. They have the best faculties in pakistan. They provide a competitive study environment. LUMS in my opinion is a little more intense. They have excellent libraries, sports complex and cafeterias. On Campus residence is again safe and clean. In other words the basic facilities provided by these institutions are the best. LUMS might be better in a few ways that it has some cafes and swimming pool compared to NUST H-12. The cost of this is that you have to pay a hell of a lot more compared to NUST to come to LUMS for just these facilities? So it can be said in end that the facilities are at par with each other. Social life is a must if you need to survive your period at the university. The friends you make have a deep impact on you and shape your life. You go through a lot of stuff together. Now social life is up to you how you connected with others. I dont think that it is dependent on which institute you go to study at. The thing that I have noticed is that, if you are a day scholar you have little social life compared to those who live in on-campus hostels. Trust me the fun you have in hostels are the best days of your lives. You know the whole building and interact with the people in it day in and out. You will make memories doing shit you cant even imagine. It doesn't depend on university trust me. I have made myself friends that made my bachelors in NUST memorable. The \u201cparty walla mahol\u201d is obviously more intense in LUMS than it is in NUST. I can understand two reasons for it (there can be more). One that NUST is an engineering university and the students that come into it mostly care about study and getting good grades. I am not saying that LUMS students are less inclined towards studies but engineering tends to take the nerd out of you and take control. Secondly I think NUST is situated in a secluded place. H-12 in Islamabad and then near motorway in Rawalpindi while LUMS is situated in the most popular area of lahore that is DHA. For partying outside, you have have to go a long way from NUST to anywhere that you can \u201cparty\u201d and trust me it takes a lot of motivation to just get up after the day you have had in university to go the distance to hang out. From LUMS you can go anywhere in DHA and have a good time. All the places are almost located in a 2\u201310 km radius. After saying all this, I can say that both the universities are the best and offer you the best time. Both have their pros and cons. For me, personally, I have had the best time in NUST and I have learned alot and had a great time. ",

            "answer_text": "Your social life depends on how you make of it. It doesn\u2019t depend on university. Of course, LUMS provides great night life, parties, and international-standard facilities. But you can have a great social life at NUST as well. If you plan to go for a grad school abroad, LUMS is your best option. You will be able to work on awesome research projects with intellectually sound professors who will prepare you well enough to land at an elite university abroad. For the last 5 years or more, undergrads have been receiving fully-funded PhD offers from schools like CMU, UIUC, Harvard, Brown and many others. So if this is your goal, LUMS is the best choice hands down. However, if job in local industry is your goal, maybe NUST and LUMS provide equal opportunities to its graduates. Both have their alumni well placed in the industry and good enough repute to maintain close to 100% employment rate. Remember that after completing your undergrad in CS, your university will not land you a job. Your skills will, and you can learn them regardless of which university you study at. ",
