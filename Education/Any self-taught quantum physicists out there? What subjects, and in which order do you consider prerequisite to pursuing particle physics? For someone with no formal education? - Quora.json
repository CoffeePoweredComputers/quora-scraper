            "answer_text": "\u201cNo Formal Education\u201d?? In Mathematics, does that mean NO (1) Basic Algebra, (2) Advanced Algebra, (3) Trigonometry, (4) Probability and Statistics, (5) Calculus, (6) Advanced Calculus including domains of convergence, (7) Linear Algebra, (8) Differential Equations, (9) Multivariate Calculus, (10) Vector and Tensor Calculus, (11) Complex Analysis, (12) Higher Transcendental Functions such as Bessel Functions and Hankel Functions, (13) Jacobians of Transformation, (14) Dirac Delta-Functions, and (15) Hilbert Spaces? In Physics, does it mean NO (A) Classical Mechanics, (B) Conservation of Energy and Conservation of Momentum, (C) Open and Closed Systems, (D) Constraints and Constraint Equations, (E) Lagrangians and Hamiltonians, (F) Special and General Relativity, (G) Maxwell\u2019s Equations, (H) Thermodynamics, (I) Atomic and Molecular Physics, (J) Basic Quantum Mechanics including the Hydrogen Atom, (I) Schrodinger and Heisenberg Representations (J) Statistical Thermodynamics, (K) Classical Electrostatics and Electrodynamics, (L) Laplace\u2019s and Poisson\u2019s Equations, (M) Spectroscopy, (N) Astrophysics and the Balmer\u2019s Series, (O) Nuclear Physics including Fusion and Fission, (P) Plasmas, (Q) Solid State Physics including crystals and conductivity, (R) Molecular Physics of Crystals and Gases including Symmetry Groups for solids, (S) Quantum Electrodynamics, and finally (T) Quantum Field Theory? Assuming you have access to a very good library, maybe you could learn all of the above (1)-(15) in Math, and (A)-(T) in Physics, on your own, but you\u2019d probably be better off by taking some college-level and graduate-level classes to help you succeed. Have you learned some of this stuff on your own already? Here is a little test for you. Can you answer these 4 easy questions in 100 words or less without equations, and can you answer the 5th question in 100 pages or less with equations? [i] Why is Special Relativity excluded from \u201cClassical Mechanics\u201d but is required for \u201cClassical Electrodynamics\u201d? [ii] Why is Water (H2O) a polar molecule, but Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is non-polar? [ iii] For Earth, why is no Element #43 found, very little Element #2, and oodles of Element #26? [iv] What Physics is involved in the creation and use of your Cell Phone? [v] Can you derive the Electromagnetic Tensor from first principles? Finally, it is one thing to have a good understanding of these topics, so that you can pick up specialized technical Journal dedicated to a sub-field, and read and understand the papers. It is another thing altogether to do Research in those fields. Has anyone every done anything like this? I know of one case. At age 16, he was a freshman in Columbia University, and was failing English. He went to the Head of the Physics Department, who at that time was Nobel Laureate Isidor Isaac Rabi. The kid was literally crying his eyes out (boo-hoo-hoo!), saying he loves physics SOOO MUCH and may never get to be a Physicist because of Freshman English. Prof. Rabi was ignoring the sobbing freshman because he was busy discussing some finer points of the latest Phys. Rev. paper in Quantum Electrodynamics with another Professor. The sobbing freshman\u2019s tears all dried up, and he started intensely following the discussion, as this was his favorite topic. He then started offering some suggestions to help fix some of the things they were worried about. Prof. Rabi was initially dismissive, basically saying, \u201cWe are Professors who are discussing items at the cutting edge of Theoretical Physics Research. This is from the latest Phys. Rev. paper just published. You don\u2019t have a clue what we are talking about.\u201d The 16-year old said, \u201cNO! This is my favorite topic. I get Phys. Rev. at home, and I was thinking about these exact same questions!\u201d Prof. Rabi said, \u201cOK, what field are we talking about?\u201d The 16-year old said without hesitation, \u201cQuantum Electrodynamics!\u201d Prof. Rabi was duly surprised, and then said, \u201cSo, why are you in my office anyway?\u201d Back to the \u201cboo-hoo-hoo\u201d and sobs and tears. Prof. Rabi said, \u201cOK. Let me get your name. I will personally ensure that you do not fail freshman English.\u201d \u201cReally??\u201d Big smiles. Then the kid realized, \u201cOh, no! I should have been talking to the Head of the English Department! You really can\u2019t help me, because that\u2019s a different department.\u201d Prof. Rabi then said, \u201cI already told you that I will personally ensure that you do not fail English, so don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d I guess a Nobel Prize in Physics has more clout than just a simple Department Head in English (who did not have a Nobel Prize). The kid did not fail Freshman English. His name was Julian Schwinger. He eventually got his own Nobel Prize in Physics. ",

If you are asking about 2., then there are a few half-way decent books by real scientists \u2014 make sure that this is the case. Gribbin may be among the most clear. Perhaps Paul Davis. ",
