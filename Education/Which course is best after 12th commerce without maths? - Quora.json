            "answer_text": "Hello, There are lots of careers available in commerce without math\u2019s .  Since you have taken PE as a subject, are you willing to go ahead and make it a profession. You may support it with other certificates or courses like Alternate healing, yoga, aerobics, Dietitian and so on. But as far as the regular courses are concerned, after 12th, you could opt for the following courses: B.Com: a regular 3 years undergraduate course, whereby you would be exposed to general subjects like Accounts, Book Keeping, financial management, statistics and so on.Post B.Com you could opt for M.Com or MBA or courses like Taxation, financial markets and stocks, banking etc.BBI: Bachelors in Banking and insurance. This is a self financed course for 3 years. The fees for these courses are higher than the regular courses. These are application and practical oriented courses.
