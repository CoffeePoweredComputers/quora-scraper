            "answer_text": "Sometimes the desire to \u201cdiscover\u201d something new is so overwhelming, researchers overlook the errors in their approach. This is particularly true for \u201cgarage researchers\u201d who work alone without the benefits of review from their colleagues. For example, I often notice that some scientists don\u2019t compare their progress with that of others in the same specialized field. If they were to do so, their work might look considerably less impressive! Well even scientists are human and have egos! ",

            "answer_text": "You'd be surprised. Scientists don't really know very much in general, but rather they tend to know a lot about a single subject, and often don't stick to their element. As a result, when they talk about the World At Large, they often miss the forest for the trees because they are completely out of their depth, and seem to lack what others tend to consider common sense.
