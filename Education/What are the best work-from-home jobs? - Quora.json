Virtual assistant This is a job with a lot of potential because the title covers many things. Virtual assistants provide administrative, technical, or creative services for health care, legal, government and finance businesses, among others. You can own a virtual assistant business or work from home for a company that makes you available to clients. \u201cYou can fit your offerings to what you know how to do,\u201d says Stephanie Foster, a former medical transcriptionist who now runs HomeWithTheKids, a resource for telecommuters. Because they work in many different fields, wages for virtual assistants have a broad range \u2014 approximately $25,000 to $75,000 annually, says Christine Durst, who founded the International Virtual Assistants Association and runs RatRaceRebellion, a job site that caters to the work-from-home and virtual workforce. Durst says the highest-paid virtual assistants work full time and offer executive support or higher-pay services such as web design, while the lowest-paid gigs are for online services that pay by the hour when work is available. Median annual wage: N/A 2. Medical Transcriptionist Being a medical transcriptionist can be a demanding job, and nearly every company seeks applicants with experience and/or training from certain schools. The work involves listening to and typing up dictation from doctors. It sounds easy, but mumbled words and doctors who eat, drink, chew gum, or talk to other people while dictating their notes can turn a straightforward task into a challenge. Median annual wage: $35,250 3. Interpreter/translator People with fluency in more than one language can find job opportunities in the public and private sectors. Interpreters work in a spoken language or sign language; translators work with written or audio documents. \u201cCompanies can access home-based translators with hard-to-find language skills without being held back by geographic location,\u201d says Sara Sutton Fell, CEO and founder of FlexJobs The BLS projected 18 percent growth in this field. Median annual wage: $47,190 4. Web developer/designer Web developers and designers create websites for personal or commercial use and are responsible for how sites look and function. Web designers can put their skills to use in publishing, advertising, management consulting, and other fields. The BLS projects the field to grow 15 percent, driven by a boom in mobile devices and e-commerce. Median annual wage: $67,990. 5. Customer service representative When you call to order something from a catalog or infomercial, the person on the other end of the line could be sitting in a home office. Hiring independent contractors to take calls from home \u201cis a huge and growing industry,\u201d says Durst. The \u201chome-shore movement\u201d is a response to complaints about companies looking offshore for workers, she adds. Many customer service reps work for retail stores, banks, and credit agencies. The BLS projects a 5 percent growth in this field. Median annual wage: $32,890 6. Tech support specialist Corporations, nonprofits, call centers, and many other businesses hire technical support specialists to work remotely. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics and co-author of \u201cUndress for Success: The Naked Truth About Making Money at Home,\u201d names it as one of her top three \u201cbest-bet work-at-home jobs.\u201d The BLS projects 11 percent growth in this field. Median annual wage (computer network support): $62,340 (Computer user support): $50,210. 7. Travel agent The internet has changed the travel business dramatically. No longer do people call up a travel agent to buy their plane tickets and book hotels. \u201cNobody does that anymore,\u201d says Tom Ogg, a travel industry veteran and founder of HomeBasedTravelAgent \u201cThe common belief is that the internet is killing travel agents,\u201d Ogg says. \u201cThe truth is they\u2019re making more money now than ever before; they just look different.\u201d Ogg says travel agents who specialize in niche travel, such as specific destinations for wealthy clients, have the potential to earn $100,000 a year working from home. The BLS wage information is based on the old business model, Ogg says. \u201cA solid business concept and plan focused on profitability will take you a long way to achieving your monetary goals,\u201d he says. Median annual wage: $36,990 8. Teacher/tutor Advanced technology and high-speed internet connections have created more opportunities for teachers and students to work together from afar. \u201cWith more states allowing children to attend public school online, there\u2019s been a growing demand for K-12 teachers,\u201d says Durst. \u201cAlso in the teaching sector, we\u2019re seeing a huge demand for people to teach children in Asia, primarily in China, to speak English.\u201d Durst says your income \u201cdepends on how many hours you\u2019re applying to it and the type of classes you\u2019re teaching.\u201d The BLS projects 7 to 8 percent growth in the field for K-12 teachers and 15 percent growth for postsecondary teachers. Median annual wage (kindergarten, elementary school): $56,900 High school: $59,170 College, university: $76,900 9. Writer/author/editor Yes, the print publishing industry is in decline, but there are work-from-home jobs for writers, editors, and proofreaders, particularly for the internet. The BLS projects 8 percent growth in this field. Even those without writing experience can join the blogosphere. Not only can blogging be fun, but you can also earn money writing for someone else\u2019s site, getting paid to post on your own blog or through revenue-sharing arrangements. Median annual wage: $61,820 10. Franchise owner Owning a business can be the ticket to working from home. For an initial investment, franchises may offer a ready-made business with brand awareness, a system, and a territory, says Leslie Truex, founder of WorkAtHomeSuccess There are franchise opportunities in a broad range of fields such as mailing and shipping, photography, cosmetics, travel, marketing, employment and staffing, and more. Starting a franchise can be very expensive. For example, opening a McDonald\u2019s restaurant could cost you up to $2.2 million. You can find franchises for small, home-based and mobile businesses, however, for $10,000 or less. Truex\u2019s advice: Consider businesses that target the over-50 crowd or the self-employed, involve health and wellness, relate to the \u201cgreen\u201d movement, or involve electronic or online devices (i.e., accessories, applications). Median annual wage: N/A 11. Social media specialist It\u2019s becoming increasingly important for businesses to have a presence on social media. If you have a knack for using social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, you could make a living helping businesses reach out, engage, and promote their product through social media marketing. Social media managers or specialists also can earn money through training and consulting. Depending on the size of the business and the amount of work required, you could charge each client between $200 and $10,000 per month, says Upwork, a website for freelancers. The average salary ranges from $34,432 to $56,571, says PayScale The BLS data lump social media specialists with other types of public relations specialists. Median annual wage: $56,770. 12. Child care provider If you have small children, providing child care in your home can have dual benefits: You keep your own kids busy with friends and activities while earning money providing care for other people\u2019s children. Websites like Care and Sittercity help connect child care providers with parents who need a sitter. How much you earn will depend on how many kids you care for each day and the extent of care you provide. The BLS projects 7 percent growth in this field. Keep in mind that your state may require licensing if you want to do this on an official basis. Median annual wage: $22,290 13. Graphic designer If you have experience designing logos and T-shirts or using computer software to create brochures and advertisements, you could make good money working from home. Websites like Fiverr and 99designs can help you meet potential clients who need your services. How much you earn will depend on the scope of the project and your experience. The field is expected to grow 4 percent, says the BLS. Median annual wage: $48,700 per year. 14. Short-term rental host If you have an extra bedroom in your home or apartment, consider renting it out through sites such as Airbnb, VRBO (Vacation Rentals By Owner) or HomeAway. You decide how often you want to rent out your space and how much to charge. The only caveat is that you need to stay competitive with similar short-term rentals in your area. Do your research to attract renters and make a decent return from each stay. The BLS does not have wage data for this slice of the \u201cgig economy.\u201d Only 1 percent of Americans have earned money through home-sharing sites, according to Pew Research Center. Median annual wage: N/A 15. Website tester Sites like UserTesting and Userlytics pay people to test different websites and mobile apps, then share their feedback. UserTesting pays testers $10 per test, with each test expected to take no more than 20 minutes. Testers then share their feedback in a video. \u201cCompanies want to make sure that the user experience is a good one and the boardroom is not always the best place to get unbiased feedback,\u201d says Durst. \u201cSo, they use services like this to get insights from people who come from the demographic pools that are in their target markets.\u201d Opportunities for this work sometimes called \u201cremote usability testing\u201d may be limited. This job is suited to someone looking to make extra money. Median annual wage: N/A 16. Licensed insurance representative Durst says she has seen a \u201chuge demand\u201d in the past year for licensed insurance reps. The BLS projects \u201cfaster than average\u201d growth in this field, at 10 percent over 10 years. Durst says insurance companies are increasingly outsourcing their incoming phone calls to contact centers. The contact centers then have to hire or contract with licensed insurance reps \u201cbecause state laws mandate that only licensed agents can \u2018sell\u2019 policies,\u201d says Durst. So, if you see an ad on TV for XYZ Life Insurance Co. and call the number on your screen, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re talking to someone who is working from home. \u201cAs you can imagine, it can be quite difficult for the contact centers to find people with the proper credentials, so the job ads are all over the place,\u201d Durst says. Median annual wage: $49,710 17. Bookkeeping, accounting, auditing clerks Although the BLS projects technological changes and automation to reduce demand for bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerks, employment in this field is expected to change little by 2026. Bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerk jobs are suited to workers who want to stay home or work part-time. Occasional visits to clients and overtime hours during certain seasons are to be expected. Median annual wage: $39,240 18. Marriage and family therapist Marriage and family therapists usually work full time and many have private practices. Online video conferencing apps such as Skype and FaceTime make it possible for therapists and their patients to talk without either of them having to go anywhere. The BLS growth outlook for this profession is \u201cmuch faster than average,\u201d with 23 percent growth projected over 10 years. Lisa Marie Bobby, founder and clinical director of GrowingSelf, a Denver-based marriage and family therapy and life-coach practice, says she\u2019s been meeting patients online since 2010. It\u2019s simply easier and more efficient use of everyone\u2019s time. \u201cIt\u2019s a 45-minute meeting versus a three-hour event that you have to find time for,\u201d she says, noting that online therapy sessions are more conducive to regular attendance and reduce patient no-shows. Median annual wage: $48,790 19. Registered nurse The growth in \u201ctelehealth,\u201d accessing health care services remotely through computers and mobile devices, has given registered nurses opportunities to work from home. \u201cWith more insurance companies adding \u2018new parent support lines\u2019 and \u2018telephonic triage\u2019 and other phone options that help meet their customers\u2019 needs without having to visit a doctor\u2019s office, there\u2019s been a big increase in demand for registered nurses,\u201d says Durst. The BLS projects 15 percent growth in this field for over 10 years. Median annual wage: $70,000 20. Event planner Whether it\u2019s a convention, a fundraiser or a birthday party that needs to be put together, event planners have ample opportunity to do a lot of the work from home via phone and computer. The job may require you to visit potential meeting sites. Candidates with experience in the hospitality business and a college degree in hospitality or some related field such as tourism management will have the best opportunities. The BLS projects an 11 percent growth in this field over 10 years. Median annual wage: $48,290 Avoid work-from-home job scams When considering a work-from-home job, put up the scam-detection radar. \u201cFirst and foremost, trust your gut,\u201d advises Durst. \u201cAlmost every scam victim I\u2019ve spoken with says, \u2018I sort of felt like something wasn\u2019t right.\u2019\u2019 Scammers will try to steal your identity and/or money by getting personal information that any new hire would be expected to provide an employer, such as a Social Security number and bank account routing number. Durst suggests watching for these positive indicators of \u201creal\u201d work-from-home employment: The hirer is an established company.The ad includes the company name and does not have applicants reply to a blind email address.Human resources personnel are available for questions.There is mention of information commonly associated with \u201creal\u201d employment (benefits, vacations, policies, etc.).There is an application and interview process, not simply an emailed offer.The employer can detail the job duties and expectations.References/work samples are requested.*Do you like my answer? if so please give it a positive vote share and see my profile and find out how to work from home too.* ",

            "answer_text": "Accountant. This requires some education and training, but independent accountants can work from home. Tax season can be incredibly busy, but if you focus on business accounting, you can create steadier streams of work (and income) through retainer agreements.Agency founder. Whether you enjoy graphic design, writing, search engine optimization, advertising, software development, or some other type of white-collar work, you can build a team to work for you. Your day-to-day would include coordinating work, managing the business, marketing, sales, and operations, at least until you are able to afford staff to handle those things for you.Copy writer. If you\u2019re a great writer, you can offer content writing services to companies who want to bolster their online presence. Great content is a critical piece of ranking well in Google search results, and not everyone can write well. Being a great writer doesn\u2019t require perfect grammar, by the way. Your writing simply needs to be understandable and form a compelling narrative.Recruiter. People with a deep professional network sometimes fall into a recruiting career. Use your connections to help companies staff hard-to-fill positions and you can charge a pretty penny (usually a percentage of the placement\u2019s first-year salary).Social media manager. If you enjoy engaging with people on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, or Twitter, there are plenty of companies who will pay you to run their social media accounts. You can even automate some of your work with tools like Buffer, which lets you manage posts across several popular social networks.Software developer. You don\u2019t need a four-year degree to get started nowadays. You can join a coding boot camp and land an entry level \u201cjunior developer\u201d title at plenty of places. Reputable boot camps usually have a list of corporate sponsors who hire graduates. A boot camp program typically lasts 3\u20136 months. Lambda School is a 9-month immersive program with a great reputation that will help you land an even better job than some folks get straight out of traditional 4-year degree programs.Web developer. While this can be similar to a software developer job, you don\u2019t need all of the technical skills a developer typically has. Learn a content management system like WordPress, grab some nice looking WordPress site templates, and fill in the blanks for local companies who need an online presence.",
