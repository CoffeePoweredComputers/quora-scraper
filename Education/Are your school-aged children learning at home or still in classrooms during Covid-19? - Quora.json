            "answer_text": "Well, this is my first reply here in Quora but I guess I can answer this one. I'm a 17 year-old high school girl who currently lives in Brazil. Private schools here have adopted the homeschooling method. Because of the covid-19 pandemic, we are not allowed to leave our homes nor have contact with crowded places, so school-aged kids are having their classes online. What we are doing, by now, is attending video conferences and sending our activities to the teachers. Although this sounds like something most educational institutes should be doing, this does not apply to public schools. The problem is: here in my country, the educational system is very precarious. We do not have the proper equipment to be teaching students from the comfort os their homes. Plus, social inequality is very alarming. Many poor people here don't even have anything to eat \u2014 so having money to own a cellphone or a computer is really impossible. I've already seen a fair share of news about students that are struggling to learn during the pandemic because they don't have the tools necessary to attend online classes.  It is also very common to find students who only go to school to have a decent meal. That is why during quarentine our public schools were allowed to open their gates and distribute food for those in need.  As much as I appreciate the efforts of our schools to adapt their theaching methods to online classes, we can't deny that our reality is very different from those of developed countries and that low-income students are the most affected during this global crisis.
