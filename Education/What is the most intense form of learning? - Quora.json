            "answer_text": "In my belief, and built by my experience, the most intense form of learning is that which is taken by a person unprompted, free of pressure, and led mostly by curiosity and the ability for the learner to connect with that which is being learnt. For example, it is always pleasing when a student enters the classroom aiming to rain down a range of information they learnt last night about a topic you haven\u2019t covered. Not coming to you, the teacher, to ask about the topic; but to tell you about the topic. That intensity to learn outside of our narrow curriculums is the foundation of a life long learner. Thus it should be supported with the respect to provide inquisitive questioning, regardless of your traditional role as the teller, and praise for such endeavour. Foster these students, they will have the biggest chance to make a difference, in some way. ",

            "answer_text": "Try becoming the key operator\u2014without any formal training\u2014of a scanning electron microscope. That is an, \u201cintense form of learning\u201d, which will keep you occupied. Then design the install and build of one in your own office. Why not just train your dog to sneeze and smile on command? How about traveling to a country where you cannot speak the language? That ought to keep you busy. Lead a team of complete strangers to cook dinner for almost a THOUSAND PEOPLE. Lecture at your local university and college\u2014about the history of renewable energy or 3-D printing\u2014with only a high school diploma. Work on the Space Shuttle project. Drive from Prague to Dresden without GPS or even being able to read the road signs. Intense learning requires ostiones. If you haven\u2019t got them, DON\u2019T TRY IT. ",
