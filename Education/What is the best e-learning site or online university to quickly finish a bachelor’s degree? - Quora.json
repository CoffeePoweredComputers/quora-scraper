            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t care, then you pay a diploma mill and you\u2019ll have your degree as soon as they get the cash. It won\u2019t have any value, employers won\u2019t respect it, but you\u2019ll have a diploma (worthless). If you actually care about the degree you\u2019re earning, then look at brick and mortar colleges and universities that are regionally accredited and that offer online programs and courses. UMass Amherst does better online with its graduate programs, but they do have an undergraduate program called \u201cUniversity Without Walls\u201d (UWW). It doesn\u2019t earn the same respect as the regular campus-based programs, but if you need the flexibility and want to try to get academic credit for \u201clife experience\u201d, then UWW is the program for you. You can learn more about it on their website (or simply google University of Massachusetts Amherst University Without Walls and then click on the links to read more). ",
