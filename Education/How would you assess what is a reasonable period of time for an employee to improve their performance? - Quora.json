            "answer_text": "If the employee\u2019s performance issue rest on his/her attitude about work, such as tardiness, lack of detail orientation, bad attitude to customer or disrespectful in treating others, I expect the attitude to change within a week after a formal, documented conversation. I am willing to give one month to the employee allowing the improvement to show. If the performance issue is due to lack of skill, knowledge and experience to perform the tasks, I am willing to give as much as 6 months with coaching and mentoring tailor made for them so that they can learn. What sitting in between is performance issue due to lack of willingness to learn and improve. This warrants further diagnose. Some may lack the aptitude to continue learning. Some are simply disengaged. For the former, it is a hopeless situation. I will give 3 months to 6 months depending on the urgency in business and encourage the employee to find a more suitable position, either internally or externally. If it is the case of disengaged employee, we need to know why. And how to reengage and motivate the employee. Employee engagement is a big topic. The problem could be the direct supervisor, could be the job content, could be lack of career path or opportunity to learn\u2026 many reasons. If the company failed to motivate employee, I would again to encourage the employee to look elsewhere. It is waste of company resources as well as the employee\u2019s time. Note it could be the company\u2019s fault that the employee is disengaged. We should part our way in a respectful way. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends greatly on what performance is required. If it is to \u2018come on time\u2019 then that is something the person can begin doing right the very next day. If it is \u2018sell more Boeing 787\u2019s\u2019 then you have to look at how long the average sales person takes to sell one, which may be a year or two and so you won\u2019t be able to demand an improvement in much less than that time frame or you will be not leaving enough time. In general performance elements tend to fall into things where you can see some improvement in attitude, effort, conscientiousness (lack of mistakes in paperwork, coding, etc.) right away, so you\u2019d probably give them a week or two versus things that take longer - improve their sales results in commission sales of some product that involves building relationships with customers, in which case, several months - two to six maybe, again depending on the product and situation. Whatever time frame you choose, you should tell them clearly, ideally in writing, evaluate whether there\u2019s any progress about halfway through that time period and again near the end of it and, if necessary, allow more time (again put that in writing, don\u2019t just let the deadline slip by or it is as if you\u2019d never set it).
