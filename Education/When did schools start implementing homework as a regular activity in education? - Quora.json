            "answer_text": "Two hundred years ago last year, or 1814, in Berlin. And you can blame this guy:    After Napoleon kicked Prussian ass at Jena-Auerstedt in 1806, that Germanic nation engaged in serious soul-searching. Johann Gottlieb Fichte decided the problem was that the non-aristocratic yeoman class was too independent. They could simply tire of soldiering and return to their farms or trades and go about their business with no thought of sacrifice on behalf of the state. He decided that situation needed to be fixed. He conceived the Volkschule. The sons of aristocrats would continue to attend the Realschule to acquire such skills as horsemanship, swordsmanship and other gentlemanly arts. The children of non-aristocrats, on the other hand, would be required to attend the Volkschule in order to learn to become dependent on the state. Homework was just one of Fichte's innovations. It's purpose was to demonstrate that the state was able to impose on personal/family time. It also limited the amount of time parents could spend imparting useful skills to their offspring. Among his other innovations: Grades would demonstrate that one's work is worthy only of the subjective evaluation of one's betters and not to expect tangible reward. Bells would mark periods of the day and enforce the sense that one's activity is constantly governed by those in authority and that one's time is not one's own. Rows and columns of desks would lend a sense of isolation within regimentation. Scrutiny--school grounds and buildings would be designed with no place to avoid being viewed by staff so that an expectation of personal privacy cannot develop. A high-sounding curriculum with no processes taught start-to-finish is key to keeping student minds preoccupied under pressure without actually learning any useful skills. Horace Mann, as secretary of education for Massachusetts had started the Common school, the first (?) public schools in the US (previously, education had been private or civil). In 1843, he traveled to Prussia to review the school system there, and brought back the methodology of the Volkschule to his home state. He attempted to interest educators in other states in his new approach to schooling, but they weren't having it, preferring instead the quintessentially American \"little red schoolhouse\" system. Eventually, he began enticing state legislatures to adopt his methods as the solution to \"the immigrant problem.\" Half a century later, John Dewey added some assembly-line-like features, and we had our American public school system, unchanged in any important respect for more than a century, well, two centuries if you go back to the school that first started cranking out \"good little Germans,\" or, as Fichte himself stated his goal:  Workers who will not strike, citizens who will not revolt, soldiers who will not disobey orders.

            "answer_text": "Wasn't that from \"Day One\"? Didn't teachers used to travel from town to town, teaching the children for a few hours and then seeing them again a few weeks later?   Obviously, the students were expected to do Home Work to learn. Isn't that what a private music teacher expects?  You meet with your teacher for one to two hours per week, and then the next week the teacher has Expected you to be practicing at home (e.g. home work). Even a college like MIT assigns its credits (360 credits needed to graduate) based upon home work.   A 12 credit class means that MIT believes that, at a minimum, the student will spend a combined 12 hours in class and studying per week.   The high schools in Massachusetts Expect that a student will receive 990 hours of class room time over 180 days.   However, they realize that it is unlikely that the student will receive more than 900 hours of in-class education during those 180 days or 5 hours per day. 5 hours per day for five days per week is 25 hours of class room instruction.   However, a typical high school student should be exposed to at Least 40 hours per week of school work, and therefore a Minimum of 15 hours per week of home work.   Plus making up that 90 hours of missed in-class education through civic duties...... One needs to Study in order to learn, and therefore, one turns in Home work to show that they have studied. Easy.
