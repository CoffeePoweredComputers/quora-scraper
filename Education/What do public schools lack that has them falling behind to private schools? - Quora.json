            "answer_text": "What do public schools lack that has them falling behind to private schools? The best high schools in Illinois are public schools, with one big factor going for them: selectivity. The selective enrollment high schools in Chicago (that is, the schools you have to test into) are the best in the state. After that, public high schools in wealthy suburbs are the best. They\u2019re de facto \u201cselective\u201d because a student\u2019s parents must be successful just to live in the district, and having successful parents is a huge advantage for students. After that comes private high schools. Some private high schools aren\u2019t as selective as they used to be, because they need tuition-paying students, and there aren\u2019t as many parents who can afford it as there used to be. Still, they are selective based on parents\u2019 willingness and ability to pay the tuition. If your parents can and will do that, you\u2019re already at an advantage as a student anyway. Below that are charter schools. These schools don\u2019t get to select their students, but parents have to sign their children up for the school. So, if you\u2019re at a charter school, you have at least one parent who gives a damn about your education. The bottom rung of schools are public, non-selective schools which pull a majority of their students from impoverished or lower-middle-class areas. What do those schools lack that the other schools that get better results have? The answer is obvious: students whose parents are successful and/or take an active role in their child\u2019s education. Parents who pay for private school, or pay a lot for a house in a very good school district, aren\u2019t buying a better curriculum or higher standards for their children, per se. They\u2019re paying to separate their children from the classroom distractions that come from students whose parents don\u2019t care as much about education. The better curriculum and higher standards are a byproduct of schools not having to deal with too many discipline problems and other problems that come along with a large portion of students whose parents lack the will or the means to support their education.

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re simply not asking the right question. Public schools are designed to meet the needs of their communities, providing an appropriate range of educational skills and experience for students from the very top, college bound academic students, to not-college bound students seeking a general high school diploma, and special needs children who do not function well in ordinary classroom settings. They accomplish most of these goals, and some excel at many of them. Sadly, as we have become increasingly aware of and sensitive to the needs of the entire breadth of society, they have become less able to meet the needs of everyone. Part of the problem lies in the sheer impossibility of being all things to all people. This problem has been exacerbated by changes in our society\u2019s priorities as the baby boomer generation has aged while continuing to place demands on the tax base for meeting their personal needs while caring little for the larger society. Part of the problem also lies in the emergence of competing schools. These schools are seeking public funding at the expense of public schools. as these schools are beginning to attract and compete for public money. Meanwhile, private schools, especially the elite college preparatory schools, have become a refuge for college bound students whose parents can afford tuition which often exceeds $50,000 per year. While these schools are often successful at providing instruction as well as the luster of the reputation to aide students who might not be easily accepted in their local public school or do as well there, because they require extra attention, they also drain strong students and reduce the willingness of parents to support taxpayer supported public schooling. Recent incursions and demands of public funding have been made more difficult because Betsy De Vos, the current secretary of Education, proposes support for many alternatives previously better supported by public sources. Rather than the \u201cfalling behind\u201d the questioner suggests, it\u2019s truly a wonder that our public schools continue to produce the vast majority of college admissions and that our universities, corporations, and government are filled with successful graduates of these institutions.
