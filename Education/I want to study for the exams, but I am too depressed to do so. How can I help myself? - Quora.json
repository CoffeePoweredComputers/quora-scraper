            "answer_text": "I had something similar to this when I was a senior in college. I had been so antisocial and fatigued, that I literally lost contact with people even in the next room and all down the hall in my dorm. I, of course, had reached a point where I had to at least pass every class that I was taking. I was in a relationship that I wasn't sure was right for me. And, I simply could not focus, and felt so sad. I happened to be taking a psych class. One day, after class, I followed my psych prof to his office and very nervously told him how I was feeling. His advice, of course, was given to me as a teacher, since we did not have a doctor patient relationship. This is a summary of his suggestions for me. He told me that I should make any decisions that I could, even if in the long run that decision had to be examined again. He felt that the inner debate on making a decision about my relationship was taking too much emotional energy. I was at a point where I just could not get any work done. He asked me what I thought the longest time was that I could study/do my work. I told him maybe 10 or 15 minutes. So he said to begin with 10 minutes. Take a break. Think about what you accomplished. Walk outside for a few minutes. When you go back into the dorm, say hello to anyone you see. Just hello and their name if you know it. If there are any doors wide open on the hall, just lean in a bit and say hello, and name. Then my next session should be 15 minutes. Then the same as above. He suggested that I have some kind of system to get me back on track after the breaks\u2026have a friend check on me every hour or so, use a timer, have my parents call every hour, use an alarm clock\u2026anything that would mark an ending and beginning to work. And then 20 more minutes of work and a break with leaving the dorm, saying hello to people, and thinking about whatever I wanted. He asked what I thought was reasonable break time and I just didn't know. So we talked about the most imposing things I needed to get done, and the amount of time that would take and the due date. So we decided that my breaks should be no more than 15 minutes. If there were things that took a larger block of time, like getting lunch or dinner, then I would extend the break to 30 to 40 minutes and then I returned to the work-break schedule. So after 15 min. of work, then a break thinking about what I had accomplished, going outside, speaking to people was for the first 5 days, increasing to 20 min. of work and then 30 minutes the last week. It worked those last few of weeks of school. I felt like a robot and that is exactly what I needed to survive that time period. He met with me again for an hour, after a week and then an hour the next week. Of course, he agreed to help me based on my agreeing to get therapy as soon as I finished up. In summary, I think what he was trying to do was stabilize me and put me into an autonomic program, so I could accomplish something, He also felt that I should at the least make human contact by speaking to people by name. Of course, what happened was people saying hi in return, asking about this or that, and a few people dropping by my room to chat. And, frequently, I found myself stretching out the length of the work time. I had to limit my talks with the person in my relationship, and not be with him for about 3 weeks. It was worth it since I did not want to lose an entire semester of school with only 3 weeks left. I hope this helps. You need to talk this through with your parents so that you can see a therapist as soon as possible. If for some reason you cannot approach your parents with this, either choose a teacher, a minister, other family member, or any adult who can be your advocate with your parents. You school or local community may also be able to provide help or counseling. By gaining some control over your life, it makes you feel more alive and helps you think about solutions. You will be in my thoughts. ",

            "answer_text": "Struggling with depression can be hard enough as it is, but if you\u2019re also trying to do your best in studying, the two things can get in each other\u2019s ways. Feelings of hopelessness, guilt, worthlessness, not being in control are characteristics of depression that can undermine your studying, just like decreased concentration, memory capacity and self-esteem. What\u2019s more, a disappointing prove can \u201cprove\u201d your depressive cognitions and make you feel even worse. Other people might think you don\u2019t have the discipline or the motivation, which only makes you feel worse about yourself. These are some tips I found helpful when going through a similar phase: 1. Mental health is more important than grades. In my life, a lot of people have told me that school is the most important thing in your life, but it\u2019s not. Education is extremely important, but always prioritise your mental and physical health. 2. Don\u2019t beat yourself up. I have often been angry at myself because I was barely able to study for an entire day. Now I realise that studying just takes a lot more effort othe days depression hits you the worst. There might be days when you can barely get yourself out of bed. If you: got out of bedread a single pagedid something you genuinely enjoyedlooked at your planner, ormade it through the dayI think you have something to be proud of. Know that I am proud of you. 3. Study in short shifts. As I mentioned above, one of the key characteristics of depression is decreased concentration. Tackle this problem by doing small studying shifts with rewarding breaks in between. (For example, use the pomodoro techniqe: 25 minutes studying, 5 minute break.) Another way to deal with this is by finding out when your concentration peaks and do the hardest studying during that time of the day. 4. Planning is key. Planning is important for every student, but for those struggling with depression even more so. It can take you longer to read and memorise the material than average, so plan your revision and reading sessions long before the exam and divide chunks over several days and weeks. 5. Self care. Just like #4, this applies to all, but even more if you struggle with mental health issues. Some things you can do: colour in a colouring bookwash your hair (works wonders for me at times)take a 20 minute walk outside (you don\u2019t have to run)list 3 things each day you\u2019re grateful for or that went wellwatch a sitcomcall someone you\u2019re comfortable with and chatfind one thing in your life that you\u2019re passionate about, however stupid it is, and enjoy with the power of the fucking sunsing a song that makes you feel powerfulmeditations and readingI know and acknowledge that some of these are maintenance activities that you don\u2019t feel able to do when you\u2019re really down. I hope others help you anyway. 6. No allnighters. I repeat: NO ALNIGHTERS! This is seriously important. Again, everyone needs sleep, but it is important to know that sleep deprivation usually worsen depression and can even trigger a depressive episode or other mental syndrome. The rule of thumb according to my doctor: sleep before midnight, wake up before 9am. 7. Find different levels of motivation. I think this is a little weird and maybe it\u2019s just me, but I have different \u2018goals\u2019 to get myself motivated. On the higher levels, I want to help people and become a psychologist, but at the same time, on the lower levels, I want to get good grades and find the material interesting. If my poor mood makes the high level feel unreachable, I still have the lower levels to count on. 8. See your doctor. Even if you feel your symptoms are subclinical (i.e. \u201cnot important/bad/relevant\u201d enough). He or she can help you find a therapist, diagnosis, medication, or just be someone to talk to and vent. 9. Inform the school. Talk about your struggles with a counselor/mentor or someone at your school or institution who can help you. Sometimes, you can get extra time or different exam environments if this helps you perform better. Someone should be aware of your situation. I hope this helps you. These tips were based on a combination of research and my own experience. If any of these tips help even just one person, I feel like my mission is successful ;) ",
