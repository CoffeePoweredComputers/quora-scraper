            "answer_text": "It depends on what course, what university and the grades, calibre of the students. . I would have thought if you have the grades asked for in the exam you will get in but each uni is different. . Some unis have better reputations than others and some are known to be the best for certain courses. I imagine the London School of Economics is the best uni to go to for anything to do with business or economics in London. Edinburgh has a great reputation for medicine.. of course Oxford and Cambridge are generally so difficult to get into but if you are for exame the son of the king of Saudi Arabia, the influence politics and who you know would help a great deal for their children to get accepted. Bill Clinton got into Oxford. ",

I do not know for a fact but I would doubt that universities make much of students resitting exams. At least they can see you a redetermined and not put off by adversity. ",
