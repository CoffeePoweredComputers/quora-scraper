            "answer_text": "It actually took me quite sometime to identify one provider that would take care of writing needs for students, and adequately while at it. It can be really difficult for a student to find a one-stop place where all their needs can be covered. Appreciating this problem pushed me to see how I could help the situation. It wasn't long before I decided to throw myself into the field and provide writing services for students. Considering that most students run to Reddit to find homework-help providers, I started by advertising my services there. Within the first week, I had written assignments for about 3 students. Not that many, of course, but it showed me the kind of needs that students had. That was 5 years ago. Having been in the field for 5 years, I've been able to fashion my prices in a manner that suits students. Additionally, such factors as timely-delivery of papers, originality of work, proper formatting, and general depth of paper in terms of content are highly considered. I've seen my scope grow from providing short writing services, to handling complex research papers, lengthy essays, as well as handling semester online classes for students. I ensure that I'm available throughout the period when I'm working on a student's paper. I can be reached on eminencewriter@gmail.com ",
