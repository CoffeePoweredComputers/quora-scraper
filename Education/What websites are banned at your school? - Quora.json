            "answer_text": "Apart from obvious sites like XVideos (strangely, my Photoshop class had different computers that did not block the site) and social media (ironically, not Quora), here\u2019s some sites (and two extensions) that my school discovered from monitoring student activity: Total Jerkface - Where you can play the entire Happy Wheels experience. Most likely banned due to violence. Cookie Clicker - How that dead meme became a trend at my school remains unknown to me. Incidentally, I was attached to Cookie Clicker before school last year started. For some reason, the classic version of Cookie Clicker was left unblocked, and it\u2019s still is to this day. YouTube - For thirty minutes or so, some nice IT guy decided to play with our minds and flat-out block YouTube. My English teacher instructed my class to use YouTube for an assignment, but no one was able to access it. It was unblocked after my teacher called the office about the problem.PokerStars (and pretty much any online casino site) - The IT guy wanted no one to become gambling addicts. I\u2019ve tried to access the site out of curiosity.GTAForums (and any site affiliated with GTA/Rockstar) - \u201cALL THE NUMBER NINES WITH THE EXTRA DIP, YOU BETTER RUN, BETTER RUN, FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN!\u201d - Big SmokeUrban Dictionary - My science teacher wanted to pull up a definition from there. Self-explanatory.Google Hangouts - Distraction?Google User Content - It is simply a snapshot of a webpage when you click \u201cCache\u201d on the green dropdown next to the URL. A smart way to access your favorite porn genre, but I can\u2019t outsmart the IT guy.Now for the extensions\u2026 VPNs - Also self-explanatory.Google Remote Desktop - Again, self-explanatory. Can\u2019t outsmart the IT guy.Kahoot bots - That extension in particular is very interesting to describe. Several people in my science class, including me, used the Kahoot bot extension. I forgot the name because it\u2019s gone from the Chrome Web Store. Basically, you enter the game PIN, choose the number of bots, and enter the name of the bot. One extension however only add bots with built-in names (e.g. Kim Jong-Uno or Ben Dover). When Kahoot gets too lit Dude ruins Kahoot with 2k bots One day in science, I decided to unleash my army of bots, because I noted that the 2-step system (enter a random code to join the game) was not on. To make my science teacher think better, I initially entered 100 bots to join the game. All of them, legitimately, were named \u201cpenis\u201d. This was in the middle of the game, by the way, like the examples shown above. I think it was after the second question. Unfortunately, I do not have any records of the hack, but this is from memory. The initial reaction was priceless. Everyone\u2019s jaw dropped to an unbelievable hack. I can quote one kid saying: \u201cWhat the?! I\u2019m behind a\u2026 Penis number 53\u2026\u201d Eventually, I added hundreds of more bots into the game. The highest I\u2019ve seen was around 500. My science teacher was unable to control the bots, because Kahoot allowed people to join in the middle of the game. Eventually, the entire bot situation became uncontrollable, and it was the last Kahoot game for the rest of the year due to the hacks, I think. Surprisingly, my bots were able to get the correct answer to reach the top of the leaderboard. This is what the leaderboard looked like, according to memory: Penis number ???Some kid named \u201cThe Muffin Man\u201dPenis number ???Penis number ???Penis number ???I\u2019m not joking. My bots were geniuses. My science teacher wanted to find out the culprit so bad. I deleted the extension right after she announced that. Everyone was looking at this one person named Jake Paul (names changed to protect identities*). Mr. Jake Paul was laughing at my name choice. I tried my best to hold my laugh. But everyone pointed out it was him to blame. Yep, it was him that got in trouble. The only thing that I could remember is him getting mocked by others for \u201cusing\u201d a perverted name, but he kept pleading that it was only him laughing at my name choice. This is where my bad luck kicked in. Someone, let\u2019s say Steve from Blue\u2019s Clues, thought that I was the one that did it (That\u2019s correct), because I was hiding my screen from everyone else, aside from one other kid to my left named Judy. I think Judy was using an emulator playing Pok\u00e9mon Emerald and not Kahoot, or he was absent that day, I\u2019m not that great at remembering. Anyway, my science teacher inspected my computer, and nothing was found. Then, she inspected Jake\u2019s computer, and sure enough, he had the extension. The story ends with Jake staying after class. I believe his parents were called, and he probably failed the \u201cClass Participation\u201d grade. In summary, I got someone in trouble because of my word choice for a Kahoot bot. But then karma decided to step in. After science, I was going to Spanish next period, and all of a sudden, the bell rang right next to my right ear. Now that I had a story to tell, here are some websites the IT guy forgot to block: Quora - I was able to access it like nothing happened. It\u2019s a place to share knowledge, after all! Wikipedia - I think the IT guy knows that Wikipedia has a sources section. .io sites - No clue. And surprisingly\u2026 Hentai Haven - Honestly, I have no idea how one kid managed to pull up Cream Lemon without people staring at that kid\u2019s Chromebook. I was unable to witness it, but someone told me that kid was able to access the site. FanFiction - It should be banned because there are many stories with terrible grammar. Starring too many neo-Grammar Nazis born in the 80s/early 90s leaving reviews on how to write when they can retire from writing. And a dedicated forum to those who actually have a logical reason why those reviews are invalid. And I think that\u2019s all I have to say. Portions of this answer do not apply to the question being asked, such as unbanned websites and the Kahoot story. (*-Jake Paul, Steve and Judy are their real life initials) ",

            "answer_text": "Our school blocked Tumblr and it\u2019s my fault. In 9th grade, we had to write research papers about a topic that had relevance in the real world and that we had interest in. I decided to write about the stigma against and romanticization of suicide. To accompany our research paper, we also had to give an oral presentation with a powerpoint that contained visual references to our points. One of the things I mentioned in my paper was the internet\u2019s constant romanticization of mental illness and suicide. I went online to find some images to demonstrate my point (I will include them below; if they make you uncomfortable, you may want to skip over them.) and was naturally led to Tumblr. Now, let me explain: Tumblr wasn\u2019t completely unblocked before I did my research project. Every time I went to put a funny gif from some TV show or movie or whatever that was sourced from Tumblr into a project I was doing, I couldn\u2019t get it to move and if I tried to click through to the original page I got hit with the \u201cTHIS WEBSITE HAS BEEN BLOCKED BY YOUR DISTRICT\u201d notification. However, the ban seemed to only take place on fandom blogs. I\u2019m not joking. I wasn\u2019t able to access a picture of Benedict Cumberbatch winking, but I could get to blogs full of people cutting, quotes encouraging suicide as the best and only option, and people treating mental illness as an aesthetic.  I included some images that I decided were \u201cschool appropriate\u201d in my presentation and then, in full-fledged pissed off fourteen year old mode, went to my mother to tell her what I had been able to do. I ended up crying because I was so upset with how ridiculous the content the school blocked was. I know it wasn\u2019t really the school\u2019s fault, but it was perturbing that they would restrict access to one part of a site that couldn\u2019t really cause any harm apart from distracting students, while leaving another, darker part of the same site wide open for kids to be influenced by. In my anger/confusion/whatever, I may have forgotten to cite my images until an hour before I had to give my presentation. I went back to put the blogs through Easybib and\u2026 they were all blocked\u2026 Oops. The moral of this story is to do citations as you go and not save them for the very end. I\u2019m happy that my school did end up blocking all of Tumblr rather than only certain portions because, yeah, it makes it a little harder for me to put stupid references in my more casual presentations, but the wannabe grunge culture that encourages people my age to do the \u201cunspeakable\u201d is not something we should have access to on school computers and wi-fi if they\u2019re going to block other, less dangerous material. Besides, it gives me a good story. ",
