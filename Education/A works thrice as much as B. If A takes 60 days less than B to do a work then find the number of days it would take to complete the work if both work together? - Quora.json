That is B takes 3X days to complete the work. As A takes 60 days less than B, the equation should be X+60=3X 3X-X=60 and X=30 Therefore A takes 30 days to complete the work and B takes 90 days to complete the work. A can complete 1/30 of work in 1 day and B cancomplete 1/90 of work in 1 day A an B together can complete 1/30+1/90=(3+1)/90=4/90 of work in 1 day. A and B together can complete the work in90/4=22.5 days. ",

            "answer_text": "Here I will assume the work to be done as 90 units Given that A is thrice efficient as B. Let efficiency of A be 3, and that of B be 1. So, A completes the work in 90/3 = 30 days. B completes the same work in 90/1 = 90 days. Now, if they both work together, combined efficiency of A and B is 3+1=4. Total work to be done is 90 (as assumed) No of days required is Work to be done/combined effiency = 90/4 22.5 days. Now you might be wondering why on earth did I assume work to be 90 days. It is because of the numbers given in the question. He said A is 3 times efficient as B. Which means A is completing the job 60 days prior to B. This very clearly tells us that the early completion of work by A is clearly attributed to his more efficiency as compared to B which is 3\u20131=2. From here we can deduce that 2 parts of A's efficiency is equal to the 60 days. That implies 1 part is 30. Similarly, 3 parts of A's efficiency is 90 days. When we put 3 parts of A's efficiency together, we say work is completed. (which is our total work). The more you practice these questions, the faster you can assume a common factor for the total work, there by you can eliminate all the fractions in the answer eliminating any scope that is left for confusion. You might find many methods where you see people use fractions, and their main goal is to make the fraction into 1 (which means that the work is done). You really free to follow whichever method looks easier to you. Hope it was helpful. Thanks you. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll be solving this through Ratio Method. It is easy and faster. Efficiency of A is 3 times of B, so Efficiency ratio between them is; A : B = 3 : 1 (as given in the question above). Taking Time taken by B= 3y and Time Taken by A= y (Reverse of Efficiency ratio). In the Question it is said that A takes 60 days less than B, So, B-A= 60, or (3y-y) 2y = 60, therefore y= 30. Then from this we can say that A does the same work in 30 days which B does in 30+60 i.e in 90 days. From the days working, Taking the LCM of 30 and 90, we get 90. Therefore Total Work is 90 Units. If both A & B works together then work completed will be,Total Work/Total Efficiency Together i.e 90/(3+1) = 22.5 Days (Answer). ",

Now let B take \u201cd\u201d days to complete a certain task, then A will take \u201cd-60\" days to complete the same task as A takes 60 days less then B to complete the same task. Now total work done by both A and B is the same as they as doing the same work. So equate the total work done by A and B :- Work done by A :- 3*(d-60) Work done by B :- 1*d So, 3d-180 = d 2d = 180 d = 90 So B alone takes 90 days to finish the work and A alone takes 30 days to complete the work and the total work is of 90 units. So of they work together, they will do 3+1=4 units per day. So days needed to finish work if both of them worked together to finish the task are :- 90/4 = 22.5 days So the answer is 22.5 days. ",
