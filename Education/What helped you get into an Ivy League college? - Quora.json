            "answer_text": "I can only speak from my experience working in admissions for Princeton University Admissions and, later, working in admissions and with students elsewhere. My students have been accepted to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth, Brown, and Penn and have worked very intensively to get into Ivies. First, every Ivy League school is different and has its own character and priorities. These priorities, if you understand and align with them, can help you achieve a spot or eliminate you from the running. The process of filtering applicants out and \u201cweeding\u201d of applications is significant for every Ivy. So, it is important to understand ways to avoid \u201cweeding\u201d. Once you get beyond the \u201cweeding\u201d which is mostly academic in nature, the next step is to consider the priorities of each school. While you will see, as in my other posts, that I have shared so much here, it\u2019s difficult to give you everything in one Quora post. I have tried to articulate ways of thinking that will help you get into the colleges that you are considering. If you feel you need more guidance, you can always opt for an admissions coach like those at Opus College Prep. Hope it helps! Princeton University Princeton (like Cornell) is most STEM focused of all the Ivy schools. For students who care about the hard sciences, engineering, mathematics, Princeton is a good fit and a large majority of its students are pursuing STEM-related areas.Princeton will look at grades and expect perfection-even 1 or 2 B\u2019s might filter a student out of the process.Princeton will also care about your extracurricular achievements and how exceptional you have been in them.They will look at your recommendation letters and weight them heavily in the process, too.Princeton likes awards. So, try to win some important awards, or at least one.Harvard University Harvard (like Yale and Dartmouth) leans in toward Humanities.Harvard, like Princeton, prioritizes academics (GPA and course rigor are deciding factors on whether your application even gets fully read-expect that 4.0 is the standard to be evaluated for Harvard)Like Princeton, Harvard prioritizes students who have achieved major awards. Without going down the rabbit hole of all the awards they like to see here, you can easily imagine what these are in some cases\u2014Regeneron/Intel, major math competition, etc\u2026Harvard will look at personal qualities and evaluate students heavily based on recommendation laters, assigning scores to those qualitiesSchool support-Harvard will look for whether a student is supported by his/her school (often through rec letters and awards won at school)Brown University Brown University will look for free thinkers who have moved mountains through community service. Brown is known for its exceptional teaching and its community outreach organization is one of the largest groups on campus.Brown cares immensely about community service and open-mindedness. Before you start tallying your logged hours to boost your application, that\u2019s not exactly what we are talking about here. Working to make a major impact on your community can be helpful. Think in terms of people helped, the difference made and numbers that are impactful.Understanding Brown and being able to articulate how you will spend your time here will also help you. Brown\u2019s Open Curriculum and lack of distribution requirements means that students are free to choose their own path.With that, Brown expects students to plan their pathway. Brown\u2019s most popular programs are economics, computer science, engineering, biology, neuroscience, classics, applied math and geology.Strong writing is exceptionally important to the Brown admissions committee (like all Ivy committees) and students need to highlight their writing strengths in the application essays.Dartmouth University The smallest and most traditional of all the Ivies, if you are a hiker, Dartmouth is a good place to apply if you are looking to align with its priorities. Dartmouth (like Princeton) will prioritize students interested in the great outdoors. The Dartmouth Outing Club is one of the oldest clubs of its kind in the country.More similar to the NESCACS like Middlebury and Williams, Dartmouth will also lean into filling spots on athletic teams. So, if you are a top athlete and can get recruited, you might want to reach out early and often to Dartmouth\u2019s many teams and their coaches for a leg up in the process. Beware for anyone who is not that sporty: a requirement of graduation at Dartmouth is a swimming test and a PE requirement!! Physical fitness is important to the university.Dartmouth, above the other Ivies, will prioritize foreign language. So, if you are a polyglot and can show your passion for languages, Dartmouth might be a great place for you. The top programs at Dartmouth are economics, government, history, psychology, English, engineering, biological sciences, and computer science.University of Pennsylvania Like Cornell, Early Decision is the way to go at PENN. It helps to apply early and offers you a greater chance.At PENN, liberal arts and pre-professional programs like nursing and engineering are fairly equal.Like Dartmouth, having a sports background can be helpful in getting into PENN.Cornell University To get into Cornell, Early Decision is the way to go.Doing your homework and showing a love for Cornell will help with getting into Cornell. Because of its remote location and unique \u201cloner\u201d standing among the Ivies, Cornell loves to see the love from students to ensure they will attend if offered a spot. While it\u2019s easier to align with the MILLION institutional priorities that Cornell has, showing the love requires a lot of research into what makes Cornell special.Cornell is the largest of all of the Ivies with a total undergraduate enrollment of roughly 14,500 in any given year. It is also the most egalitarian of the Ivies with the most socially mobile students.Cornell is considered strong in engineering and architecture and its hotel administration programs are renowned.There are more opportunities to get into Cornell because there is more going on at Cornell than at any other Ivy League school. It\u2019s sheer size and mix of state and private funding create many opportunities for students to align and connect.Cornell offers a mix of liberal arts, pre-professional programs and the diversity of possibility creates many opportunities for every student to be considered.Columbia University Columbia\u2019s students are extremely hardworking and a bit more stressed than other Ivy students. There is a culture of competition at Columbia, which is odd considering students and the university pride themselves on intellectualism and a passion for the liberal arts and CORE program. Less pre-professional than PENN and much more intellectual, getting into Columbia requires highlighting a fit with one of two schools\u2014Columbia College (Columbia\u2019s school of arts and sciences) or the Fu School of Engineering and Applied Science.Depending on which program you apply to, you will have to show a deep interest in the liberal arts and/or research to be considered by Columbia.For NY students, it helps to try to align with Columbia by taking courses on campus or getting involved in some way with the university.Columbia definitely favors certain schools as \u201cfeeders\u201d over others. So, if your school is not a feeder and does not have a history of sending students to Columbia, you might be better to opt for another Ivy.Yale University Yale functions very similarly to Harvard and takes the same measures to weed through applications. There is a system of intense filtering out.For students who want to avoid the filter, you need to focus on getting a 4.0 GPA and taking the most rigorous courses possible at your school.Yale, like Harvard, leans into the humanities.Yale\u2019s most popular programs are economics, life sciences, poli sci, engineering, history, English, architecture and modern languages. For students applying to these programs, it will be important to show a strong background in research",

            "answer_text": "I applied to 5 Ivies (HYPrColPe). I was rejected by H and Pr, waitlisted by Y, and accepted by Col and Pe [all regular decision]. In addition, I got into Caltech regular decision, which is very comparable to Ivies and certainly better in terms of majoring in math/physics/chemistry/engineering. Not that it\u2019s relevant, as these universities are generally considered tier 2 schools, but I also was accepted by UChicago and Duke regular decision with significant merit scholarships. First and foremost, my stats got me in the door \u2014 Rank 1 out of 120 students, 1590 SAT [800 M, 790 R], 36 ACT [36 E, 36 M, 36 R, 35 S], 4.73 GPA, 1510/1520 on PSAT [got National Merit Scholarship], 16 APs with 12 5s, 800s on Chem and Math II subject tests, 790 on Biology-M subject test, 780 on Physics subject test (I had to self-study pretty much all of E&M, optics, and modern physics, so not too shabby). I took the most advanced courses possible at my school in every subject, especially math, where I completed Multivariable Calculus my junior year (received the Multivariable Calc. Student of the Year award from the math department) and studied Linear Algebra, Set and Number Theory, and Complex Analysis my senior year. As a junior, I took 7 AP exams. The summer after my sophomore year, I took part in the COSMOS math and science research program at UC Irvine, which led to me getting a research internship at UC Irvine for 2 full years at a molecular and cell biology lab. I participated in the SIMR research program at Stanford\u2019s Medical school (~5% acceptance rate) the summer after my junior year as an intern in a bioinformatics lab. My research is somewhat classified, but I did make a significant discovery that could lead to the repurposing of a currently available drug to treat pulmonary fibrosis. In high school, I was the captain of our Academic Decathlon and Mock Trial teams, and I also launched a service initiative my freshman year that gained local, state, and national recognition in approximately 100 newspapers, including USA Today. I will say that if you want to launch a club devoted to service and outreach, it should be devoted to targeting an interesting social issue and revolve around something you truly care about. I was also a Varsity golfer all 4 years, served as an editor and writer on the Publications staff for 2 years, and represented my school for 3 years in the local Chemistry Olympiad competitions. Although I was very disappointed that I didn\u2019t ultimately get into Harvard or Princeton and was also rejected by MIT and Stanford (decided to withdraw from Yale\u2019s waitlist), I eventually accepted that life goes on.
