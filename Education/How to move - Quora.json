            "answer_text": "Assess your stuff. Will your IKEA bed break if you try to take it apart and move it? Are your appliances old? Don't move broken items. Everybody goes through their stuff. There will be 4 piles (possibly 5, depending on your stuff). Be ruthless. It's just stuff. Think 5 yrs in the future - will you miss the item? When was the last time you actually used, or even looked at the item? If you haven't touched it in a year, get rid of it.   1 Garbage/Recycle.   Self explanatory. Broken, dangerous, things that should have gone in the garbage when you got home with the happy meal, old paperwork, etc 2 Sell - Prepare to sell off what you can - old books, kid's toys, extra kitchenware, small pieces of furniture, unused craft items, board games, puzzles,etc.   wash, repair, paint, catalog, price - Have the yard sale 3 Donate - Call different services where you are, find out what they take, and how to get it there.  4 Stuff you will move - Should be the smallest amount of stuff 5 If you have high quality items that you no longer want or have interest in - you can consider consignment, or pawning. These could include top quality tools, designer clothing and accessories, collectibles, antiques, etc Call moving companies, and get estimates. You don't know the prices until you check them out. By the time you drive two vehicles, possibly spend multiple days on the road for lack of being able to make road time - your costs could be very similar to them moving your stuff, and you driving long distances over a couple of days.  Call UHaul, and other self movers. They could have a one way that needs to be returned to Seattle. Of course, you don't have a lot of time, so you may not be able to do much prep.  Safe journey. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Sir, I understand your dilemma. However, since you and your wife have chosen to move, you have also decided that you must, in some form, travel from one city to another. So, taking into consideration your children's concerns with travelling for a long time, your wife's inability to drive on the highway and the financial issue, here are your options, in my honest opinion. 1. I have actually just looked at flights for you, and there seem to be some for as little as 155$. The price does go up a bit depending on which airline you use, but perhaps you have air miles you could use towards the trip? Since your kids do not like travelling for a long time, and since your wife does not enjoy the highway, this may be the best option. 2. Drive. Do you feel comfortable driving on the highway? There is really nothing to be scared of. Yes, there are silly drivers out there, but if you mind your own business and keep a speed just under 100 km./hr, you will be just fine. To make it more interesting, you can stop at the halfway mark and rent a motel room for the night, maybe stop at a touristic site to walk around for a few hours and have lunch. Make the whole trip into an adventure for your kids. The thing is that most kids do not like long trips. Neither do adults. But sometimes it is unavoidable. I do think it's really nice that you're taking your kids' discomfort into account. In the end, you are the parents, and so the final decision is yours.  For your belongings, I would say your best bet is to either hire a moving company if you must keep your bedroom set and other big things. If not, sell them and buy new when you get to Seattle. It may be hard to let go of old furniture, but it can also provide for a clean slate feeling. You are starting over in a new city. It's exciting! It's fresh! You have the world at your fingertips! And most importantly, you have your wife and kids. Something many people dream of!  Actually, if I were you, I would sit your wife and kids down, tell them how much you love them. Tell them how excited you are to be going on this new adventure with them. Tell them there will be a few obstacles, like a long trip (if you drive there). But tell them they are gonna have a ball picking out new furniture and making new friends! These are fun and exciting changes, and they should all feel how fortunate they are to be experiencing this adventure. Then tell them again that because you love them so much, you are a team and you will all get through this together. Good luck!  Family road trip from San Francisco, CA to Seattle, WA ",
