            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you're a science student. So, I'd say that the process of leading to take a drop began from 11th standard itself. Initially, 11th was smooth and I was able to cope up with everything then during mid-year things started to get a bit difficult for me.(I'm a science student with bio and I was in Aakash institute which was a franchise, basically and they had kinda below average teachers) So naturally, I was not able to understand a lot of things that were taught to us in physics and chemistry and I didn't bother to ask someone or look out for help because I thought there's no point in it (my biggest mistake probably). At that time, I was also not aware of the online teaching platforms or the YouTube videos (physicswallah, biomentors etc.) that are available (If I have had watched some of the videos back in time to clear my doubts, the chain reaction of low marks and constant self-doubt wouldn't have begun) Not to mention, I was a bit careless in class too because of my very entertaining friends. In short, 11th was the foundation and in my case, it was fragile. Then in 12th, I tried my best to improve and I used to study hard but then again, my foundation was weak so it was double-work for me and the results did not have a very significant change. So, I knew beforehand that I'd require to take a drop (infact I knew it since 11th when things were not going too well for me). Now, my suggestion to you is- Study regularly and revise what you're being taught the same day (I know this is same as what everyone says but trust me, it is the key. You still have a lot of time, don't worry about what you have done or achieved till now). Also, after tests, analyse your mistakes and don't get demotivated when you get low marks. (it's very important for improvement) I hope you do well in future :) All the best. ",
