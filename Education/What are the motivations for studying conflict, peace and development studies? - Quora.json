            "answer_text": "Personally I studied it but I have never regretted, it assists me in making political analysis about peace building. Conflict is the order of the day world wide and if you have any dream of working with international humanitarian agencies, this your course. At a family level this course will enable you to be a good peace maker by studying various concepts about peace. All in it will teach you how to deal with reality. Development Studies enables you to study communities and a policy makers will need your research in setting up pro-people development. Again it easy for one who did an undergraduate degree in Development Studies to do a masters in most humanities courses so it is an open ended course. ",
