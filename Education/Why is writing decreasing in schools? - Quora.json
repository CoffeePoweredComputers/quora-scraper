            "answer_text": "Yes. Writing exercises or the need for writing itself is becoming less - because of the introduction of technology -Digital methods of learning/assessment etc., It is possible that a few years from now, typing would be the way of writing - or just hovering a finger over the digital letters/screen would replace typing. Today, knowing the way to write on papers, I might say it is bad- We have preserved documents from the past, written on dried leaves - Present innovation of technology in digital writing is in my opinion further progress from writing on paper.
