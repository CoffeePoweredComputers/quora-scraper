            "answer_text": "A lot would depend on how you define \"design.\" If someone defines design simply by its aesthetic value, then it would be rather subjective, as you've pointed out. I would define design as an overarching term that encompasses everything, from aesthetic value to functionality and usability. In the online world, design can most certainly be measured. In fact, creative is constantly being tested against each other all the time to see which drives the most conversions. It's a combination of how a product looks and how intuitive or fluid it is to interact with. The winning combination would give you the \"best\" design. Offline, design also exists everywhere and is tested everywhere. Product design, for example, is based on a long history of different and sometimes radical thinking. The computer you use to its peripherals, all stem from many many iterations to evolve at its present state -- tested and measured in the sense of feedback and sales, so the \"best\" design remains and is sold on the market.
