            "answer_text": "10 Tips for Coping with Exam Stress Keep a sense of perspective. There will be life after exams, and there\u2019ll come a time when you never have to sit an exam again.  # Take regular breaks. Try to recognise when you're getting too stressed. It\u2019s a sign that you need to take a break, to do something else for a short time. You could also try out this Pomodoro Technique - Wikipedia #Don\u2019t let friends wind you up. Talking people who understand and share the stress your under can be helpful, but comparing revision notes and subject knowledge never is, and will leave you feeling like you haven't done enough. #Make a revision timetable. Timetable your revision with breaks at a frequency that works best for you. Work when you naturally feel more alert, whether that\u2019s in the morning or evening, at home, or in the library. # Eat well. Eat regular meals including breakfast to maintain your blood sugar and energy levels. # Give yourself a chance to get a good night\u2019s sleep. Stop working and give yourself time to unwind before going to bed, and don\u2019t take your revision notes with you when you do. #Use physical activity to give you a break from studying. Exercise is one of the best ways to de-stress. Whether it\u2019s a gym session, or a short walk through the park, you\u2019ll return from it better able to focus on the mental activity you\u2019re engaged in. If you have more than one exam in a day, take a short walk in between, but give your self-time to get something to eat and drink also #Treat yourself. Use treats to motivate yourself and build these into your revision timetable, for example allow yourself time to watch an episode of your favourite TV programme after a few hours hard work or plan something nice for when your exams are over #Try relaxation techniques. It will take a bit of practice, but relaxation or breathing techniques can really help to calm nerves #Don\u2019t take part in the exam 'post-mortem'. Comparing answers with friends after an exam, when it\u2019s too late to change anything you have written, serves no purpose and will only increase your worry. #Keep a sense of perspective. There will be life after exams, and there\u2019ll come a time when you never have to sit an exam again. ",

            "answer_text": "Great Day to You, Is this is the first time you are unable to focus on your studies or you will face this situation often. If it is the first time you are facing there might be some distraction which you are thinking more about it. if this is your regular problem then you need to know the value of education in our life. if you are really not interested in education then discuss with your parents and well wishers about your plans. but i can this is one of the biggest mistake now a days most of students doing in their life, by simply they are spending their time in college and when they are out in real life they are not getting the job because of they do not have enough skills and they are unable to perform small jobs or unable to focus on their goals because it is already late for them. so never try to under estimate the value of education and focus on your education. There are many ways to increase your focus on education like doing meditation, avoid using mobile, internet, watching TV before 30 mins of study. also associate with the people who are good at studies. because the environment in which we are will effect us to become what we are. All the best for your future. ",
