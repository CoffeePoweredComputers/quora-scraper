            "answer_text": "Dear M Anonymous, To write the capital A in cursive, you have many choices. The sheet below is something I created to show a young friend how to write cursive properly with the start and end points marked. (His school isn\u2019t teaching cursive in class!) However, when I write cursive, I often add some flair, so I don\u2019t always use the \u201ccorrect\u201d way of writing letters. There\u2019s also the Palmer method of writing cursive. Hope this helps! Also see the excellent answer by Caleb Rothschild.  Below is a page from my bullet journal showing a cursive alphabet I wrote.  - Also see Sarah Madden's answer to How can someone who never learned cursive read it? \u2014Sarah M., posted 10 April 2018 (updated 16 September 2019)  QUESTION: What is the correct form of writing a capital \u201ca\u201d in cursive? (asked 31 March 2017) ",

Now, while in many third-grade classrooms, the first \u2018A\u2019 may be considered technically correct, cursive is an incredibly expressive, individualistic art form that each person has. So, all of the above \u2018A\u2019s are correct\u2014unless it is a graded third-grade cursive assignment in which it most likely the first one. ",
