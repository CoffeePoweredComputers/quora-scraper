            "answer_text": "What do you mean by outstanding? And are you looking at a certain faculty? Certain faculties are harder to get into (eg medicine and law) but some are more welcoming. So unless you are targeting the top faculties, there's always hope that you can be accepted into NUS/NTU. But if you are a foreigner, then it would be more difficult as you are competing within a smaller pool of students. If you are a foreigner, one way that might increase your chance of entering NUS/NTU is to go through the pre-university education in Singapore. ",
