            "answer_text": "It is always okay, in any circumstance, however... \u201cPunish\u201d is very vague. There will be an appropriate punishment for any wrong-doing. The philosophy behind punishing anyone for a wrong-doing is that it will encourage them to act differently and appropriately the next time. It also sets an example for other potential children. Were you to let something go without punishment, what would that say to the child? Even if it werent a big deal, this still applies. What if it were insignificant, say the child accidentally spilled a drink? Should you punish a child for an accident? I'd say absolutely, I would tell the child to clean up the mess he made, assuming said child is capable enough of doing so. This is a reasonable punishment, and it teaches the child to be less careless. This will benefit him later in his knows. To address your quetion specifcally, \u201cwhat if the child didnt know it was wrong?\u201d, I'll create a hypothetical. Say the child overheard you using a curse and then said it in school, its meaning unbeknownst to him. An ideal punishment may be a sympathetic scold, followed by an explanation of why what he did was bad, in a way he could understand. I would then explain that, should he use said word again, he will be punished further, perhaps via a timeout or removing his acces to the tv or sonetjing similar. Tl;dr There is an appropraite punishment for every action that has a negative outcome, and punishments are important. Just dont overdo it. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by Punish..and what they did.If they hurt someone or intentionally broke something etc..then yes- there should be consequences to their actions\u2026every child KNOWS not to hurt someone or break things. For other things- they need to have a LONG (boring, tear-jerking, when-will-this-be -over) lecture on WHY what they did is wrong, WHY you are disappointed in them for doing it, and WHY they WILL be punished if they do it again. The punishment depends on the age \u2026 usually a 15\u201320 minute time out in a chair facing the wall without getting up, or talking to anyone is sufficient\u2026after the lecture.For some kids, and if what they did was REALLY bad\u2026 take away their favorite toy, electronics etc\u2026 for a couple days after the lecture and time out. But EXPLAINING why it is wrong and why they will be punished is a must.The whole \u201cbecause I said so\u201d teaches them nothing\u2026Spankings teach them that it is OK to hit people you are mad at. Good Luck! <3 ",
