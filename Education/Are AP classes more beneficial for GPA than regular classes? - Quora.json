            "answer_text": "It depends on your school. If your school uses a weighted GPA, then Advanced Placement courses can increase your GPA above 4.0. If your school only does unweighted GPA (like mine), the \u201dstandard\u201d and AP course will affect your GPA identically. To confirm, you should consult your school\u2019s student handbook or a similar resource. But do keep in mind that college applications often ask for both your weighted or unweighted GPA. Most importantly, GPA isn't everything. Colleges look at every aspect of your high school experience\u2014GPA, course selection, standardized test scores, extracurriculars, and so on. Law of diminishing returns applies, so if you try to only take easy courses in order to maintain a 4.0 unweighted GPA, admissions will see right through you. With this in mind, it's generally better to take an AP course and get a B than to take its \u201dstandard\u201d equivalent and get a A+. Aim to learn first, and then work the numbers so that they reflect your success. It's that intersection of intrinsic motivation (actual learning) and extrinsic indicators (your GPA) that will better your high school experience. ",

            "answer_text": "At most US high schools, AP classes, like IB, honors, and college classes, are weighted. The formula depends on the school, but often AP classes are computed on a 5.0 scale rather than 4.0. In essence, if you receive a B in an AP class it\u2019s the same as getting an A in a regular on-level class. Now, how do colleges weight them? Ones with selective admission want to see you took the most rigorous courses available to you at your school. Your guidance counselor will explain that on the school report; at some US high schools, no AP classes are offered. ",

            "answer_text": "AP classes are more beneficial because they are weighted. This means if you get a B, you can still get a 4.0 because that equals an A in a regular class. If you get an A, it makes you GPA higher than 4.0, which in this day and age is pretty much the bare minimum if you want to attend a prestigious university. ",

            "answer_text": "Weighted GPA? Yes. They are taken out of a 5.0 scale, versus the regular class out of 4.0, and the honors out of 4.5 This means that if you get a B, it will have the same GPA impact as an A in a standard course. A C equates to a regular B. Non-weighted GPA? No, it\u2019s all out of 4.0 regardless of difficulty status. Additionally, you have the opportunity to gain college credit from the class if you pass an exam. When applying to colleges, having challenging courses like AP and honors provides more than just a GPA boost - they like to see you taking harder courses to show your dedication and worth ethic. ",
