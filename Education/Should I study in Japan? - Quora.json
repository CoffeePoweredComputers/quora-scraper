            "answer_text": "I grew up in Japan and now I attend university in the U.S. Currently, I am back in Japan for winter break and I had an opportunity to catch up with a friend who attends Keio, one of the top universities in Japan. Here is how the conversation with him went\u2014translated into English. Me: Hey, how have you been? How\u2019s your school life? Friend: Great! You know, I realized in high school that studying isn\u2019t everything in life. There\u2019s a lot more to do. I\u2019m quite active in this one student organization. Me: Yep that\u2019s true. So then what\u2019s your typical weekday like? Friend: Okay so I wake up around noon. Then I wonder whether I should go to class and usually I don\u2019t go. So then I would have free time until I start my part-time job in the afternoon. At six, I would go attend club meeting and around nine I would go to karaoke. Then I sleep and repeat this. Me: Wait don\u2019t you have tests in classes? And how many hours of class do you have? Friend: Yeah I have tests in classes. Like this semester I took a French class. I memorized five words a minute before the test and got A+. For my statistics class, the tests are multiple choice and open book. So a question would show us a bell curve and ask us to identify the mean and the mode from five choices. It\u2019s pretty easy. I have eight hours of class per week. Me: (laughing pretty hard) This is from a student in law department at one of the top universities in Japan. Although I\u2019ve heard that people in engineering school are busier with their studies, in general, the primary purpose of attending university is not academics. Their time in middle schools and high schools were spent to get into the best universities and universities are supposed to provide the leisure they did not have for years. While I highly recommend people to study abroad in Japan, you should know that the academics will probably constitute a very small fraction of your experience there. It will be closer to cultural immersion. If you want to spend more time understanding the Japanese culture, this is an amazing opportunity! All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve lived in Japan for a year and China for a year, too. I loved both experiences immensely, but there are certain things you have to come to terms with if you\u2019re going to live there with your sanity intact. I\u2019m fully white so I can\u2019t say for sure, but from what I\u2019ve seen in other\u2019s lives with your background, you\u2019ll likely get a lot of stares because they\u2019re trying to figure out if you\u2019re Japanese or European. With me, it was pure novelty factor that got people staring, but your background makes you even more fascinating and rare. I have to confess, when I was living in Japan, I also caught myself staring at people like yourself, but I was thinking \u201cI wonder what their story is? What\u2019s is it like to live in Japan as a \u2018half and half\u2019? What an interesting life that must be\u201d etc etc. No joke. Silly, but genuine fascination. You will feel like a zoo animal at first, and it might even make you sad at being an outsider and even angry at times like it did with me (on multiple occasions had to stop myself from asking people what they were looking at). But the fact that you have a common ancestry is more of a connection than any full-foreigner will ever have in Japan, despite them having lived there for 20+ years. Seriously, just go online and look this up. Japan\u2019s homogeneous society is very exclusive, even if sub-consciously so. If I were you, I would embrace the opportunity to learn. You are in a very rare position to be able to get a real glimpse into both cultures, and you can use this for good. Don\u2019t be ashamed, in fact, use this as fuel to experience something hardly anybody gets to experience. Also, bear in mind that you will get over it pretty quickly once over there. For me, once I had a good network of friends and was familiar enough to go about living, I didn\u2019t care if people stared at me. In fact, when my parents came to visit me 4 months in and remarked on this, I had to admit I didn\u2019t even notice it anymore. Start a blog about your experiences if you do go, I\u2019m sure lots of people would love to read it! In short, don\u2019t waste this awesome opportunity you have. All the best. ",
