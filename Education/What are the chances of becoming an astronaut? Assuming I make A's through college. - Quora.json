            "answer_text": "You haven't mentioned what you're studying. There are specific fields of study that will increase your chances of becoming an astronaut even if you're not earning only As. Just look at this list of Former Astronauts with their brief educational background and work experience and you'll notice a certain trend. You'll notice degrees in mathematics, physics, aeronautical engineering, military degrees, medicine/surgery, electrical engineering etc. Quite a lot of them have a good experience in aviation being test pilots or other. So, look into that and specialize. Perseverance is extremely important in this endeavor. Clayton Anderson, who is active here on Quora, applied to NASA 16 times if I'm not mistaken until he finally made it. It literally took him 15 years to get what he wanted. His story is pretty inspirational. I think he even has a book about his ordeal. You can ask him questions directly here on Quora as well. I know he answers cause I asked him something silly in the past and he was gracious enough to answer :-) ",

My former co-worker\u2019s kid just did the amazing thing of make it through Caltech with an A average. Caltech just about trumps any other college. (She\u2014the kid\u2014would be able to answer this question.) That would be easy, but 2 colleges near equal ranking would be harder. The issue isn\u2019t grades alone. I believe that most ASCANs didn\u2019t have 4.0 GPAs. A few did (helps, but not essential). ",
