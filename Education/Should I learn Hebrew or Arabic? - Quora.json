            "answer_text": "Depends on why you want to learn another language. Both languages are very similar so I believe they are equally difficult for someone who does not speak both languages. Arabic is by far more useful as it has hundreds of millions, while Hebrew is spoken by less than 10 million people (including non native speakers). If you want to learn either language to get by as a tourist in Israel - everyone in Israel speaks good English. Most native Hebrew speakers speak English as a second language. Most Hebrew important literary works are translated into English and most Israeli important Academic essays and articles are published in English. The only reason I can think of to prefer Hebrew over Arabic is to get close to Judaism, or read the Bible in the original Hebrew. This is a good enough reason, for the translation of the Bible into English fails to express the full depth of the original. Both languages are beutiful, and open a gate to a world of magnificent cultural heritage and wonderful poetry and prose. I\u2019d begin by learning one, and immidiately go on to the other. ",

            "answer_text": "Hebrew is spoken in only one country \u201cIsrael\u201d and most Israelis speak Arabic anyway. On the other hand Arabic is spoken by several hundred million people (Egypt alone is about 100 million). Hebrew is so close to Arabic, but it is more practical to learn Arabic. Hebrew as a language died some time back when the jews were in diaspora. IT was reinvented leaning heavily on borrowings form the Arabic language both Vocabulary wise and grammar wise. Final verdict: learn Arabic not Hebrew ",
