            "answer_text": "Institute of Aeronautical Engineering (IARE) is better than Padmasri BV RAJU(BVRIT) in many perspectives. 1.IARE Academic College Fee is Less compare to BVRIT 2. IARE is also one of the top college in telangana 3. Both BVRIT & IARE are autonomus and have their educational standards with the top placements 4. Travelling distance can be reduced compare to BVRIT. One can save nearly 2 hours in travelling if he/she is an IAREAN 5. Only Drawback in the IARE is rules. There are many rules in the college Where one can\u2019t enjoy as much as in BVRIT College. In educational side IARE is good. One can blindly join in IARE without any confusion for good placements & Future. ",

            "answer_text": "The only draw back BVRIT has is its distance from the city, but the atmosphere they provide is best in business. BVRIT Narsapur is an orchard park campus with a peaceful atmosphere (without any dust or noise pollution) suitable for learning since it is far away from the city. Our chairmen Vishu sir strive for the future of the student (24/7). There are many differentiators for our college such as VEDIC(You can google it), Assistive technology lab, Microsoft Innovation Centre and the list goes on\u2026. I don\u2019t know much about IARE, but I can see that BVRIT in currently best in business compared to IARE. P.S: Don\u2019t judge Bvrit by its distance from the city. Just visit the campus and i can assure that you love the large 100 acre campus covered with greenery (Mainly Mango farms which you can steal and pay fine :p). ",
