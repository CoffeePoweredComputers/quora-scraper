            "answer_text": "No. Movies are movies. I teach in a private high school, but went to public high school years ago, so I\u2019ve been in high schools for decades. So here goes: For one thing, classrooms are almost always much smaller in movies than in real life. The walls and decorations, signs, etc. are stylized and depict only a small suggestion of what might be on a real high school classroom or hallway wall. The class work and teaching (for example, the novel they\u2019re discussing in English, or the science lab they\u2019re doing) in a movie are always simplified. Often students are doing work in a movie high school that you\u2019d more likely see in a real-life middle school. Characters are generally portrayed as either 100% positive (friend of the hero/heroine) or 100% negative (nasty, mean classmate or teacher). That\u2019s not even close to real. Individual characters are portrayed by prototype: the sexy cheerleader, the dumb athlete, the sadistic teacher, etc. Again, this serves the plot purpose, but in reality, people are much more complex than that. The characters also wear the newest, most fashionable clothes that come right out of Wardrobe. In real life, students wear a variety of things. Some are last-year\u2019s style. Some are torn or patched or dirty. And by the way, student backpacks are generally much fuller than what you see actors carrying around. Movies often show the football or basketball games, school plays or dances as the most important elements of school life. They may be for some kids, but a whole lot more goes on in a school day in and day out. Finally (although I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more), the actors in these movies are usually well over 18 years old. Hollywood is trying to tell a story. Accuracy about high school life is not true. If you\u2019re looking for real high school life, I would recommend researching some documentaries. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say the physical part, the buildings, the fields, stadium are pretty authentic. Most countries in Europe and South America are quite different, being in multi-story buildings with little open space. Most American campuses are sprawling over a few acres, usually built around a quad, and open space close to the cafeteria, with tables and benches and often some grass to toss a football on. The cafeterias are quite large, with plenty of tables and a standard school lunch as well as MacDonalds, Burger King etc. available in the cafeteria. There is frequently a salad bar. What is different are the students. There are not mean people going around harrassing other people or starting arguments. Usually the kids are like any kids, wanting to learn, wanting to have fun and wanting to socialize. There are cliques but most of them are together because they like each other. Of course, these are young people with hormones roaring, so there will be some fights, but most high school kids are quite mature and this is not shown on TV. There are many service clubs that raise money for charities or who help out with special education classes. There also abundant interest clubs for kids who like computers or who collect minerals, like ham raidio, etc. etc. There are pep clubs and football, basketball, volleyball games to cheer for. I quite like high school students. ",
