            "answer_text": "The 'best' routine will depend on the comfort zones of a person. If you are a flexible person and can adjust with people around, then you should start early, before which take a five minutes concentration(meditation) time in open air (helps you to freshen up your mind, all you have to do is find a place to sit outside your room, maybe garden or terrace or even in front of your room window and breathe in the fresh air keeping your eyes closed) and start off. Decide upon the subject and topics to learn in advance. Take 5 mins break after every hour and eat healthy. In case you are a night owl, make sure you sleep sufficiently and do not strain your eyes. Preparing time tables have always been unsuccessful for me. The lesson that I learnt is that you should not overburden yourself while deciding the schedule. Keep it brief and once you are in a flow, you will be able to follow. Good luck :) ",
