            "answer_text": "Have you looked at universities in UK?UK is outside the EU an has many good universities for computer science. I looked at Coursefinder.telegraph.co.uk and filtered by computer science course.  There were many options which I am sure accept average students. Assuming you would need a work visa to work after graduation , you want to think about how immigrant friendly is the work visa policy in UK. Many of my friends fromIndia had to come back home because the work visa policy was not favourable. Please think about that before going ahead with the big step. And finally have you looked at US universities ? There are unlimited opportunities to choose from here. I mStudying at University of Florida and it has a very good computer science programme.
