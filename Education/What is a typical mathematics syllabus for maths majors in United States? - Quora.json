            "answer_text": "Well, generally it would follow something along the lines of Calc 1Calc 2Calc 3Some course designed to instruct techniques for writing proofs, some graph theory, modular arithmetic, etc. Linear AlgebraSome pure mathAbstract AlgebraAnalysisDifferential Geometry/TopologyMaybe some applied math (some schools have a separate major or track for this)Differential EquationsProb/statsthis could very well be it's own majorSome math electivesprobably a programming class or twoThe way it works at SLU (Saint Louis University) is as follows: Calc 1Calc 2Calc 3Principles of math (a slightly more involved discrete math class)Introduction to Linear Algebra (this one is calc 3 based and proof based)Introduction to Abstract AlgebraIntroduction to Analysis (AKA Real Analysis)From here, you have to fulfill a sequence requirement. You can either finish both the algebra and analysis sequence, or, finish one of them (you have to do a pure math sequence) and then do a sequence in another area of math such as DE, Complex Variables, or Prob/stats.  Another req is 3 hours in a Prob/Stats class Then 9-12 hours of electives an Allied elective (a math based course in something like Chem, Physics, Earth and Atmospheric sciences, CS, etc.) A programming class  I think that's it. It comes out to be about 14 classes if my memory serves me correct (go to the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science for further clarification) Personally, My schedule looks as follows (Just to clarify, some of these courses I don't need to graduate or to complete my math degree, I just REALLY want to take them and think it would be good to have taken them):  Freshman yearFirst SemesterCalc 1Second SemesterCalc 2Discrete Math (I am a CS minor as well and this is a req)Sophomore yearFirst SemesterCalc 3Principles of MathFoundations of Stats (a calc 2 based prob/stats course that uses R to model data I think, it's a new course)Second SemesterIntroduction to Linear AlgebraDifferential EquationsProbability Theory Junior year First Semester Introduction to AnalysisIntroduction to Abstract AlgebraPartial Differential EquationsSecond SemesterMetric SpacesLinear AlgebraNonlinear Dynamics and ChaosSenior YearFirst SemesterFinancial MathematicsSome upper division prob/stats coursemaybe another upper division prob/stats course(maybe a course in Complex Variables)Second Semester(Maybe Numerical Analysis, Graph Theory would be nice too)Some Upper Division prob/stats coursemaybe another upper division prob/stats course(maybe the second course in Complex Variables)I am still trying to figure out my senior year and where I could maybe squeeze in a Numerical Analysis class and maybe some more of those upper division prob/stats courses. I'm not sure I want to get a master's degree (since that will require taking out loans... self explanatory there) so I want to get a super vast mathematical exposure in undergrad. The one thing I HATE about SLU is the super extensive core reqs needed to graduate. I have to graduate in 4 years which is tricky given how many math classes I want to take. My Freshman through Junior year is pretty much set in stone but my senior year (other than financial math) is up for debate. While my schedule is certainly way more than the required amount, it gives an accurate idea of what's available to take as a math major and generally how a math major works at SLU, which, is generally how it works in the US.  Hope this helps! ",
