If you study in any such partner University then it all becomes super easy to study in Japan and specifically at Todai! Some other good universities in the Tokyo area can be Waseda University, Sophia University, Keio University. Also look up Nagoya University or Osaka university and Kyoto University if those interest you! Happy studying abroad! :) ",
