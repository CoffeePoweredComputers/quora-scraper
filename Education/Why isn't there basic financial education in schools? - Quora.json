            "answer_text": "It\u2019s mainly because of two important realities:\u2014 The pure and applied academic subjects such as mathematics, language, geography, etc, have long been proven to have real value and meaningfulness as a hedge in working life later on. Yet many schoolchildren still don\u2019t pay enough attention to those subjects because they don\u2019t or cannot see their relevance \u2014 precisely because there just aren\u2019t many practical opportunities for the relevance to come through when you\u2019re still in school.Financial education is largely applied knowledge based on varying levels of the academic subjects. Its relevance and meaningfulness often manifests in practical settings such as in work. In any case, \u201cfinancial education\u201d is an amorphous term \u2014 because financial education itself has so many flavours and variables in them when compared to the cleaner, neater structure of the academic subjects.In short, the kids are already ignoring important subjects like mathematics, language, geography, etc \u2014 so what makes anyone think \u2018financial education\u2019 won\u2019t end up in the same boat? Let me give you a sense of things:\u2014 In Accounting or Bookkeeping classes (if your high school has them), you will see a lot of students struggling to get the correct journal entries and do trial balances. But once you\u2019ve started working for just a few months, it becomes quite easy to know which entry goes to where in the credit or debit columns. The meaningfulness comes from the practical setting through use.When I took bookkeeping in school, it took me flippin\u2019 days to do a trial balance. Once I started working, it can literally take me MINUTES to do one up.Imagine holding a class about bonds and treasuries. These can be important components in a personal money portfolio. They make for jack to the high-school student, who has no practical inlet or outlet about the contexts of those financial instruments.I knew a little about stocks and bonds even when young. I learnt something from my parents and old relatives because they had investments. If I didn\u2019t have my kind of parents or relatives, it\u2019s not going to make sense to me from schoolwork.Imagine holding a class about how to do a tax return and tax liabilities. Again, it\u2019s largely a waste of resources at the school level. It takes just a day or two to learn how to do the world\u2019s Top Three most complex tax returns \u2014 Turkey, Brazil and Italy. When you\u2019re in working life, you are invested in knowing how this stuff works.Education and schooling are a story about hedging for the future \u2014 and the future is scary because a lot of the knowledge required in \u201cfinancial education\u201d rides on knowing the \u2018basic\u2019 stuff of the academic school subjects. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a great rush in our public schools to teach anything but what used to be taught, that is, academic content. Why the rush? The kids are hardly learning anything. But you want to make sure it's closer to zero? Here's how the deal works. Local school systems start talking excitedly about some wonderful new thing that they could teach\u2014 money, health, global problems, global warming, sex ed, cooperation, health literacy, the list just goes on and on and on. So the kids don't learn traditional content. Meanwhile they're expected to be interested in learning hours and hours about finances, bank accounts, mortgages\u2026? Are you kidding? Most adults do not want to know more than one hour on finance. You know, if kids learn history, they at least hear fascinating stories about the VIPs of history. Where is the fascination in the prime rate? Another gruesomely funny aspect is that thanks to Common Core Math, kids can barely do any arithmetic but you want them to know the math in high finance or banking? I don't think so! Without math and numbers, a class on financial matters is going to feeel pretty empty. Here's what I'm recommending. Everybody should be more cynical about our hugely inefficient Education Establishment. These people will trick you. So when they propose something, second-guess it. Put yourself in the position of the kids who will have to learn all this boring stuff that you propose. Remember that traditional education was conceived as a pyramid affair. You start with a broad base of foundational knowledge, that is, basic stuff everyone should know. Then you build another layer and then another layer. Now the kid is semi-educated and ready for more advanced information, not before. Take away the basic information and you participate in the dumbing-down of that student.  ",
