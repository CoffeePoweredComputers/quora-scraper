            "answer_text": "It\u2019s quite likely that the official calendar for 2022 has not yet been set. My district and union just recently posted the calendar for the 20\u201321 school year. You can get an idea of the date by looking at this year\u2019s date. For example, our graduation ALWAYS takes place on a Thursday night. Except in 2008, but that\u2019s a whole nuther story. This Thursday is the first or second Thursday in June. Find out how your school has handled graduation in the past, and you\u2019ll have an idea of your exact date in 2022. In my district, June 2 and June 9 are the first two Thursdays. Based on past school years, June 2 is too early, so it\u2019s almost certainly on June 9. ",

I graduate June 10th, 2022. I\u2019m so ready to graduate all ready. High school has been a real struggle for me really, it has been hard with my eating disorder. So i will be returning back to school on Friday. I only have two years until i graduate highschool, i want these two years that are left to be the greatest two years of my life. Which i know isn\u2019t going to happen but anyways there you go. Hoping for the best, ~Kamaria\u2764 ",
