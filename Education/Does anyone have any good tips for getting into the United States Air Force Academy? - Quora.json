            "answer_text": "In theory, successful applications to the military academies come from people who have diversified activities and excelled throughout their early lives.  \"Lots of fingers in lots of pies\" is how one liaison officer (Academy speak for recruiter) described desirable applicants.  Using my own path as an example: Varsity Swimmer 4 years and team captain all 4 years, volunteer at a local stage theater for lighting/fundraising, worked part-time jobs throughout high school, had a 4.0GPA with about 40 college credits before Junior year, scholarship award from John Hopkins, raced mountain bikes and made it to one national level final.  A large number of cadets (close to 80% or so) were Varsity athletes in high school, many were team captains.  Well over half were Eagle Scouts and the number of Order of the Arrow initiates was quite high as well. Having a diverse resume is enough to get you through the pre-application.  The actual application will require well written essays, proof that you really did do all those great things you claimed to do, and a few letters of recommendations from teachers, coaches, etc.  Poorly written letters of recommendation can sink an applicant. You will also need a nomination from a senator, congressman, or one of the other government officials that each have a limited (5 per year) number of nominations they can hand out each year.  Each state has a slightly different process for application.  In California, where there are a ton of qualified and interested applicants, the request for nomination packet was like 20 pages long.  In Oregon, the package was about three pages long since there were a lower number of qualified and interested applicants.  Should you get through the initial round of state application, you will likely have to go to a face to face interview with a senator/congressman or their designated representatives.  In Oregon they performed a joint panel that included staffers and I think a few senator's wives.  They asked tough questions such as, \"If you are a fighter pilot with orders to drop bombs on a target that you see is a school with children playing in front, what do you do and why do you do it?\"  You will be judged on the content of your answer as well as its presentation.  Also, wear a suit to this meeting.  One of the guys that was waiting to interview just before me was wearing sweats.  Lets just say he was not one of my classmates. If you get the nomination, pass the pre-application and  send in a solid full application, you then get to pass a security screening/background check as well as a medical physical.  And you have to pass a pre-cadet fitness test with pullups, pushups, situps, and shuttle runs (though the fitness test changes all the time in both content and number of reps required).  One last thing to consider: Every cadet at USAFA is technically on an academic scholarship, including those that are recruited for athletics.  The teams (especially football)  have staff members at the academy who are tasked with justifying the inclusion of less than stellar academic performers that are exceptional athletes.  These same staffers also assist with the application process as well as \"finding\" nominations for the recruits.  I'm not saying that there aren't brilliant academics that are also fantastic on the D-line playing for the Falcons, just that the recruited athletes have an extra advantage in application. If you really want to go to the academy, you need to be on the path early.   Sophomore year is when I started researching the application process to ensure I would be ready to submit paperwork by the cutoff dates. Finally, you have to show up to in processing, take the oath, climb on the bus, and get ready to make it through basic training. Some approximate numbers to consider for my class:12,000 qualified applications to USAFA1500 accepted1250 show up to in-process at the start of basic training929 graduated 4 years later (the last one to get the boot only had one day until graduation) Good luck!

            "answer_text": "Congratulations, you appear to be on track to be a great candidate. Academics and physical fitness are certainly very important pre-requisites for success at any service academy. I hope that you will continue having success in these areas. The private pilot license is great but may not carry a lot of weight at selection time. But please continue, I am a private pilot and have spent many enjoyable hours aloft. You need to be sixteen in order to test for a private pilot certificate. How about joining the Civil Air Patrol they accept youth from 12\u201318 years of age. I would urge you to become involved. Involved in your school, your church, your community. If your school has student government, run for an office. What are your hobbies, can you join a group and actively participate? How about Scouting? I can tell you that being involved with the Boy Scouts and if you can do it, becoming an Eagle Scout carries a lot of weight. If you belong to a church, become more active. Assume youth leadership roles. Many community governments provide opportunities for teenagers to participate at many levels. One word of caution, please don\u2019t join organizations or assume leadership roles just because they may look good on an application. One or two examples of you being \u2018all-in\u2019 in an organization are much more impressive than a long list of things you tried but didn\u2019t pursue or fully engage in. Service academies are looking for young men and women who are good citizens of high ethical and moral character. The type of person who will step up and volunteer their time and their skills, themselves, without being asked again. They are training future leaders. Good luck in your high school years. Keep your eye on the prize and I'm sure you will do very well. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several things that can help you get into the Academy.  Probably most obviously is that you have to have some pretty spectacular grades.  Keep in mind that you're competing against thousands of other hopefuls who want to gain entry to a school that provides a free (sort of), top-notch education.  If you've got those grades--and even if you don't--there are ways to look good to the review board:1-Don't be a white male.  If you're anything other than a white guy, you've got that diversity factor that is always being looked for.2-Use your connections.  Know any alumni?  You'll need a congressional recommendation to get in, and a friendly letter from a grad couldn't hurt.  3-Be well-rounded.  Academics is just one part of everyday Academy life.  If you're involved in clubs, groups, sports--that type of thing--in school, it'll make you look even better.   Last, it's not just about getting there, but staying there.  We kicked cadets out every day for failing classes, fighting, lying, cheating, drug use, and for just not being able to acclimate to the cadet life.  Keep in mind that if you get past your sophomore year, and get kicked out because you lied to your commander...well, that's one hell of an education that you'll be paying the government back for.  Good luck! ",

Earn a varsity letter or two.Participate in a leadership activity in or outside of school - Student council, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, Junior ROTC. Earn a significant award/rank (Eagle Scout for Boy Scouts, Gold Award for Girl Scouts, Spaatz Award for Civil Air Patrol, etc.). The Academy trains the future leaders of the Air Force - you need to show your leadership potential.Get your Private Pilot\u2019s license - keep up your motivation.Understand that no matter how well you prepare, your academy experience will be one of the most formative and challenging of your life. Everyone finds at least one area of performance that is almost impossible to achieve (and yet they do). A key concept is one that the academy develops the whole person, all aspects, and the standards are high in every category.Have a backup plan - many apply, few are chosen.

If you are on one or both, run for president.Get involved in extracurricular activities and/or volunteer work. If you can, take a leadership role in them, or be able to show that you recruited others to help.Unless one of your parents was awarded the Medal of Honor, you need to be recommended by your congressman or senator. Consider writing them now to introduce yourself and ask what they are looking for in a candidate, then, once a year or so, write them again to tell them how you are progressing.

I was on track to get appointed to the Academy by then-Senator Richard Luger, only to be told after my eye exam that my eyesight was \u201cso bad I did not qualify to apply\u201d because of it. On the positive side - the Air Force eye exam was the first time my astigmatism was diagnosed\u2026. ",
