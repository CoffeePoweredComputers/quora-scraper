            "answer_text": "Pure economics or economic theory is a study of micro economics where the subject matter of study is the individual. Economics of development or studies in development economics relate to macro economics where aggregates are studied. In micro economics theories such as marginal utility, demand, cost of production and distribution of income through land, labour, capital and enterprise are made. Theories relating to rent of land, wages of labour, interest on capital and profit of enterpreneur are studied here. However in macro economics studies growth aspects like national income, money supply, inflation and its control, budget making, taxes and public expenditure programmes are highlighted. Both micro and macro economics are complementary in nature. Micro economic theories are applied to solve macro economic problems. ",
