            "answer_text": "My sister is a teenager (she is 16), I live with her in the same house and we have many chats every single day about her school, homework and problems with study. So my answer will be relevant here. Duolingo - it's a free app for learning new languages (at this time there're more than 50 different languages available for learning)SoloLearn - this app is essential for you, if you decided to learn how to code (you could learn with this app C++, Java, Python 3, Java Script, PHP, C#, HTML, CSS, SQL and some other programming languages and concepts)Unplag - it's a browser-based application that checks your texts in various formats (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .html, .txt and some others) for potential similarities, checks your citations and references and allows you to correct them according to the rules of academic writing. Great alternative to Turnitin! Besides, it has a free version (of course, with a limited functionality)Memrise - with this app you could learn almost everything (new languages, math, literature, history, geography, programming languages and computer literacy. What I love the most about this app is that learning with Memrise isn't boring - it's fun and interactive! Besides, it has a global community of millions of users, with whom you could interact and enhance your learning process!Pomodoro Timer - this is a productivity app with the unlimited potential of use. My sister uses it when does some research for school assignments and I use it while I'm writing blog posts and articles for my clients. It helps to manage time which you spend on different tasks and reminds you when you should do a break. 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break - it's my perfect formula of high productivity. Besides, it helps me to focus on a smaller pieces of a bigger tasks.WordBook - it's an excellent English dictionary and thesaurus. It has a lot things other thesauruses have, but it's professionally recorded pronunciation of every single word really makes it to stand out. There's also a spellchecker, a feature that connects word semantically, bookmarking and history management as well. Awesome app for students, young bloggers and writers!",
