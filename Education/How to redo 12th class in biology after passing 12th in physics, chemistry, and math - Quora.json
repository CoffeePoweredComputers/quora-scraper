            "answer_text": "This possibility is a bit tough. If you change your board i.e from Central Board to State Board or ICSE or the other way round it might be possible. I am not sure but you will need to work out the rules and carefully move ahead. You have to show a reason for not continuing your studies after class 10 if now you want to do BIO because you cannot show that you have crossed 11th and 12th. So you will need to start from 11th and 12th both which means losing two years. You will need to seek permission from the academic controlling authorities and you will need to make proper applications. Thanks for A2A but I am still not sure if I have helped you. There must be some other way as well where you may do directly 12th then do ask your teachers and principles if you are comfortable enough with them or go to some teacher/principle of some other school in some other city by taking appointment if you dont want people near you to know about this.
