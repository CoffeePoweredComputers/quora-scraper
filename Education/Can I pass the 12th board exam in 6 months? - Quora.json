            "answer_text": "Yes you can. Definitely. Although I am assuming you have two eyes (or at least one), two hands, two legs and most importantly a working brain. But if you should pass or not only you can decide. It all depends on your efforts which you put in in these final months. I suggest you start early now and remove all other distractions from your life like facebook, whatsapp, instagram, tv, cricket or football (or any other), any outdoor activities, etc. This way you will create more time for your study and will make the effort easier a bit. Study regularly and don\u2019t procrastinate. Remember: It\u2019s now or never. You decide. Hope I helped. ",

You are the one who knows how much faster can you mug things up or understand the concepts. You are the one who needs to learn things so you know how much time you need. You need to decide how much time you will need to study and by studying I mean with full concentration and minimum distraction.
