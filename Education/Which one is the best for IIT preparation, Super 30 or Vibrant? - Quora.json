            "answer_text": "Undoubtedly VIBRANT ACADEMY is the best. See the last year result of Vibrant Academy (JEE MAIN Selection percentage 61.55% & Advanced percentage is 52.19). Vibrant has emerged as a strong contender among the top coaching institutes. With a 50% record selection percentage every year from regular classroom courses in the JEE Main & Advanced, the institute has set a benchmark for itself and its competitors. The complete system of coaching is based on real requirements of a student to crack IIT-JEE. Vibrant is better than All Institutes in Kota. Actually all are giving very good results in JEE but Resonance and Allen are too much crowded. That\u2019s why Numbers of students selected from both. Vibrant has a decent crowd with good teachers Also vibrant only focus only JEE and not on medical exams. So please don\u2019t decide from the advertisements. Vibrant is giving a consistent performance and there HODs are the best. Mr. Narendra Awasthi, Nitin Jain.,Neel Kamal Sethia,MS Chouhan, Pankaj Joshi and Vikas Gupta and others are the best teachers for JEE. So, choose according to your goal. Facts are in front of you. The questions are tough because they want you to clear JEE Advanced. Once you are done with the sheets; you are provided with question bank. The question bank is to boost confidence. Solve the sheets, they are very important. In fact, don\u2019t solve anything except the sheets. At the end of the day if you practice a healthy amount of problems from every topic you will be fine irrespective of your coaching. Vibrant focuses more on quality than quantity. The faculties are simply awesome The study materials and problems which are provided by vibrant are really good and if you solve all of them you will easily clear jee adv. with a good rank. As far as the total number of selections goes, don\u2019t trust the statistics provided by the coaching institutes because too much data is manipulated to show large numbers.   I can surely prefer you to study at Vibrant Academy if you want to become an IITian ",
