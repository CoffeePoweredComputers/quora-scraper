If you are doing well in your core classes and have demonstrated a strong work ethic in the rest of your courses, I would have a conversation with your teacher or administrators to see how you can improve your grade in your elective. The situation at your school may be different, but at mine if you put in effort and are respectful, in electives teachers will work with you. No one wants you to fail. I do not know if you will pass eighth grade if you fail your elective, but I encourage you to try your best to bring your grade up if it is not too late. ",
