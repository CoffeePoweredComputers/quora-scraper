            "answer_text": "No, essentially when you have finished school you pretty much have two educational options; 6th  form or college. Now 6th  form is located as part of the high school. You wear your own kind of uniform given to you, when I was in school back in 2010 when this changed beforehand you could wear whatever clothes you wanted.   You had the course(s) you applied for and you where allowed to leave when the class had finished, it was pretty much like a small college in a school. Many people stay in 6th form because they can be in classes with people they've known for the past 5 years rather than meet strangers.    I however went to college, my school was not a very good reputable one in  both social and academics. But I knew several who did go to 6th form. It is like a college, and is treated as such except you are surrounded by classmates you know, teachers you know  and the entire high school, plus uniform requirements. We  don't have uniform enquirements in college. I'd also like to point out that college  is different from US colleges. Here you  leave school at 16, then  if you go to 6th form or college do on average about 2 years, like a school you turn up for your lessons and then leave at the end of the lesson and go home. You could be in college for more years depending on factors such as the course, and whether you decide to join at an older age or if you change courses at some point.  Then if you wish you go to university, where you get a student loan and have the option of living there until the end of your course, those take on average about 3 years. ",

            "answer_text": "UK and EU students in the UK attend sixth form (sixth form college or Years 12 and 13 in a school with a sixth form) free of charge, normally for two or three years after GCSEs. This is true up to the end of the academic year in which they have their 19th birthday. If they turn 19 before the beginning of September, then they are not funded, and can be charged tuition fees, although in practice this will be covered by a loan, just as with university tuition fees. Students from outside the UK and on a Tier 4 visa are not entitled to free tuition at this level, and are supposed to be charged tuition fees. They are entitled to attend only schools and colleges that are allowed to sponsor them as Tier 4 students. In practice, students who are not UK or EU citizens and not on a Tier 4 do sometimes slip through the system, and are taught without being charged tuition fees, where a school is not aware of the rules, but this is unusual and not officially sanctioned.

            "answer_text": "As of a few years ago, Sixth Form at a state institution (either a college or a Sixth Form attached to a secondary school) was free if you were under 21 at the time of starting your course. Mature students - 21 and over - had to pay. Prices varied depending on the establishment and the course syllabus, but the fees (including tuition and exams) were typically around \u00a3200 per subject. However, there were certain grants that you could apply for if you were on a low income which could lower tuition fees by up to 80%. Some towns also offered travel allowance or free bus passes for students on low incomes. I don't believe any of this has changed, although I'm not 100% sure - it's possible that the Tory government have increased fees and done away with grants, as they have at universities. Sixth Forms attached to private schools can charge tuition fees to all students, same as they do with Primary and Secondary students, so keep that in mind when you're looking at places. ",

My daughter\u2019s studying at a Sixth Form College about 15 miles away. She travels by bus every day - that costs \u00a3650 for each year. The other cost is a charge for \u2018additional materials\u2019 for each course - about \u00a310\u201315 per subject per year. Students also pay for their own text books. Obviously, all study trips and university open days are extra. ",
