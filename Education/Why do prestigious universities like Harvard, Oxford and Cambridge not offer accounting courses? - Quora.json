            "answer_text": "For a long time, the ruling class in England were the landed gentry - people whose wealth came from owning a lot of land. In order to justify their power, they argued that people who inherited wealth were not greedy, and that landowners learned to think about what was good for everyone on the land. Anyone who had to earn money was seen as unsuitable for a position of leadership. However, the land that is the source of the family\u2019s wealth is passed on to the oldest son. The daughters should marry someone else with wealth, and the younger sons might have to find a respectable profession - the church, medicine, law or serving in the armed forces. Of course, the gentry did sometimes need people who were smart to do difficult jobs for them. A few members of the lower classes could rise in social status by establishing their intelligence, usually with someone from the landed gentry acting as a patron. So, Oxford and Cambridge taught subjects like classics, mathematics and natural science because these were seen as suitable pursuits for a gentleman. Being good at Latin and Greek or Maths would help you earn a living, it would demonstrate that you were extremely intelligent, and had spent your time learning something whose only value was that it demonstrated your intelligence. Studying law could help you earn a living, but a respectable living. Of course, originally, the reason for learning Latin was that it was the international language of scholarship, but from the 18th Century and onward, knowing Latin was a status symbol because you had invested time in something with no practical value. Obviously, some people would get jobs teaching Latin, but most people would learn it not to teach it, but because knowledge of Latin was a demonstration of social status. So, for a long time, people studying at Oxbridge were either members of the gentry, or people whose careers would require them to impress members of the gentry, and demonstrate allegiance to the class system. This helps to explain why certain disciplines were seen as non-academic. Anything that was related to a job was inferior, unless that job were something deemed to be a suitable career for a gentleman - law, the church or, at Cambridge, land management. ",

            "answer_text": "As other answers have suggested, these universities don\u2019t teach applied subjects; they teach academic subjects. This is how they\u2019ve always been, and (I hope) how they always will be. Their purpose is not to prepare people for jobs, but to give them a solid academic background that will enable them to contribute to academia and to society at large. Degrees from these universities are well regarded because they teach students how to think and work effectively. Mathematics and economics are academic disciplines. Accounting is an application of these disciplines to the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about companies. The forms and conventions of accounting can all be learned by someone with the right academic background. Note: this answer is not intended to say that accounting isn\u2019t a perfectly good subject to study. If accounting is what you want to do, an accounting degree is the fastest way to get there. I\u2019m just trying to explain the way these universities think, and their attitude to applied subjects. Thanks for the A2A. ",
