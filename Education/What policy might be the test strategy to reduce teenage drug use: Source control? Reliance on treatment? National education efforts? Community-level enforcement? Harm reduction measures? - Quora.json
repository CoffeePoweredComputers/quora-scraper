            "answer_text": "First let\u2019s review the problem. Most people who use drugs - around 90% - do not end up with a drug use problem. This suggests that a promising area to consider is the idea of \u201cresilience\u201d. Resilience is a teachable set of skills and qualities. Being able to get over setbacks and disappointments, resist peer pressure, form realistic plans and work towards them in steps, tolerate frustration and keep going in the face of adversity are examples of resilience. As well as being protective factors against addiction, these are valuable life skills which are beneficial anyway. Instead of \u201cdrug ed\u201d which tends to merely advertise drugs, perhaps more attention could be paid to developing young peoples\u2019 resilience in educational settings. Of the other 10%, the ones who do develop a substance use disorder, three quarters will get better by themselves, with no intervention whatsoever. That is not to say their drug use will not harm them in the meantime: there are many harms, including health issues and legal consequences which may continue long after the substance use disorder has been dealt with. So harm reduction is part of my answer. It is a legitimate goal to seek to ensure that people damage themselves and society as little as possible through drug use. Opioid substitution therapy is effective, cost effective and people volunteer for this kind of treatment more than they do for other treatment modalities. I mean far more than doling out medication (although that\u2019s important) - OST can be an opportunity to engage individuals more widely, build skills and confidence and foster re-engagement with mainstream society. What is important, given the overall figures I mention above, is figuring out what is different about the treatment seeking population, compared with those who either didn\u2019t have a problem or didn\u2019t need treatment to get on top of it. Around 70% of the treatment seeking population have co-occuring mental health disorders, with depression and anxiety being the most common. Traditional addiction treatment does not deal well with dual diagnosis patients. We need to get better at this if we are to give people a reasonable prospect of success. Personalised treatment plans tailored to individual needs are necessary. Finally, the US lags behind the rest of the world in having a treatment industry that is largely centred on the 12 Step new religious movement, despite the fact it is not backed by evidence of efficacy. The rest of the world has moved on and most countries offer a far wider range of treatment modalities, many backed by solid evidence of efficacy. An overhaul is needed. ",

            "answer_text": "Complete legalization, regulation, and education. Stop treating drugs as taboos. All drugs are used to help people, even meth and heroin. (Meth = Adderral, Heroin = Morphine), it's time to stop acting like recreational use is forbidden, and start explaining to people the full list of pros and cons and let them decide. Teenage use is honestly the same as adult use, because if a teenager WANTS to use drugs, they will, and there is nothing anybody can do to stop them. It's the unfortunate truth, I've seen friends degrade because of harder drugs than anything I handled, begging them just makes them feel bad, that's the opposite of what you want while someone's sober from drugs. You have to replace the good feeling of drugs with something else. ",
