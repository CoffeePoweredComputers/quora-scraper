Firstly focus over your Maths (300 marks) , if you want to qualify maths section then you need to answer minimum 36 - 37 questions correctly (just to clear the cut off). Secondly for the GAT (600 marks) you need to mainly focus on General Studies [ i.e. history (modern history) , polity (questions relating to articles), geography (thoroughly take a look at atlas), economy (five years plans) and yes don't forget to check out the current affairs ] And for General Science and English exams you don't have to take much stress. Usually candidates are not able to clear the exam just because they might have failed to clear the Maths or General Studies cut off. So, you have to focus a bit more on the pattern of the exam. All the best for your exam. If any other questions then ask in comment section, I'll answer soon. Hope it helps. ",
