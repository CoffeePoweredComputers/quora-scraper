I was accepted as a transfer student to Harvard, Cornell, Vanderbilt, Duke, Michigan, Wisconsin, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi. You have a chance, just put in the effort! Doors are never completely shut. ",

            "answer_text": "It gets harder to you to get admission because universities base admission around a pupil's academic performance in university/advanced level courses in their grade 11 and 12 years. Also, most universities establish GPA cut offs for admission. This cut off is established based on the competitiveness of individual programs at specific universities. A more competitive program could have a cut off average of 90 percent or higher, while most prestigious programs maintain cut offs around 80 percent. Universities with more liberal application processes could have admission cut offs as low as 65 percent. Students must take university/advanced level courses in grades 11 and 12 in order to apply for university.. ",
