            "answer_text": "If you will give 12th boards in February 2021 then you are in 11th class definitely. I personally feel you should not apply for NDA1 2020 because you have not completed your class 11 syllabus , and the syllabus for Nda has both the combination of 11and 12. So , prepare from now , if possible complete your syllabus of 11th till January and start doing 12 th maths syllabus . It increase your speed as well as your confidence Now coming to your question it depends on your DOB. ",

            "answer_text": "You can give if your DOB falls under the criteria but after clearing exam you will not be allowed to give SSB . However , i think you should give exam because it will prepare you for next exam , you will be able to handle stress in exam after going through the process also if you go through a process once it will be easy for you next time . I also gave my NDA1 2019 exam while studying in 12 th backlog and i was not able to make through but then i gave NDA2 and i cleared my exam and i have got my AFSB centre at Gandhinagar . Hope it helps. ",
