            "answer_text": "There are many teaching platforms, but the best one for you depends on your goals :) There are lots of reasons to choose different types of platforms (for example, how much technical expertise you have). I\u2019m the CMO of Podia, and here\u2019s why our customers tend to choose us to host their online courses: All-in-one. While other platforms require you to use third-party tools to host your content (e.g. YouTube or Wistia) or handle checkout (e.g. ThriveCart), Podia handles all of this for you, from the sales page to the checkout experience to the course content to the email communications.24/7 support. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in the middle of a course launch, and something goes wrong. What kind of customer support response time is acceptable? Perhaps you\u2019re okay with a 1-day-or-more response time (which is average for several of the major platforms), but I\u2019m not :) If you have a question or an issue, you can always reach us on live chat, email, phone, or video, regardless of how much you earn.Zero transaction fees. Whether your members pay you $5, $50 or $500, you pay the same low monthly fee. We don\u2019t believe in making creators pay more for their success.Of course, these aren\u2019t the only reasons that course creators are switching to us from other platforms, just the main ones. On top of that, we also go beyond courses: Podia offers an all-in-one storefront where you can sell your Online courses, Digital Downloads and Memberships in one place, plus an Email Marketing platform that lets you engage your audience and convert them into paying customers. You can see more about our online course platform here. In short, if your priorities in a course platform are using a single all-in-one product, getting fast customer service and not paying transaction fees, give Podia a try. Your first 14 days are free, so you have nothing to lose :) ",
