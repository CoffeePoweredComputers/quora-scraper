            "answer_text": "Would have if he had vs Would have if he Really, the difference is that the former puts both parts of the sentence in the past. The passing would have happened if the working had happened. The latter says that the first part is in the past and the second part is ongoing. The second one would sound more like a condemnation of Fardin\u2019s work ethic because he doesn\u2019t work hard\u2014that\u2019s still happening. I doubt it would be taken that way, though. Most people are not anal-retentive about grammar rules. There is a difference between the two version, but it almost doesn\u2019t matter due to the fact that most people would digest the second version the same way that they would the first. And given the actual meaning and how relatively rare it is for students to all of a sudden change their ways and stick with the change, they are probably both true, anyway. Thank you for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "I think of the past perfect {Fardin had worked) as the way we express the past of the past. In this sentence, the sense I get is that the test is now in the past. It is probable that the effort should have taken place before, that is yet more deeply in the past. So - \u201cFardin would have passed if he had worked harder\u201d. I can imagine some kind of test, probably a physical one, where sheer effort was important. Then, maybe Fardin would have passed if he worked harder. ",
