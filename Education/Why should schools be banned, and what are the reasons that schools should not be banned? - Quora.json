Start by reading a couple books where in the plot explores the absence of schools and/or banned knowledge. Look up \u201cbook banning\u201d and explore what it means to ban anything at all let alone ideas.

            "answer_text": "Public schools were designed to provide workers for factories and/or young men for the army and navy. In the UK reading and arithmetic was taught, but initially writing was discouraged - as students might write a seditious article against the government. Schools today provide workers. Pre COVID 19 unemployment levels were quite, low so schools were doing what they are designed for. The workers then pay taxes which keeps society going. So why ban a system which is working? Teachers here have to do 20 hours a term to update their training and development. This means the system never stays still and develops to fulfil the needs of society. Sure it isn't perfect. Nothing in life is. I have taught in four different countries, two with government-funded schools and two without. Money helps, but the keen students who appreciate their school and teachers, make a huge difference,! ",
