            "answer_text": "On January 08, 2019, Lok Sabha has passed the constitutional amendment bill enabling 10% reservation for economically weaker sections in the general category. Based on the above bill, general category students whose family annual income is less than Rs. 8 lakh will be eligible. If the government wants to increase the reservation to 59% by including 10% quota for economically weaker sections in the general category, a constitutional amendment has to be made for Article 15 & 16 of Indian Constitution. So HRD ministry announced that it will implement a 10% reservation of the general category from the 2019 academic session and an increase of around 25 percent seats in higher education will compensate above requirement without disturbing current Quota system, ",
