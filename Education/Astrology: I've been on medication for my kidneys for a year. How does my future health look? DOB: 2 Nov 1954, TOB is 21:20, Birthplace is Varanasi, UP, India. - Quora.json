            "answer_text": "I need to preface the following with telling you I am not a doctor and cannot speak from that level, of course. What courses of treatment are taken or whatever prognosis is made are ultimately in a medical doctor's domain and not in mine as an astrologer. My comments are strictly from the astrological perspective. I took a quick look at your chart, bringing up your Solar Return (when the Sun returns to the precise degrees and minutes where it was at the time of your birth) for last year. While I usually do the Solar Return based on where one lives now, I don't know if you're still in Varanasi but I cast the chart based on your birthplace. The aspects are so stunningly pronounced, so I'm comfortable with what I'm telling you here. I'm wondering whether this is a hereditary condition because your natal North Node is tightly conjunct the Solar Return Ascendant (lagna). The North Node in Vedic terminology would be Rahu; but I'm a Western astrologer working with the tropical zodiac and do not mean to imply use of Vedic astrology in my thoughts here. The 2014 Solar Return Ascendant fell in the natal 6th house of health, so this is one of the first signs I spotted. Venus rules the kidneys. But because you have a natal Sun-Saturn conjunction (0\u00b0) as part of a 4-body stellium (three or more bodies considered conjunct) of out-of-sign Neptune in Venus-ruled Libra, Mercury, Sun and Saturn all in Pluto-ruled Scorpio (Scorpio is ruled by both Mars and Pluto; but in this case, Pluto is extremely important), I felt it important to consider the Sun as well. You have Venus Retrograde in Scorpio, which is also important IMO. Even though Venus is not part of the stellium, it is positioned in square to Pluto in Leo which appeared to me to be connected to this situation.  In 2013, you had your Saturn Return (when Saturn comes back to the same degrees and minutes where it was at the time of your birth. The Saturn Return occurs roughly every 29 years and is highly significant in one's life. The day after your birthday in 2013, there was a Solar Eclipse that made a partile (less than a degree) conjunction to your natal Saturn. Any time there is an eclipse on one's Sun, it bears noting because those transits beyond the Sun and Moon on that day will touch certain degrees that will carry through anywhere from several months to several years. In this case, that eclipse actually tied you to the 2014 Solar Return which I'm analyzing now. In this Solar Return, transiting Venus is making a 4-minute partile conjunction to your natal Saturn, implying that all of these bodies in Scorpio would continue to be in play through this year as well. Transiting Pluto has been in your sixth house of health for several years and is now moving into your 7th house of long-term relationships (marriage, open enemies, people working closely with you--business partners, lawyers, even doctors perhaps although I normally would think of doctors related to other houses). Pluto is currently transiting Saturn-ruled Capricorn while your natal Pluto is in Sun-ruled Leo, which again points to the same factors showing up. I also checked your 2015 Solar Return which is coming up, and see enough of these same indications that confirm what RT Kaushik said as well. This is, if anything, validation between our two schools of astrology, which delights me because this is what should happen between our two disciplines from each side of the globe. While your 10th house is rising this time, Mercury is close to a Mercury Return (a little over 1\u00b0) in the next Solar Return. Even though such a transiting conjunction here might not ordinarily be important, it's especially so here since there's a Venus-Mars 15-minute partile conjunction which is also conjunct (but not partile) Jupiter in the 6th house in the next Solar Return, which implies to me that the situation isn't likely to improve at this time. That's further confirmed with Saturn's transiting conjunction still present although now in Sagittarius. On a final thought, the Solar Return Moon makes a 17-minute partile conjunction to your natal Uranus this year, and you have transiting Uranus in the 12th house in square to transiting Pluto that will be conjunct the Solar Return Midheaven (10th house cusp).  Natally, you have Uranus and Jupiter in the 1st house which is, among other things, the house of the physical body; but your natal Jupiter--while conjunct the Solar Return Moon as well--will not be in a partile conjunction to this transiting Moon. The Solar Return Moon is also opposed to your natal Moon, and your angular houses are heightened in this chart, implying to me that the coming year will be even more significant. I hope you'll follow up with your doctors, taking their advice seriously. If they want you on the medication, please keep taking it. I do not see an improvement in the next year; but again, I am not a doctor and do not mean to imply any kind of medical advice. I hope this helps. Thank you for asking. ",

So Neech Bhanga. 6th lord in 8th--chronic problem. gives both Vipereeta raja yoga and also chronic problem. Rahu in 7th and 7th lord Jupiter though exalted is 8th from itself  is afflicted by Saturn and Mars. 7th Sign Libra too is afflicted by Saturn and Sun and Lord of 7th sign Venus is in 6th sign and is hemmed between malefics. One can expect Jupiter's aspect to give relief but it does not since it is the dispositor of Rahu. So Kidney is affected. The succeeding periods in Saturn mahadasa not very conducive.One has to strengthen the 7th lord and reduce the effects of the malefics afflicting it. So Thursday -Jupiter or GURU needs to be strengthened and Mars and Saturn to be appeased and so is Rahu. ",

(Though I can't say with certainty, yet, that astro-medical diagnosis has the desirable level of accuracy!) Overall vitality is average. Oncoming periods  do not indicate any remission or complete cure, so you will have to attempt other disciplinary , yoga and meditative stuff to keep this in check. Do not wear diamonds or coral. Wear a emerald on your little finger. Visiting Shani temple (or your preferred place of worship) daily or on Saturdays is another psychological prescription. ",

Venus interperiod from jan 19 to mar 19 was the period of neglected health which became serious after the start of Sun inter period from mar 19. As stated above moon period will bring you relief via medicine and surgery since moon is conjunct mars in 8th house. Once this is done your health will recover after Saturn transits into moon star later next year. Good luck. ",
