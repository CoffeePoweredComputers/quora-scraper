            "answer_text": "Well, I would like to say you, \u201cYes, it is possible\u201d. to score high marks in just 2.5 months. With the right amount of dedication, time management and presentation, every answer script marks can turn out to be a high score. It is essential that you make a study timetable that will help you distribute your study time into your subjects. The best time table for a student of class 10 is an optimal one that ensures you revise every subject daily. You must make sure that you put in more time into subjects that require a lot of practice like math. The students should study a maximum of 10 hours a day and a minimum of 7 hours of study is enough for them to pass. Just follow these tips and I assure you that no one can stop you from securing more percentage in your 10th board exams. CBSE Class 10 Preparation Tips: 1. Science a. Physics Go through NCERT bookPracticing the numerical questions and revising the concepts.Physics has several questions based on theorem and direct formulas which can be memorized by revising thoroughly.You must get a grip on the fundamental concepts of the subject.b. Chemistry It is always advised to go through the derivations, SCC, FCC, BCC etc. These are some of the very important portions of the board exams.Students can also practice as many organic reactions as they can to have the thorough idea of the subject.Study the name reactions; make charts of formulae along with names and revise them as and when possible.After you finish your syllabus, revise as many times as possiblec. Biology This subject includes a lot of diagrams, so it\u2019s important to give special attention to diagrams and their theory.Ensure that important terms and their respective functions are remembered.Biology has a lot of learning and memorization of difficult terminology.Get meticulous with the key definitions as the subject is mostly theory.It is recommended to know about the weightage of each science to score better in board exam. for this use \u201cOye Exams\u201d app where you can see chapter wise weighted analysis of each subject.2. Social Science Create a chart with important dates, flip through it often and you will find that you are able to easily remember the dates.Along with dates, names of people will also be present in abundance, when it comes to History. Names of Freedom Fighters, Rulers etc will be present in large numbers.When it comes to Geography topic, marking stuff on maps is a surprise question that may be asked in 10th Board Examination. Map marking can\u2019t be mastered just by looking and going through maps! You will have to plot yourself the asked locations on the map and practice it!While learning long answers, try to form a link between the different events. Try to relate the concepts by asking yourself questions like what happened after this and why.Try to memorize the long answers in the form of points instead of paragraphs.Always attempt the short questions first. The lengthy questions should be attended at the end.3. Maths Must refer previous year board exam papers, you will easily understand the level of questions which can be asked in board exams.NCERT is the best book for CBSE 10th maths. Each and every concept is explained in simple language and supported with examples. All the solved and unsolved questions in NCERT books are the most important questions for Class 10 Maths exam paper.After thoroughly going with NCERT started doing R. D SHARMA. tried to complete all the examples of R. D. SHARMA for better practice of concepts. RD Sharma is vast book with variety of questions.Maintain a separate register for formulae, theories and methods.Having a clear understanding about your syllabus and the weightage to various sections will definitely help you to decide how much time you should dedicate to each section.Figures and graphs can help you to score more marks if you make them with a little concentration.4. English: Unseen passage/note making: This section is quite scoring and needs the least amount of effort comparatively.Reading the newspaper, topics from philosophy and even science fiction can help you improve your English language knowledge and can help you prepare for the board exam.Writing skills: Stick to formats strictly. Most of the questions on this subject are for 10 marks, divided into 3 marks for the format.Practice formal letters, applications and report speeches and understand the format properly.Grammar: Follow a good grammar book and know the basic rules.Literature: where you will probably be asked analytical questions as well as content questions, you must have time to familiarize yourself with some of the complexities of your material.5. Hindi The poetries and the meaning of there are to be memorized along with the important chapters and the questions arising from it.Solve previous years papers (try \u201cOYE EXAMS\u201d app for past 10 years solved papers) and cross-check with the solutions provided. In fact, most of the times, questions are just repeated in exams.Be clear about the grammatical rules related to topics prescribed in your syllabus. Practice grammar questions as much as you can.Learn the format for essay and letter writing and practice descriptive questions as much as you can.I also have a suggestion of an application Oye Exams Available at Google Play Store can help you to make your Board exam easy. They provide: Previous 12 years solved Question papers (with Original Paper copy).Chapter-wise Question bankGraphical weightage analysis of each subject.Yearly marking Trend analysis for each chapter.Syllabus of each subject.All Subjects Textbooks (eg.

            "answer_text": "This is different- Well I definitely want to pour my heart out- I never took it seriously. I remember my preparation months: You can say I was among the toppers of my class. I studied basically nothing. All day I used to use the computer pretending to do a school project , and used to surf Instagram and do random things, wasting time. The only study I used to do was in the tutions (for maths and science). In the end, I even failed to complete the assignment I had been working all the day for months. Also failed to complete one Lab Report book. When boards came near I knew I had to prepare but I only did so casually. I solved some sample papers. Even during the exams, I casually studied and went through some guides and previous year papers. I only studied for max. 2hrs/day. After the exams, like everyone else I thought that I might get only 80%. I started estimating what marks I would get if my this answer is correct or that one. Finally the days passed and CBSE announced the results. The results- I got 476/500 which is 95.2% or 10 CGPA. 100/100 in Maths. I\u2019ll spare you the aftermath. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m a genius or something. Its that all the hype around the boards is all but a joke. Don\u2019t get stressed out because Boards don\u2019t matter that much. I got 100/100 in the internals only because I was in the good books of the teachers. My Suggestions: English: This is the key. You need to have a good sense of the language to score well in all the subjects( Assuming they are in English). You need a good vocabulary, because you can spell out a few fancy words to impress the examiner.( Which is a shame because we\u2019ve developed a superiority complex towards English.) Maths: Make sure that concepts are clear( crystal clear not required). Main thing is you should UNDERSTAND whats going on. Before the exams, Practice all NCERT questions twice with a gap of a few days. That\u2019s enough. Science: Again, understanding is the key. You got to understand everything. NCERT covers all the syllabus, but you may use reference books for understanding and extra reading. Social Sciences: Just plot the important points of each chapter and go through multiple times. No need to learn every single fact. Reference books may help. Main thing is while writing answers just make sure that you write many points and make it look big. Don\u2019t fill it with total BS, try to look logical ( like related topics). Here English matters the most, try using some fancy parliamentary language. Languages: Try not to make spelling mistakes. Be creative. No need of spending 10\u201314 hrs a day studying. I know a girl who studied the whole year even in the school lunch breaks and free periods. She had studied 14hrs./day during last 3 months. End result- 95.8% , just 0.6% more than me. I\u2019m sure once your results are declared, you will be able to relate- Boards are just a SCAM! There you go! Wish you luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: The tips here are for English Medium CBSE students. However, students of other Boards of Education may also adopt them, after the required modifications. Furthermore, no promise is being made that students will definitely get 95+ after following these tips. Dear tenth grader, From my perspective you should follow the following tips: General tips Study on a regular basis. 4\u20135 hours a day would be enough.Make sure you have decided what you are going to study earlier! Many students just sit down and waste their time thinking about what to do! A good strategy to tackle this could be taking out 15 minutes to decide the next day\u2019s schedule before going to sleep.Pay attention to what is being taught in class. Many a times you may be able to get some additional important information related to the topic by attentive listening, which might be difficult to find (or comprehend) in your textbook.As the exam comes nearer (3\u20134 months left) Try to complete your syllabus. Don\u2019t leave anything for the last minute! It doesn\u2019t matter if 2\u20133 chapters are left, but if it\u2019s too much, get into the exam mode immediately.Start revising the chapters thoroughly. Especially if you are a CBSE student, read the NCERT textbook line by line at least twice in each subject.Take your Pre-Board exams with a fresh mind. Treat them as if they are the real exams.After Pre-Board exams Start subject-wise planned preparation. You would\u2019ve got the date- sheet by this time. Use it to decide how much time to give to each subject and when.Focus a bit more on your weaker areas. Try to revise those topics as many times as possible.Solve sample papers. This will help you gauge your capabilities. Try to complete each paper at least 20 minutes before time. And solve them in complete isolation. Seal yourself off for those 3 hours. Doing a paper a day would be ideal.Subject-wise preparation tips : You will get 35\u201340 days to brush-up and give that cutting-edge precision to your preparations. Let\u2019s see how you should utilise that time. Mathematics (ideal preparation time- 2 weeks): You should have completed solving the NCERT textbook at least once by November, including the optional exercises. Try to solve it once more now.Also solve the solved examples of Trigonometry and Geometry from RS Aggarwal and RD Sharma.After giving your Pre-Board exams, start solving the book on \u201cExemplar Problems In Mathematics\u201d published by the NCERT. Give an hour a day to it. It will surely test your conceptual clarity and application skills.After that set two weeks apart for solving sample papers and previous years\u2019 question papers. I would recommend Oswaal Sample Question Papers (published by Oswaal Books) and \u201cCBSE 10 Last Years\u2019 Solved Papers\u201d (published by Oswal Publishers; this Oswal is different from the previous one).Science (ideal preparation duartion- 5 days): Treat the NCERT textbook as the Godbook. Read it thoroughly at least thrice. Read the chapter on \u201cChemical Reactions and Equations\u201d and \u201cCarbon and Its Compounds\u201d from Lakhmir Singh after completing NCERT. There is no need to refer to other books for any other chapter. Additionally, you may read \u201cHeredity and Evolution\u201d from Lakhmir Singh before doing it from the NCERT textbook.Memorise all the reactions and important bits of information, however small it may be. The NCERT text should be on your fingertips.Solve sample papers. It will improve your time management skills. Again I would say that you should go for Oswaal Sample Papers and the aforementioned question bank.You should also use \u201cEvergreen Self-Study In Science\u201d (published by Evergreen Publications). It contains some extra important bits of information. The authors have summarised the chapters in the form of \u201cChapter at a Glance\u201d, which makes revision pretty easy. But again, I am warning, don\u2019t forget NCERT!Go through the assigned practicals at least thrice. Just having a look in the morning before the exam won\u2019t work in most cases (unless you become extremely lucky).Social Science (ideal preparation duration- 6 days): Memorise the NCERT text completely, but with understanding. You should have done this twice by your Pre-Board exams, so most of it will be still fresh in your mind, which will help in covering the vast syllabus a lot faster.Try to improvise your own answers. From this year, CBSE will consider creative answers too during evaluation, so try to write at least something relevant to the question, in case you don\u2019t know the exact answer. You will surely get marks for it. But remember, it should be relevant and within the context of the question.For History, read each chapter like a story. Summarise it and then frame questions on your own. Look for answers to those questions in the text. This will help you cover most of it in the least possible time. Ideal revision time would be 2 days for this.For Political Science, you need to understand the theme of each chapter. Memorisation is the only thing that can get you past this. Ideal revision time would be 1 day for this.For Economics, you need to pay attention in class and memorise the NCERT. Framing questions will also go a long way in covering it up. Ideally, Economics\u2019 revision should be completed in a day.For Geography, memorisation is the key. You need to have the details on your fingertips. Try to make mnemonics and memorisation tricks to aid you. For example, BRUM = Bajra-> Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra. You will need 2\u20133 days for this.For map-based questions, go through the maps at least thrice. Practice jotting down places on maps. 2 hours would be enough.Revise the important information (like dates, % age values) etc a day before the exam.Again, solve Oswaal Sample Papers. Also use \u201cEvergreen Self-Study In Social Science\u201d for exploring a wide variety of questions from each chapter.I think this much is enough to get 97\u201398%. I am not writing about English as the syllabus has changed (CBSE has removed English Communicative and made English Language and Literature compulsory, which follows the new NCERT curriculum and additionally, novels have been removed). Also, I am not writing about the second language as it can vary from student to student (plus the answer has become too lengthy). Hope this helps! Yours Ash Kumar ",

            "answer_text": "See if you have not started studying sincerely and still you hope that you can achieve 95 % then I must say it's extremelyy difficult . On the other hand if you have finished through most important topics and just need a score boosting idea then keep reading. For maths complete the ncert and do some extra questions from rd Sharma for AP and linear equation in two variables as both of these will have atleast 12 marks weightage and they might be tough.For science go through ncert and try to solve some application based questions as in last year most of questions were of that type. Don't neglect the journal and go through all practicals given in them. It will help in practical based questions.For English, keep answer short but use good vocabulary and don't make grammatical errors . In story most of students lose some marks but it can be avoided easily. Just keep the plot of story tight and don't make it boring . Add atleast one major twist so that it won't be predictable.For social studies you must be thorough with the textbook and remember the dates of all events. Underline important points and make your answer a bit longer as they can fetch you marks in SS.Having good handwriting is also important as it helps in improving paper presentation.Solve oswal questions sets as they are very helpful.I had appeared for cbse class 10 exam this year and hence I am well aware of the current pattern. All the best ",

            "answer_text": "If you give a couple of hours a day for each day for that you have left, I think that might be more than enough. But remember, studying is a serious job you could be staring at a book for days and end up grasping nothing. How to do it is not as important as how to do it properly. Know where you are, take self assessments after each couple of days analyze those responses and plan accordingly, stress on your mistakes and know your strengths. Plan, see the days you have left and how much you need to cover, make a good time table and follow it rigorously, be careful not falling for those exception days as there will often be someones birthday or a good movie in the theaters , know the balance be intelligent enough to manage it or even leave somethings behind if required.( for example I remember my target was to solve entire RD Sharma at least twice it sounded a mammoth task then but planning did the trick for me) Always try understanding the concepts rather than mugging, this will also help you maintain the interest, maintain diaries of these tricks write down important points, proofs and formulae. DO NOT COPY FROM TEXTBOOK you already have it there, document your own important stuff, this will help a lot when you revise. First focus on accuracy then improve your speed, don\u2019t lure towards shortcuts or tricks firsthand although they are important but they are often useless when you don\u2019t fully understand the concepts behind it, when you have a clear concept you not only recall these tricks more easily but you sometimes end up making your own, which is the best. Don\u2019t get distracted, maintain your focus, your time to study might just fly when you are focused, this will allow you to go for more longer stretches. Use YouTube, nowadays everyone has far more easier access to internet then we had in our time so use it. If you are struggling with some theory, brush your concepts rather than wasting time.(However this is just what not to do for numerical and math practice! This requires perseverance) Keep revising, if you do not retain what you study it\u2019s worthless. Don\u2019t give up, keep doing the good work it might take a bit of time for the results to be obviously visible, but the key is to retain your pace and avoid overthinking. Sacrifice, you might want to put a hold on that dopamine rush you get from your social networking for a few days. Prioritize stuff, do things that are more significant first. Work Hard, never get comfortable, push your limits if you have the chance, if you want to be on the top make sure you deserve it first rest will follow. Last and most important, don\u2019t be afraid to fail, be sure to learn your failures and sleep each day with a least a slight improvement in you, it will never be in vein. Hope it helps ! Cheers. ",
