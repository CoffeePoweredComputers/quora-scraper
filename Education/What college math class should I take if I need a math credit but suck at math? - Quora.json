            "answer_text": "My department chair, a mathematician, made an offer to his intro math classes: if no one said \u201cI\u2019m bad at math\u201d (or something similar) in class, he would give them all some extra credit. Get that thought out of your head, or you\u2019ll psych yourself out. That\u2019s what I did, and trust me, it didn\u2019t turn out well. I had a lot of fear and anxiety about mathematics because I let myself believe this. Also, whatever math class you take, put in the time. I just wrote Joshua Gross's answer to What is the golden rule for studying?, and they\u2019re all about how much time is necessary. I teach courses that count as mathematics general education requirements, and trust me when I say that the biggest issue is how much time students commit. That may be far more time than you like, and it may be more time than the toughest course in your major (for you), but it\u2019s nonetheless true. Given the two considerations, picking the class should not be hard. You should have a relatively small number of courses that satisfy this requirement. The requirements are specific to your school, but here\u2019s a list of the common ones: Precalculus - this continues from high school mathematics (algebra, geometry, trigonometry) and is mostly taken by students who need calculus; it may be a minimum requirementCalculus with analytical geometry, also known as General Calculus, Calculus for Science and Engineering, or just Calculus; this will include trigonometry and focus on problems like filling and emptying containers, because it\u2019s used in physical sciences and engineeringBusiness calculus, which is more \u201capplied\u201d, but the application is in business and looks at things like how investments might grow over time; there\u2019s typically little trigonometryStatistics, or probability and statistics: there may well be a dozen different stats classes you can take for this requirement (or none), and if so, ask around for recommendations; this is the most commonly used form of mathematicsA concepts in mathematics course, which will cover multiple areas, but the specifics will depend on the professor and semester",

            "answer_text": "I would actually avoid any \u201ccounting for credit\u201d classes, of the sort created for people who are terrible at math. Those classes can also be terribly confusing. I have a master\u2019s in math and when one student showed me his homework from a \u201cmath for jocks\u201d class, I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it! It would have been boringly easy if I had been sitting in the class and had some context, but outside of it, it looked downright incoherent. I\u2019d recommend the lowest level of regular math available, if math in general is giving you trouble. However, if you can find an easy class in linear algebra, or discrete math, those might be easier than say Calc 1. It\u2019s kind of a crapshoot though, so check out what people say about the difficulty level of classes at your school in particular. Good luck! ",
