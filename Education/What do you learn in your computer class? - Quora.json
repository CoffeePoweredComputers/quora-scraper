            "answer_text": "Get fully acquainted with various operating systems.Though you are expected to learn contents in the syllabus, listen to the extra tips your teacher is giving to you. Try them yourself.Try not to get obsessed by the PC. It is a machine, but your aren\u2019t. Enjoy the class.Like other techniques you are taught what you are expected to do as per curriculum. So, contents should be your first priority.Always do parallel and lateral thinking. That makes you different.If you take more than an hour, to understand the contents taught in an hour, then be aware, you are not catching everything teacher is trying to convey. This is especially true for a computer subject. Because it is as vast as water on earth, it is difficult for any teacher to teach you about this machine. Understand teacher.",
