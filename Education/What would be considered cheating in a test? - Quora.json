            "answer_text": "I\u2019d define cheating as a dishonest behavior, exam misconduct and rules violation. However, there is more comprehensive definition: An exam is a test at which you demonstrate your individual qualifications and skills within the framework and on the conditions laid down by the university for the relevant exam. If you \u2013 intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 act in such a way as to improve your exam conditions compared to what was intended, you are cheating to obtain an incorrect assessment. If you help someone else obtain an undue advantage at an exam, this also constitutes cheating. Furthermore, attempts at cheating at exams will be dealt with in accordance with the rules regarding exam cheating, regardless of whether the attempt at cheating is successful or whether you actually intended to cheat. The rules regarding exam cheating are applicable irrespective of the type of exam. - Source Wikipedia says that Academic cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 70% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 60% say they have plagiarized papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. Unfortunately, the problem of academic cheating has spread from the examinees to examiners and it definitely shouldn\u2019t be ignored. It\u2019s important to investigate the problem to solve it, that\u2019s why I recommend you to read more about Academic Dishonesty in Education and methods of its prevention. ",

            "answer_text": "I graded advanced engineering math for a year. Whenever someone cheated, I could tell because then two papers would have the same answers. I would put the grades in the grade book, but I put stars instead of grades on the papers. Cheaters never asked about the missing grades, while the person who was copied from would. Of course, this does not uncover the persons who hire someone else to just do their work. I often wondered how many engineering degrees were granted to totally unqualified candidates, and what the consequences of the cheating were. The truth is, most engineering failures are not due to incompetent work. Failures are caused by what is overlooked: Gusset plate - Wikipedia. ",
