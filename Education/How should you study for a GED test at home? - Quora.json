            "answer_text": "Go to Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more and get a prep book for pretty cheap! Kaplan is probably your best bet to learn the basics. For all of the subjects except for math, I\u2019d honestly recommend just jumping in after you do a review of the basics from your Kaplan book. Go to the GED Testing Service website and getting a practice test for each one. Once you take these tests, use your score report to guide your studying and work on your weaknesses! For the math section, I would start by simply copying and pasting the topics in the list below into YouTube, Google, or another search engine, and you\u2019ll find tons of free resources to use! Here\u2019s a rough breakdown of the math section: Number operations & number sense = 20-30% Measurement & geometry = 20-30% Data analysis, statistics, & probability = 20-30% Algebra, functions, & patterns = 20-30% The math section has 46 questions total. The first 5 questions must be done without a calculator, but you will be able to use a calculator for the remaining 41 questions! You\u2019ll have 115 minutes to do this section. Here\u2019s the list of some things you should know: -Be able to recognize less than, greater than, equal to, and not equal to signs -Addition and subtraction with fractions -Multiplication and division with fractions -Addition/subtraction/multiplication/division with negative numbers -Exponent rules -Factoring/Using the quadratic equation -How to use the F.O.I.L. Method -Calculations with percents -How to calculate slope and find the equation of a line -How to find the mean, median, and mode -How to read and solve problems with bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and other graphs -How to solve algebraic equations (in other words, how to \u201cget x by itself on one side\u201d) -How to read and use number lines -How to find greatest common factors -Be able to identify the ones, tens, and hundreds places in numbers -Be able to identify the tenths, hundredths, and thousandths places in numbers -Rounding and estimation -Simple interest calculations using the simple interest formula: p = irt ***The geometry section can be intimidating, as many don\u2019t know where to begin! Here\u2019s where to start if you aren\u2019t sure: -Know the difference between the radius and diameter of circles -Be able to calculate the area and circumference of circles -Know how to find the area and perimeter of squares -Know how to find the area and perimeter of rectangles -Know how to find the perimeter of triangles -Know how to determine the area of a triangle -Make sure you understand the pythagorean theorem and how to use it to find missing triangle side! -Be able to use formulas to find the area and volumes of other shapes like spheres You\u2019ll probably get some geometry word problems, so make sure to practice them! The key is to understand the geometry basics I just outlined above, and you should be okay! **Note that you\u2019ll be given the formulas on test day, so don\u2019t worry about memorizing them! If you can master all of this, you\u2019ll be in great shape! As I said above, you can study many of them by just copying and pasting the topic into Google or YouTube. Of course, you can always look them up in your prep books too if you have any! Don\u2019t forget to take good notes, and also, make sure you try at least one math practice test before you take the real thing!
