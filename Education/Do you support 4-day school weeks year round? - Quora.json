My first year of public high school, I was just transferring over from a private Christian school, so I really got caught off guard by pretty much everything. I had basically high C's to B-'s all year. Transferring to a school that gave me a little space to breathe between seeing people, and not a lot of people at that, really helped me to adjust to the increased pressure to pick a career and succeed in school. It really all depends on the type of person you are, and how well you handle social and academic pressure as well as how well you can focus on your own.Not that I'm alone a lot, I take an ROP class so I see regular kids every morning, and I hang out at the park a lot, so.... yeah, I'm pretty secluded, actually.

I think kids need some unstructured time, but giving the kids a day of \u201cday care\u201d is ridiculous time wasting. Why not use the day productively? Perhaps as a tutoring day or a day to learn subjects the kids like? ",
