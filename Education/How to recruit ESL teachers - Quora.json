            "answer_text": "In order to recruit ESL teachers, you need to be where they are. Once teachers or instructors are ESL certified, where on the web do they go to search for their next opportunity? How can you best spend your recruiting dollars to reach the highest number of qualified candidates for your positions? I've been working in the teach abroad space for some time now and understand that it is a wide industry with many places to post vacancies.  I am biased, as I've had great experiences, but I must suggest recruiting ESL teachers using Teach Away. They've been an established player in the international recruiting game for over ten years, their job board receives over a million views each month, and their social reach extends to over 500,000 people.  Teach Away's job posting options cater to international schools and organizations big and small, too. From single job posting options, to package options, to full service, you'll find something that works. You'll have some great ESL candidates to choose from as well, as Teach Away works closely with the University of Toronto's TEFL Online program to ensure quality ESL teaching candidates are using their site to find jobs. I definitely recommend browsing the site and seeing if you like what Teach Away has to offer.  For info on recruiting with Teach Away: teachaway.com/recruitment ",

There are many bad companies that just don\u2019t care that much about employee welfare; likewise, there are a lot of losers, who not only don\u2019t get hired well, but also become decision makers in policy-making, management, etc.Naturally, teachers are attracted to the places that pay the most; trust me, very few teachers would volunteer to go to Saudi Arabia if the pay wasn\u2019t as good as it traditionally has been. For the record, though, I loved my experience there and the food, once I found entertainment.Of course, feel free to reach out for me to ask for edits at bj80klunder@outlook[dot]com.Joe ",
