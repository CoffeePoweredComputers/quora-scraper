            "answer_text": "That depends on what you mean by \u201cunderstand probability\u201d. At the most basic level, you\u2019d only need to understand fractions the way you were probably taught them in elementary school. At the highest level on a statistical side, you\u2019d need to learn measure theory, which would require quite a lot of math indeed (I think this would ordinarily be taught in an upper level elective in an undergraduate math department, or possibly in graduate level math or statistics). And there are all sorts of levels in between. Getting a real grip on the differences between Bayesian and frequentist uses of the term probably requires at least some familiarity with integrals. And, in addition, there are a lot of tricky philosophical issues that don\u2019t exactly require math, but do sort of depend on understanding some mathematical constructs. ",

The exception is continuous random variables which require a working knowledge of calculus. When you start combining different random variables together, the mathematics can become quite hairy. ",
