            "answer_text": "There is no simple answer that can adequately answer this. A beginning, however, is to say that when one has gained new knowledge or a new level of skill that was not in evidence before an event, then the event was a learning event. This idea can and should be the beginning of a ongoing discussion about learning. For example, what if that new skill or knowledge disappears after a month. Was that still learning if it was not permanent? And what constitutes as knowledge? And how does one really know that they have new knowledge\u2014compared to what? What about quality of knowledge? What about memorization versus understanding versus application? And what about wisdom versus experience? If we reflect on our experiences, is that new knowledge? ",

Or they are able to perform a task or skill without prompting. In addition, when the students can show that they have a different belief or attitude about a phenomena, or person. The only proviso to the foregoing is that you might expect higher levels exhibited as the students move up the hierarchy of learning. ",

It is when information can be recalled or when collective bits of information, perhaps not relevant in themselves but contributing to a solution, can be combined as relevant that we have \u201clearned\u201d. Our brains are the most efficient computer ever designed. ",

When a student seems like a \u201cpig looking at a wristwatch,\u201d there is no understanding and certainly no learning (my sincere apologies to swine). Students must have their own \u201caha\u201d moment that puts the gleam of understanding in their eyes. They must be able to ask questions that evidence they\u2019re on the right track to understanding a concept. ",
