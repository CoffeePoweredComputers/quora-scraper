            "answer_text": "It's good to know that you're focused to become an archaeologist. Basics at first: The purpose of Archaeology is to study how people in the past interacted with their world. Day-to-day Archaeologists conduct field investigations, analyze artifacts, excavate sites, manage the logistics of projects at sites, write reports and recommendations, teach, conduct research, and publish the results of their research in academic journals. Archaeology is an important career because it assists us in obtaining a chronology of our past, it gives us some understanding of why human culture has changed through time and it allows us to explain cause-and-effect behavior of humans in the past which in turn helps us understand the present and why humanity is the way it is. A field work assistant just starting out with a bachelors degree will typically earn $10 - $12 USD per hour. A professor or museum curator at a large research institution who has a PhD, many years experience, and has produced many publications, may earn $80,000 - $100,000 USD a year. Indiana Jones, Daniel Jackson, Nathan Drake are some famous fictional archaeologists. Now, your answer: The minimal education requirement to work as a field archaeologist is a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree with a major in anthropology or archaeology and previous field experience. To move into a supervisory role you will be required to obtain a graduate degree, usually a Masters of Arts, Masters of Science, or PhD. You can opt any stream like Medical/Non-medical science, Commerce or Arts for senior secondary education. After Intermediate level go ahead with Arts or Science. I don't think any school provides Archeology or Anthropology as a major or optional subject in Intermediate. But if you'll choose Commerce stream you can go with Science for bachelor's degree. In my opinion choosing Arts stream with History as majors will help you to get deeper knowledge. It would be of great help for your career. Be focused on your study and work hard. Have a nice day. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the request Deval. I am not familiar with the profession and would probably not be able to give you an authoritative answer. But after doing some research what I understand is- You can choose any of the streams for your 12th(Science/Commerce/Arts) . Because your options for taking up archeology would come while choosing your graduation stream. After your 12th, you can pick your choice of specialisation like a BA/Bsc in History or Archeology. Then a post graduation in Archeology. Then if interested you can go for a PhD too. I had written an answer related to travel options for an archaeologist where I have few more details on the colleges and couple of related links that I thought would be useful. The link below.- Meera M's answer to Does an archaeologist in India also get to travel around the world? I believe the answer was a little late. But hope it helps you out. Cheers! ",
