            "answer_text": "It's not too late, but you've probably heard students saying that they screwed up Junior year the most by dropping in performance then in prior years. This happened to me. My freshmen year, I got straight-A's, my sophomore year I got one B in APWH first semester, and one B in Honors English 3/4, but otherwise I still got a 4.33 GPA both semesters since I was taking three courses that boosted my GPA. Then my Junior year, I screwed up because I was prioritizing my extracurriculars, specifically I was doing more hackathons because I thought they would've looked better in my applications. I got 3 B's and a C in AP English Lang, resulting in a 3.83 GPA. Thankfully I got straight A's, or a 4.67 GPA my second semester Junior year because it demonstrated that I still compherended the academic rigor of my Junior year, because if I didn't I bet I would've been rejected from a lot more schools. What I'm getting at is that your Junior year is typically one of the hardest ones in your high school career. Even our class Valedictorian got her only two B's, one each semester in her Junior year. So if you're looking towards increasing your GPA, keep in mind that you have to make a major overhaul when strategizing how you work in school so that way you can get a higher GPA. ",

Colleges will see that you improved throughout the years. Ending 11th grade: I actually screwed up my 11th grade year which i regret now. I didn\u2019t really do well because of my mental health and not having motivation. But you can still do other stuff that makes your GPA look not as bad. Like volunteering, after school clubs, and if you\u2019re taking ACT/SAT having a decent score. It\u2019s not the end of the world if you screw up, everyone can improve. ",

By the time you are in 11th grade, you have earned grades for 20 or so classes. It is a hard climb but not impossible. If you got 3.5 for first two years, you need 4.5 the next two years. That will bring to a 4.0. 4.5x20 is 90. 3.5x20 is 70 total is 160/40 is 4.0 To get 4.5 in 20 classes you need 10 AP and honors classes with A. 10 x 5 plus all A grades in 10x4 regular classes. ",
