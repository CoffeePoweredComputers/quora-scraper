            "answer_text": "We refer nature as our mother and we live ours lives in her lap. We all are her gifts. The plants, animals, oceans, trees and everything is her boon. Life on earth started from the same single celled microorganisms who then grew up to be distinct, powerful and intelligent. The plants, animals and even us humans have same ancestors. Under the classification of living things, there are different kingdoms like plane kingdoms and animal kingdoms. Being the most intelligent and advanced species on the earth, it is our duty to protect them and take care of their existence. They already doing their best and all we need to do is not put them under threat. We have already made many species of plants and animals to extinct. We all were born equally so who we are to kill them? You can read more about it here. https://www.acadru.com/learningmodule-brief/animal-kingdom-and-their-social-systems We humans have a responsibility towards the world we live. There is a rule in nature that the dominant survives but that doesn't give us the right to behave as if we are the Gods. We must have social and ethical thinking. We must protect the nature. There are many organizations and NGOs that are working for it. There are many animal welfare centres too and there are funds like World Wildlife Fund (WWF) whose sole aim is to protect the animals and their habitats. There are many sanctuaries and wildlife parks built around the world to conserve their habitats because we all live in an ecosystem where everything is related to everyone. In a park for a tigers where we aim to protect them, we need to have their foods like deer too and for deer we need grass too. If the deer are overkilled, it kills the tigers too. It is because of us humans that the balance in the nature is disturbed. We have already done so much harm and now it is our duty to protect them. You can read more about it here. https://www.toppr.com/guides/biology/diversity-in-living-organisms/animal-kingdom/ We have to understand that they too are a part of our ecosystem and the nature and for the Earth to be healthy, it needs everyone of us to survive. After all, we all are the children of Mother Nature. ",
