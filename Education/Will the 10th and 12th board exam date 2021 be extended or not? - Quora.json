            "answer_text": "Well nothing can be said as of now. But there are some factors to be considered: Online Classes: Not all students are able to attend the online classes and thus their syllabus is lagging behind. According the Unlock 5 guidelines, schools can be reopened after 15 Oct if their respective State Governments allow. In such a case, the CBSE might prefer giving some extra time so that all students are able to complete their syllabus.Corona Vaccine: A lot of will also depend when the vaccine will arrive. If the vaccine is made available by the later part of the year, it gives decent time to vaccinate majority of the students, thus no delay will be caused. But if vaccine is made available by Jan-Feb 2021, the CBSE might consider postponing the examination by a month or two, so that all students can be vaccinated. If vaccine is introduced after march, I am afraid that no postponement will happen and exams will be conducted by implementing SOPs similar to how the 2020 compartment examinations are being conducted.Sample paper: This is not a reasoning but an important point which needs to be noted. The CBSE usually releases the sample papers for all subjects by first week of September. But till now there are no signs of it. It may be possible that sample papers are not released yet as the 2020 compartment examinations are still going on. But the possibility cannot be ignored that CBSE has something else in mind, maybe no board examination, especially for class 10 students. (PS- this is my own point of view, please study as I can be wrong.)(Ignore grammatical errors) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, As of now, there is no official notice related to extending of board examination by CBSE. On a personal level, I do feel that board exams 2021 might be extended. But that extension will not be of 4\u20135months, rather hardly be of a month or so. Usually, board exams start from 15th Feb every year. But this time it can happen that exams might start from 15th march onwards or max to the max from the 1st week of April. All the best! Thanks. ",
