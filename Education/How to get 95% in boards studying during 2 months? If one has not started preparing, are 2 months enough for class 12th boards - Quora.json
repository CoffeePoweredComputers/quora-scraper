            "answer_text": "- My Result: 96.6%- Depends on you, and your level of preparation by now. Whatever may it be, you can do much much more as 2 months are good enough for CBSE. 1. For Physics, focus on NCERTs and past year papers. Derivations are crucial low hanging fruits. Churn them out from scratch, as if you\u2019re explaining it to someone else. Don\u2019t miss a step. Read, understand, and write till you can derive the equations/theorems from scratch. 2. For Chemistry, Focus only and only on NCERTs. For chapters like surface chemistry, p-block, polymers, everyday life and stuff like that, you really need to know the chapter to its utmost details. There must not be a single line which you miss out while studying. Yet, some parts would require knowing which is not in NCERTs, like in the chapter of Solid State, structures of ionic compounds is not given in detail (rock salt, zinc blende); yet, CBSE has asked it many times. So, past year papers are of great help to practice. Also making notes for chemistry is extremely helpful, and I cannot stress this more. I scored 100/100 in Chemistry, and I hope this adds some credibility to my answer. 3. For Maths, you need to know beyond the NCERTs to score well. R.D Sharma is more than sufficient. But, just don\u2019t entangle yourself into the huge collection of problems in R.D Sharma. You need to respect the fact that you\u2019ve woken up quite late. There\u2019s absolutely no time to master each and every concept. Focus on practicing the solved examples. That would do. Also, don't forget the past year papers. 4. For Physical Education: Aman Aloon's answer to Is it tough to score marks in class 12 CBSE physical education exam? - My background: Prepared properly for a month or so. I became used to pulling all nighters for 2-3 days in a row. I never slept the day before the actual exam, and just went straight to the examination center after mugging up. Though, it was really painful, and I do not recommend that madness ,the madness of realizing that you\u2019ve wasted everything till now. I didn\u2019t give Pre-Boards, as I was afraid that I would not be able to score even 60-70%, and obviously, who wants to shatter the image of being a \u201cTopper\u201d all through your life in front of your teachers? I remember that I was pretty much helpless at that point of time, and I can vividly recall surfing details of Improvement examination just 4 hours before the Physics paper. Yet, I ended up scoring 96.6%. It\u2019s very easy and tempting to write a story which would not only inspire people, but would help leave an impression of your \u201cheroic act\u201d. Believe you me, that\u2019s not my intention, and that\u2019s the reason why I began my answer with an important line, that it depends on you, and your preparation by now. In my case, I was a student who was solving Irodov, HC Verma, A Das Gupta, P. Bahadur, Solomons etc. before I began to get distracted, just 2\u20133 months into 12th class. So, I had the necessary background and aptitude in terms of grasping many things quickly. But, that doesn\u2019t mean, that if someone doesn\u2019t have the same, one cannot pull off something as magical as this sounds. One can! It depends on you, and your focus, dedication, and commitment. There are always multiple perspectives of looking at a particular situation. I remember, asking questions such as these, to myself at times, \u201cPeople study rigorously by sacrificing the luxuries of their lives for a year, and I am sizing up myself to that very task with some 50 odd days in my hand. What do you think of yourself, Aman? Who are you? What makes you think that you can achieve something which people normally do not even think of, if starting 1\u20132 months ahead of the examination? and, my answer to questions such as these would invariably be, \u201cI agree to the fact that people do study very hard in order to achieve a great result. But, that\u2019s exactly your challenge, Aman. You\u2019ve to do the same thing in 50 odd days, which normally people do in a year. How does one grow? You grow by testing your limits, and here is the perfect opportunity to test your limits, Aman. You should thank your stars instead, that you\u2019ve been given a late wake up call by the nature, as the nature wants you to test your limits, to help you grow, to help you intensify your inner strength. So, buckle up, Aman. Get ready for an opportunity for a lifetime!\u201d The motive behind sharing such personal conversations is that, you would need to give yourself the necessary pep talk at times. At times, you would need to shut the inner critic down. You would need to help yourself calm down by talking to yourself. At such times, you would need your own support, and you must be there for yourself. To support yourself. To talk yourself out from your anxiety and fear. So, go ahead, and start off with a new life :) ",

            "answer_text": "YES! For the how part, here you go So you want 95%+ in boards. It'd have been much easier to answer had you also mentioned your current preparation level but I'd answer anyway. First of all, don't think of the boards as a very tough thing, it's actually pretty easy. I've a few friends who didn't do any specific prep for boards at all but got 90-94% just by 20-30 days of study focused on boards. I will give you subject-wise strategy for each of the subjects. Physics - It's one of my loved subjects. The beauty of physics lies in understanding it, so please do take the time to understand it (believe me, you've got a lot of time). I have seen some students mugging the derivations and formula up but that's not the correct way to study Physics. Please understand each derivation completely and then do it by yourself. One may find the language of NCERT tough at times, so it's advisable to refer to a book from Dinesh, ABC, and the likes. However, for the chapters of Modern Physics, NCERT is more than sufficient, just read them properly. Don't forget to solve numerical, conceptual and short answer questions from a question bank like Xamidea. In exams, go through the complete question paper, do the questions you are completely confident of first and so on. Choose your priorities between derivations and numericals as per your strength. As a general guideline, Do at least 3-4 previous year papers/sample papers so that you get an idea as to how much time you are taking and where you need to improve. Do at least one paper the day before the exam. Get 6-8 hours sleep if you've prepared well for the exams. SLEEPING IS A MUST before Physics, Maths and English exams. Chemistry - I dreaded this subject but ended up getting 98/100 in Chemistry. In one sentence, Mug up NCERT! There are about 6-7 mechanisms in Organic Chemistry, understand them, there was one question always asked from that part when I gave the exam. Remember uses , names, and categories of the compounds in Biomolecules, Chemistry in everyday life, Polymers etc. For physical chemistry (the one I didn't dread), do lots of numericals after understanding the chapters. For Inorganic, mug mug mug (except Co-ordination chemistry). In exams, it's one of those papers you can finish in 2.5 hours max if you have good prep, go through it, if you can't remember some concept or something, skip that question and go ahead, come back later after attempting them all. Maths- Understand and solve each question from NCERT. Some people may ask you to go for RD Sharma or RS Agarwal or other books but I always felt that NCERT was sufficient. Solve the previous year papers, if you don't feel confident enough go for those books but first solve NCERT completely. If you face any problems while understanding NCERT, refer other books like RS Agarwal. In exams, DO THE 6 MARKS QUESTIONS FIRST! Then the 4 marks ones, the 3 marks ones and so on. Don't write more than 4-5 lines for the 1 marks questions. Go through the solved papers for idea on how long and detailed answers you have to write. English - One of the easiest subjects to prepare for. Read all the stories and the poems, understand them. There must be a novel in the syllabus, read it like a novel, don't refer to guides with summaries. After reading the novel, you may go for questions based on the novel, the character sketches for the various characters. If English is a weak point of yours, try to write character sketches of the characters and answers to the questions given in NCERT by yourself, it will help you a lot. In exams, Divide the time, 30-40 minutes for reading section, Keep a look on your watch while doing this section. I forgot my watch and ended up wasting 1.75 hours on reading section. Go for literature next and finish it in 1-1.25 hours, spend the rest on writing.  Comp. Sc. - Though I love coding, I didn't have CS as a subject in school. Can't help you much regarding this. But if they do give you codes to write and/or find errors/bugs in codes, it won't be much difficult. Keep all the syntax in your head, and do write some code on your own based on the questions provided, it may help. Not much idea regarding this, sorry. Physical Education - This one is a true life saver, Go through it at-least once before the exams start and then study again during the break provided. Easy subject, don't prepare too much for it, prepare just as much as required. I recommend APC or Saraswati Publications for this subject. In exams, chill and give this one, if you've prepared for it well, no one can stop you from getting 95. Though you can't get 100 in this one (they never give 100 for this subject no matter what), you can easily get 95. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. You can easily score 95% if you start working now. (Just assuming you passed in half yearly with atleast 60%)I passed 12th last year only with 94.4% aggregate. And by this time(december), I just used to attend tuitions. No self study.I started taking BOARDS seriously only after boards datesheet was out. (1st week of january).So, now when you have 10-15 days spare.I'd just suggest you to mug up the NCERT books first.Take pre-boards seriously. As most of the time, your board practicals marks are awarded on the basis of pre-boards. Even externals also ask you about your pre-boards performance.Not only this, pre boards will tell you your current status about how much you're prepared for boards.So,make sure you get 30/30 in three of the practicals.Now, for theory examsFirst and foremost thing is to mug up NCERT books. Get through it. Boards paper constitutes direct questions from NCERT. For chemistry, NCERT book is more than enough. I'd not suggest any reference or previous year books. For maths, the question paper will surely constitute of 50% direct NCERT questions.But in maths, you need to do previous year papers. For this, get U-like book and solve each and every paper. This will help in managing time to complete paper in 3 hours. Time management is must in MATHS boards.  For physics, it is going to be a little tough as compared to other subjects. But if you're thorough with concepts,90+ is easy to score Practice each derivation. Get through the numericals. For physics too, purchase U-like and simply solve all the solved papers. For english, Time management is equally important. You don't really need to use fancy words in writing section. Be direct and underline important points. Do the character sketch for novel section. I had physical education as 5th subject. So, the textbook was enough to fetch me 96/100. Rest, goodluck for your boards. I hope you get 95+ in your boards so as to answer calls of your relatives with pride on the result day.This is only where this percentage is going to help. :D ",

            "answer_text": "I want you to believe me that getting marks in CBSE Board Science ( I can only speak for this) is a cakewalk, trust me I'll tell you how : The most important step in preparing for Boards is solving past year papers. If you've paid even a little attention in class and have a basic idea of the terminology used in the chapter then look no further and dive straight into past year papers.Buy Arihant past 10 year SOLVED papers book subject - wise and start solving the questions.You may not feel confident but just start solving the questions. Trust me on this.You'll start liking the subject more and start understanding why you were made to learn something and how everything adds up together.You'll start seeing a pattern in all the questions. You'll see more or less the same questions are asked every year in different forms.You'll realize what topics require more attention.Its TOTALLY OK to look at solutions to the answers and how they're solved. Give it your best but if you're not able to solve just look at the solutions, try to replicate it yourself and mark it so you can come back to it.You'll understand what things you're good at and what you need to work on.Well if it's so simple why doesn't everyone do it, well maybe because they're not able to find the fun factor in it and lose interest mostly because of how we're taught science in school. I was lucky enough to not attend any tuitions during my schooldays so I had to figure out most things by myself, and when I needed help I would ask my parents and teachers but not before I would have tried my best to solve it. I just had this natural curiosity inside me. Imagine what if to teach kids football, they were made to memorise all the history, rules, positions and strategies of the game and years later only those who would memorise them properly would be allowed to actually play football in the field. That sounds absurd and horrific right. That's how the Indian education system is built but you don't have to wait for it to change but you need to learn to make your way around it by keeping things fun. I may not be able to help you for the entire prep but there is a little thing that I've done- I have scanned my notes and uploaded them on a Google Drive the link to which is given below. 1)The Physics part includes most of the concepts which students generally find tough to understand. I have tried to simplify them as far as I could. 2) Metallurgy notes include all the basic processes in a structured and organized manner. 3) The Semiconductors folder I've kept separately and contains most of the knowledge you'll need for clearing Boards. 4) This includes the notes for Informatics Practices as well for those who have Java and MySQL. I understand that Boards are no longer considered for entrances to Indian engineering colleges but getting marks in Boards is very very easy if you follow the right steps. All the best!!

            "answer_text": "Yes the time is more than enough to hit the bull's eye(get 95%)...But u need to have the \"extra\" factor from hard work to dedication...well that has become a clich\u00e9 and everyone tells the same thing...so my dear friend first and foremost I will give u tips to tackle each subject separately:  PHYsics: Practice derivations everday as it comprises higher weightage during the board....For numerical part solve last 5 years qusn paper as mostly the board people follow a trend of certain concepts that repeats many a times.  Reference book: Pradeep(contains all solved paper as well as derivations)is the best bet. MAths: The subject that engulfs everyone either in a good way(if studied)else in bad way...For maths my best possible recommendation is to spend quality time solving 3D planes and vector qusns.Do enough of integration...The golden rule is to first read examiner's mind by solving last 5 years question paper and get thorough with those concepts.But first and foremost be completely thorough with all ncert exercises and solved questions as 45-55% directly comes from ncert. Reference book: I would strongly suggest Rd sharma or RS agarwal... CHEmistry: It was my favourite...Always remember to read chemistry like a newspaper...Daily spend 1 hr reading it(don't go for full understanding just have a focussed read)...This way every next day just try to revise the previous days topic by reducing the time.Eg 1hr 1st day,30mins. 2nd day,3rd day 20mins and so on and this way slowly everything will slowly transfer into ur subconscious mind without ur awareness...and by the time u think of completing that chapter thoroughly u will realise that 70% of the things u already know and rest 30% u can cover by giving quality time with full understanding and not reading.. Reference book:personally ncert was more than enough but can refer golden for this.(do solve previous year qusns and ncert exercises as 90% of the paper is based on these two factors only.) Now left with English and optional subject which I think u can manage on ur own... By the way I had scored 88% in my 12 th cbse board...maximum in english-95 and minimum in physics-78...so best of luck and do try ur best to take good points according to u in ur routine and better buck up as only 2 months left Preference ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is damn! YES. But first of all you have to believe, because first and the most important step towards success is the feeling that you can succeed. Now coming to how it can be done... So let me tell you it in a very planned manner. Lets count your days from now, you have full 60 days in hand. Now coming to the syllabus you'll have 15-16 chapters in each subject I guess as per mine in 12th science. So if you take 2 days to complete a chapter of one subject you'll be taking 1 month to cover up your main subjects like PCB or PCM . So I'm not going to tell how many hours you should study, but you should complete your target everyday. As they say break your goal into simple achievable targets. The time is pretty enough and don't forget to solve 5 years CBSE board question papers. Solving them in proper time will boost your confidence. And do believe (future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams) In the two months proper study with NO COMPROMISE you'll surely be among the toppers. So start now, work hard & Dream big Edit: One more tip is to recall the name of topics or important points after reading a chapter, as soon as you recall the name of topic your mind will give you whole gist of that. & this can be done before sleep also for the whole day study. Edit : For board exams your only focus should be NCERT (if you find physics tough then take help of other books too , but main focus is to only understand NCERT) with all its in text ,solved and excercise questions ) All the very best :) Thanks for A2A ",

            "answer_text": "Scoring more than 90% in board exams might seem a difficult task, however with the right study habits and hard work, it is easily achievable. Here in this article we\u2019ve shared 10 quick ways to score more than 90% in board exams. #1. Keep improving your previous exam %. Keep a target of performing better than in the last exams.

Stick to your textbooks \u2013 Well this doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re against reference books. But to score more than 90% in the board exams, stick to the textbooks.

Know your weaknesses \u2013 While preparing for the board exams, work on the weak points, scratch them to the depth and get thorough with it.  #4. Time management \u2013 An adult should sleep for around 8 hours. Do not waste time in sleeping more than this. Subjects such as biology, physics, chemistry and economics should be studied in the morning. Study for atleast 8 hours a day, give equal importance to languages and computer as they help in scoring.  #5. Solve the previous year exam papers since almost 50% questions are from them. Learn all the previously asked questions\u2019 answers thoroughly. #6. Improve your writing skills by writing mock exams. The presentation should be visually pleasing for the examiner. #7. Last 3 months play an important role in deciding the final % of your board examination, so utilize this time efficiently. Create a proper time management and giving sufficient time to every subject. #8. On the night before the board exam \u2013 Do not touch new topics, revise what you\u2019ve already learnt. Sleep for 8 hours to relax the brain. #9. On examination day don\u2019t think about those chapters which you have not worked upon. Feel confident about those lessons which are learnt well. It increases confidence and removes stress. #10. Finally when sitting for the exam, in the first 15 minutes read the entire question paper. While reading the questions, plan how you\u2019ll attempt the questions and which ones will be attempted first. Take along pens, pencils, scale and rubber, make diagrams where asked. With these tips, scoring more than 90% in the board exams is not a tough task. The post is originally appeared here. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to score above 90, then you need to know some important points NCERT books are heartbeat of this exam, as question paper cover this entire book. If you master yourself in NCERT, then no one can stop you from scoring this.You must know the marks pattern that have been distributed to each chapter of your particular subject, as question will be asked only on the basis of the pattern provided. You are not going to earn 5 marks from the section of 2 marks. You can learn the marks pattern given in the starting pages of your text book.Make a time table, for each day. How much time, you will devote to your each paper and what topics you will complete during that time, so that you can cover the entire syllabus in the next 30, 35 or 45 days. Must spare some days for revision works.Start preparing from most scoring section, then move to next most scoring and so on. It will give you more confidence as day by day the no.of marks you prepared for increasing and you would feel today I have this much. :-)Practice some model papers, try to answer point wise. Avoid narrating like a story.Before going to bed check what you have accomplished, and what you will do next morning.Stick to your routine, by your heart, take proper sleep 6-7 hrs is sufficient and it must be in a routine, eat healthy, drink sufficient water, as it is important to be physically and mentally fit and free. You can't do anything by taking overload and stress.Before leaving your bed, say thanks for all good things you have, and start your day with meditation and few exercises, it will help you to focus more and more and energize you.Believe in yourself, say to yourself, i can do it and I have to do it.Last but not the least, hard work always pays off. Determination, Full dedication, Hard work and the battle is yours. :-)",

            "answer_text": "Hi, 2 months are more than enough. You just need to practice previous years question papers. It will help you a lot. You should Practice Oswaal Books Question Banks and Sample Question papers. They have a unique layout, precise and updated content. It includes previous years question papers with solution in toppers own handwriting. Whereas, SQP includes 10 Sample Question Papers covering important concepts from an examination perspective (1-5 solved and 6-10 for Self-Assessment*). This book provides students everything they need to learn and excel. Some subject-wise tips: Mathematics :You should know the usage of all the Maths formulas.The concepts/formulas sheet should be kept handy.If you really want to score an A1 in math exam, then it is really important to completely be in sync with your NCERT book. Almost the whole questions paper comprises of the concepts and formulas that are given in the NCERT book.Once the revision is done, start solving the sample papers, unsolved papers and practice papers within the given set of time.Physics :Get a grip on the fundamental concepts of the subject. A major part of the exam contains direct formula- and theorem-based questions. Therefore, revise them thoroughly to solve questions accurately. Use the formula and theorems extensively in solving various problems from last years\u2019 papers and model papers. Chemistry :It is a high-scoring subject, and also requires lesser time for preparation. Speed and accuracy in solving different problems can be acquired through in-depth study of the subject and extensive practice. Study the name reactions; make charts of formula along with names and revise them as and when possible. Biology :Give special attention to important diagrams and their theory. Make sure you remember the important terms and their respective functions. Biology involves learning and memorizing difficult terminology. Write such terms repeatedly so as to get acquainted with them. Get thorough with the important definitions as the subject is mostly theory. English :Unseen passage/note making: This is an extremely scoring section and needs the least amount of effort comparatively. Read the passage carefully and you will be able to find the links to answer the questions.Writing skills: Follow formats religiously. Majority of the questions in this section are for 10 marks, divided into 3 marks for format, 4 for content and 3 for fluency/accuracy of English as far as I remember. Look at sample letters, articles from reference books to improve thinking skills and get an idea of presentation. The board examiners would much rather prefer an exhaustive article with lots of ideas and inputs by the student than just repetitive arguments in flowery language.Grammar: Practice, practice, practice. Brush up basic rules and attempt as many questions as possible and learn from the mistakes you make.Literature: Read all the chapters very thoroughly. Specially for poems, write in your book or a separate notepad all that your teacher explains. Having said that, you should also realize that understanding the chapter is not enough as you will be expected to write 7-10 mark answers in the exam. Keeping this in mind, try to attempt past year papers and questions from other reference material and try to frame long answers. Each of these long answers should have an introduction, body and conclusion. Aim for about 150-200 words spread across 3-4 paragraphs.These were the strategies I followed. Hope it will help you too. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "I'll talk about the science stream. 2 months are more than enough if you are dedicated and devoted. You just need to build concepts to score good in any exam (any exam you give till class 12). Once you build your concepts, you need to practice few questions. But, the difference is that you won't have to look the solution for every question after you know the concept involved in solving that particular Question. If you go the other way, you'll find something new in every next question and you'll find yourself helpless which will ultimately decrease your confidence. For class 12 boards, after covering the syllabus, you just need to solve previous years' question papers (minimum 10). Set a timer and attempt the questions of a particular year. You'll surely get to know the technique involved in attempting the paper and the method involved to write an answer. You'll also get to know your weaknesses and the topics you need to revise. P.S Don't get carried away by people giving suggestions to just go and fill maximun sheets in board exams. Content and quality is what matters, not the quantity. I myself scored 96.6% in 2017. ",

Yes 2 months are enough but only if you study everyday like there is an exam tomorrow. What you now need to do the first month is to start collecting all you studied throughout the year and also clear any doubts/gaps in your learning you might have .All this can be done with lots of revision and practice so the 1st month you must complete all the chapters.Practice practice and practice!! The next month should be totally for final revision and practicing previous years papers. I have always felt that practicing previous years papers is very underrated , especially in CBSE 12th papers like Math ,time management plays a huge factor .Trust me CBSE class 12th examination is very predictable and all you need to do is observe previous years papers and note and practice the questions that are repeated regularly In CBSE board exams just having knowledge is not enough ,the ability to potray that knowledge in a neat and organised manner is the difference between those who score 90 and those who score 95. So best of luck for your 2 months of hardwork. Best of luck!! ",

As per your situation I must suggest start studying right now as you have not started preparing at all,The same case was with me 3 years aback.I have been a IITJEE aspirant and studied nearly 2 years expect the month before boards. Start with your favorite subject,this is what I used to do,everyday I begin study with Maths and after doing some 15-20 questions I shift to chemistry or physics you may follow the same! Take breaks!After studying for around an hour take break for 5-10 mins and you will remain concentrated all the time,But be careful to return back to study table after 5 mins!!! Cheers ",

I still remember one day before exams I was literally confused which chapter to start studying from and when I started studying a particular chapter I would think about another chapter which I haven't started studying .Don't keep any single thing remained for that day. So try to give most of your time to studies atleast 10 hours a day Do practice numericals in physics. Rest is easy .Mug up every page of chemistry and for Maths I think it's easy than these two but if you still don't know integration and derivatives then forget about getting more than 70 in maths I will say this again the syllabus is too big to handle therefore consistency in science is a must I totally lost interest in these things as near the exams were and I still remember my exams didn't went well .Hoping for a decent result to come up. Finally coming to conclusion if you have not studied the whole year and planning to study in last two months I think you can't do it because there is a daily routine which you are following breaking that routine sitting for hours to study needs a time to get comfortable to and most of the people fail here . If you are extremely dedicated and focused then you can definately achieve anything . All the best ",

You just need to sit down and make a list the topics and subjects you are weak in. Firstly make them strong. Practice each and every example and questions given in the text books. Then go to the topics that are okay to you practice them also very nicely. As sometimes you are blank I'm the topics you are well versed.

Try not to cram. Reason your way through the questions. Find real life examples. You will have no trouble remembering it. Find similar minded friends and discuss your findings and doubts with them. Make sure you thoroughly enjoy learning. Don't work hard. Play hard, but play with the right things. Forget marks. They will come to you if you are led by curiosity.

Whether two months are enough that will be decided by your state of preparation till now.Since we have no idea about it so it is not possible for me to answer that. I can not suggest any time table to achieve a certain percentage because only studying does not ensure marks. What is required is to follow a strict routine in which you plan to study the subjects in a disciplined way. The toughest subject should be taken up when you are fresh in mind. It also should be given maximum amount of time. According to your capability and liking you can decide o that. For example I found Physics easier than Chemistry so I divided my time like that. Certain topics needs repeated practice. They should be attempted every day. ",

Arora is the best one i have heard of and studied too.Practicing the numericals and understanding the concept will excel your grades.Best of luck:) ",

It's sort of a luck game and the question that you saw an hour ago in the practice paper appears in the main question paper! Well, 2 months are more than enough. Just go through the entire NCERT and practice the previous year question papers. Questions from the past years are repeated and at times not even a singke letter is changed. If you have a firm grip on your concepts and you now have an idea what can be asked and how much weightage each unit has, you can score, trust me, more than 95%. You should also focus on the presentation of the answer. You may be 100% right, but if you have zero presentation sense, you're going to lose a good section of your digits! People do say that the marks you get depends entirely on the mood of the teacher. It is so. But it hardly matters if you have presented your answers well. It's never too late, especially if you have started early. All the best! ",
