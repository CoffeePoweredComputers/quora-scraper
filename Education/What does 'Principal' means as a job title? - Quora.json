            "answer_text": "First understand that if you are talking about software engineering, then all corporate titles are more or less made up \u201cPrincipal\u201d engineer is generally someone who is an individual contributor, and is more experienced than a Senior software engineer. S/he is usually assigned to one project at a time, and doesn\u2019t contribute to multiple teams In software engineering, there are 2 tracks, technical track and management track. Generally, tracks diverge after senior software engineer. If you are on a Management track, you will probably go to be Junior software engineer \u2192 Software engineer \u2192 Senior Software engineer \u2192 Team lead \u2192 Scrum master \u2192 Project/Product Manager \u2192 Director \u2192 VP If you are on a technical track you go Junior software engineer \u2192 Software engineer \u2192 Senior Software engineer \u2192 Principal Software engineer \u2192 Architect \u2192 Senior Architect \u2192 Enterprise Architect Until you are Principal Software engineer, you are focused on one project. You will be expected to provide some technical guidance to members of your team. When you go into being an \u201cArchitect\u201d, you are expected to help out in multiple projects Again, titles in Software engineering jobs are more or less bullshit. A Principal is called principal just so everyone in the team knows that the guy knows his/her stuff. Also may times this happens. There are 2 guys, A & B who started in the company together. A is more technically competent. B is more competent with people. Both progress upto Sneior software engineer together. Since, A is more technically competent, he keeps getting more and more interesting stuff, which keeps him happy. Eventually, B gets promoted to \u201cTeam Lead\u201d. Now, A is not happy, because it seems like A wasn\u2019t promoted, even though A is technically competent. He is still getting the interesting projects and everything, but he doesn;t have a new title to go with it. So, corporations come up with a new bullshit title: \u201cPrincipal Software Engineer. Here, you are promoted. happy now? Oh yes, btw, now that you are \u201cprincipal\u201d step out of your cube little bit and help other people too\u201d ",
