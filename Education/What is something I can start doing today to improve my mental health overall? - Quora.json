            "answer_text": "My primary suggestion is to stop thinking about \u201cmental health\u201d as something distinct from \u201cgeneral health\u201d. All of the body\u2019s systems are interrelated and so there are a lot of very simple things you can start doing today that will help your health. The starting point for health in general is what is commonly called the \u201cthree pillars\u201d approach: Sleep, Diet, Exercise. The key concepts are regularity and sufficiency. Sleep is my main research area, so I\u2019ll witter on about this particular area for ages if you let me, but I\u2019ll try and be brief. Almost every major system in your body suffers from irregular and insufficient sleep, from your brain down to your toes (well, circulation to your toes at least). Sleep regularity is something a lot of people struggle with, and many people tend to sleep to little then try to \u201ccatch up\u201d on the weekend. Try cutting out that hour of netflix before going to bed and instead get to bed at a regular time every night (weeknight and weekday). Sleep sufficiency is an incredibly complex area and I\u2019m going to simplify things a LOT, but primarily this depends on age. Adults need about 7 to 7.5 hours of sleep a night (that\u2019s actual sleep, not when you go to bed, and on average most people take about 15 to 30 minutes to get to sleep, which is where the \u201c8 hours\u201d recommendation comes from), while young children might need as much as 12 hours of sleep (and more for babies!! The lazy little blighters! Get a job!\u2026 yes, that\u2019s jealousy speaking). There are also a massive number of sleep myths and if you\u2019re interested post another question and I\u2019ll see if Quora has a word limit. Diet is the same. Pay attention to eating on a regular schedule (no skipping meals, no delaying meals), and do some research on what is sufficient, both in terms of total calorie count and nutrient breakdown. If you have the cash to spare then visiting a professional nutritionist and getting a meal plan tailored for your specific lifestyle and preferences is the sort of gift that keeps on giving and a wise investment in your future health (and no, I\u2019m not a nutritionist, I just happen to think that these people are an incredibly underutilized subset of the medical profession who have a lot to offer). Exercise is the same. Exercise regularly, and don\u2019t overdo it or underdo it. Exercise doesn\u2019t need to be expensive or inconvenient, and something as simple as taking a walk around the block a few times a day can result in a major improvement in health. Again there\u2019s a lot here that a specialist could tell you and they could tailor a plan to address your specific health needs as there are specific health benefits (both physical and mental) associated with specific types of exercise, but generally speaking just the act of getting up off the coach and getting outside for an hour of walking (or two half-hour walks, or four 15 minute walks - whatever works for your schedule) will make you a slightly healthier and happier person. Regarding sleep, eating or exercise, excess is as dangerous as insufficiency. Adults who slept 10 or more hours a day showed increases in rates of depression, cancer and heart disease similar to those who slept 4 or less hours a day. The research on obesity likewise shows that it has a significant effect on health and creates a lot of mental issues. Over-exercise is well researched academically, but poorly publicised, but the greatest benefits seem to come from light to moderate exercise, and overdoing it can have harmful effects. If you want to do something today then I recommend starting with the basics. Sit down and thing about your sleep, diet and exercise. Write a plan, check your budget, revisit your schedule, and work things out. It will probably take about an hour to get a starting schedule up and running, but you\u2019ll feel the benefits quite quickly. There are far more advanced techniques, but these come later. First the basics. ",

            "answer_text": "I love this question and all the great answers that have already been written. I\u2019ll add my two cents here as well: Don\u2019t rely on other people to make you happy. In that vein, don\u2019t try to make other people change in order to make you feel better. It\u2019s extremely frustrating to believe that once someone changes or starts to treat you better or if someone would only behave differently, then you\u2019d feel better. You need to learn to rely on your own self to feel the way you want to feel. Don\u2019t give another human being the power to control your happiness. You should be the only person who has that privilege.Don\u2019t focus on what you don\u2019t have. This is a big one. There are always things that you want but don\u2019t have, no matter how much you have. You can be a multi-billionaire and still feel like you don\u2019t have enough or that you don\u2019t have what you want. The more you think about what you don\u2019t have, the more depressed you are. \u201cI don\u2019t have love, I don\u2019t have enough sex, I don\u2019t have enough money, I don\u2019t have a big enough house, I don\u2019t have a car, I don\u2019t have an education, I don\u2019t have children, I don\u2019t have a lover, I don\u2019t have the body I want\u2026\u201d the more you think about what you don\u2019t have the more unhappy you become. It\u2019s easy to get into this because we\u2019re such a society of mass consumerism. Focus on what you do have\u2026 if you have running water, a roof over your head and food\u2014 you have A LOT. You have more than a lot of people in this world. And if you have your health and you have someone who loves you (anyone, even a cat)\u2014 well then you have everything. Focus on what you do have and what you don\u2019t have won\u2019t feel so dire anymore.Don\u2019t worry about what other people are thinking about you. There is a very big chance that nobody is really thinking about you at all. Everyone is so busy worrying about what everyone else is thinking about them that they have no time to think about you. When you are worried about what other people are thinking, you\u2019re likely just projecting your own thoughts about yourself onto other people.Don\u2019t judge other people and be as kind as you possibly can. Judgment toward other people is exhausting, takes a ton of mental energy and actually feels toxic to your mind and body. When you find love and kindness for people, all people, you actually calm your nervous system and feel calmer. You also have so much more mind space to think about other things.Count your blessings - there have been multiple studies proving the efficacy of gratitude on mental health.Gratitude definitely improves personal relationships as you are seeing the good in people which actually supports them in being their best selves. It increases your capacity for kindness and for self-love and love toward others.Gratitude increases your happiness as you begin to see the positive aspects of the world around you.Gratitude can actually improve your physical health.Gratitude increases empathy levelsGratitude increases sleep qualityGratitude increases feelings of self-esteem and self-confidence.To do this, write a gratitude list. Each night, before you go to sleep, think of 10 things you\u2019re grateful for and write it down. You will find peace and love in your heart instantaneously. See: Giving thanks can make you happier - Harvard Health 6. Don\u2019t compare yourself or your life to anyone else\u2019s. You can never really know what other people are thinking or feeling or what their lives are really like. When you compare your backend to other people\u2019s front ends, you wind up feeling horrible. Comparison leeches joy from you. When you find yourself comparing yourself to others, you stop looking at your own self, which in part creates a disconnect with your personal identity and sense of self. You are actually rejecting yourself when you make comparisons to others. Rejection from yourself hurts worse than rejection from anyone else. 7. Get outside a lot. Being out in the world improves your mood and your sense of connection with the world. Even if you work long hours inside an office, make time to get outside every few hours and take a walk around the block. Being outside will greatly improve your mental health. 8. Connect with your breath. I have this assignment with many of my patients to set a reminder on their phone every hour that says \u201cstop and take a breath.\u201d At this time, they have to take 60 seconds to do deep breathing. This keeps their nervous system calm and keeps their anxiety levels low. For those who have general anxiety, the anxiety starts in the body and then the mind catches up by scanning for things to be anxious about. By developing a habit of doing intentional deep breathing, you keep your body calm thus preemptively keep your anxiety levels down. 9. Play in the dirt. People who garden tend to be happier. Mycobacterium, which occurs naturally in soil, has the same effect on your brain as anti-depressant medications. 10. Compliment 10 people each day. Tell someone how beautiful they are, or what a good job they\u2019re doing or how much you appreciate them. It will make them happy and then it will make you happy. I don\u2019t know why! But it just works. I try to say nice things to strangers every day and it always makes me happy. 31 Easy Ways to be Happy Right Now - RECOVER... ",
