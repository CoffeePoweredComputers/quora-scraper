            "answer_text": "They are not a one person operation, most of the time. They will try many times as it takes to get you over to the US for a set amount. It used to bee $3000.00 for walking across the desert, and $6000.00 for air transport. A good coyote will make sure you have everything you need to get thru the desert. A bad one will not give a damn if you die, girls will be raped, by them, people will have to drink water from desert pudles. Good coyotes are mostly controlled by drug cartels, the drug cartels make sure everything is done right, they don't want a bad name. It used to fairly easy to come across the border, I know 30 miles outside El Paso the rio grande is very shallow, you can walk across. I was at a party there, and people walked back and forth from the mexican side to the US side. ",

            "answer_text": "There is the saying that \u201cthere is no honor among thieves\u201d. That perfectly apply to the coyotes. As always, there are exceptions to the rule, but in general they are driven by money among all things so the safety of the people is not their top priority unless there is big money behind it. The best way to deal with them is to actually not deal with them directly but to use an intermediary who will make sure they do not receive any money until you get safely to your destination. Is hard to get a trusted intermediary but is the safest way. Even then, this is not 100% fool proof. But going back to the topic, even among locals, the Coyotes are considered to be some of the worst kind of criminals due to the heinous crimes that are attached to them. ",
