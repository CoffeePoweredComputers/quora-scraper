            "answer_text": "So many of the answers point to tech, games, and social networking as if these items magically appeared in kids\u2019 little hands. No, the reason why kids aren't playing outside are the parents. Parents are the ones giving them these devices and games without any regard to what impact it may have on their child, merely because \u201ceveryone else does it\u201d and well to be honest it keeps the kids occupied and quiet for the most part. I won't ever fault any parent for needing a break, but I can get one by sending my kids to the backyard to play outside. In fact I'm typing this as my 5 year old is playing in the sandbox. A sandbox I built myself that cost way less than an iPad or an Xbox and TV. There's a reason some of the CEOs and founders of the largest tech companies in the world don't give their own children tech too early or severely limit their screen time. My personal take on why you shouldn't offer these devices to your kids wholesale is this: for the most part, these devices are meant for consumption. Think about that. The main drive for these products is continuously supply content for users to constantly consume. By design, these products make us consumption zombies, the \u201ccouch potatoes\u201d of old are now \u201ctech potatoes\u201d of the 21st century. When you have everything constantly spoon fed to you in delightful apps and videos, using your own imagination and creativity takes a back seat. I'm also not just speculating, I've done this with both my boys (9 yr old and 5 yr old) and have constantly been told throughout their lives how articulate their speech is and how wonderful it is to be able to have an actual conversation with them despite their young age. Not trying to brag, just illustrating a point. Just to be clear, I'm not one of those parents that hate all technology and believes it has no place blah blah blah. I love tech (currently the CTO of a tech startup), but as with all things we give to our kids, it must be done responsibly. ",

            "answer_text": "Other answers have pointed to technology. Sure, thats great. But there are other factors too. Areas where you can play outside are far more limited now than they used to be. Increases in population and urbanisation and traffic make playing out a lot more difficult in towns and cities compared to when I was a lad. Then there is cultural differences. If we hit a car with our football when we were kids, we would run and if we got caught, get a bollocking. End of. Now parents are more likely to get involved and escalate the situation, law enforcement gets called etc. It\u2019s just not worth it. Then there are parents attitudes towards their little darlings. Generally outside play carries risk of getting hurt. It\u2019s generally what kids are good at doing. And they learn from it. But parents now always seem to want to overprotect their children, or are caught up in blame culture when accidents happen. This directly impacts on point one as well. So the opportunity to interact and exercise has gone down, whereas the opportunity and ease of virtual socialising and entertainment has risen, what would anyone reasonably expect to happen? ",
