            "answer_text": "I know for a fact that some teachers don\u2019t love students. Students can be self absorbed, noisy, demanding, lazy, irresponsible, and persistent to the point of being completely annoying. However, despite those properties, students are above all inexperienced little kids. They play more than they work. Teachers know this and most teachers love their students. If we are talking about primary and secondary levels (below college and university levels), teachers are highly overworked and underpaid and despite the saying (if you can\u2019t do, teach) most teachers actually can do something better. They teach because they like teaching and because they love the students and worry about them. For university level (which is my case), this is not the case. Teaching at a university is much more than just teaching. Actually for professors teaching is only a part of their work. Moreover, they are much better paid and rewarded for their work. Hence it is not the students that make them teach. Nonetheless, they are still normal human beings and more often than not, they love their students. Believe it or not, even the self absorbed, demanding, and annoying ones. We\u2019re actually more annoyed at the fact that they don\u2019t live up to their potential than anything else. ",

Parents deal college and universities once in a semester or only on teacher-parent meetings or even not at all. We deal with all the ups and downs to make sure our students get what they deserves.Parents expend part of their life earning to child, we teachers expend our time and effort i.e. Life indirectly for betterment of our students.Teachers are the one to track progress, make personal connection so that they can give advices and help students to be better person everyday.At the end of the semester teachers are the one to keep eye on result and mark sheets rather than parents. Teachers are one to visit university websites first to get their students' result.We become happy on students achievements and sad on not meeting expectations. Inspiring and filling up failed student with \u201cI Can\u201d attitude is not a joke. Even parents nowadays don't care these stuffs.People nowadays see teachers as paid slaves who exchange their time for money. But you'll realize what it needed to be a responsible teacher only by being one. You need courage, discipline, hard-work, fresh contents, knowledge transfer and communication skills along with constant energy level throughout the day.  Without loving your students, it's not possible to be a good teacher. Thank you. Image: BusyTeacher ",

They keep me refreshed all the time. They always make me laugh. If someday I'm not in good mood, they keep trying to make me laugh. They share their daily  school experience. We together laugh. I also feel rejuvenated whenever they talk about school. And I just go back in flashback, to my school life. I share my experience with them. Even on Sundays I take tuitions.  Now as tomorrow is teachers day so the 12th class students are preparing something for their teachers. They share with me - \"didi we are preparing this today,that today.\" Etc etc... One my student is wearing a saree. She used to discuss daily  - \"didi am going to wear this saree or that saree..\" Finally yesterday she decided on the saree.. I really enjoy when they discuss everything.. With me..  I love  them.. :) ",

I love some students; most of them I like just fine; occasionally, I get students who are creepy or whom I dislike for various reasons. But all my students have the opportunity to be in the \u201cloved\u201d category until they demonstrate themselves to be unworthy of that. For the record, I teach adults, not children. And I\u2019m a fallible human being, not a bodhisattva or saint or some such. Teachers love teaching and seeing the \u201clights come on\u201d in their students\u2019 eyes when they see real learning and curiosity in action. Teachers also love learning; sometimes what we learn is how to be more generous and compassionate to our students. ",

Guru and student relationship is a very deep one.  He not only teaches the subject but also about the way to live a life.  There is always an unconscious interaction between a teacher and a student.  The primary goal of a teacher is to \"transfer\" his knowledge on a topic to his students successfully.  If the student has successfully transferred the knowledge then that would be the \"happiest\" moment for the guru.   Guru starts loving the student when he comes to know that he is paving his path using the small knowledge (knowledge can be anything not just subjects) which he taught.Guru is like a person who sows a seed and tries his level best to grow it into a plant and then to a tree which can bear fruits.  He loves those fruits a lot and he praises himself looking at the tree growing much bigger and bigger. My HOD (Mr. S.P.Singh) always says this, \"I scold you'll! I am concerned about you'll, not because I am an HOD but I feel you'll as my children.\"I am really happy and lucky to have such people as my gurus I am thankful to you for asking this question.  You just bought back few memories. ",

I am not a teacher yet but I plan to so I will tell you from my point of view as a student. Yes of course, your teachers love you. They love that you come everyday into their classrooms ready to learn, ready to become better citizens. Teachers are always there when you need to talk or when you are going through a rough situation. Teachers like to listen to their students whether it is something academic or personal and try to find ways to help them. In my opinion, teachers are like your second parents. If you are a middle or high school teacher, they have so many students and responsibilities that they don\u2019t really have much time to interact with each student one on one (and of course there are boundaries when it comes to a teacher-student relationship) My point is that even though teachers have a lot of work to do and you might feel like they don\u2019t like you, they definitely do. They like to watch you grow up and accomplish a lot of amazing things. Hope this helps! Sending love \ud83d\udc95 ~Joyce Ps: also, go follow these great people, they will definitely give you a great insight into the teaching field Annabelle Clark Jennifer Kohos Kostiner Kenny Olsen ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly, I think, because they\u2019re students themselves. Teachers love to learn, and love to share what they\u2019ve learned with others. Around students teachers are constantly learning and growing. Of all the classes my partner teaches, my favorite is cultural diversity. It\u2019s a mandatory class - all students have to take it and most resent the hell out of it. Each one of them thinks that it\u2019s the dumbest idea for a class they can imagine, and besides they already know what cultural diversity means! So in the first three weeks of class she goes over what the terms mean, like discrimination and stereotype. She lets them warm up to the idea that they all know what discrimination means, because each student in the class is the ONLY person there who\u2019s ever experienced it firsthand! And then the magic starts. As they go through the different types everyone in the class suddenly realizes that not only have they experienced discrimination, but so has every other person there. And that most of them stereotype, so they\u2019re dishing out as much as they receive, without ever realizing it. By the end of the class my partner will receive long letters of thanks. In a journey of just a few months, lives changed. New understanding was gained. I remember one in particular, written by a woman in her 60\u2019s. She confessed that her own mother taught her how to hate people, and she passed the lesson on to her children. She thought it might be too late for her daughter, but maybe not for the grandchildren. She was going to spend the rest of her life trying to teach those kids not to hate. And with every story, my partner learns even more. About people. About the world. About things that separate us and bring us together again. Let me tell you something. Teaching is the greatest job in the world! It\u2019s such a shame no one can make a living doing it. :( ",

Actually, if you are a Christian, you are required to love your students. I never considered any other feeling towards my students than love. Did I fail to practice it? Did I make mistakes? Did I ever say anything wrong? Yes, I did. Did I ever want to hurt a student? No, never. Was I prepared to spend my life to aid them? Yes. Was I prepared to risk injury for them? Yes. Did I believe with all my mind and heart that I would die to protect them? I did. ",

I was not a good student myself until after I was expelled from school, and then became curious enough to study on my own accord. I know that there are many things that a teenager would prefer to do than to learn the concepts and facts that I teach. I also know that in all likelihood much of what I teach them will not serve them in their adult life, and that many of them will forget most of what I teach them, unless they pursue some field of study and a career that relates to my subject. I also think that humanity is constantly evolving; and that my students belong to a generation which will be in many ways better than the generations before them _ including mine. My students will inherit the world after I\u2019m gone, and they are therefore the most important things in the world. This world and it\u2019s future belongs to them. They have the potential to do much greater things than I. They are also filled with hope and enthusiasm, which brightens my day. For these reasons, I love my students. I may feel greater love for some, but I don\u2019t think I have disliked any. I may have been lucky with my students; but this has been my experience so far. ",
