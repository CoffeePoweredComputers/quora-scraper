            "answer_text": "Which university is better: Oxford or Harvard? Define better. No, really. Define it. Harvard and Oxford are different enough institutions that any direct, global comparisons are almost totally meaningless. For a start, the University of Oxford is a UK university, obeying the UK doctrine of \u201capply to study a specific subject and study only that subject to a high level\u201d, whilst Harvard is a US college obeying the US doctrine of \u201cstudy a broad range of subjects to a medium level\u201d. Oxford (and indeed, the UK system as a whole) is likely to appeal more to those who know exactly what they want to study, whilst Harvard (and the US system) is likely to benefit those who are undecided, or want to get a more rounded education. So which system is better? I can tell you from experience that a UK student generally (though there are of course exceptions) knows more about their specific subject than a US student of a similar calibre \u2014 but the US student has a broader academic knowledge base, having spent less time on their \u201cmain\u201d subject, in favour of studying other things that the UK student never touches. So, which of them is a better student? Which of these education paradigms is better? No matter how you try to beat around the bush, this is a totally arbitrary decision \u2014 by one metric, the \u201cnarrow but deep\u201d student is \u2018better\u2019, but by a different metric, you might decide that the \u201cbroader but shallower\u201d student is \u2018better\u2019. This argument can then be extended to the institutions as a whole \u2014 you can arbitrarily make Oxford come out on top by prioritising one set of values, or by choosing a different set of values, you can make Harvard come out on top. Depending on how you weigh academic achievement, employability, income after graduation, student satisfaction, accommodation, cost, sporting achievements, contact hours, facilities, and even number of prominent alumni \u2014 all of these different factors which universities boast about \u2014 you can arbitrarily value one over the other and that makes a university \u201cbetter\u201d than another one. So which institute is \u201cbetter\u201d depends entirely on how you define \u201cbetter\u201d \u2014 of which there is no universal definition. This becomes an especially pointless exercise when comparing universities which have such different educational ideologies, and exist in such different cultures \u2014 it is often said that the UK and the USA are \u201ctwo peoples divided by a common language\u201d \u2014 so even the fact that one is in England, and the other is in the USA can change how you perceive it!  So even though the Times Higher Education World University Rankings places Oxford and Cambridge above Stanford, MIT, Caltech and Harvard \u2014 this is totally useless information, unless, of course, you already know what you value. Remember: you are the one who has to go to these universities \u2014 not the people who write these rankings. You are the one who has to live and study there. It is your life. You need to make the decision about what matters to you \u2014 not outsourcing it to some faceless writer at a ranking agency. As an example, let\u2019s consider my brother, Sam Fraser. My brother is a very sporty person (ugh). He is also very intelligent (don\u2019t tell him I said that). Despite this, he didn\u2019t even apply to Oxford (or Cambridge), even though I am pretty damned confident he could have got in if he wanted to. This was partly because he didn\u2019t think he would enjoy the culture there, but mainly because he wanted to go to Bath university \u2014 a university famed for its sporting prowess, which offered him a course he could be really enthusiastic about, and which he actually wanted to study, gave him links and opportunities for his future career, and which was located in a beautiful environment he would enjoy working in. He didn\u2019t necessarily care that Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial (and so on) rank higher than Bath in the official rankings. He formed his own set of values that were important to him , and relevant to what he wanted to do, and how he would experience university, and, based upon those values, he made a decision about which university was best for him. Not \u201cbest\u201d in some, arbitrary, nebulous fashion. Best for him, Sam Fraser, the economics student. The result? Sam is very happy at Bath. He has great friends, and has had some amazing opportunities \u2014 both academic, and sporting. He will go very, very far in life. Would Sam be as happy, and be in as good a position, if he had forced himself to apply to a \u201cbetter\u201d (read: higher ranked) university that he wasn\u2019t actually passionate about? I won\u2019t answer for him \u2014 but I think that the answer should be fairly obvious. Don\u2019t rely on other people to tell you what is \u201cbest\u201d \u2014 even in an \u201caverage\u201d sense. You are not some abominable Frankenstein- amalgamation of every student in the world, so the \u201caverage\u201d doesn\u2019t matter to you. It\u2019s cliche, but you are an individual, and you need to make your own way in life. Global rankings exist as a measuring stick for certain universities to make themselves feel superior, and for their students to boast about (and for other people to make judgements about the kind people who boast about university rankings\u2026). They serve very little purpose outside of that, and they certainly shouldn\u2019t act as the sole motivation for attending an institute. Boiling 3 or 4 years of your life and love, successes and failures, hard work and fun with friends into a single number is one of the most trivial, banal and pointless exercises I can possibly conceive of.  So. Which is better, Oxford or Harvard? The answer is both, and neither of them. It depends on who you are, and what you value in an education. What do you want to get out of it? What do you want to study, and how will you experience life at those institutions. Nobody else can tell you those things, and asking for somebody to tell you which is \u201cbest\u201d in a global is a pretty sure fire way to find yourself miserable at somewhere you don\u2019t actually want to be, where you\u2019re not getting the most out of your education. Much as I hate to admit that my brother was right about anything, you want to be like Sam. Make your decisions for the right reasons. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends, people usually compare departments, but I\u2019ll bite. Harvard\u2019s undergraduate acceptance rate is 4.5%. Oxford\u2019s undergraduate acceptance rate is 17.5% I\u2019ll tell you why not only Harvard is better, I\u2019ll tell you why the vast majority of U.S. universities are superior. The top 20 colleges sum total of their endowments are $542,240,202,000. I\u2019m not adding zeros. I know that money isn\u2019t everything. But the United States has more than two colleges, unlike the UK, to rely on for statistics. My school, Berkeley, isn\u2019t even on that list. And Berkeley is responsible for adding 16 elements to the periodic table. Harvard has a sum total of 158 nobel laureates. Cambridge has 117. Oxford has 69. The other 10 universities on that list range from having 50 to 100 nobel laureates. They\u2019re all in the United States. How is Harvard not a meritocracy? Is the nobel committee biased? Harvard\u2019s median SAT acceptance is 1520. A 1520 converts to a score at the 99.3395 percentile. Their 75th percentile acceptance is a 1590. This score converts to a 99.9581 percentile placement. I hear Harvard discriminates against Asian americans. I\u2019m not sure how this is even possible. The scores literally show the exact opposite. In fact, 25% of Harvard\u2019s class is Asian. If we want to talk about holistic admissions, this is probably not the route to take. Oxford and Cambridge are probably fantastic schools. But they\u2019re two schools. The United States has Harvard, and then another 50 schools that are either on par or just in the neighborhood. It is no mistake that the schools in America attract the smartest kids from all over the world. The money for the research is here. Silicon Valley is here. The epicenter of technological development happened in America\u2019s backyard. The entire social media age was invented by a Harvard alum. The operating system you are probably using was invented by a Harvard alum. The video games you play are probably off of Steam, which was created by a Harvard alum. Google is here. Those two co-founders are Stanford grads. Instagram is here. That\u2019s also a Stanford grad. Snapchat is here\u2014I don\u2019t think I have to go on. By any metric. ",
