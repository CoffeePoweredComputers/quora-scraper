            "answer_text": "The first day of kindergarten is symbolically important in our culture. We see it as a huge significant milestone. As a kindergarten teacher I feel it is very much over rated. The first day at any new \" job\" is wrought with stress and possible confusion. There is separation anxiety in all parties, confusion, sadness and fatigue. I know because I have BEEN there! It is time we take pictures of to keep, which is fine but the story behind the shot is what is significant. I have seen lovely examples of kindergarten children dolled up perfectly for their first day waiting for the bus and then photos coming off the bus bedraggled, shoes untied, hair all a mess and that is reality. I think it is a day to prepare for. I believe in kindergarten orientation where children can come to school with parents to see the room and find the bathroom and find out where they will enter school and meet their teacher is critical. I highly valued \" staggered opening\" when just a few children came to kindergarten for the day and the teacher could orient the children to their new school careers. Children get lots of individual attention, that way and will be prepared to,come on the first day all the class will attend. With those experiences the children will feel empowered to take on the task. Parents can review at home and also tell their children about problems they may face and how to handle them. I think the most important day in kindergarten is when each child walks in feeling secure and confident about their day at school. THAT day is the important one. ",
