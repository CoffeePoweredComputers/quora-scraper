            "answer_text": "Many here seem to be equaling the two, but I believe IB \u2018wins\u2019 by a long shot. Even though A levels can be compared to the difficulty level of IB HL (more or less), IB SLs cannot be compared to AS levels. There are many reasons for this, and main one being that you don\u2019t actually take an exam in the latter. There\u2019s a huge difference between taking 3 more subjects (and consequently more exam papers - 3 times 2 papers for each subject = 6 exams - and sometimes there\u2019s even more, where even SL subjects have three papers). Then, there\u2019s the actual way of testing - IB has more essay-focused exams - mutiple-choice questions aren\u2019t seen as often as in the A levels. Someone here mentioned that you can take up to 4 HLs. I believe that\u2019s wrong. One could technically take all six subjects at HL. However, we\u2019re not here to talk about possibilities. No one does this because they want to do their best, not to overexhaust themselves. But the point stands. The difference is that you take more subjects, and CAN take much much more challenging levels in the IB, whereas the A levels offer no such thing. Then, there\u2019s also the matter of the Internal Assessments (IAs). Something unheard of in A levels, but deeply rooted in the IB community. Those are individual papers you have to write in each subject, and amount to approximately 20\u201325% of your grade (for each of the subjects, and also depending on your level). They are very stressful to write (and upload), and especially for students who have no background in writing projects (which is most of the IB community). A levels has no such thing. Now, if you thought that having twice as many subjects and exams was enough for the IB creators - you\u2019re wrong. Besides 6 subjects (and levels) you\u2019re free to choose, students have to take another four additional classes a week for two mandatory classes - TOK (Theory of Knowledge) and CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service). And of course, they come with some obligations too. Besides essays and practice presentations, you have to hold a 10-minutes-per-person presentation as 1/3 of your grade, and write a 1,600 word essay on one of the prescribed subject. And this is no easy feat. But hey, at least IB students grow to become the masters of evaluation (also known as \u2018bs, illustrate & evaluate\u2019). Lastly, the Extended Essay (EE). It\u2019s a 4,000 word long essay on the topic of your choice (any subject). You choose a mentor and write as you go. Now, it may not seem all that bad. But it is. It takes days and months to finish this piece, on top of all the projects and studying for the 13+ exams. Again, no such thing in the A levels - the only thing their students have to worry about are the exams for their three subjects. Combined together, EE and TOK are worth up to 3 points out of 45 possible in the IB, and whether one gets 0,1,2 or 3 depends on the grades they get in each of the subjects. Getting both As if practically impossible. But hey, it\u2019s not like they have a choice! Overall, although the difficulty of the material taught in A levels is comparable to the HLs, the sheer amount of workload IB students have compared to the A levels blows away the latter out of competition. And if all of this did not prove my point, just look at every IB student ever after final examinations: \u201cI should have taken A levels!\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I will assume that by IB you refer to the IB Diploma not the IB certificates. Let\u2019s have a brief rundown of IB and A Levels: IB HLs and A-Levels are of comparable difficulty. Many people will argue that in some cases IB HLs are more difficult (e.g. HL Maths etc.). But for comparison sake let\u2019s say 1 IB HL= 1 A-Level course.You can take upto 4 HL in IB but you can go upto 6 A-Level courses. So, up until now we have A Levels being harder (by a margin of 6\u20134=2)But now the fun starts. Add in 6 IAs (individual assessments) that you have to do for each IB subjects, and now A Levels lead by a margin of 1.Add in the 4000 word Extended essay written on a topic of your choice, and the mandatory TOK course, which accounts for addition 3 marks in your final IB scoresheet. (IB and A-Levels are now equal).Add in mandatory CAS(Creativity, Action and service) activities. Each might take you a minimum 30 hours per semester. (IB leads by 2 points).A group 4 project in sciences (ok, frankly not that difficult by hey it\u2019s still something).Hence, we see overall IB is a much harder course and trust me, it\u2019s workload is insanely high. Thus, if you want to challenge yourself go for IB. ",
