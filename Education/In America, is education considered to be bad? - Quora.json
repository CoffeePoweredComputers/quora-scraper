            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an interesting question. Within American culture and history, there has long been a strong thread of anti-intellectualism. That thread has regional underpinnings, being more a feature of the American South (former Confederacy), where to this day high school graduation rates and percentage of kids pursuing higher education is significantly lower than the rest of the country. That\u2019s anti-intellectual trend is strongest in the former Confederacy because that was the area where schooling was most suppressed. Educating slaves was a no-no, and most plantation families used private tutors to educate their own children. Without any commitment from the plantation elites to funding/building schools, poor/working class whites also weren\u2019t educated. The cultural attitude became one that didn\u2019t value education. That is perhaps reinforced a bit by the Anabaptist and Calvinist traditions as they got modified and adapted in the New World. There\u2019s a streak of rebellious anti-authoritarianism in U.S. culture, and that also made itself felt as opposition to \u201corganized\u201d religion. The Great Awakening religious groups (that became evangelicals) as well as many Baptist and related churches allowed any preacher to hang out a shingle and start a church community, where \u201ctraditional\u201d religion required seminary training and higher education. While this was a national phenomenon, here again it was stronger and more persistent in the South. European immigrant groups from more mainstream traditions (Irish and German Catholics, Presbyterian Scots, etc.) settled in greater numbers in the North. To this day, it\u2019s a big deal and a source of great pride when the child or grandchild of an immigrant becomes the first in his family to go to college or get a college degree. At the same time, there\u2019s a nativist cultural tradition that views going to college as unnecessary and elitist. ",

            "answer_text": "The measure of a human being, is not their level of education. It is explained in the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence Also, at least some Americans are aware of the difference between the socialization studies in the public schools, and the alternatives in private education. Added to this however is that a large proportion of the American Population is never taught anything about Lev Vygotsky the Soviet Psychologist who designed the Educational Theory which forms the basis for the textbooks used in American Schools. The coy wording of the lessons probably does not cause alarm in the minds of young students. When they read phrases which teach them that all people are \u201cmembers of a society,\u201d they are unaware of the propaganda device being used. Americans in point of fact, are the \u201ccitizens of a sovereign nation\u201d. However, if the Big Lie is told often enough, and for many years, the population can be gradually guided away from being able to distinguish a true statement from a false one. American schools are a kind of odd recipe of secularism, postmodernism, and cultural communism. The result is that sometimes, Americans do not always have a clear understanding of what is being done, but the one thing they can understand about the education system is that it is something they need to endure.
