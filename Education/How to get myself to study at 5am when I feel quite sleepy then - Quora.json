            "answer_text": "Okay you probably don\u2019t have the habbit of waking up that early. Right? First things first. You have to first try waking up early. For that to achieve try waking 30 mins early from the time you normally wake up i.e you are setting goals. And achieving these small goals will let you stay motivated until you start getting up at 5 am. Second most important thing; If you plan to do something which you don\u2019t like, you will associate early rising unpleasant. So plan doing things which you love. This way you will motivate yourself, and after that you may start studying. Lastly, put that alarm clock far away from the bed so that you have to get up to turn that thing off! If you have to study at 5 am then stop saying \u201cI feel sleepy at 5 \u201d. If you have to achieve something you will have to bear the pain. No pain No Gain! ",

            "answer_text": "If you have already had 6\u20138 hours sleep by 5am, then first have breakfast to give you some energy. Perhaps also have some B-vitamins (e.g. Berocca in OZ) to release that energy. If you have not just had your daily rest by 5am, the best advice I can give you is don\u2019t even bother studying as it will be a waste of time. Instead either try to rest, or just get on with your day. ",

At least one of those segments must be long enough ( usually 4 hours) for you to reach the deepest levels of sleep and must include a section of REM sleep, or you are definitely and dangerously sleep deprived.
