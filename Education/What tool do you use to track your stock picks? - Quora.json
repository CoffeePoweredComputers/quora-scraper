            "answer_text": "I use the simplest tool of them all - I track the price of the stock or long-term option I'm invested in. Think about it - the price is the only thing that affects your future profits. When price goes down enough I buy more & when price goes up enough I sell some - very simple. I have found the very safe stocks like Dow Jones stocks can make you a lot of money. But don't buy the actual stocks - buy the long-term options (LEAPS) on the stocks because they will ultimately make you a lot more money. My method is a contrary investing strategy. If my option go down enough I buy more option contracts and when they go up enough I sell them. Investing in the long-term options of the dogs of the Dow stocks/options (Dogs are Dow Jones stocks with highest dividends) is up 143% in last 3 1/2 years ($60,000 grew to $145,000 & half of $145,000 is in cash & doubles as emergency fund.

            "answer_text": "For fundamental tracking like P/E ratios, EPS, revenue, institutional traders buying over the last 3 months, I use Finviz because it makes financial visualizations and things much quicker. For technical tracking I use Chartmill because it has some unique indicators like large players volume and the Twiggs Money Flow. ",
