            "answer_text": "I live in the U.S., so I hope you do too :) First, check to see if there are any regulations about color or things like that. Next, I would chose a nice summer dress (Something a bit more structured). I saw this year\u2019s graduation, and the dresses tended to look like the ones to follow. White or another bright color would go beautifully with your skin tone. Stores: Tobi, (First order is 50% off!) Lulu\u2019s, Modcloth, Shop Ruche, Nordstrom, local boutiques This white dress below would be pretty with some gold earrings and either wedges (Tan/Neutral colored), nude pumps, or brightly colored pumps. Something you can walk in, though.  Or this skater type of dress:  Or sheath dresses, like this:  Or this:  If you want to be more modest:  For our school, the high school graduation consists of everyone wearing the robe, (So what you wear doesn\u2019t matter until afterwards) and going up to the stage to get their diploma. Afterwards, there was a function at a museum where they ate food, etc. Most people didn\u2019t bring a bag, because they didn\u2019t need to hold anything. I hope you have a great day! ",
