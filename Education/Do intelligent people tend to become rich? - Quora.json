Ok\u2026ok\u2026I am not intelligent\u2026but I am rather smart, thus understand intelligence\u2026 It all starts when they are very young\u2026 Pre school\u2026kindergarten\u2026and elementary, they see their peers/friends as dumb or boring. They tend to be loners and \u2018look inwards\u2019 to find entertainment or challenge. At this age, if either parent is intelligent, then can become good mentor and provide challenging environment while growing. Money is not necessarily a big motivator\u2026unless they grew up \u2018dirt poor\u2019, suffered and \u2018wanted to show the world\u2019 by becoming a Billionaire\u2026 Once they realize the gift of intelligence, they start to feel the weight\u2026 At first they are happy (or even euphoric) thinking they can do anything\u2026 Then they start to realize it takes more than intelligence\u2026 At this juncture, they splinter into different paths. The ambitious/ optimistic ones continue to pursue \u2018Changing the World\u2019 agenda The timid/ pessimist tries to hide behind the crowd and pretend \u2018I\u2019m just smart\u2019 The competitive/ selfish goes for money or other status to show their \u2018greatness\u2019. For the rest of us, if you come across the first type, either help them or move out of the way, you will be doing humanity a favor\u2026 If you come across the second type, hire or partner with them and they will be the main \u2018engine\u2019 of success\u2026(just make sure to compensate fairly\u2026) If you hire the third type, you end up being \u2018stepping stone\u2019 and they become dominant player in the industry\u2026 ",

I have encountered some exceedingly dull, rather stupid people who were very wealthy indeed, they had focused on making money and happened to choose the right market to work in. You cannot draw a valid corollary between intelligence, and wealth, although I guess it is fair to say capable people usually do alright in the world, but life can be a very variable feast, and conditions emerge which are unpredictable, there are no guarantees.

There are usually multiple variables operating at the same time and some of them interact, leaving a complex constellation of factors. In this case, the following each correlate with wealth: incomeageeducationoccupationpersonality traits conscientiousness and opennesssavings habitsemotional stability You can read about the interactions between these factors in A. Frunham, H. Cheng (2019) Factors influencing adult savings and investment: Findings from a nationally representative sample, Personality and individual Differences 151. For a more condensed and easy to understand discussion (by a top cognitive scientist), read this: The intelligent investor Then, on the same Unz site, look for and read these three pieces: The Wages of Intellect (Part 2) Family Fortunes Family Misfortunes In the end, you will learn that intelligence is one cause of wealth. As with all statistical findings, this one is not deterministic at the individual level. Smarter people simply are more likely to be come wealthy than duller people. ",

There are a LOT of intelligent people who never become wealthy, as well as many that do, but on the flip side; there are many unintelligent people that become wealthy as well. It all comes down to financial intelligence. You have to read and understand information about HOW to become rich, if you want to be rich (unless you inherit your money). The trick is to learn about passive residual income and how to invest in assets and minimize your liabilities. ",

Intelligence is the measure if what you know, not whether you apply it. You can employ advisors who will guide you to wealth success if that is what you want. You only have to look at Kylie Jenner and her cosmetics success. We all know Kylie does not have a PhD, but she has business advisors that have fully accentuated and guided her in business and what she likes, so she can become a success in this domain in doing what she likes- cosmetics.
