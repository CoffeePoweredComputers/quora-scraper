            "answer_text": "Why not both? Double Majors do exist. Having an aptitude for math is definitely uncommon in our generation and so if you have the ability (and the interest!) I would encourage you develop it. Also in some research areas of chemistry, particularly Quantum Chemistry; math becomes ubiquitous. You have topics like representation theory and stochastic calculus forming the BASIC tools of study for your subject, which without a strong background in math will be hard understand.  As far as making money, Math has the advantage of giving you an easier access to finance/trading where you can make a lot of money. Chemistry is uncommon in that space although if you were to go into drug discovery or some engineering related aspect I suspect Chemistry could pay off there, but on average it will be much less than the type of Wall Street Jobs that Math opens.  Now as far as job options: I'll spit the facts here, math by itself isn't flooded with job opportunities without mixing with computer science. Professorships and post doctoral positions are extremely competitive, and the Wall Street Financial Modeling are only slightly less hard to get (some too requiring a strong command of computer science), both requiring PhD level training (and in that, they want you to excel). If you were to pick up some programming on the side though the landscape changes super drastically, since programmers with strong math backgrounds appear to be very hard to come by and in extremely high demand. Data Science for example (which is heavier on the stats side, but nothing difficult for a logical mind to pick up) is currently in full rush and paying extremely generously.  Now I'm not really qualified to make a statement about what the job prospects of a Chemistry major are, perhaps someone else is better suited. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are more jobs for chemists. I'm also sure an undergrad in math can lead to being an actuary or statistician, college or high school teacher, etc., or graduate studies in an industrially useful area like economics (which uses a lot of calculus) or even an MBA or med school, with the appropriate minors. Chemistry jobs, though, are abundant in any big city area. Also, they pay you 25\u201330000 plus free tuition to just attend grad school in chemistry - pretty sweet! There are a lot of chemical companies out there. Math is important but not as directly used in the development of new products, manufacturing, etc., unless your focus is Six Sigma (black belt). At least minor in chem or chem engineering. Chem engineering is a good balance, with lots of jobs and a lot of math use. But nothing beats majoring in chemistry for grad school. ",
