            "answer_text": "I believe if you choose to pursue future degrees, or to further your career prospects in the future, that Boston University would be your best choice. Why Boston University? I feel that Boston University is better known overall, both within The United States, and Internationally. Boston University has a great, stellar even reputation. Boston College started off as being a Roman Catholic religious college, and while it has become increasingly secular to the point of having very little religious connection anymore, it might be seen by some as being less prestigious, more parochial, more provincial even. However if your life's goal is to settle down, and excell professionally in greater Boston, and Massachusetts in general, then Boston College might perhaps do as well or better than Boston University. Make no mistake about it, Boston College still has the air of an \u201cold boys club\u201d, and is regarded locally as being a patriarchal learning institution, attended by many students with a sense of entitlement. Generally I would steer prospective students towards the more modern, better known, perhaps better regarded Boston University. I would suggest for instance that any of my friends, and relatives ought to opt for Boston University over Boston College. Boston University is also located in a more dynamic, innovative, exciting area than is Boston College, Boston College being situated instead in a more bucolic area at the very edge of the city limits, and is almost in the boring Boston suburbs.

            "answer_text": "Both BU and BC are outstanding universities, and it depends on your major and interests which to attend. BU is larger and has a wider variety of programs, has a medical school, and is probably known for its science and engineering. BC has an excellent nursing school, and BU does not offer that major. Both universities play in Division 1, and BC is particularly known for its strong football program. Both are served by the Green Line trolley/subway line, so easy to get into downtown Boston or wherever. BU is more urban, and BC more suburban. (Despite its name, BC is mostly in the suburb of Newton.) Finally, BC is a Catholic university and affiliated with the Jesuit order, while BU is historically affiliated with the Methodist church. ",
