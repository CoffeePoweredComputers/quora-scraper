            "answer_text": "I got this as a whatsapp message, it gives interesting perspective on the importance of sleep timings. What Time Should You Sleep? By James Pang Is there a best time to sleep? There is a saying that sleeping early and waking up early is good for your health. How true is that? Is it alright to sleep late and wake up late? You actually have an amazing biological clock ticking inside your body. It is very precise. It helps to regulate your various body functions including your sleeping time. From 11pm to 3am, most of your blood circulation concentrates in your liver. Your liver gets larger when filled with more blood. This is an important time when your body undergoes detoxification process. Your liver neutralizes and breaks down body toxins accumulated throughout the day. However if you don't sleep at this time, your liver cannot carry out this detoxification process smoothly. \u00b7 If you sleep at 11pm, you have full 4 hours to detoxify your body. \u00b7 If you sleep at 12am, you have 3 hours. \u00b7 If you sleep at 1am, you have 2 hours. \u00b7 And if you sleep at 2am, you only have 1 hour to detoxify. What if you sleep after 3am? Unfortunately, you won't have any time to actually detoxify your body. If you continue with this sleeping pattern, these toxins will accumulate in your body over time. You know what happens next. What if you sleep late and wake up late? Have you tried going to bed very late at night? Did you realize you feel very tired the next day no matter how much you sleep? Sleeping late and waking up late is indeed very bad for your health. Besides not having enough time to detoxify your body, you will miss out other important body functions too. From 3am to 5am, most blood circulation concentrates in your lung. What should you do at this moment? Well, you should exercise and breathe in fresh air. Take in good energy into your body, preferably in a garden. At this time, the air is very fresh with lots of beneficial negative ions. From 5am to 7am, most blood circulation concentrates in your large intestine. What should you do at this moment? You should poop! Pass out all unwanted poop from your large intestine. Prepare your body to absorb more nutrients throughout the day. From 7am to 9am, most blood circulation concentrates in your stomach. What should you do at this moment? Have your breakfast! This is your most important meal in a day. Make sure you have all the required nutrients from your breakfast. Not having breakfast causes lots of health problems for you in the future. That's the way to start your day There you are... the most ideal way to start your day. After fully detoxifying your blood during your sleep, you wake up fresh to inhale beneficial energy. Then you pass out unwanted poop from your large intestine. After that, you take in balanced nutrients to prepare your body for a new day. No wonder people living in villages or farms is healthier. They sleep early and wake up early. They follow their natural biological clock. Living in city, we have more difficulty in following this sleeping schedule. We have good lightning, TV and internet to delay our precious sleeping time. Following your natural timetable Once I know the importance of our biological clock, I try my best to follow it. If I wake up early, I usually start my day on the computer. But when I see the clock shows 7am, I know it's the best time for breakfast. So I'll try to have my breakfast before 9am for best absorption. What if you're offered a night shift job? I recommend you to reject it even the salary is higher. For long term, you may need to spend more money for your health problems. What if you have assignment to do until late at night? Well, why not sleep early and wake up earlier to do it? Just shift your work time from late night to early morning. You get the same time. But your body will appreciate it. ",

            "answer_text": "The good time to sleep is from 9 pm -  5 am. Scientists have done lot of research to find the answers for sleep related questions. Like - when is the good time to sleep, how long one should sleep, how can one have a sound sleep, how a sleep affects our health? In reply to these questions, scientists have come up with many findings, each different from the other. Therefore, no common consensus can be built on this. But still many researchers say that 6 to 8 hours sleep is good enough to stay healthy. Now the question arises that is there any good time to go to bed, or you can sleep any time of the day for 7 hours and feel fresh and active. There are many evidences that a good night's sleep is the hallmark to have good health. Ideally you should go to bed between 10 pm and midnight and wake up when you feel like getting up in the morning. By following this habit you can complete your sleep and wake up fresh. Avoid using an alarm clock as it disrupt your sleep in between leaving you irritated and sleep deprived whole day.Your internal 24-hour sleep-wake cycle, otherwise known as biological clock or circadian rhythm, is regulated by processes in the brain that respond to how long you've been awake and the changes between light and dark. At night, your body responds to the loss of daylight by producing   melatonin   , a hormone that makes us sleepy. During the day, sunlight triggers the brain to inhibit melatonin production so you feel awake and alert. Therefore, you must have experienced it yourself that when you delay your sleep by 2 or 3 hours and go to bed after 1 am or 2 am. You get up 8 or 9' o clock in the morning you don't feel fresh and active like others who went to bed by 10 pm and got up at 5 or 6'o clock in the morning. This is simply because you do not tend to get sound sleep during the morning time as atmospheric noise begins to enter your ear and disrupt your sleep. ",
