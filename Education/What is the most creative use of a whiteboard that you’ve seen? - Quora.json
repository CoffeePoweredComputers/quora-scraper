            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhat is the most creative use of a whiteboard that you\u2019ve seen?\u201d I\u2019m not sure how creative this is, but, I know a guy who got a bunch of old whiteboards from a school surplus auction. He turned one of them into what I could only dub a photo-lithography studio, which then fed into a CAD/CAM system \u2026 something of the sorts. An explanation:He took a large whiteboard, turned it into a table-top, and then mounted a camera, exactly centered. He can sketch something, take a picture, and this feeds into one of his CAD studios (or maybe several) to do engineering diagrams. He\u2019s got another setup as a surface to accept a print from a plotter (large printer), and, it will use (laser aligned) guides to cut materials he sets above it to the exactly specified size. I would call this a 3-phase 3D printer, of sorts. Phase 1: Design. Phase 2: Refine model and print. Phase 3: Make parts, patterns, whatever. If I remember correctly, it\u2019s something like 4x6-ft or 4x5ft \u2014 and it works. I know a lot of programming and software development went into it. And I know that because I helped with some of it initially, when he first articulated his plans for the surplus purchase. But, at this point, he\u2019s got all of the programming and automation stuff handled on his own, so, I haven\u2019t seen it in years. But, what I do know is that he\u2019s now invested in laser cutters and printers, and still uses the original setup to some degree; everything from plastics to wood to metals. The cutting table is a bit of a monstrosity last I saw it \u2014 he had to change-out blades for different materials manually, but, otherwise, one tool was programmed to do one cut, another tool for another cut, and a variety of vices, clamps and grips to move a piece in 3-dimensions. I remember one of the first things we did was make permanent etchings and laminate the edges of the whiteboard table-top with ruler markers and angles. And then we thought: \u201cThat sucks, we should just make the rules and angle markers mobile.\u201d So, we filled it all in and buffed it out to about the same consistency, then substituted another (clean, new-used board) and made it so that the slide-rules and angle markers could move around for his sketches. The whole thing, when I last saw it, was before its time. Hackish multi-phase photo-lithography design and CNC by a DIY\u2019er, on-the-fly. I\u2019m sure you could buy a 3D CNC machine, now, for about the total cost the guy has invested over the years. But, FWIW: I think the original application of being able to sketch directly onto a whiteboard table-top, take a top-down picture, feed it into a CAD/CAM studio, edit and refine, and then output plans that would then use the same surface size to do things (different surface with tools mounted) \u2014 way back when I thought it was absolutely fascinating.
