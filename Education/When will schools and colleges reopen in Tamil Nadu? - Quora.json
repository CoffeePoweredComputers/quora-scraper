            "answer_text": "I don't think the schools will re open this academic year. Schools and Colleges will be the last one to open up. Until unless we have some remedy's like Vaccine, none of the parents are ready to send their kids to School. It's not that easy to manage the School children, social Distancing, wearing mask for 6\u20137 hours and washing hands at regular intervals is not at all possible. So according to me Schools will reopen only next academic year, may be for 10th and 22th student's, school may have some alternate plans. But for others our country is still not ready. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the schools in Tamil Nadu are CBSE schools. Government has already permitted CBSE schools to reopen from 21st Sept 2020. But the schools in Tamil Nadu are not yet reopening because they want to save money by just conducting online classes instead of the regular physical classes ",
