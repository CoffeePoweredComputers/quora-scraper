He worked two jobs while going to school full time. He had started out wanting to be a teacher, but after doing his student teaching, he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a teacher. He dropped out of college. He eventually got a very rewarding job, and started taking one class a semester, he graduated from college 22 years after his original graduation date. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is doable if your family is supportive. I earned my masters in administration which allowed me to be promoted three times since graduation and increase my income by 66% over the course of 7 years. On the flip side, I was late to a lot of family events, had to leave early from other events and completely missed far too many moments that you just can\u2019t get back. Ultimately the degree has provided many comforts and experiences but it also exacted it\u2019s price. ",
