            "answer_text": "I just read an answer which says: 'I hope it is not so'. This reminded me of an incident around 1984. I had applied to University of Zambia for a teaching position, and they had offered me a position as Senior Lecturer on their faculty. The money being offered was also good by their standards as well as Indian standards. I had also applied for a research assignment at a Japanese research institute. And the Japanese Professor had written that he had forwarded my application and had said, \u201c I hope your application is successful.\u201d A professor saying, \u201c he hope your application is successful\u201d, means a lot. It means that the chances of success are very high. I did not want the University of Zambia to wait and I declined the teaching assignment at University of Zambia in Lusaka, Zambia. But later the assignment from Japan did not come through, as well due to the reason that I had availed that type scholarship earlier to go to Japan in 1975. It was then the reality struck me. The Japanese Professor had wanted to say, \u201cI wish your application is successful\u201d rather than \u201c I hope your application is successful.\u201d In my opinion the correct translation should be: \u201c I wish it was not so\u201d. \u201c I wish it had not happened\u201d.
