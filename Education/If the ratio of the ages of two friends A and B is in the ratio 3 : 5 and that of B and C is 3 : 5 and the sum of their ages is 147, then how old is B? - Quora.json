            "answer_text": "Friends ..! The ratio of the ages of two friends A and B is in the ratio 3 : 5 and that of B and C is 3 : 5 To equalize B we have to multiply the ratio of A and B ages with three and multiply with 5 the ratio of B and C. Accordingly A : B = 3 x 3 : 5 x 3 will be 9 : 15 B : C = 3 x 5 : 5 x 5 will be 15 : 25 Now, we can write A : B : C as 9 : 15 : 25 Let the rational between their ages be x, thus their ages are 9x, 15x and 25x The sum of their ages is 147, Accordingly 9x + 15x + 25x = 147 49x = 147 x = 147/49 x = 3 The derived rational is 3, thus the ages of three fruends will be A's age 9x = 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 years B's age 15x = 15 \u00d7 3 = 45 years C\u2019s age 25x = 25 \u00d7 3 = 75 years. Answer B is 45 years old ",

            "answer_text": "A:B = 3:5B:C = 3:5 We can see in the first ratio between A and B, B has 5 part of the total. and for the second one the ratio between B and C, B has 3 parts of the total. To make B equal in both ratios we have to do like dis A:B = 3 x 3 : 5 x 3 = 9 : 15 (multiplying both with 3) B:C = 3 x 5 : 5 x 5 = 15 : 25 (multiplying both with 5) Now, we can see that both ratios have equal value of B. So, We can write A:B:C = 9 : 15 : 25 ",
