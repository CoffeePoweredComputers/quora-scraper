And also each month they update the list and everytime you have a chance to enter elite batch ..once you are in elite you will never go out even if your performance is low after entering the batch\u2026 So now I comes to the benefits they will get\u2026They will have elite exams on all tuesdays apart from the ordinary weekly exams conducted on all mondays\u2026the speciality of elite exams is that you will get a chance to encounter with higher order questions\u2026 Another benefits is that they will get magazines of MTG for free and Books with questiom papers of previous year unit wise exams.They will also get extra question papers for practicing\u2026 Your strength and hardwork can make you a member of elite batch and I think its a good thing as you will get a chance to work even more nd more harder every time\u2026. NB:Im not a member of elite batch till the end even I tried my level best..There you can see a very tight competition for A+ batch itself\u2026 ",

Also they get incentives like extra library books, resonance packages, qs papers etc. However ,the batch is rotatable. You can get in and be thrown out week after week. PS: there are many who are studying in govt. medical colleges without being in this batch. So focus on studying, leave the rest to our buddy above . ",
