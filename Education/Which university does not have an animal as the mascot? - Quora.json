            "answer_text": "There are several schools with human or human-like mascots, such as Sparty (Michigan State), the Demon Deacon (Wake Forest), the leprechaun (Notre Dame) and the masked rider of the Texas Tech Red Raiders. There are also a few that do not represent any sentient being. The most famous of these is probably the Stanford Tree, which is so well known it has its own Quora topic.  The mascot of The Ohio State University is Brutus Buckeye. A buckeye is a nut that grows in the state of Ohio, and the live mascot has a buckeye for a head. Although rival schools are fond of saying that \u201ca buckeye is a useless nut,\u201d and buckeyes aren't edible if not cooked, they do have some uses. Native Americans roasted the nut and peeled away the shell to make a food called \"hetuck.\" The nut can also be cooked, beaten into a paste and used as a supplement to treat arthritis. (Source: Can you eat buckeye nuts?)  Pepperdine's athletic teams are the Waves, and their mascot is an actual wave. Willie the Wave has a wave for a head, and is dressed like a surfer.
