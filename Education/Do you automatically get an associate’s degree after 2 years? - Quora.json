            "answer_text": "This is a question I\u2019ve answered many times. For example, somebody will be attending a four-year college or university and think that after 2 years of being there, they now have an Associates degree. So if they were to drop out in year 3 or 4, they can say they have an Associate\u2019s degree. You don\u2019t have one! So just because you completed your first two years doesn\u2019t automatically give you a degree! However, if you had enrolled in an Associates degree program and completed everything, then yes, you would officially earn the degree. And then could continue on for the Bachelors. So in order to earn an Associates, you need to be formally enrolled in that degree program. And successfully complete all the degree\u2019s requirements. A process that could take longer than 2 years because you may be going to school part-time instead of full-time. So how long it will take you to complete all the credits you need is dependent upon your individual schedule. With a lot more working students, some are just taking one class at a time. So the 2 years is when you\u2019re taking full loads each quarter, semester, or session. Not everybody takes a full load. ",

            "answer_text": "NOPE. As with any degree program (associate, bachelors, masters, doctoral) there are required course work and GPA requirements. Many (not all) masters and higher require research in the form of writing a dissertation and the like. Just going to college for a couple of years won\u2019t give you an associate degree. Keep in mind that the \u201ctwo years\u201d applies if you are going full time, not part time. Associate degrees are usually only granted by junior/community colleges. If you go to a state university, they most likely don\u2019t do associate degrees. So if you want an associate degree you need to:1) go to a college that offers them2) sign up for the particular program (you want an AA or an AS and in what field)3) complete the required coursework AND maintain the minimum GPA4) once you have the coursework, you\u2019ll need to apply for the degree.

            "answer_text": "No. Time has nothing to do with getting a degree. Every degree program, including those that grant associates\u2019 degrees, has graduation requirements. Typically, those requirements include core classes within a field or specialty, general education requirements such as composition and math, and perhaps a small number of electives. If you are a full-time student and take approximately 15 credits per semester, you can typically complete graduation requirements for an associate's degree in two years. If you switch programs, fail classes or do not achieve a passing grade, or take less than 15 credit hours per semester, it will take you longer than two years. ",

It might not accept some of the courses taken at the 4 year school, due to either content or grade. ",
