            "answer_text": "There are several magazines and online publications that fashion themselves \u201cjournals\u201d intended for high schoolers. In truth, the vast majority (perhaps all) of these self-proclaimed academic journals do not meet the standards of an actual academic journal published by a university or professional organization. That\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re all scams (some are, so be aware) \u2014 some might well encourage deeper critical thought and writing among high school students, which is never a bad thing, so feel free to submit your writings to them. But they aren\u2019t recognized, legitimate academic journals and do not serve the purpose of an academic journal. In fact, most high school students would have trouble producing the kind of quality original research in a specialized field to publish in an actual journal; it can take years for a university professor to get his/her work published in one sometimes. That being said, after high school you\u2019ll find that there are several journals for university students such as the Gettysburg College Journal of the Civil War Era and Berkeley Undergraduate Journal of Classics. These journals are designed for undergraduate students to publish their research. If you truly feel that you\u2019ve produced a piece of genuine, original research as a high school student though, you can submit to any recognized academic journal. I know of a high schooler years ago who got published in a professional academic journal by Oxford. Such journals are intended for academics in specific fields, but they aren\u2019t closed to submissions by anyone \u2014 it\u2019s just that most don\u2019t make the final cut. Best of luck! ",
