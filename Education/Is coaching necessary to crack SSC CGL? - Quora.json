            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. First let us reckon why one needs coaching. Timely completion of syllabus.Better understanding of conceptsMock Tests to evaluate your performance.Keep you abreast of the recent changes in Exam pattern.Now analyse for all the points can they be achieved without coaching? If you are determined enough, have set your goal and time allocation for each subject, you do not need coaching. But you need to be very clear will you be able to do that on your own? Depends on your dedication.If you are sharp enough, and have some basic knowledge of the concepts, you can make it on your own. If you have even a slight doubt in this, get enrolled in coaching. Why take chances?With plethora of mocks and test series available in this internet revolution, nothing is beyond your reach. You can almost take any mock, anywhere, anytime. Dependency on coaching for evaluating your performance is obsolete now.Now this is something very serious. The recent changes in the Quant section have certainly raised the level up. I am damn sure almost 99% of the teachers themselves will fail in solving those questions. As we very well know what their knowledge domain is. So, all you need is to master Sarvesh Kumar book+Rakesh yadav( for basics) you yourself.Thus I listed out few major points why one has to get enrolled in coaching. If you on your own can well manage, you do not need to. I too never got into such for CGL Your task does not finishes here itself. You will always have to give extra hours apart from what hours you spend in coaching.Coachings have turned more into business nowadays. You will be attending classes together with 300\u2013400 other batch-mates at the very same time in the very same class.It was common experience of few of my friends that their syllabus was left incomplete. If any such mishap occurs, you will get into extra trouble.Thankyou. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on various things. Let\u2019s understand three things in details - If you are dedicated to studies and have determined mission and vision then you don\u2019t need any kind of coaching because in today's era, we have internet and all things are available in it. You can study through YouTube; google mock tests and online tutorial and you can clear your SSC CGL exam.Another situation is that you have all the things mentioned in the 1st point but you are confused and don\u2019t like online classes, then need of coaching center arises.One more situation \u2013 You need someone to teach you when you got stuck in the problems and you believe in live teaching rather than online coaching. Then you need proper coaching center.So, which point mentioned above suits you? We will understand on the basis of some points mentioned below- Do your SWOT analysis i.e. Strengths, weakness, opportunities, threat? It is needed to understand what kind of person you are! Introvert or extrovert. This will help you to make the better decision not just here but in a life time.Do not follow trend i.e. if everyone is taking coaching so you should also take coaching. It is not true.Books are needed with the latest editions with the latest questions.Not all subjects require coaching for example - GK.You need to learn formulas by yourself only, no coaching center can learn for you.Give yourself at least a week to decide for what\u2019s best for you.Do you need to travel a new city \u2013 sometimes coaching is not available in small towns so people shift from one place to another.Expenses calculations needed. Remember cost is temporary but what you learn from that is permanent if you keep practicing.Traveling, vehicle, bags, lunch-dinner, etc. proper time-table needed.Any other points you may think of? If you take all the points into consideration, I am sure that you will get the answer of the kind of person you are when it comes to learning. There is nothing bad either in self-study or in taking coaching. Let\u2019s clear all your doubts about coaching below - What are the advantages of regular coaching? Coaching classes are one of the best options for the students above average level who have a very good grasping power.In coaching classes, the students get a chance of group study and can also get a solution for a problem having a discussion with each other.In coaching classes, the students get to learn the importance of coordination that helps them in school.Sometimes a student can also get motivated to work hard by seeing others doing well in studies.Studying in a group also brings a challenge so that the students get to learn to compete with each other. Competition is very important for good results.The entire atmosphere in a coaching class is quite healthy & friendly that motivates the students to study better.Before joining a coaching class, the parents can inquire about the coaching center and the teachers for authenticity.The parents can also get feedback from the teachers to track the preparation and performance of the students so far.If you need better counseling check options coaching academy which gives many kinds of coaching including SSC. You can call them and can take free counseling.What are the disadvantages of regular coaching? The foremost disadvantage of a coaching class is that it has an extremely crowded environment that brings a lack of concentration.Due to the heavy crowd in a coaching class, the students fail to get complete attention from teachers.The students who feel hesitate to ask for their queries also find it difficult to approach the teacher for any problem.In coaching classes, the parents cannot observe the progress of their child on a regular basis, unlike home tuitions.The students with lower grasping power lag behind in catching up with other students in the class.I hope you get an idea of what is right and what is wrong. I hope my answer clear your doubts and will help you in taking a better wiser decision. Check the coaching center I mentioned and call them if you need help in taking better decision for SSC coaching. ",
