            "answer_text": "If you want to be a future IITian, then it\u2019s crucial to plan ahead. For the JEE Advanced exam, one has to start the preparations right from class 11. A high level of dedication and effort needs to be put in, from the very beginning. The questions asked in the JEE Advanced exam are almost equally from the Class 11 and Class 12 syllabus. There are many students who take it easy in 11th standard after the stressful 10th board exams, but let me tell you that it is almost impossible to cover up the lost preparation in 12th standard. So, in order to secure a good rank in the examination, students must begin an in-depth and structured preparation of the exam syllabi right from the 11 th standard. While cracking the JEE Main is relatively easier and based mainly on the NCERT content, the JEE Advanced requires a rigorous practice of the basics as well as relatively advanced practice problems from several reference books of both class 11 th and 12 th syllabus. I\u2019ve listed out topics you need to work on in each subject of standard 11th to make the process of JEE Advanced easier for you. Important Topics from Class 11 Mathematics A major section of the JEE Advanced Mathematics syllabus is based on the class 11 Mathematics content. The topics of 11 th syllabus Mathematics that cover almost 50% of the JEE Advanced Mathematics question papers are listed below: Relations and functionsTrigonometric functionsComplex numbersQuadratic equationsLinear inequalitiesPermutations and CombinationsProbabilityBinomial TheoremSequences and seriesStraight linesConic sectionThree-dimensional geometryLimits, derivatives and continuity of functions (including L\u2019Hospital rule)Since the above-mentioned topics form the base of any Mathematics problem, it is crucial to have a routine practice of sums of different levels of difficulty on a regular basis. For example, not understanding limits and derivatives will make solving problems of differentiation and integration very difficult. This topic forms approximately 30% of the class 12 th Maths syllabus. Of the above-mentioned topics, relations and functions, trigonometry and probability need to be studied more extensively. JEE Mathematics: 1. NCERT Maths 11th and 12th: The problems in the book are basic and easy. Most of the problems can be solved orally by the student. This book should be covered very early in one\u2019s preparation. 2. A. Das Gupta Objective: It\u2019s a practice book for each chapter, and a good indicator of your understanding of each chapter. \u2018Practice makes perfect\u2019 and this is the motto of this book. 3. S.L. Loney for Trigonometry and Coordinate Geometry: The author has written the book in a very exhaustive manner, in-fact even PhD students use these books. For ideal preparation it\u2019s always preferred to have a mentor to guide the student on which part of the book is solved and which part can be left out. 4. G.N. Berman: This book is specifically used for Calculus, and on every concept in every chapter a number of different problems are available. Don\u2019t use this book beyond Calculus as it contains higher level mathematics, which is not at all needed for JEE.Few other books that you can use to pickup some quality problems \u2013 I.A Maron and A Das Gupta Subjective ",
