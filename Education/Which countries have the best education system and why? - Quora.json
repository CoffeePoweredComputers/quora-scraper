            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question to answer, because some of the top performing world education systems can't be more different from one another. East Asia and Scandinavia rank the highest. I'm going to answer this by giving a quick epithet about a high performing American system at the local level, and then talk about Finland and South Korea.  I believe there exist local education systems in the United States that can compete with the best globally. Compared with the rest of the world the American education system is very decentralized and allows for some incredibly effective education systems at the local level. Unfortunately, this cannot be said of the whole American education system.  An example of a great local education system that is very competitive with the rest of the world would be that of Palo Alto, California. Here, STEM courses are highly valued. Education is rigorous, competitive but also very stressful. Students that would be at the top of their class in other places in the country might only be considered mediocre in Palo Alto.  Palo Alto is much different than the education system of say, Denmark. Denmark has a world class education system but its society doesn't value individual achievement as highly as Americans do so there are fewer opportunities for star students for the sake of moving the whole group along. This shows that there is and always will be pros and cons amongst all education systems.  South Korea, according to Pearson has the best education system in the world. This is a remarkable achievement because after the Korean War, 78% of Koreans were illiterate. The Korean government insists on equal access to education for all, a teacher is a highly coveted career (only 5% of applicants will be accepted into the elementary school teaching program) and having a good education is very consequential to your social status. Heck, even your parents are judged by their peers when you perform poorly in school. South Korea continuously searches for ways to be efficient with education dollars. While it invests much more in teachers, it expects these teachers to teach larger classes. The first pushing costs up, the latter pushing costs down. With South Korea, intense government and public interest in Education, plus an incredible work ethic by students tangled with the social costs of performing poorly, is a recipe for this:   South Korea vs. United States 2009 PISA Results (From NCEE) Unfortunately, the cost of doubling the performance of that of American counterparts is an immensely stressful environment that (it is argued) stifles out of the box thinking and creates high rates of teen suicide. Students study night and day in Korea in their pursuit of that perfect test score. After they finish school many turn up in one of the many after school academies, or \"Hagwons,\" where they will study well into the wee hours of the night. This high performance comes at a cost.     Now let's talk about Finland that is home to another top performing education system. Finland is another example of a nation that once fared poorly with the rest of the world but now is ahead of the pack after effective reforms. It couldn't be any more different from South Korea, since it has eliminated standardized tests and elementary education mandates lots of free time to build social skills.    Finnish elementary school kids working on a project.  In Finland, all teachers complete 3 years of graduate level preparation, paid for by the government. Teacher education was a focus in the 1970s and overhauled making it longer and making it free. This investment of time and money worked.  With this is an effective balance between centralization and decentralization. While there is a common core, it consists of 10 or so pages of guidance for teachers who then collectively develop curriculum and assessments. Before the common core overhaul, teachers were workout out of 700 page documents that commanded curriculum to the t.  As with other high performing education systems, Finland provides ample time for teacher collaboration with weekly meetings and continued professional development for education professionals.  With the South Korea and Finland examples, as well as some others I haven't discussed, high performing education systems have the following in common:  -The country puts a high value on education, with noticeable differences with how education is talked about in daily conversation, on the news and amongst students themselves. -The country values teachers highly, and pays them accordingly.-High performing education systems have high standards. -Education and other public policy are aligned and complement each other.-High performing systems value equality and universal access. -Frequent teacher feedback What they don't have, or what doesn't matter: They don't use conventional wisdom, and waste money on moot issues like:-Small class sizes (doesn't matter)-Expenditure per pupil (doesn't matter)-Teacher certification (doesn't matter)-% teachers with advanced degrees (doesn't matter) They don't have:-Teachers that make only $25,000 per year and have student loans. -Public debate over issues like, whether or not to put a sticker saying evolution is just a theory on the science textbook.-Common core that doesn't allow for teacher input. Thanks for reading!  This was written by someone outside of the education profession. I'd appreciate if professionals in education can chime in on my South Korea and Finland anecdotes and my does have/does not haves in my conclusion. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read this topic on another site .. As much as I learnt about this topic is written here . Education of any country depends on peoples living there and their innovative mind . According to this here is some countries which have best education system. 1.Japan : Japan has had the best education system in the world for three straight quarters in a row. The main reason for being at the top is its technology based educational background and a firm investment in its education system with a lot of money being put into it. 2. South Korea : South Korea comes 2nd on the top 20 most educated countries in the world. It is worth noting that South Korea was able to defeat Japan in 3 out of the 5 levels that were looked at in the ranking but just couldn\u2019t out pace Japan. This was mainly due to the fact that Japan has invested more into early childhood education compared to South Korea. 3. United Kingdom :The UK seems to have done quite well in this poll done on September 2013.Of all the European countries, the UK is the only country that was able to make it to the top 10 of the ranking. 4. Singapore : The Singapore education system has continued to impress over the years and is giving the UK education system a run for its money. The country ranks highly in primary education and is thought to be inching closer to beating the UK in terms of quality education. 5. Russia : Their luck of investing in early childhood education has been their major undoing as its the main reason why they are not ranked at the top of the list. Russian education system is simply the best. 6. Finland : It is important that although Finland is considered to have one of the best education systems in the world, it does not rank first in any of the levels that were looked at. Its early childhood enrollment was quite poor a fact that made it miss out on the top 5 ranking. 7. Canada : of all the countries in the world, Canada has the highest rate of college graduates. Although this is quite impressive they tend to overlook the benefits of investing in their children\u2019s education in terms of early childhood education. 8. Netherlands: Netherlands is quite the opposite of all these other countries. They have invested a lot in early childhood development and are ranked quite highly but have not done the same in the other areas.The country has one of the lowest high school graduates hence their poor ranking. 9. Ireland : Ireland has done quite a great job with their education system. If only their government would look into the early years of development of their children and invest in that area they would definitely give the other countries a run for their money. 10. Israel : It is known that Finland has modeled their education system based on that of Israel. This is the main reason why Finland is ranked highly. The only reason why Israel has not been ranked highly is the same as that of other countries i.e not investing in their early childhood education program. 11. China : It is worth noting that China has one of the largest education systems in the whole world. With this fact one cannot help but wonder why their education system is still ranked one of the best considering the high number of students involved. Their major undoing is the low number of students competing high school and poor investment in early childhood education. 12. New Zealand : New Zealand can easily give any of the top 10 ranked countries a run for their money. Their major undoing is their poor primary level test scores. 13. Norway : This is also another country with a great education system. It is only ranked lower due to its poor primary level test scores. 14. Belgium : Belgium was doing so well on their education system until they started decreasing funding to their education sector. 15.Germany : Germany has always ranked highly as a power house as far as education is concerned. However it has seen a steady decline on this area due to its inability to address social change in the country. 16. Denmark : Denmark tends to perform averagely in all levels of education. It has quite a remarkable early childhood education system. 17. Estonia : No one ever thought that this small country could rank higher than even the United States as far as education is concerned. Estonia has an impressive primary and early childhood education system. 18. United States of America : Most people thought that the United States would be able to rank highly due to its financial muscle but this is far from the reality. The US needs to work on their high school graduation rates and their early childhood education in order to rank highly. 19. France : The country has an impressive early childhood education system but it all stops there with years of neglect of other levels of education taking its toll on the education system. 20. Portugal : Portugal closes the list of the top 20 most educated countries in the world. Its high school graduation rate however is still contentious as it has been challenged by the European Union. Best of luck .. Thanks for your support . ",

            "answer_text": "Below are the following countries which tops the ranking for the best education in the World: FINLAND Finland routinely tops rankings of global education systems and is famous for having no banding systems \u2014 all pupils, regardless of ability, are taught in the same classes. As a result, the gap between the weakest and the strongest pupils is the smallest in the world. Finnish schools also give relatively little homework and have only one mandatory test at age 16. South Korea 2015 has seen the rise of South Korea as the number one educational system in the world. It managed to bump its way from the second best to the best system, all in the span of three years. Korea does this for two reasons. First, they believe in working hard. Kids spend seven days of the week in school and are educated thoroughly in everything they study. Secondly, South Korea spends a lot of money on its educational system. The yearly budget for the system is slightly more than 11 billion dollars. The other Asian countries are major competition for South Korea. A noticeable statistic about the South Korean educational system is the country is near 100% literate. 99.2% of males in South Korea are literate while 96.6% of females are literate. Japan A combination of a hard work ethic and technology play a major role in making the Japanese educational system what it is. No other country deploys technology in education to the extent that Japan does. Kids have access to resources that most other students do not, giving them the ability to get answers to some of the most difficult questions. Another focus of the Japanese educational system is extracurricular activities. Sports, chess, and other such clubs have been proven to increase the educational value of a school system. In Japan almost all students participate in at least one club, it is expected of them. Singapore Singapore has one of the best primary education systems in the world. The primary education system is credited for allow Singapore to jump ahead two places on the list of best educational systems. What is most impressive about Singapore\u2019s educational system is that they built it from scratch. Another amazing thing that Singapore does is they shift the focus away from the traditional school tasks of rote memorization and repetition and instead focus on deeper education. Conceptual learning and problem-based education play a major part in their educational system. They want students to solve problems on their own with a teacher there to help, should they get lost in the process. Hong Kong They take a large amount of their education system from the United Kingdom. The educational system is seen over by the Social Welfare Department of the government. Each level of schooling in Hong Kong works together to create an overall educational experience. The literacy rate in Hong Kong is 94.6, still a pretty high number. ",

            "answer_text": "Like a lot of \"best\" questions, there's some problems in answering. \"Best practices\" is very much in the eye of the beholder. I don't teach my students to take tests, but I use innovative and exciting practices. They probably don't score as well on state exams as they might - 95's instead of 98's - and to some, that's a bad thing. Others point to the fact that my students are extremely well prepared for later education and say this is a great thing, indeed. Let's hit the usual suspects and talk about them, though: Finland -  Nordic education is often held up as a shining example of best practices. Students are given a great deal of freedom, can pursue interests, and teachers are held up as shining examples to be emulated. And this is a good system in a lot of ways: So long as your students buy-in, are typical, and non-problematic. The Finnish system is excellent for a largely homogenous country in a relatively small area with a similar culture that values education. In short: the Finnish system is great for Finns. The Finnish system does not shine nearly so well for students who are unusual, largely because they don't have a lot of them. Special needs kids tend, comparatively to other countries, to be underserved. They operate in largely the same ways as other kids, but that won't work so well for them. Rebellious/education-rejecting students are similarly very poorly handled. Finland's \"bright side\" of its education is indeed a shining star of awesome, but their underside is just as dirty as anywhere else. Overall, though, Finland's practices are definitely best for Finland. Top marks. Chinese -  The Chinese education system tends to take a lot of heat in the Western world, but much of it is undeserved. Here's a quick reminder: China has a population of 1.415 BILLION people. Dirty math puts that at quadruple the United States and two hundred and sixty times the population of Finland. Now tell me, Mr.American-Insulter-of-Chinese-Systems, exactly what non-standardized approach you're going to use to individualize the education of the children of ONE. BILLION. PEOPLE. Of course China leans heavily on standardization! You have this many children, that many college seats, and you have to compare these bogglingly large numbers of children from across this huge country: you're going to have to have some standard metrics. China recognizes the value of teaching children to think (contrary to Western media sentiments) and does a decent job of teaching them to think in the Chinese style. China puts tremendous value on testing and the value of tests, and so they shine mightily in that vein. This system, which would be terrible in Finland and is so maligned in the United States, is exactly what China needs. They're still tinkering with it - and so they should - but their system makes sense for them. Their practices are the best for the needs of the Chinese. Top marks. United States The United States model is either brilliant or horrible, depending on which parts you look at, and who's talking about it.  American education loves it some tech these days. Yes, yes it does. In America, a great war is being fought over differentiation vs. standardization, great, country-spanning curriculums and town-specific lesson plans. In essence, we're caught between Finland and China, and we're trying to sample the best of both. At the same time, though, there are a few things in which America positively shines in education, and we frequently forget to celebrate these things: The United States positively kicks ass at teaching atypical children. \"But wait,\" I hear you say. \"What about all these disenfranchised kids, all these special ed kids being neglected, and so on?\" America is a country of misfits, rejects, and oddballs - always has been. Probably always will be. We're very good at handling those cases. The fact that we notice these disenfranchised kids, these special ed kids, etc is one of the strongest signs we care about it. Autism Education is a big deal in the United States, and we're good at it precisely because we aren't satisfied with how good we are at it. The American system also focuses more attention on our Gifted learners than many other countries. Again, we're unhappy with how we treat our Gifted learners despite this. We have a lot of unusual cases here - why that is requires a more formal knowledge than mine - but we're obsessed with dealing with them. It might even be argued that we focus too much on special cases and too little on the mainstream, that we give credence to \"issues\" that perhaps should be told to chin up and soldier on. That's our ugly downside, perhaps. When you live in a melting pot - and make no mistake, we're by far the most culturally diverse (if sometimes painfully so) nation around - you have to learn to deal with all the ingredients that get thrown in the cauldron. American education is about dealing with random rare ingredients. We're good at it. It works for us. So, in that regard, our system is what's best for Americans. We are absolutely tinkering with it - self-improvement is an American obsession - but it's still the best way we've found for our neurotic nation. Top marks. You see? Best practices is a very regional (maybe even class-by-class) term. What's the school you want to apply the practices like? What does its culture value? What are the goals of the people you're trying to teach? What do their parents want for their children? Finland's best practices would be a disaster in China. The Chinese system of special education would be illegal in the United States. The American standard classroom gives the Finnish teacher nightmares to wake them at any hour. Yet each country prospers under its own method. Best practices requires knowing your student - that's something I suspect all three countries would agree upon. Know your student, bring your student's needs to the front, and do what's best for the learning. ",

The best thinking often happens when ideas, fields, disciplines collide, in a Clash of Civilizations. (3) But, is US tertiary education overrated? I have a Professor pal with impeccable Ivies credentials.

            "answer_text": " When considering which countries have the best education systems, one has to take into account various factors. Overall literacy and graduation rates are important. Also, how many grades are publicly funded and free for students to attend? Countries on top of this list also have high rates of graduates going on to higher degrees. Here is a list of the five countries that rank among the best education systems in the world. Finland: What puts this Scandinavian country on the top of the list of best education systems? Among other things their system does well: free school meals through all grades, well-respected teachers, and a \u201clearn through play\u201d strategy of education. Not only do they have consistently high literacy rates (99% in 2018) and grade completion, but they also have good student/teacher ratios. In 2014, Finland averaged about 13 students per teacher in primary school. Finland is the model for public education.Japan: Japan\u2019s famously rigorous teaching system starts early, and Japanese students spend more time in the classroom than any other country\u2019s students. Japanese students consistently place higher in standardized testing, but that may be a function of the competitive school culture rather than focusing on student needs. High school is not mandatory, but the enrollment rate is 98%. In order to get into the competitive high schools, many Japanese students prepare for the entrance exams in after-school prep. It\u2019s not surprising that Japan has a 99% literacy rate, but did you know they also have a 99.99% school attendance rate? Students do not skip class in this highly competitive culture.South Korea: While statistics are virtually unknown for their North Korean counterparts, the South Korean system ranks among the top systems for education. Education is highly emphasized in South Korean culture. Children spend 16 hours a day learning, combining school with after-school prep classes. They also spend almost two months more in school per year than Americans. South Korea has the highest high school graduation rate (97%) and the highest college graduation rate in the world (69%).Denmark: This country is often recognized among the best systems in Europe, with 99% literacy. While Denmark tends to rank lower on such metrics as resource availability, it has shown improvement in its learning environment. It has done this by lowering student/teacher ratios and increasing its focus on younger students earlier in their development. Not only is college education free in Denmark, but Denmark grants its college students a $1,000/month stipend for living expenses.Norway: This country rounds out the top five countries with the best education systems. Norway has achieved great strides like Denmark in recent years, taking a page from its neighbors and increasing student to teacher ratios. They boast a ratio as low as one instructor for ten students, and have a stellar literacy rate (99% in 2018). Norway reformed its education system in 2006, making I.T. (information technology) a compulsory subject. Most counties offer students specializing in I.T. in upper secondary school a free laptop.",

            "answer_text": "The 11 best school systems in the world.. Every year, the World Economic Forum releases its Global Competitiveness Report on the state of the world's economies. The WEF looks at data on areas as varied as the soundness of banks to the sophistication of businesses in each country. It then uses the data to compile a picture of the economy of almost every country on earth. Countries were ranked according to the \"12 pillars of competitiveness,\" which includes macro-economic environment, infrastructure, health and primary education, and labour market efficiency. =9. Japan: 5.6 Japan is one of the top performing countries for literacy, science, and maths in the OECD group. Students go through six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, and three years of high school before deciding whether they want to go to university. High school is not compulsory but enrolment is close to 98%. 9. Barbados: 5.9 The Barbados government has invested heavily in education, resulting in a literacy rate of 98%, one of the highest in the world. Primary runs from 4 to 11, with secondary 11 to 18. The majority of schools at both levels are state-owned and run =9. New Zealand: 5.6 Primary and secondary education in New Zealand runs from aged 5 to aged 19, with school compulsory between 6 and 16. There are three types of secondary schools in New Zealand: state schools educate approximately 85% of students, state-integrated schools \u2014 private schools that have been integrated into the state but keep their special charter \u2014 educate 12%, and private schools educate 3%. 8. Estonia: 5.7 Estonia spends around 4% of its GDP on education, according to 2015 figures. The country's 1992 Education Act says that the goals of education are \"to create favourable conditions for the development of personality, family and the Estonian nation; to promote the development of ethnic minorities, economic, political and cultural life in Estonia and the preservation of nature in the global economic and cultural context; to teach the values of citizenship; and to set up the prerequisites for creating a tradition of lifelong learning nation-wide.\" =6. Ireland: 5.8 The majority of secondary schools in Ireland are privately owned and managed but state-funded, but there are also state comprehensives and vocational schools. However, a recent report shows that Ireland's spending on education fell 15% behind the developed world during the height of the financial crisis, 2008 to 2013, suggesting its education system could suffer in future. =6. Qatar: 5.8 The BBC reported in 2012 that oil-rich Qatar was \"becoming one of the most significant players in the field of education innovation, supporting a raft of projects from grassroots basic literacy through to high-end university research.\" The country is investing heavily in improving educational standards as part of its Vision 2030 programme to make the country self-sufficient. Government-funded schools offer free education but only to Qatari citizens and most foreign nationals tend to send their children to private schools 5. Netherlands: 5.9 Dutch children were found to be the happiest in the world in a 2013 Unicef study, leading the way globally educational well-being among others. Schools typically don't give much homework until secondary level and students report little pressure and stress. Schools are divided between faith schools and \"neutral\" state schools, with only a small number of private schools. 4. Singapore: 6.1 Singapore scores incredibly highly in the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) tests, which aim to measure and compare the performance of students across different countries. However, the school system also has a reputation as being a pressure cooker, putting students under a lot of stress at a young age. =2. Belgium: 6.2 Belgium has four different genres of secondary schools, namely general secondary schools, technical secondary schools, vocational secondary education schools, and art secondary education institutions. The Fulbright Commission in the US, which organises student exchanges with Belgium and Luxembourg says: \"Education enjoys high priority, and the largest share of the regional governments\u2019 annual budget in Belgium. Complete systems of public and private schools are available to all children between the ages of 4 and 18, at little or no cost.\" =2. Switzerland: 6.2 Just 5% of children attend private schools in Switzerland. Lessons are taught in different languages depending on the region of Switzerland, with German, French or Italian the most common languages of instruction. From secondary onwards students are separated by ability. 1. Finland: 6.7 Finland routinely tops rankings of global education systems and is famous for having no banding systems \u2014 all pupils, regardless of ability, are taught in the same classes. As a result, the gap between the weakest and the strongest pupils is the smallest in the world. Finnish schools also give relatively little homework and have only one mandatory test at age 16. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends entirely on how you define and measure the data and in which year you sample that data. Do you mean \u201chigh school graduation rates\u201d?

(Finland in 2014 seemed to be the best in Europe, though there\u2019s no good world-wide system to compare it to.)Do you mean schools that produce the highest number of employed majors in artistic fields? (Australia in 2016).Do you mean which country\u2019s schools have the highest ranks in parental satisfaction in children\u2019s education? The best qualified teachers? (Finland in 2017 was #1 in both categories. That country, incidentally, requires teachers to have two full degrees and has ferociously competitive teacher-training in which only about one-third of the best education majors will ever be allowed to teach.)Do you mean which country\u2019s colleges are perceived as most prestigious worldwide based on surveys? (the USA in 2016)Do you mean in terms of international test scores? (Finland bounces between #1-#3 internationally each year, as has done so for 15 years).Do you mean STEM education? (Singapore scored highest in PISA Worldwide rankings on math and science tests in 2016, followed by Japan and Estonia, but other years had different results)Do you mean overall literacy rates? (South Korea, Ukraine, and Russia largely tied here in 2017)Do you mean which country produces the most patents and nobel prizes? (United States in 2018)Do you mean which country scores highest on critical thinking tests and information literacy? (Finland in 2014).Each one of those questions ends up with a different answer, so what do you consider the best sign of education? The percentage of the population that completes a degree? The ones that score highest on tests? The countries with highest literacy rates? Whatever you prioritize will end up bouncing the rankings around, as will the year in which you gather the data, since this fluctuates slowly over the course of time. Even in the cases above, the difference between first, second, and third is usually a single percentage point or two, so I\u2019m not sure any ranking is particularly meaningful. Finally, education systems that tend to prioritize one type of education are often fairly weak in others. The pattern frequently seems to be: STEM, reading literacy, art, or creativity\u2014pick one. The other skillsets then tend to fall by the wayside. ",

            "answer_text": "Top Countries With Best Education System Each country strives to offer its kids the most effective achievable begin in life. It does this by aiming to build the best education system it possibly can. As a part of this endeavor, they rely on strong educational policies, committed stakeholders, and the potential of students. It takes many hands to create a successful educational experience for students. Over the years, the following countries have consistently been ranked as having the best education system in the world: United States of America  The United States of America is one of the foremost common academic destinations in the world for aspiring students of all categories \u2013 from K-12 to university education. This is because it has the best education system one could ask for on many fronts \u2013 from attracting the best teachers to accessible public education give for free, to even creating healthy competition amongst students. The United States continues to be a top choice for students aiming to get into grad school, especially, thanks to their status as having the best education system. United Kingdom  The United Kingdom has long been touted as having the best education system in the world \u2013 starting off in the age-old days when children from other universities would be sent off to England for higher studies. Now the United Kingdom uses modern teaching methods and focusing on the diverse needs of a growing population along with addressing labor market demands to maintain its status in world rankings for the best education system. Germany  It is considered the top study destination for non-English speakers of the world. Also, it is considered as the third most popular study destination after the US and the UK. Almost every major city of Germany is home to at least one world-class university. 13 German universities make to the world\u2019s top 250 and 30 in the top 500. This itself is enough to place Germany amongst the world\u2019s best education providers. Low tuition fees, excellent post-graduate job opportunities, different scholarships schemes and high-quality life are some of the factors which makes it a favorite amongst the higher education aspirants. Also, home to some of the world\u2019s oldest universities, Germany is considered as the hub of innovation and world-class discoveries. Finland  Finland has been ranked as having the best education system time and time again. Their methods are often unusual when looking at those of other countries \u2013 there are no score bands, class sizes are small and children\u2019s well-being are prioritized over just quantitative metrics. Japan  Japan has consistently produced great which has resulted in it being thought of as having the best education system by many analytics. But unlike a lot of countries that may show great test scores, Japan does a great job of balancing the effects of student pressure and producing good student results. Canada  Canada is becoming an increasingly popular choice for students seeking to experience the best education system in the world. This is especially the case for students you might find the United States of America and the United Kingdom too competitive or too expensive. Canada becomes a viable option for those seeking to learn from the best education system in the world while also not necessarily going down the traditional route of choosing America or the United Kingdom for their studies.

            "answer_text": "This answer has been edited in response to some comments that were made. I have stressed certain elements early one to expedite matters, as this answer does against the grain of the established propaganda. It is a tough sell to be a contrarian like Galileo Galilei was, but I feel the public deserves the full story. There is a lot of marketing involved in the idea that Finland has the best educational system in the world. I am sure the Finnish government (like all governments would) uses this as a way to show that they are doing something great. Maybe they are, but as I will try to demonstrate, it is not so easy peasy or, if you allow the small pun, easy pisa. Sure, the PISA tests demonstrate that students are doing well. But, are they really the best and why is it really? Everyone wants a winner and be proud. However, the marketing of the educational success of Finland usually does not talk about the most important factor that has nothing to do about educational practices or programs. Finnish is one of the easiest languages to learn to read and to spell. (English could be too, but it would require smart managers and it should be phased in over one or two generations. Roosevelt, Shaw, Carnegie saw the need. Capitalism stopped the idea and it was badly implemented, but maybe it is time to revisit the idea.) Finnish grammar, which is not as simple as its orthography, does not affect learning to read and spell early on. One can argue that the learning of the cases becomes quite intuitive for a native-Finnish speaker as one ears those cases used day in and day out. (Similarly, no one has to teach/learn most of the most irregular French verbs and forms [or English past tense verbs] as children are constantly bombarded hearing them). Finnish grammar (in its intricacies, in its finest details, in its irregularities) is learned/taught after students have finished learning to decode letters, syllables, words, and finally internalized the whole into a more logographic recall. Facts are that the Finnish language has an extraordinary easy orthography. First, very few supporters will ever admit that their language is one of the major reasons why they are successful. Politicians and bureaucrats will ride the wave, milk all they can from that kind of success. Finnish orthography is almost never mentioned in any of the \u201cliterature\u201d extolling Finland and its success with the PISA tests. To me this is the sign of an overzealous marketer (or politician or bureaucrat who wants to keep his or her job). Many do it and in many countries. Why not? It is a great job with great fringe benefits. One very important reason is that Finnish has a very simple and regular spelling system. Let me explain.  Regularizing the English Spelling System Second, Swedish-speaking Finns do not do as well on PISA tests as the Finnish-speaking Finns, who (the latter) come from a lower and less educated demographic group. (This is all explained at Regularizing the English Spelling System. \u201cTo correlate international literacy assessment scores (literacy) with the phonemicity of a language is a complex proposition since many other factors interfere. Yet, it is interesting that Finnish students, who use one of the most phonemic languages of all European languages, top the chart. Yet, Canadian students are not far behind! Surely, there are other compensatory factors at work in elevating the scores of the Canadian students, but at what ... cost! Literally! Maybe the educational system in Finland is vastly superior and its success has nothing to do with its language? To help us answer some of those questions, a great analysis was done here, but it does have a few shortcomings which I will explore later on. Background Finnish students tend to score very high on many literacy assessments and consistantly so (PISA 2003 and 2006,...) and one might just wonder why! Conversely, English-speaking students from Canada, Australia, New Zealand do well too! BUT, the devil is in the detail! For instance, Finnish students receive only 3 hours of formal education per day whereas Canadian students, for instance, receive 4.5 hours a day. (1) That's 50% more! Moreover, Finnish students start school at age 7. Students in Canada start at age 5 (on average)! 2 more years is a great head start, especially at that age. But, maybe, it would not be necessary if English was not such a difficult language to learn!Some people argue that starting students too early is the problem. A lot of the scientific data seems to point out that those are the times when children are the most malleable and can learn so many things. So, the idea of starting students later seems counter-intuitive and counter to all the scientific data. Certainly, it seems that Finnish students are getting less education, not more. So, Finnish students go to school fewer hours per day and start later and they still do better than most other students from other countries! How do they do it? Maybe it is not a matter of quantity, but more a matter of quality? Apparently, they have highly educated teachers (with Master's degree). Canada has that too! They must plan Individual Education programs for students. Canadian teachers do that too. Teachers are highly respected in Finland. Well, not so, in Canada where teachers are often ridiculed for not working long hours --or so it seems! The curriculum guides are quite different: the Finnish one being more general in its scope (3). \"For example, a typical middle school teacher in Finland teaches just less than 600 hours annually, corresponding to about four 45-minute lessons a day. In the United States, by contrast, a teacher at the same level devotes 1,080 hours to teaching over 180 school days as shown in Figure 2 (OECD, 2008). This means that a middle school teacher in the United States, on average, devotes about twice as much time to classroom teaching compared with his or her counterpart in Finland. This, however, does not imply that teachers in Finland work less than they do elsewhere. An important\u2014and still voluntary\u2014part of Finnish teachers\u2019 work is devoted to the improvement of classroom practice, the school as a whole, and work with the community. Because Finnish teachers take on significant responsibility for curriculum and assessment, as well as experimentation.\" (Ibid) Finland has --up to this time-- a very homogeneous student population, with very few second language learner. Canada (and many other countries) have a good portion of their student population that are second-language learners. Many have heard how well 15 year old Finns do on international tests (PISA). Many have linked this success to a host of factors and, while it is hard to argue that some of these factors must not help, a few people have also remarked that there is one more element that makes the Finns remarkable: a reliable and regular spelling system, whereby one letter is linked to one sound (or phoneme). However, because there are so many factors that come into play in evaluating a school system, how could one be certain that this \"feature\" does indeed play a role in their success? As luck would have it, there are Swedish-speakers in Finland. Swedish-speaking and Finnish-speaking Students In Finland, there are 2 linguistic communities. The Swedish-speaking kids (SS) and the Finnish-speaking kids (FS). Fortunately for us, both groups receive \"exactly\" the same kind of education: same trained teachers, same programs, same testing,... The major difference between the 2 groups is the language they use. It is worth noting that Swedish does not have as regular a spelling system as Finnish. Actually, the SS group has other characteristics that make the case even more compelling. This group apparently has the upper-middle class characteristics, which is usually associated with better educational outcomes, because they have better educated parents, access to more money to get tutoring, and many other advantages that the average middle-class FS kids would not have. In other words, we have a pretty strong controlled experiment here where we can evaluate how language affects educational outcomes. Swedish-speaking Finns VS Finnish-speaking Finns The only analysis that was done on this between Swedish-speaking Finns and Finnish-speaking Finns was done by Taksin Nuoret, a university student (apparently, ... because no one knows for sure who he is). Regardless, his comparison has not been challenged. And while it is not perfect, IMHO, there are many parts that are valuable. In his analysis (http://finnish-and-pisa.blogspot.ca/), the notion that an easy spelling system helps kids learn is compelling, considering we have close to a perfect controlled experiment as we could hope. \" \"In PISA 2003 Finnish-speaking students clearly outperformed their Swedish-speaking peers in scientific literacy, with an average difference of 26 points. However, also the Swedish-speaking minority was doing very well, since their results were on a par with those of the Netherlands.\" Moreover, \"20,8% of the Finnish students who took part in PISA 2003 were Swedish-speaking, that is, much more than the share of the Swedish-speaking population (which was 5,55% in 2003). [...] This means that the PISA 2003 results of the Finnish-speaking students are actually even higher than those reported for the whole country (since the results reported for the whole country include results of both linguistic communities).\" If one wants to do the same kind of research for other years, they can do it, but at this time, I don't have the time. A Few Errors Although the morphological and Estonian arguments support the thesis, they weaken it in a way! He points out that Estonian kids do better than many other kids from other countries on PISA! It is actually not that surprising, since Estonian and Finnish have the same characteristics: an easy spelling system. However, comparing Estonian's success and Finnish success is interesting, but weak since there are too many variables at work. The same thing can be said when he tries to compare the ranking of countries that have \"phonetic\" spelling systems, like Spain and Italy, against countries that have a complex spelling system, like English. Like with Estonia, there are too many variables that come into play. Since students of these countries did not do as well as, say, English speaking students, then he generalises and states that the \"correlation between spelling and Pisa results is weak\". But, Italian and Spanish educational systems are vastly different than Canadian or Australian systems. Are the school budgets in Italy the same as the ones in Canada? How many hours are devoted to language or spelling studies in Canadian schools compared to Italian schools? What is the teacher to student ratio? What is the support ratio? How about training or pay? What is the teaching load (as in marking expectations, types of tests, ...)? How about parent involvement, literacy, expectations,...? There are, in other words, so many factors that could tip the scale and compensate for the shortcoming of a difficult spelling system AND --likewise-- factors that could cause poor results. It is worth noting that the PISA test takes place at age 15, at which time, English-speaking students (and others) have had plenty of time to learn how to read all of those crazy words and memorize them --by hook or by crook-- as logograms. If Estonia had another linguistic community as Finland has, then the comparison would be more valid, trustworthy, and reliable. Still, it is an interesting point that Estonia's should not do as well educationally as \"richer\" (more developped) Western nations, based on several economic matrices, but it did! Sadly, recent results have not been duplicated! The Finnish morphology argument in Mr. Nuoret's analysis is simple and quite intuitive too. He feels that the simple use of prefixes and suffixes (lexemes) across all of the lexicon, with regularity, makes learning the language fasdter and easier. Many Western languages have a mix of Greek and Latin suffixes that make learning to read more complicated. This is a very simple concept. Again, simplicity and regularity are key. It is hard to argue against such a simple concept! FINAL NOTE The issue of whether or not a spelling system can affect the ability to learn a language is only as good as the inference that one can make from a set of data and variables that you can --or cannot-- control. Fortunately, the SS to FS comparison is strong, since many variables are being controlled. It is true that many speakers learn to read and spell in English. In fact, on the PISA test Canadian students and SS students perform just as well. The Canadian system and the SS conditions are similar, with similar educational conditions and languages that have their challenges.That Finnish-speaking Finns do much better than their Swedish-speaking counterparts (and kids from other countries like kids from Commonwealth countries) who have complex spelling systems demonstrates that a complex spelling system like English has is likely to challenge learning. It does not make it impossible! There are compelling evidence that it delays learning too. In other words, there are no compelling evidence that we can find that proves that a complex spelling system is an advantage. Finnish has its challenges though! Many of his words are much longer ... to read, for instance! Dr. yule also points out that some of the differences between some phonemes are so minor that some learners find it hard to distinguish them. But, all the data shows that Finnish is a much easier language to learn than English and by a long shot, according to Dr. Yule's analysis. So, this is one more evidence --and a very strong one at that--that spelling does matter. Intuitively, most human beings would understand that a reliable spelling system would make learning to read QUICKER. Again, millions of people can read, have learned to read English. That is not the point. The point is that if the English spelling system was made more regular, learning to read (and spell) would be faster and also much easier, something that educators around the world strive for. ",

I am currently now in India. I moved here after attending a month and a half of high school(Grade 9). I am in my final year engineering, in an okay college affiliated to the University of Mumbai. I will divide each experience as per the following:  a. Environment b. Teachers c. Education System Overall 1. Experience in Abu Dhabi: a . My dad is rich. My friend's Dad is rich. Everyone is rich (At least everyone's parents were earning a good salary). we get everything we want So why study?There was absolutely no competition and the need to study.Who wants to study when you have birthdays, friends' parents' anniversary to attend, dad's new luxury car to drive, visit the amazing malls, spend money\u200b etc? b. The teachers teach at low salaries. They don't have proper qualifications and come on their husbands visa. I studied in a private \"reputed\" school that was affiliated to the CBSE board. So I wonder what its like in less reputed schools. c. The education system is not good. Its not competitive and you don't really learn a lot. Studying 3 hrs a day is what you'd call a sincere serious student. 2. Experience in Canada I lived in Mississauga in Grade 4 then moved to Burlington, grade 5 to grade 8. I attended one and half a month of high school. a. It was tough at the beginning. My dressing sense was horrible and I took A LOT of time trying to fit in. I didnt wear deodarant, I didnt have a bf, heck I didnt even know what a crush was. And I was in grade 4. But I was the smartest, geekiest, looser who wore glasses and was \"ugly\". But I improved gradually. No glasses, lots of deodorant, makeup. A lot of importance is given to way you look and present yourself. You always want to fit into the cool, popular, rich group. You want to be one of those pretty girls who get a lot of attention from hot guys. b. The teachers are very nice and friendly and know what they teach perfectly. Well, there wasn't much to teach anyways. Most of what was taught, I had already learned in Abu Dhabi. It was a breeze.  c. The education system makes us students think and analyse. Enough time is given for assignments and you are not allowed to plagiarize. There are a wide variety of actives, that allow you to discover yourself. Choir, orchestra, cross country, silver birch, movie making club, sports like lacrosse, basketball, volley ball, EVERYTHING. The list is way longer when you get into high school. A lot of reading activities are conducted. We had reading buddies. Grade 6 students were to teach 1st Graders how to read. It was fun.  For science, everything was done practically, slowly so that everyone could understand. Videos and presentations were shown to us regularly. We had many science projects. Ex. Surface Tension: We were given 150gms of clay. We had to build a boat that can float on water and hold marbles. It was intresting and fun. It was a competition actually. We formed groups, and the boat that could hold the most number of marbles won. I won, I used my sandwich bag, put clay into it, ran hot water, and rolled it out using a pencil. It was flat, thin, had the largest amount of surface area. :D Language was pretty difficult for me. I am not a creative writer. I remember this one project, we had to choose a book to read and present the summary. I read one of the Harry Potter books, I don't remember which one, and I put up a puppet show. I believe I got an A-, I bet it was because of the puppet show. I was used to getting B+ in language. In grade 5, my group mates and I were to choose a fairy tale and give it an alternate ending, and then enact it. Music class was awesome. I played the baritone. I loved playing it. I brought it home to practice. I also joined choir. Gym. I hated it at times. I was and never will be good at sports, except basketball. I was always the last person to get picked on a team. Sad. I know. But I did make it to the basketball team in grade 6. Best experience of my life.I also participated in cross country.  Math was a subject I loved. I got an A in every single test. It was so easy.  French is Canada's second language. I loved it, because of the teacher who taught me. She was so kind. Madame Mc Rae. Gosh, I miss her. She would talk about India and her love for samosa's. I got her a samosa once, she loved it.  History and Geography. Honestly, I don't know what we did during that class. I remember maps, and me and my friend used to talk a lot. Never listened to the teacher aha. **Sorry Ms Kennedy. Art. My favorite subject. Ace'ed EVERY project/assignment. My work was put around my school. We had to use clay to draw a picture. I choose to draw a beach. I used fine lines, and different techniques to make sand look like sand, the ocean to look like an ocean. I put in a lot of effort in art. It still is my favorite subject. Here are a couple pictures on how we were evaluated:   \u200b\u200b We had to make our own newspaper with different articles as our English project.    \u200b\u200b Math project. We had to design an amusment park, and then calculate the total area of the park. I used a variety of shapes, and sizes.   \u200b\u200b   \u200b\u200b Science test that I aced. But later flunked Indian science. I got 1/10, in my first physics test. But in the next semester a 9/10. Getting that paper was THE best moment.   \u200b\u200b  \u200b\u200b In french, in this project, we had to think of our own world, make a picture of it, and then explain it. I made my own ice cream world :D  3. Experience in India a. India is very very competitive. We start right from the morning. Competition at the bus stop, competition when buying vegetables. We see a wide variety of people. People who are rich poor middle class, all types. Everyone wants a good career and job. Hence Huge competition in academics. Entrance exams! That is all that's on a students mind. Extra curricular activities are a waste of time. You can do that after you get into a top college, read IIT. b. The teachers are different. They are strict and intimidating. It took me a while to get used to the teachers here. Most of them know their stuff. c. Indian education is tough. I had joined ICSE and it was even more tough. My physics sir asked me what I learnt in science in Grade 9. I told him the water cycle. He laughed and told me I have to work real hard.  I did. I I still work hard just to keep in pace with the average students, let alone the \"topper\".   Indian Education focuses on rote learning. Too many assignments are given and hence everyone plagiarizes, and learn nothing. Everyone wants marks. That's what important. Everyone wants to be an engineer or a doctor. We are not allowed to think, think of what we want or like. Mind you, I like engineering though.  But in India, everyone knows the basics of science and mathematics. Everyone is intelligent. Every one studies hard for those last 2 days before an exam.  I graduated elementary high with an honor in Math in grade 8 (Canada), in grade 9, I failed Indian Math. But then I worked hard and passed. I was used to finding the area of a square in Grade 8, suddenly in garde 9, I had to memorize (a+b)^2, and a whole bunch of difficult formulas. In semester 4 of my 4 year long engineering course, I got a 71. I improved. In Canada, my teacher took 5, 30 minute periods to explain surface tension, and to complete the whole project, perfectly. Indian teachers, \"explain\" a whole chapter in 30 minutes. Eg. Indian teachers explain 10 concepts Students grasp 5, and are unclear with 2 and have no clue with 3. Indian students learn more. Instead of learning 1 concept, they learn so much more.  Most Indian students memorize and have their concepts crystal clear. Even though we are memorizing equations and cramming a lot of information into our minds, and working hard, its great in the long run. At our workplaces, we know overall how everything works.  Indian students don't work on projects. They copy everything from Wikipedia, or different websites. Indian students don't \"waste\" time thinking. Someone has already done so much research, just copy it. I remember my history project for internal marks. I dyed my papers with tea, burnt the sides to give it a vintage effect, and then I wrote information on it. I used gel pens, color pencils everything. I put a lot of effort. But people who didn't put in as much effort and time as me, still got very high marks. In India, everyone get's internal marks (marks that the school gives and not an external who corrects your exams.) I learnt that in grade 10, and wasted no time in projects. I didn't waste my time being creative.   I remember getting 2 periods of gym in a year. Teachers think it is a waste of time \"playing\". Studying is so much more important. Memorizing that math formula and getting that extra mark to beat your competitor is so much important. Gaining weight, looking and feeling confident can take a back seat until you get into the best college, and then the best job and a great life.  All Indian students do is study(not all, most). In Canada we had lessons on security(A lady constable was called and she gave everyone tips.), on sex (Grade 6), drugs (we were put in different situations and were asked to react to those. I was asked if I'd like to try \"drugs\", and I said no, and gave a stern look. The constable said I said \"No\", correctly. :D )  I still think Indian Education is the best. Like I said before, Indian students learn more. Yes, many Indians are not confident, Most of us don't have a great dressing sense, don't know how to play instruments, but most Indian Students are intelligent, have a great memory and always are willing to learn, at any point of their life.  Also, when you are from India, you can probably adjust to most countries. Places like UAE, London, Canada, USA are so much more cleaner and aesthetically designed. UPDATE: So I see a lot of comments telling me that they see a bit of sarcasm, and that my answer is biased and flawed.  I think math and science is everywhere, in daily life. You buy stuff, you deposit money in a bank. In India, profit loss shares dividend simple interest, compound interest, balance credit, is taught from the early ages. This is not taught in Canada. I learnt simple interest in grade 8 in canada. Principal, rate and time is give, you just calculate the Simple intrest. No tricky sums, nothing.  Didn't you see how easily I got 15/15 in that science test. It was a piece of cake. I wrote practically 1 sentence and to the point answers and aced it. I thought I was the smartest person on earth. I came to India, and I got 1/10. I am trying to point out how slow paced the Canadian system is. I am trying to say, in India we learn so much and is much more superior to any other system, I believe. Indian students get over with the hard difficult stuff first. Then we explore different areas like makeup, fashion etc. Indian students, all of them, know how a bank functions. Know how your money gets interest. Indian students know what fixed deposit is. In Canada only commerce students might know that, but whatever they do specialize in, know everything clearly. But people in Canada who haven't taken up commerce will have to go to the people who have taken commerce and ask them for guidance. Indian's dont need this guidance. They can take their own basic decision's. Although, if they still want to organize more efficiently, they can ask finicial advisors etc. But I'm trying to say, that we have the basic, practical knowledge. When there is a sale, Indians are quick in finding out the discount and are quick in taking a decision. As a whole, Indian students are knowledgeable. This is why I feel the Indian education system is much more superior to any other system. **This answer was written on 24 Dec 2013.

            "answer_text": "Well, \u201cbest\u201d is a strange term. As has been said centuries before, \u201cif you would argue with me then define your terms.\u201d In the current Indian context \u201cbest\u201d could be defined as the education system that leads to the most prosperity but prosperity without ethics is an unruly beast as the PRC will begin to increasingly discover. It is interesting that in both China and India large numbers of multimillionaires are leaving for overseas - mostly for the US. Does that make the US the \u201cbest\u201d education system. I think few would dispute the energy and vitality of the best universities in the US but many even in the US are unhappy with the school system. Indeed many see the rise of President Trump as a nail in the coffin of US education - though I would personally disagree. So what should an education system seek to achieve. I can find no better definition than what Yang and Damasio - both amazing neuroscientists - have written. I quote,\u201dThe more people develop and educate themselves, the more they refine their behavioral and cognitive options. In fact,one could argue that the chief purpose of education is to cultivate children\u2019s building of repertoires of cognitive and behavioral strategies and options, helping them to recognize the complexity of situations and to respond in increasingly flexible, sophisticated, and creative ways. In our view, out of these processes of recognizing and responding, the very processes that form the interface between cognition and emotion, emerge the origins of creativity\u2014the artistic, scientific, and technological innovations that are unique to our species. Further, out of these same kinds of processing emerges a special kind of human innovation: the social creativity that we call morality and ethical thought.\u201d It is not a paragraph you will easily absorb but try reading at first only the bold bits and then try to read the entire paragraph. Not too dissimilar are the views of Howard Gardner, famed HGSE professor and the father of MI or Multiple Intelligences, who in his book Five Minds for the future, cites these five minds as: The Disciplined Mind - You have to have a discipline or a topic of expertise or else you will merely be working for those who have one. The Synthesizing Mind - We are being inundated with information. If you cannot put the essential bits together to create your own mind, then the future will be a difficult thing for you. The Creating Mind - This will help you keep one step ahead of the robots. The Respectful Mind - If you are not prepared to understand others points of view but merely seek to put them down, that will likely presage a pessimistic future. This is what happened in the Danish Cartoonist\u2019s case and we will probably see it happen in the case of our JNUs and Ramjas College instances. The Ethical Mind - Gardner explains it best,\u201d This mind conceptualizes how work can serve purposes beyond self-interest and how members of society can work unselfishly to improve the lot of all.\u201d Try to see how Yang and Damasio describe how the origins of morality and ethics stem from the ability of our children to ,\u201drecognize the complexity of situations and to respond in increasingly flexible, sophisticated, and creative ways.\u201d Also try to see how Yang and Damasio connect this same process to the development of Morality and Ethics. You will then understand why corruption is endemic in our country. Back to your question, where can we get the best education. Reggio Emilio in Italy is an interesting experiment since the war where parents got together as a community to make the education of children a common cause. When will that happen in our communities? When will our politicians learn to increase the budget for education and decrease it for weapons? As the old song goes - When will they ever learn? ",

            "answer_text": "Hi The countries that produce good results in the traditional old fashioned areas of learning are more likely to be countries such as Japan, China, Uganda, the Philippines, Malaysia. These are countries I have some knowledge of. I worked with many adult students who taught in their own country but came to Australia where their teaching qualifications weren\u2019t recognised. Consequently the Tasmanian State Education Department recruited them as teacher aides and I taught those teachers. This is what I learned from the many I taught: The students work very hard and put in long hours. Good results are expected. It is a tight curriculum and in places like Sudan where there are schools for people awaiting settlement to a new country people of all ages might be in one class as that\u2019s the level they are at. You can have a 60 year old alongside a 7 year old and both, depending on opportunity or lack thereof, study the same work. There is a lot of marking to do but almost all are taught is through ROTE learning. It relies on memory and includes such strategies as times table. This right/wrong assessment is favoured by many people, including government ministers, as it gives clear results and makes teachers more accountable (in their view). Those who are actually part of the Education System in Australia and, I imagine but don\u2019t know, know that this is not the best way of teaching. Why? Because students in countries that foster teaching by rote aren\u2019t being taught to think. I know an inventor who couldn\u2019t get his \u2018Seawing\u2019 project into the market in Australia but based purely on his ability to think and design something from scratch he was employed to work in Singapore. His only job was to think. Apparently the curriculum is so regimented there that people aren\u2019t used to thinking laterally or applying their knowledge to invent something new. The reasons people who aren\u2019t in schools prefer rote learning is because it\u2019s either right or not - and it\u2019s easy to score. On the other hand it\u2019s hard to measure thinking apart from its absence. That\u2019s when you notice. It\u2019s misunderstood by people who aren\u2019t educators and who learned by rote themselves. Imagine then that you\u2019ve learned your times tables - invariably up to 12x12. What do you do when you have to multiply 13x17 quickly. Probably use your phone - not a bad strategy, but shouldn\u2019t we be taught to calculate more than 12x12=144. I didn\u2019t learn tables and I recently found out my son didn\u2019t either. I asked him how he knew an answer. Like me he calculated it almost instantly. For example we both seem to work it out this way: I work out 3x17 is 21+30 (51) or just 3x17= 51 in my head. Then I add it to 170. I get 221 almost instantly. When I calculate within the 12 x table I do the same. I see 9x7 as 3x7 then triple to make 63. It\u2019s just as quick but doesn\u2019t have a boundary of 12 maximum. What I\u2019m saying is that learning the tables can be a limited strategy - limited by 12. It takes higher order thinking to invent a way to do it that is your way. Tables are a useful tool for division and subtraction and many other operations, but they are just that - a tool. What we need to do in real life is apply that to everyday situations. So it\u2019s better to ask a student to work out how many tiles they would need to make a particular pattern on a floor 15metres x 10metres. They have to take into account tile size, extra tiles if the pattern is like a herringbone and may need to be halved. So, the question becomes an open question rather than a right/wrong answer. If the student can show their working out and justify it they have not only consolidated their maths problem, but they are looking at it and applying it or creating something new with it. If you refer to Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy \u2018remember\u2019 or recall is the lowest level of thinking. Creation is the highest level of thinking - there are levels between. By opening a problem out students produce work at higher levels. Learning tables is never going to be more than recall. So mathematics becomes numeracy when applied to open ended problems. You\u2019re not limiting what they can do. Students are less likely to be bored if they have to explain how they did it. We\u2019ve only talked about Times tables but this applies to all areas of the curriculum. But, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to mark and many teachers have to create a Rubric (a marking grid that should be available to students so that they know what the criteria are) in order to see where that student is. Likewise English needs to become language. It\u2019s about more than reading and writing- it\u2019s about writing for a purpose, text types - eg persuasive writing, narrative, argument, discussion etc. Students learn to use those spelling tools into fluent writing for a purpose- once again difficult to assess without a rubric. My university used rubrics so I knew what I had to do to get a top mark. Students want that too. Actually even in grade 2 they love it if you write the day\u2019s planning on the board. Certainly the schools who take this approach to learning and get away from \u2018talk and chalk\u2019 are teaching students to think. They\u2019re teaching them to apply their learning and create new work. This is the most fundamental difference between the systems of teaching. Thinking takes a Teacher much longer to plan but the results can be outstanding. The biggest difference my adult students noticed in the classroom was that students talked, worked in group or pairs, and walked around. This was totally opposed to how they\u2019d taught. They weren\u2019t allowed to share by talking. They had up to 200 students in a classroom and very few resources in the camps. Rote teaching was the only way to keep on top of the progress of students. In Australia we have smaller class sizes. I also had a parent who had home-taught from workbooks. Her kids got good results but she quickly realised that they didn\u2019t get a good education because they were confined to their text book and didn\u2019t participate in strategies such as \u2018\u2018Community of Inquiry\u201d after reading a book. She taught her children to read the book and hopefully comprehend it; she told me they never actually analysed the book or looked at it from different perspectives or under the \u201cmantle of the expert\u201d. These techniques allow for very rich study of a book by a group. They don\u2019t just read it. They try to position where the reader is. This is the underpinning theory as well as the technique now learned through Professional Development. The other comment I\u2019d like to make about rote learning is that it doesn\u2019t meet individual learning styles - visual, auditory (listening) and kinaesthetic or kinesthetic (hands on learners). But that\u2019s for another post. The short answer is the best learning institutions favour open ended thinking and working at higher levels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy versus rote learning that, whilst easy to mark, really only produces a tool that may not even be applied outside the classroom. Creative thinking is far better than rote learning on its own. I\u2019m not sure where the US is in relation to Education. Australia does it well although many Education Ministers just don\u2019t understand it. I hope they rely on the feedback of people in the classroom but fear they want a return to rote learning - not because it\u2019s better but it\u2019s easier for them to make teachers accountable. I hope they have good advisers. ",

            "answer_text": "THE GLOBE OF EDUCATION  There is a strong mindset of people that makes them believe that being educated means a good job with high salary and high standard of living. But is education all about getting a good job and salary? Education begins the day a person takes birth. As soon as they are born they learn to cry, they learn crawling, walking, words, sentences and a lot other things. Education involves the acquisition of knowledge and the learning of skills. A true education determines the caliber of a person and makes them work to reach their dream. The problems in today's society with the education system are endless. So many students are deprived of the quality of the education they deserve today. Many elementary and high schools are improving but deserve more attention with school supplies, smaller classrooms, and need more upgraded teachers. Requirements of school do not let student choose what they want to study for their future. Students are required to study specific curriculums and this sometimes doesn\u2019t respond to the subject of their interest. Educators attempt to change that system to make it better by taking reference from the successful stories around the globe. India has one of the most complex education systems in the world. With over 1.5 million schools, between them teaching more than 220 million students, it is also one of the largest. Education in India is provided by the public sector as well as the private sector, with control and funding coming from three levels: central, state and local. India\u2019s Right to Education Act is a right included in the Indian Constitution which is empowering children in rural areas and those who are not allowed to study.  It is giving all children between the ages of six and 14 access to free, compulsory education in a local school. At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group. India is ranked 92 in education among 145 countries. In just a few decades, countries of the world will be governed by today\u2019s youth. Their thoughts and actions will be shaped by what they know and what they have experienced. This makes education even more important in global world. Pearson recently released their global report on education (which we also looked at last year). This report takes a look at major factors in education, such as expenditure per student, GDP, graduation rates, etc. South Korea has a satisfactory education system which has delivered results well above the OECD averages across math, science and reading for over a decade. Pre-school (which is optional), is offered from age three, in South Korea, with compulsory schooling from the age of five or six. After primary school, children move onto middle school, known as Jung Haggyo, and then High School (Godeung Haggyo). Different areas of the country have slightly different systems, including the processes for allocating spots, which might be by lottery (especially in large, densely populated cities), or through selective testing. Schooling in South Korea is free in the middle school. After that if a person chooses to attend high school to do specialize or vocational courses, fees are charged which includes lunch and tuition fees. East Asian nations continue to outperform others. South Korea is followed by Japan (2nd), Singapore (3rd) and Hong Kong (4th), Finland (5th) and so on. In Japan, the students don\u2019t take any exams until they reach grade four (the age of 10). They just take small tests. It is believed that the goal for the first 3 years of school is not to judge the child\u2019s knowledge or learning, but to establish good manners and to develop their character. Children are taught to respect other people, be gentle towards nature, generous, compassionate, and empathetic. Besides this, the kids are taught qualities like grit, self-control, and justice. Students also have to clean their classrooms, cafeterias, and even toilets by themselves. This is done to make them respect their own work and the work done by other people. Japanese students don\u2019t skip classes, nor do they arrive late for school. The average attendance in Japanese school is 99.99%. At the end of high school they have to take a very important exam that decides their future. A student can choose one college they would like to go to, and that college has a certain score requirement. If a student doesn\u2019t reach that score they probably don\u2019t go to college.  Singapore\u2019s education system which is ranked 3rd is the product of a distinctive, even unique, set of historical, institutional and cultural influences. These factors go a long way to help explain why the educational system is especially effective in the current assessment environment, but it also limits how transferable it is to other countries. It is also relatively flexible and expert-led. In addition, Singapore\u2019s institutional arrangements are characterized by a prescribed national curriculum. National high stakes examinations at the end of primary and secondary schooling stream students according to their exam performance and, crucially, prompt teachers to emphasize coverage of the curriculum and teaching to the test. The alignment of curriculum, assessment and instruction is exceptionally strong. Hong Kong (ranked 4th) operates a vibrant and competitive international and local school sector. There are three main types of local schools \u2013 government schools which are operated by the Government; aided schools which are fully subverted by the Government but run by voluntary bodies; and private schools, some of which receive financial assistance from the Government. Government and aided schools deliver a curriculum recommended by the Government. They offer free primary and secondary education. A lot of Primary schools in Hong Kong have Chinese medium of instructions. Children are to study a number of subjects, and Social Studies, Physical Education, Science, Math, English, Chinese, Art, and Music are among them. Children sit for the examination at Primary 5 and 6. The result of exams help to locate children to Secondary schools, and those students with the highest scores go to the top schools. Students prepare for the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) at 12th Grade/Year. At the end of the 12th year, students are to take exams leading to the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). After getting HKDSE students can continue education in different institutions.  Finland ranked fifth is an innovative country when it comes to education, and its innovation yields results. Finnish students only take one standardized test during their entire primary and secondary schooling. The Finnish test, called the National Matriculation Examination, is taken at the end of high school. They are not burdened with homework and spend relatively little time on homework. Finns place a lot of value on free time and play. By law, teachers must give students a 15-minute break for every 45 minutes of instruction.  All these education systems prize effort above inherited \u2018smartness\u2019, and have clear learning outcomes and goalposts they have a strong culture of accountability and engagement among a broad community of stakeholders. Many countries have proven themselves as best but there is much that still lack in providing the quality of education. This makes improvement in education system an issue of utmost importance. Some of the suggested changes are: Countries should learn from each other\u2019s success stories and try to apply them with their own country for a better success in the field of education.Education in every country should be free of cost and compulsory for every citizen. Government should sponsor education at all levels to release the burden of education fees from the student\u2019s mind.Education system must provide highly qualified teachers who can bring out the good from the students. There should be motivation and counseling sessions introduced in every school so that the kid can come up with their problem and resolve them. This would reduce stress from their minds and their potential would increase.Students at all levels should be made to work for their potential and not going through the boring curriculum which would make them lousy and uninterested in studies. Along with this innovative teaching methods should be introduced to develop students interest in the subject.A lot has been done to bring education to increase standards of education and still there is a lot we can do to bring innovation in education to make this world more educated, more constructive, and more developed and a better place to live in.To make life better, education is the most important and an extremely essential tool. This tool if not used properly can destroy the world but if given right work can change this world and make it a heaven. ",

Japan Japan\u2019s splendidly rigorous teaching system starts early, and Japanese students pay longer within the room than the other country\u2019s students. Japanese students systematically place higher in standardized testing, however that will be an operation of the competitive college culture instead of specializing in student wants. highschool isn\u2019t obligatory, however, the enrollment rate is ninety-eight. so as to urge into the competitive high colleges, several Japanese students brace themselves for the doorway exams in outside homework. It\u2019s not shocking that Japan incorporates a ninety-nine skill rate, however, did you recognize they even have a ninety-nine .99% college group action rate?

            "answer_text": "When it comes to education policy, first name comes from Finland, what is the reason behind this, I will tell you in detail further. But first of all know that when our country became independent India it was said that Finland was like a forest. Education policy has been Finland's priority from the very beginning, Finland not only made good policy to move forward in education sector but also changed its policies from time to time.  You will be surprised to know that the mobile company Nokia, the operating system Linux, and Angry Birds, the initial company to make the game belongs to Finland. Here are some features of Finland's education policy :- In Finland, the child's primary education starts from age 7, before which he does not have to take any kind of nursery, a course like LKG UKG. Whereas, if we talk about India, then the new education policy has said to start elementary education of the child from the age of 3 years.There is only one class teacher from class one to class 6, where people believe that the child cannot be understood in 1 year, and the person who has seen and understood the child for many years can evaluate it well. .In Finland, the language is taught through singing, for which all kinds of musical instruments are present in the class. If you talk about India, here you will get to see only a few things in the name of helpful learning materials such as chart paper, some sports items in some schools.In Finland, the municipality can change the policies of education for its region accordingly, meaning that a small body is free to make education policy there. Whereas, if we talk about India, education in India is the subject of a concurrent list in which the center and the state make education policy.Mid-day meal means for children in India started in 1995, whereas in Finland this facility was implemented only in 1948, in India, where the news of food spoilage to children keeps on coming, the same Finland. The quality of food in India is better than the three star hotels in India. In Finland, studies are done on the basis of subject-to-topic, with special use of community participation and sports method. While Operation Black Board has not yet been implemented due to shortage of teachers in India. Because of which the same teacher is unable to pay attention to many children.In Finland, there is one teacher for every 20 children, whereas in India there is not a single teacher for every 30 children, the National Education Policy and the suggestion of Yashpal Committee which came out in 1986 has not been implemented till date.In India's big and well-known schools, only toppers are admitted on the basis of merit, while in Finland schools, toppers are not in practice.In India, if you do not do well in a subject, you are compelled to study tuition by the school teacher, while in Finland, special teachers are appointed for the weak children who do not have to pay any fees.To improve Finland's education, its government changed policies from time to time, and spent 7% of GDP on education. You would be surprised to know that Finland has a population of only 55 lakhs, which is the most successful of its success. There is a big reason.",

            "answer_text": "Education is one of the necessities of the humans and, therefore, a prime responsibility and obligation of the states and governments to impose it without any regional or class discrimination. A state is a combination and arrangement of a number of systems being run by the state machinery. Among the others, Education is a system that requires an organized systematization, coordination and structural development from grassroots to higher levels of and around the society. The education itself is a proof to the progressiveness and development of the nations.The most developed nations in the worlds have most developed and best education systems while, the underdeveloped, struggling ones and one with the bad economy and global ranks have the bad education systems when compared to the developed ones. West is considered to be the most developed ones when it comes to education which however isn\u2019t the case especially when you talk about the USA, Australian continent and overall European continent.  Here is a list of top ten 20 countries with doing well and strengthening their education systems.  The rankings are confirmed with the combination of the OECD\u2019s Pisa tests, international tests, Int. Mathematics & Science Study, Int. Reading Literacy Study and other US Studies. Asians (South and South East followed by Norwegians) and then others are once again leading the world in the best education providers of the world.  Japan and south-Korea have fierce competition for the 1st rank. Koreans defeated Japan in 3 levels. Japan despite investing in childhood education is compromised in some rankings as no#2 and almost tying with Japan in the ranks. Do you know that children in South Korea attend school often seven-day a week? The national education budget estimated last year was $11,300,000,000. Korean is the primary language and learning mode of the country. The literacy rate is total 97.9% out of which males are sharing 99.2% and 96.6% of females. Korea\u2019s economic development and prosperity is a proof to its development and innovation in education. Apart, from Korean, strong efforts have been made to pour quality English language in the education systems. The GDP (PPP) per capita estimated in 2014 is $34,795. ",

            "answer_text": "Finland has held the unofficial title as the country with the world\u2019s best education system since 2000. It is because of the following reasons that Finland has the best Education system in the world: No standardized testing: Staying in line with our print-minded sensibilities, standardized testing is the blanket way we test for subject comprehension. Filling in little bubbles on a scantron and answering pre-canned questions is somehow supposed to be a way to determine mastery or at least competence of a subject. What often happens is that students will learn to cram just to pass a test and teachers will be teaching with the sole purpose of students passing a test. Learning has been thrown out of the equation. Finland has no standardized tests. Their only exception is something called the National Matriculation Exam, which is a voluntary test for students at the end of an upper-secondary school (equivalent to an American high school.) All children throughout Finland are graded on an individualized basis and grading system set by their teacher. Tracking overall progress is done by the Ministry of Education, which samples groups across different ranges of schools. Accountability for teachers (not required): A lot of the blame goes to the teachers and rightfully so sometimes. But in Finland, the bar is set so high for teachers, that there is often no reason to have a rigorous \u201cgrading\" system for teachers. All teachers are required to have a master's degree before entering the profession. Teaching programs are the most rigorous and selective professional schools in the entire country. If a teacher isn't performing well, it's the individual principal's responsibility to do something about it. The concept of the pupil-teacher dynamic that was once the master to apprentice cannot be distilled down to a few bureaucratic checks and standardized testing measures. It needs to be dealt with on an individual basis. Cooperation, not competition: While most Americans and other countries see the educational system as one big Darwinian competition, the Finns see it differently. Ironically, this attitude has put them at the head of the international pack. Finland's educational system doesn't worry about artificial or arbitrary merit-based systems. There are no lists of top performing schools or teachers. It's not an environment of competition \u2013 instead, cooperation is the norm. Make the basics a priority: Many school systems are so concerned with increasing test scores and comprehension in math and science, they tend to forget what constitutes a happy, harmonious and healthy student and learning environment. Many years ago, the Finnish school system was in need of some serious reforms. The program that Finland put together focused on returning back to the basics. It wasn't about dominating with excellent marks or upping the ante. Instead, they looked to make the school environment a more equitable place. Since the 1980s, Finnish educators have focused on making these basics a priority: Education should be an instrument to balance out social inequality.All students receive free school meals.Ease of access to health care.Psychological counselingIndividualized guidanceBeginning with the individual in a collective environment of equality is Finland's way. Starting school at an older age: Here the Finns again start by changing very minute details. Students start school when they are seven years old. They're given free rein in the developing childhood years to not be chained to compulsory education. It's simply just a way to let a kid be a kid. There are only 9 years of compulsory school that Finnish children are required to attend. Everything past the ninth grade or at the age of 16 is optional. Just from a psychological standpoint, this is a freeing idea. Although it may anecdotal, many students really feel like they're stuck in a prison. Finland alleviates this forced ideal and instead opts to prepare its children for the real world. Providing professional options past a traditional college degree: The current pipeline for education in America is incredibly stagnant and immutable. Children are stuck in the K-12 circuit jumping from teacher to teacher. Each grade is a preparation for the next, all ending in the grand culmination of college, which then prepares you for the next grand thing on the conveyor belt. Many students don't need to go to college and get a worthless degree or flounder about trying to find purpose and incur massive debt. Finland solves this dilemma by offering options that are equally advantageous for the student continuing their education. There is a lesser focused dichotomy of college-educated versus trade-school or working class. Both can be equally professional and fulfilling for a career. In Finland, there is the Upper Secondary School which is a three-year program that prepares students for the Matriculation Test that determines their acceptance into a University. This is usually based off of specialties they've acquired during their time in \u201chigh-school\" Next, there is vocational education, which is a three-year program that trains students for various careers. They have the option to take the Matriculation test if they want to then apply to University. Finns wake up later for less strenuous schooldays: Waking up early, catching a bus or ride, participating in morning and after school extracurriculars are huge time sinks for a student. Add to the fact that some classes start anywhere from 6 am to 8 am and you've got sleepy, uninspired adolescents on your hands. Students in Finland usually start school anywhere from 9:00 \u2013 9:45 AM. Research has shown that early start times are detrimental to students' well-being, health, and maturation. Finnish schools start the day later and usually end by 2:00 \u2013 2:45 AM. They have longer class periods and much longer breaks in between. The overall system isn't there to ram and cram information to their students, but to create an environment of holistic learning. Consistent instruction from the same teachers: There are fewer teachers and students in Finnish schools. You can't expect to teach an auditorium of invisible faces and breakthrough to them on an individual level. Students in Finland often have the same teacher for up to six years of their education. During this time, the teacher can take on the role of a mentor or even a family member. During those years, mutual trust and bonding are built so that both parties know and respect each other. Different needs and learning styles vary on an individual basis. Finnish teachers can account for this because they've figured out the student's own idiosyncratic needs. They can accurately chart and care for their progress and help them reach their goals. There is no passing along to the next teacher because there isn't one. A more relaxed atmosphere: There is a general trend in what Finland is doing with its schools. Less stress, less unneeded regimentation and more caring. Students usually only have a couple of classes a day. They have several times to eat their food, enjoy recreational activities and generally just relax. Spread throughout the day are 15 to 20-minute intervals where the kids can get up and stretch, grab some fresh air and decompress. This type of environment is also needed by the teachers. Teacher rooms are set up all over Finnish schools, where they can lounge about and relax, prepare for the day or just simply socialize. Teachers are people too and need to be functional so they can operate at the best of their abilities. Less homework and outside work required: According to the OECD, students in Finland have the least amount of outside work and homework than any other student in the world. They spend only half an hour a night working on stuff from school. Finnish students also don't have tutors. Yet they're outperforming cultures that have toxic school-to-life balances without the unneeded or unnecessary stress. Finnish students are getting everything they need to get done in school without the added pressures that come with excelling at a subject. Without having to worry about grades and busy-work they are able to focus on the true task at hand \u2013 learning and growing as a human being. Please share and upvote if you liked the answer!

Many developed nations all across the globe are recognized to have the best education system, and it is the responsibility of government that they play an essential role in the improvement of these set of courses. In that respective ranking list, UK and US are leading the way; they are known for proving world-class education. Therefore, different international students also attract to them as they provide better cultural diversity and lifestyle.  The United Kingdom is known to be the first in the list as they have the outstanding education system. Plus, there are a total of two hundred universities in the nation out of which several are also qualified in the list of top 10 universities. Two leading universities are the University of Cambridge and Oxford University. List of Nations that provide the best education system United Kingdom United States Canada Germany France  After being sixteen years old, students often go for A Levels for getting into university. After spending and clearing a couple of years of secondary education, they can specialize in a few subjects of their own choice. They can only carry on or pursue those subjects at their university. The state funds public education in the USA through state and federal taxes. As per the National Center for Education\u2019s report, seventy percent of the world\u2019s students continue their higher studies in the United States of America. Eight out of the top 10 universities are situated in the USA; this is the reason student love to go for studies in the United States. ",

Teachers are required to be more highly educated, given leeway on how to deal with students and testing is held to minimum. They have had to deal with an increasing number of immigrants. However, their students literacy rates remain high. Korean and Japanese students spend a lot more time attending k-12 school, learn by rote and live in a relatively un-diverse society so I do not see their school system as being nearly as strong. Also, I actually knew a surprising number of Korean students in Texas. Sometimes parents brought them to USA due to learning disabilities, or they were adopted children with birth defects or from unwed mothers. They were able to get the support they needed to do well in school from their adopted parents. Sometimes how well a country does in PISA scores depends on who they actually admit to regular schools. Germany has a good system for educating people in trades who are not going on to college. However, often whether or not you attend college in Germany has more to do with how much money families invest in their children \u201cextra\u201d education opportunities. The United States does not function as well as many smaller countries do because of greater diversity in students, and the fact that sports is consider as important as education in some areas. If school districts were allowed more independence, they would probably track their students according to ability as they used to. However this was stopped because it was considered discriminatory.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a difficult thing to quantify, the best thing I can reccomend is that several factors imply which country has the best school system overall The literacy rate - this gives you an indication of how well the primary/elementary school system functions, and obviously basic literacy and numeracy is the foundation of all further education - however amongst developed countries, this is pretty much 95 to 100% so it\u2019s hard to distinguish here.The number of people who complete high school/ secondary school. Again, in most developed countries, this is a fairly high percentage, so its usefulness in determining the very best school system is limited, but still necessary.Scores in standardised tests in maths and science. Unlike reading, which is difficult to compare directly due to differences in language - 2+2= 4 is true everywhere so maths and science subjects grades can be directly compared more easily. However, the drawback here is that many countries schools concentrate on the rote learning of material to pass the test , rather than on meaningful comprehension of the material in a way that allows it to be applied in a real job.Number of people in various age ranges who hold third level degrees (college/university graduates). This is a useful metric, ASSUMING that the colleges are reputalbe and properly accredited (I\u2019ve read that this is a problem in India).

            "answer_text": "Gist:  No system is superior or inferior in the way they deliver. Its all about the individual. At the end of the day, the systems are put in place just to direct our thinking, and its the individual who has to put a step forward for developing his/her skills. Long answer: I have been brought up in both the Indian and Canadian systems and I feel that the way you have presented the Canadian education system is biased. (in reference to Anon's answer.) Being able to think freely, express your ideas, and teaching you how to educate yourself should be the aim of any education system. The Indian system fails to do all three. Desperation is the primary factor in play in the Indian system, which leads all the kids to constantly perform and bag that well paying software job, that is at the outset of an engineering degree. Caring about the way you look, fitting in, etc. are social issues which are prevalent everywhere, not just in Canada. Trying to look smarter and wanting to \"fit in\" with the popular kids, seems to be more of a personal issue rather than one caused by the system. I know several highly successful and motivated individuals, who have been brought up in the Canadian system. And you seem to generalize educated people as ones who are well versed in mathematics.Waste a little time, :P and think for a bit, aren't there any doctors, engineers or other technically skilled individuals in Canada? Weren't they brought up in the so called \"flawed\" system? Again, success is not about rote learning or memorizing equations, it differs from person to person. In my opinion, as millions of people traverse the beaten path in India and become victims of the \"rat race\" (incl. me), it puts them in crutches. These people cannot think differently and will keep following the same set of \"instructions to success\". This cripples the nation with too many doctors, engineers and lawyers. By the description of your experiences, you indeed enjoyed your time in the Canadian system. And judging the same by your descriptions of the Indian system, you felt like you were being imprisoned here. And I beg to differ, that in the Indian system while some teachers might be aces; most of them know exactly what is prescribed to them. Usually, they do not know the complete implication of the concept and are often unable to present a completely satisfying explanation or example of the phenomenon, and rather just require us to memorize concepts without truly understanding them, which on the long run will prove to be completely useless. Being able to generate new ideas, might be the hardest thing to do for any student educated in the Indian system, as they are so accustomed to learning everything in the traditional rote manner, where everything is clearly defined and as you elucidated, there is a lot less thinking involved. Again, not to generalize, there are exceptions.  No system is superior or inferior in the way they deliver. Its all about the individual. If you feel that you might need to do more math, and become well versed technically, then take up more math courses. If you want to specialize in fine arts, then do that. At the end of the day, the systems are put in place just to direct our thinking, and its the individual who has to put a step forward for developing him/her skills ",

There are various post-secondary institutions that include colleges, universities and technical schools. Each post-secondary school has its own set of rules on how to apply, and decides what level of English you will need to be at to be accepted, as well as other entry requirements for various courses of study.There are private career and vocational schools which are not necessarily governed by provincial governments as well. There are career colleges, community colleges -- both of which are non-degree granting institutions offering courses ranging from 1-3 years. The fee is generally lower than the university or university colleges. Then there are university colleges offering four-year undergraduate degrees as well as graduate courses ranging from Masters to doctoral.

            "answer_text": "11 Ways Finland\u2019s Education System Shows Us that \u201cLess is More\u201d. Students in Finland start formal schooling at the age of seven. Yes, seven! Finland allows their children to be children, to learn through playing and exploring rather than sitting still locked up in a classroom. But don\u2019t they get behind? No! The kids start school when they are actually developmentally ready to learn and focus. This first year is followed by only nine years of compulsory school. Everything after ninth grade is optional and at the age of 16 the students can choose from the following three tracks: \u2022 Upper Secondary School: This three year program prepares students for the Matriculation Test that determines their acceptance into University. Students usually pick which upper secondary school they would like to attend based on the school\u2019s specialties and apply to get into that institution. I think of this as a mixture of High School and College. (In recent years a little less than 40% choose this option.) \u2022Vocational Education: This is a three year program that trains students for various careers as well as gives them the option to take the Matriculation test to then apply for University should they so choose. However, the students in this track are usually content with their skill and either enter the workforce or they go on to a Poly-technical College to get further training. (A little less than 60% choose this track.) (But wait! Shouldn\u2019t everyone take calculus, economics, and advanced chemistry?! Shouldn\u2019t everyone get a University degree?! No, not everyone has to go to University! Hmmm\u2026.. interesting\u2026.. What if we provided options for those who want to become successful (and very profitable) welders or electricians? What if we didn\u2019t force students who know that their talents reside outside of the world of formal academics to take three years of high school classes that they found boring and useless? What if we allowed them to train in and explore vocations they found fascinating and in which they were gifted? What if we made these students feel valued and like they had a place in the education realm?) \u2022 Enter the workforce. (Less than 5% choose this path) 2. Less Time in School = More Rest Students typically start school between 9:00 and 9:45. Actually, Helsinki is thinking of creating a law stating that schools cannot begin before 9:00 am because research has consistently proved that adolescents need quality sleep in the morning. The school day usually ends by 2:00 or 2:45. Some days they start earlier and some days they start later. Finnish students\u2019 schedules are always different and changing; however they typically have three to four 75 minute classes a day with several breaks in between. This overall system allows both students and teachers to be well rested and ready to teach/learn. 3. Fewer Instruction Hours = More Planning Time Teachers have shorter days as well. According to the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) an average Finnish teacher teaches 600 hours annually or about 4 or less lessons daily. An average U.S. teacher almost doubles that teaching time with an average of over 1,080 hours of in-class instruction annually. This equals an average of six or more lessons daily. Also, teachers and students in Finland are not expected to be at school when they do not have a class. For example, if they don\u2019t have any afternoon classes on Thursdays, they (both teachers and students) can simply leave. Or if their first class on a Wednesday starts at 11:00, they don\u2019t have to be at school until that time. This system allows the Finnish teacher more time to plan and think about each lesson. It allows them to create great, thought provoking lessons. 4. Fewer Teachers = More Consistency and Care Elementary students in Finland often have the SAME teacher for up to SIX YEARS of their education. That is right! The same teacher cares for, nurtures and tends to the education of the same group of students for six years in a row. And you had better believe that during those six years with the same 15-20 students, those teachers have figured out the individual instructional needs and learning styles of each and every student. These teachers know where each of their students have been and where they are going. They track the kids\u2019 progress and have a personal invested interest in seeing the kids succeed and reach their goals. There is no \u201cpassing the buck\u201d onto the next teacher because they ARE the next teacher. If there is a discipline or behavior problem, the teacher had better nip it in the bud right away or else deal with it the next six years. ( Some schools in Finland only loop their elementary children for three years at a time instead of six, however the benefits are still the same. ) This system is not only helpful to a child because it gives them the consistency, care and individualized attention they need, it also helps the teachers understand the curriculum in a holistic and linear way. The teacher knows what they need to teach to get them to the next step, while also giving the teachers freedom to work at the pace of their students. Teachers don\u2019t feel the pressure to speed up or slow down so that they are \u201cready\u201d for the teacher next year. Again, they are the teacher next year and they control the curriculum! They know where the kids are and what they have learned and will plan according to the students\u2019 needs! I really believe this is a HUGE part of Finland\u2019s success story and it does not receive enough attention. 5. Fewer Accepted Applicants= More Confidence in Teachers So\u2026\u2026children have the same teacher for three to six years. What if your kid gets a \u201cbad teacher\u201d? Finland works very hard to make sure there are no \u201cbad teachers.\u201d Primary education is THE most competitive degree to get in Finland. The elementary education departments in Finland only accept 10% of all applicants and turns down thousands of students annually. A person not only has to be the best and the brightest to become a primary teacher, they also have to have passed a series of interviews and personality screenings to get in. So, it isn\u2019t enough to be the smartest in your class, you also have to have the natural ability and drive to teach. Finland understands that the ability to teach isn\u2019t something that can be gained from studying. It is usually a gift and passion. Some have it, some don\u2019t. The few universities with teaching programs in Finland make sure they only accept applicants that have that gift. On top of excellent grades, and a natural disposition to be a teacher, all teachers must get a Master\u2019s degree and write a Master\u2019s Thesis. This generates a lot of confidence and trust in Finland\u2019s teachers. Parents trust the teachers to be highly qualified, trained, and gifted individuals. They do not try to interfere or usurp their authority and decisions. I asked a math teacher how many emails they typically get from parents. They shrugged and answered \u201cAbout five or six\u201d. I said, \u201cOh, I get about that much a day too.\u201d They then answered\u2026\u201dNo! I meant five or six a semester!\u201d Again, what would it be like to live in a society based on trust and respect? 6. Fewer Classes= More Breaks As I stated before, students only have three to four (or rarely, five) classes a day. They also have several breaks/recesses/ snack times during the day and these usually happen outside come rain or shine. These 15 to 20 minute gives them time to digest what they are learning, use their muscles, stretch their legs, get some fresh air and let out the \u201cwiggles.\u201d There are several neurological advantages for these breaks. Study after study supports the need for children to be physically active in order to learn. Stagnation of the body leads to stagnation of the brain and unfocused, \u201chyper\u201d children. The teachers also have these breaks. The first day I was in a school in Finland a teacher apologized for the state of the \u201cTeacher Room.\u201d She then commented on the fact that all teacher rooms must look like this. I laughed and politely agreed, but in my head I was thinking; \u201cWhat is a teacher room?\u201d A teacher\u2019s room is what used to be called the teacher\u2019s lounge in the U.S\u2026back before they went extinct. In Finland these rooms are always full of teachers who are either working, preparing, grabbing a cup of coffee, or simply resting, socializing, and mentally preparing for their next class. Secondary level teachers usually have 10 to 20 minute breaks in between classes and often have a few skip (prep) periods as well. These rooms are different depending on the school, but from what I can tell the basic formula is a few tables, a few couches, a coffee pot, a kitchen, a selection of free fruit and snacks, and teachers to talk and collaborate with. A few of them even have massage chairs! Ha! So, why don\u2019t these rooms of collaboration, support and solace exist in the U.S.? We do not have TIME! Every day we teach six to seven classes in a row with no breaks. The three to five minute passing periods we do get are often used to answer emails from parents, erase the board, get ready for the next class, make copies, answer student questions, pick up the mess left behind by the students, and (heaven forbid) go to the bathroom! If we have a spare moment we are then expected to monitor the hallway because we can\u2019t trust students to get to class without supervision. The luxury of actually sitting down for 10 minutes and enjoying a cup of coffee with some colleagues is an absolute dream, and having a day with only three classes\u2014that is a fantasy! 7. Less Testing = More Learning Imagine all of the exciting things you could do with your students if there wasn\u2019t a giant state test looming over your head every year. Imagine the freedom you could have if your pay wasn\u2019t connected to your student\u2019s test scores. Imagine how much more fun and engaging your lessons would be! Although it still exists, there is overall less pressure on the teacher in Finland to get through the curriculum. The teacher is simply trusted to do a good job and therefore they have more control over their classroom and its content. The teacher is able to take more risks and try new things and create exciting, engaging curriculum that allows students to become skilled individuals ready for the real world. They have time to teach skills that allow students to develop into individuals who know how to start a project and work systematically to accomplish a goal. They have time to teach craft education where students get to learn how to do real life skills like sewing, cooking, cleaning, woodworking and more! And while they are learning these amazing skills they are also learning math and problem solving and how to follow directions! 8. Fewer Topics = More Depth I have observed several fifth through ninth grade math classes in Finland. I have looked at the curriculum covered over these five years of education and I realized that I attempt to teach the content of five years of Finnish math education in one year. Each math topic presented in every grade level I have observed here is include in my seventh grade curriculum. Again, the American mentality of \u201cmore is more\u201d simply does not work. If I am to get through everything I am expected to do in one year I have to introduce a new topic/lesson every other day and I always feel \u201cbehind\u201d. Behind what, I am not sure, but the pressure is there pushing me and my students along. In Finland, teachers take their time. They look deeper into the topic and don\u2019t panic if they are a little behind or don\u2019t cover every topic in the existence of mathematics in a single year. Also, students only have math a few times a week. In fact, after Easter Break, all of my seventh graders only have math ONCE a week! My heart still panics a little when I hear this! I can\u2019t believe that is enough math time! How will they be ready for the tests?! Oh\u2014 wait. There are no tests. There is no need to rush through. The students get to actually understand the material before they are forced on to a new topic. One teacher showed me a course book and said that it had too many topics for one five week grading period. I looked at the entire book and had to stifle a chuckle because it essentially covered what would be found in ONE chapter from my textbook. Why do we push our kids in the U.S. to learn so much so quickly? No wonder they are stressed out! No wonder they give up! 9. Less Homework = More Participation According to the OECD, Finnish students have the least amount of homework in the world. They average under half an hour of homework a night. Finnish students typically do not have outside tutors or lessons either. This is especially shocking when you realize Finnish students are outscoring the high performing Asian nations whose students receive hours of additional/outside instruction. From what I can observe, students in Finland get the work done in class, and teachers feel that what the students are able to do in school is enough. Again, there is not pressure to have them do more than what is necessary for them to learn a skill. Often the assignments are open-ended and not really graded. Yet, the students work on it in class diligently. It is very interesting to see what happens to the students when they are given something to do. The students who were not listening to the lesson at all put away their phones and start working on the task set before them. Even if it is just a suggested assignment, they give it their full attention up to the end of class. It is almost like there is an unspoken agreement: \u201cI won\u2019t give you homework if you work on this while you are in my classroom.\u201d This system has really made me think about the amount of homework I assign on a daily basis. 10. Fewer Students = More Individual Attention This is obvious. If you have fewer students you will be able to give them the care and attention they need to learn. A Finnish teacher will have about 3 to 4 classes of 20 students a day- so they will see between 60 to 80 students a day. I see 180 students every single day. I have 30 to 35 students in a class, six classes in a row, 5 days a week. 11. Less Structure = More Trust Trust is key to this whole system not structure. Instead of being suspicious of one another and creating tons of structure, rules, hoops and tests to see if the system is working, they simply trust the system. Society trusts the schools to hire good Teachers. The schools trust the teachers to be highly trained individuals and therefore give them freedom to create the type of classroom environment that is best for their individual students. The Parent\u2019s trust the teachers to make decisions that will help their children learn and thrive. The Teachers trust the students to do the work and learn for the sake of learning. The Students trust the teachers to give them the tools they need to be successful. Society trusts the system and gives education the respect it deserves. It works and it isn\u2019t complicated. Finland has it figured out. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough question - partly because systems change, partly because \u201cbest Education system is hard to define\u201d but mostly because it\u2019s hard to compare systems when their cultures, their views and beliefs, aspirations and hopes, priorities and needs are different. Singapore, for example, does well in some subjects at an international level particularly Maths and Science where they repeatedly achieve high ranking . It is facile to say that this means they have a \u201cgood\u201d education, becasue the high ranking is acheived through a great deal of rote learning for teaching to the tests that they do well in. Is that a good education? does this teaching make better citizens (whatever that may mean) can the students use their education in a way that gives them satisfaction and the objectives for employment etc. for the country met? is the test itself of any intrinsic value? Grade A is better than Grade B - but what does \u2018better\u2019 mean . Does the curriculum allow for children to reach their potential as individuals? or do we simply judge (as we tend to do) that the child is not important but getting top marks is. Take those complexities on board and keep thinking best for whom? best at what? best for the future? best for innovation? best for predicting the needs of the future? best for the health of the nation? best for peace? best for power? Add your own \u201cbests\u201d and try to define what they look like. Investigate exactly what is being called best. It\u2019s usually the highest marks in some form of testing - but does that make better citizen? good neighbours? hard workers? more wealth? more happiness? innovation? stability?Have a good think about that - what would you feel you would want to enable you to say \u201cthat was the best education I could have had.\u201d ?While you are doing that I will think of some educational systems that I believe do a good job and, although none is perfect, what do they do well and why might that be important. By contrast I shall give you some bad systems - and these are the ones that actively damage in my view the interests of the country and the learner. When you are ready post the question requesting me (at least) : \u201cWhat do you feel are the main factors that will provide a good education for students and which factors would mitigate against a good education? Please give examples\u201d If you are up for that, I shall wait eagerly for your next communication. ",

            "answer_text": "Which countries in the world have the best education level. Actually, this is estimated according to the ranking of the Global Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report. In this, the forum covers all the countries of the world and gives them number out of 10. In this report, high-tech training in a particular field is also recognized along with those receiving university-level education in major countries. This shows that in which country the level of education is better. According to the WEF 2017 report, India ranks very low in this list. 1- Singapore: According to the 2017 report, Singapore has the best level of education in the world. With a score of 6.3 out of 10, this country is recognized for having the world's best education system in subjects like science and mathematics. 2-Finland: The score of this country is 6.2. The importance of education in Finland is known by the fact that every teacher here is selected from the top ten graduates of the country and is essentially expected to get a post graduate degree. 3-Netherlands: Netherlands is also much better in terms of education, hence its score is 6.1. Every third Dutch citizen is a university degree holder. 4-Switzerland: Considered one of the most romantic places in the world, this country has a score of 6.0. In Switzerland it costs $ 17000 per student per year. About 86 percent of people in Switzerland, aged 25\u201364 years, are educated. 5-Belgium: Belgium ranks fifth with a score of 6.0. Only 3 percent of Belgian citizens remain unemployed even after getting higher education. Here the salary of teachers is also very high. Their salaries average up to $ 74000. 6-Denmark: This country has a score of 5.9, but Denmark ranks among the highest spending countries on education. Denmark is also one of the few countries to increase spending on the education of its citizens during the financial crash between 2008 and 2010. 7-Norway: Norway is in seventh place with a score of 5.9. The specialty of this country is that this country spends a lot of money on the education of its citizens. From primary education to territory education, this country spends about $ 14,000 per person annually. 8-America: America's score is also 5.9, but in one case it is far ahead which is why it is placed at number eight. About 43 per cent of the people here have university level degrees. As a result, the US ranks fifth in the OECD listings among the levels of about 34 educated countries. 9-Australia: Australia is ninth with a score of only 5.9 because 43 percent of the students take some technical training after completing school. In this case, only Canada, Japan, Israel, Korea, America and England are ahead of Australia. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, according to the Google and me off course Finland\u2019s education system is one of the best education system in World. The main reason behind this is there is a law over there that education is mandatory for every child or person, and government will provide it not just for free of cost but also provide the good facilities in the schools. And that\u2019s why teaching is the most respectable job in Finland. Moreover, the Salary wages of the Teachers/Professors are much higher than any other profession in Finland. So the perks and facilities which they enjoyed are completely equivalent to an IAS officer in India.  Being a modern and Developed country Finland\u2019s government Education budget is the biggest in their country and World as well. It helps to enhance the quality of education in their schools and Colleges. And I also want to tell you one more thing as per my research that their Teachers only spend 4 hours a day in the classroom and take 2 hours a week for professional development. Moreover, there is an another provision in their Education law that All teachers in Finland must have a master\u2019s degree, which is fully subsidized. Their Teachers have a freedom of deciding the best educational methods for their students. So, Now I hope that you will get your answer for which country has the best education system and why. Thanks for giving the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Finland is often cited as having a terrific educational system. When the media and the British government want to bash teachers in the U.K., it is Finland\u2019s education system to which ours is compared. There are a number of reasons for this. It\u2019s not quite as simple as teachers in Finland work harder than anywhere else, as some might suggest. I can assure you that U.K. teachers exhaust themselves every day (and I\u2019m pretty that the same can be said of teachers around the world). What Finnish schools have done is to create an ideal learning environment. Finnish students start school later than the U.K. and only have a couple of lessons a day. This means they school doesn\u2019t feel like a drag. All students also have free school meals so the school can ensure that they are getting good, healthy nutritional food. Compare that to the U.K. About a quarter of the students I teach struggle to focus in the morning because they\u2019ve been up until 4am playing Call of Duty and they are tired. Then at lunchtime they dose up on lurid-coloured energy drinks to wake themselves up, and chemically-enhanced snacks, so in the afternoon they\u2019re bouncing off the walls. Also imagine only having only two or so subjects to focus on each day - it would be much less stressful. Let\u2019s look at the lessons themselves. In our school, lessons are one hour long. In Finnish schools, they are much longer than this. This gives the teacher a lot more freedom when it comes to planning lessons. And speaking of freedom: Finland has scrapped standardised testing. In the U.K. schools and teachers are judged on results. This has led to a culture where we teach to the exam (why would you do otherwise, if you get raked over the coals if your students perform poorly?) Not only does this create a stressful environment where schools compete bitterly with one another, but it sucks the fun out of the learning experience. School in the U.K. has become about grades, not about learning. In Finland, there is none of that stress. They take a much more holistic approach to education (similar to many homeschooling parents). If students become particularly engaged in a topic, then the class can stick with it for a bit longer. If a teacher has read a particularly interesting article that they feel might trigger a debate, they can base a lesson around it. Finnish schools have also ditched homework (one of the biggest sources of grief among U.K. students), because they trust the teachers to deliver the learning in school. All in all, a great learning environment: for teachers and students. Source: 10 reasons why Finland's education system is the best in the world ",

Unlike here where teachers are trying to fit the need of the worst student in your class.Many standardized test to help see your improvement. You may be thinking tests and homework are terrible! But they actually tell you what you are bad at.You could quickly adjust if you move to another country. By this, I mean Chinese are one of the most advanced country at teaching elementary kids high school math, you could probably adjust easily.Teachers are generally helpful. Personally, I had study in China before, teachers will probably answer any of your question related to academic.Classmates are all genius!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Have you ever see a first grader fluent in multiplication chart? (By the way they actually require it) Chinese are all expert in math!In conclusion, I think China have the best education system, but because this is a topic related to culture and people could have different opinion, I am not going to say it definite. (In my opinion, Finland\u2019s education system is great as well!) ",

South KoreaJapanSingaporeHong KongFinlandUKCanadaNetherlandsIrelandPolandIt's interesting to note the US came in 14th out of 40. In my opinion the US has spent too much testing and not enough time teaching. They spend an enormous amount of time brainwashing students with liberal ideas. They also have gotten rid of foreign language programs, art, music, drama, public speaking, and other subjects they refer to as fluff. They have turned  subjects such as English, civics, history, into the most boring subjects in school. They put their emphasis on advanced mathematics and sciences. They hire coaches first and if they just happen to teach an academic subject that's all well and good. They also put an obscene amount of emphasis on sports to the detriment of academics. There is huge amount of corruption in US education. All this has combined to bring US education down with no chance of seeing rise any time soon.",

            "answer_text": "It's impossible to judge who has the best system in the world. You can't just take test results, compare them and claim the one with the highest is the best because it doesn't take into account students who are failed by the system. Lots of institutions fail and discard difficult students and kick them out of the system. Their results don't show up on the test scores and bring down the average unlike another system which might keep students of lower abilities in the system for longer. Which is the best system? The one that kicks out a less intelligent kid or one who keeps them engaged even though their final mark might not be brilliant? Statistics will tell you it's the former but I'd argue it's the latter. The best education systems in the world are ones who have realised students are different and teaching them as if they're all the same is futile. Some kids need to be pushed more, others need a more informal setting. A good system has the ability for gifted children to find their niche as well as provide legitimate alternatives to those who can't handle a rigid class system. ",

Apart, from Korean, strong efforts have been  made to pour quality English language in the education systems. The GDP  (PPP) per capita estimated in 2014 is $34,795. 2) Japan:  The  Japanese have dominated in the world from the last three-quarters. The  technology-based educational structure has provided the nation with some  great figures in the knowledge and insight. The strong education has  made the country rank in top numbers among the world\u2019s strongest  economies. The GDP nearly 5.96 trillion USD is well evident to prove the  claim. Literacy rate in both the countries are very high(Almost 100%). That\u2019s really appreciable to have everyone educated.  How do they achieve it? Regarding Japan, Emphasis on rote learning, theory and compulsory study to age of 18 pays off. Formal, intense instruction in maths and the Japanese language begins at  the age of six and continues through to 15, the earliest age at which  pupils can leave school. Those who elect to go on to senior high school \u2013  the rough equivalent of an English sixth form college and a traditional  route to higher education \u2013 through to age 18 must study an eclectic  range of subjects, including maths, Japanese literature and English.

Has a large emphasis on no standardized testing especially in young children (eat your heart out America) and children are encouraged to play and spend their childhood how it should be: with laughter and the occasional tumble. Now compare that to the routine of American children who at a young age are told to do well in order to succeed in life from the moment they are born and are told to go home and study and do homework for 3 hours a day lest they fall behind their other peers. This embracing your childhood is working out well for them because Finland has a high rate of high school graduates and a great number of students going into higher education (much higher than America) and is continuously one of the leading nations in fields such as reading or science.

When it comes to America, we have 50 states, each with their own educational systems with little overlap, so comparing America to say Finland or Japan won't work. Would it make sense for a country with multiple languages, let's pick a country like Nigeria. It isn't too small, has a thriving business and cultural life, and is a fairly prominent country. They also have students who live in tiny villages, religious issues between Muslims and non-Muslims, large portions of the student body who live in poverty\u2026 I picked this country because of their diverse situations as an example. Most countries are in similar situations due to changing demographics, fluidity of economics, and technology. Countries like Mexico charge students for school beyond 6th gtade, so their public schools are filled with the working poor. Hawii is like that too. Japanese students are under so much pressure to succeed they have issue with high suicide rates. Each school takes what they get, educates them using guidelines they feel are current and useful and sends students to the next level, be it a job or university. ",

            "answer_text": "Every year, the World Economic Forum releases its Global Competitiveness Report on the state of the world's economies. The WEF looks at data on areas as varied as the soundness of banks to the sophistication of businesses in each country. It then uses the data to compile a picture of the economy of almost every country on earth. Countries were ranked according to the \"12 pillars of competitiveness,\" which includes macro-economic environment, infrastructure, health and primary education, and labour market efficiency. 1. Finland: 6.7 Finland routinely tops rankings of global education systems and is famous for having no banding systems \u2014 all pupils, regardless of ability, are taught in the same classes. As a result, the gap between the weakest and the strongest pupils is the smallest in the world. Finnish schools also give relatively little homework and have only one mandatory test at age 16. 2. Switzerland: 6.2 Just 5% of children attend private schools in Switzerland. Lessons are taught in different languages depending on the region of Switzerland, with German, French or Italian the most common languages of instruction. From secondary onwards students are separated by ability. =3. Belgium: 6.2 Belgium has four different genres of secondary schools, namely general secondary schools, technical secondary schools, vocational secondary education schools, and art secondary education institutions. The Fulbright Commission in the US, which organises student exchanges with Belgium and Luxembourg says: \"Education enjoys high priority, and the largest share of the regional governments\u2019 annual budget in Belgium. Complete systems of public and private schools are available to all children between the ages of 4 and 18, at little or no cost. 4. Singapore: 6.1 Singapore scores incredibly highly in the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) tests, which aim to measure and compare the performance of students across different countries. However, the school system also has a reputation as being a pressure cooker, putting students under a lot of stress at a young age. 5. Netherlands: 5.9 Dutch children were found to be the happiest in the world in a 2013 Unicef study, leading the way globally educational well-being among others. Schools typically don't give much homework until secondary level and students report little pressure and stress. Schools are divided between faith schools and \"neutral\" state schools, with only a small number of private schools. =6. Ireland: 5.8 The majority of secondary schools in Ireland are privately owned and managed but state-funded, but there are also state comprehensives and vocational schools. However, a recent report shows that Ireland's spending on education fell 15% behind the developed world during the height of the financial crisis, 2008 to 2013, suggesting its education system could suffer in future. =7. Qatar: 5.8 The BBC reported in 2012 that oil-rich Qatar was \"becoming one of the most significant players in the field of education innovation, supporting a raft of projects from grassroots basic literacy through to high-end university research.\" The country is investing heavily in improving educational standards as part of its Vision 2030 programme to make the country self-sufficient. Government-funded schools offer free education but only to Qatari citizens and most foreign nationals tend to send their children to private schools 8. Estonia: 5.7 Estonia spends around 4% of its GDP on education, according to 2015 figures. The country's 1992 Education Act says that the goals of education are \"to create favourable conditions for the development of personality, family and the Estonian nation; to promote the development of ethnic minorities, economic, political and cultural life in Estonia and the preservation of nature in the global economic and cultural context; to teach the values of citizenship; and to set up the prerequisites for creating a tradition of lifelong learning nation-wide =9. New Zealand: 5.6 Primary and secondary education in New Zealand runs from aged 5 to aged 19, with school compulsory between 6 and 16. There are three types of secondary schools in New Zealand: state schools educate approximately 85% of students, state-integrated schools \u2014 private schools that have been integrated into the state but keep their special charter \u2014 educate 12%, and private schools educate 3%. 10. Barbados: 5.9 The Barbados government has invested heavily in education, resulting in a literacy rate of 98%, one of the highest in the world. Primary runs from 4 to 11, with secondary 11 to 18. The majority of schools at both levels are state-owned and run. 11. Japan: 5.6 Japan is one of the top performing countries for literacy, science, and maths in the OECD group. Students go through six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, and three years of high school before deciding whether they want to go to university. High school is not compulsory but enrolment is close to 98%. ",

The documentary explores questions about how Finland was able to create rapid and sustainable change. If you happen to be in the Phoenix, AZ area, there is going to be a screening on July 14th at 6:00 pm at 3535 E. McDowell Road. Not in the area? You can find more screening times here. Interestingly enough, Finland wasn\u2019t trying to become the best - they were just trying to create equity, take off some of the pressure, let kids be kids and promote cooperation. They opted out of testing until recently. They didn\u2019t expect to score well. They were just thinking, \u201cHey - let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d It appears that creating life balance, letting kids be kids and letting kids self direct their own education/learning exploration is what made it work.

But all learning, whether it be providing a working well system for crops, or designing eco-friendly buildings rely on certain skills: math, reading, science, problem solving... A \"best\" education for any country is one that can be translated into advancements in real life.

But if the education system is judged on the basis of imparting all round, holistic, creative, innovative, sports, practicals academic, curricular, co-curricular activities & the genuine cum outstanding quality education to the students, then Finland is the country with the best model of education system in the world . Although Finland was once the table toper in Mathematics, Science & Reading until 2012, now they are in the 5th spot as of the 2017 rankings but still ensures that Finland has been in the top 5 till date in the field of the academics. Unfortunately every test used for judging a country\u2019s education performance & ranking in the past,the present & most probably in the future is solely based on the marks(academics) in the field of Mathematics, Science & Reading. As a result, South Korea tops the table in this aspect.

What's interesting, according to those who've studied it is that they take kind of opposite approaches. South Korea's primary education is highly structured, emphasizing memorization, long hours and lots of homework. Finland, on the other hand, apparently has a much less structured system, which emphasizes critical thinking, curiosity and real world applications. I think the constant in countries with the best education is that they attract the best and most skilled teachers, usually pay them well, and give them a great deal of support. ",

BTW I'm not from any of free above mentioned countries! You may not have been surprised by Finland but newzealand might have surprised u! Let me justify!! For starters Newzealand has the numero Uno standard of living in the entire world. For a Nation that is so isolated, I would be impossible to maintain such a great standards of living without proper education system. The education system in Newzealand is a three-tier model which includes primary and intermediate schools, followed by secondary schools (high schools) and tertiary education at universities and/or polytechnic. The academic year in New Zealand varies between institutions, but generally runs from early February until mid-December for primary schools, late January to late November or early December for secondary schools, and polytechnics, and from late February until mid-November for universities. However, newzealand has its own problems too. Bullying is the most widely spread one. Nevertheless it stands among the top in the world! ",

How many seek such a job in India. The estimate is nearly 20 Crore people, nearly one person in every five houses seeks Govt jobs? The leaders LIE through their teeth and the idots believe it. Present Government came to power through several unrealisable promises including generating 2 Crore Jobs a year. Was it delivered? No , because, if our leaders have so much knowledge we will not have so much of poverty and social disturbance. All they can do is to go on an annual pilgrimage to DAVOS give a lunch for RS 1 core a CEO, offer them that they can loot our country and stash the wealth out of the country and they, if convinced will start an company and provide jobs. Our Education system creates Glorified CLERKS for every domain. They are totally learning resistant and thinking disabled. A good education system should create Curious minds which are Learning enabled and educate the students on various thinking skills. When such students come out of the education system the first casuality will be our political leaders. The citizen when acquiring thinking skills will find that our leaders are no different from British Colonial rulers who looted the country, So dont worry. Our education system will not be changed for a long time to come. Today even highly placed and lettered people are unaware that Centre is run mostly with GDP Monetised and not with Tax money alone. They question Farmer subsity saying it is their Tax money. The learning disabled do not know that Farmers contribute 16% through GDP and some more through paying several indirect taxes. But they have been exploited by every leaders-includingFarmer leadrs - for generations. When the educated understand the implications of economic decisions of every government, the reasons of poverty, social unrest, the education system will be worth its existence. Now itdervers to be totally scrapped. ",

That being said I'm going to assume you mean which country's pupils score the highest on standardized tests in certain subject matters.  The answer to that is Singapore for math and science and despite the propaganda about school spending and other things the real reason is because the Asian culture highly values education. In many Asian countries being a school teacher is amongst the same social ranks as a doctor or an attorney. The students are disciplined. Corporal punishment is not only allowed but encouraged by the government. The social pressure on students to excel is immense. So immense that student suicide is highest in Asian than anywhere else in the world. A student not doing well in a national exam is considered a reflection and shame on the parents. Which segways into the parents investing a lot into their child's education. Families will go without food on occasion in order to send their child to the best schools. Parents take an active role in their child's education. ",

The old 6-5-3-3 system was changed to a 6-3-3-4 system (6 years of elementary school, 3 years of junior high school, 3 years of senior high school and 4 years of university) with reference to the American system.

With universities across the world focusing on high-quality education, it has become very easy for students to travel across countries for higher education in search of better opportunities and future. But how can one select the best country to study abroad? Well, a country\u2019s education system is a mirror into its values and beliefs towards learning. Leverage Edu is here to help you explore the countries having an excellent education system. UK Home to the oldest academic institutions in the world, the UK is internationally known as one of the leading countries with the best education system. Renowned UK universities have nurtured globally acclaimed scholars and thinkers of all times. The education system in the UK is divided into 4 sections - Primary Education, Secondary Education, Further Education and Higher Education. Primary education is compulsory in the UK. During the secondary level of education, students have to take the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) or some other national-level certified exam to qualify for the next stage. Further Education, as well as Higher Education, are optional in nature. Students get a chance to directly get placed into the industry after completing secondary education. CanadaThe Canadian Education system is propounded by the federal government which ensures that the quality and standards are maintained par excellence. Canada has invested heavily in its education sector and this has been evident with the fact that it has emerged as one of the top countries with the best education system. The Canadian government also offers high subsidies to students to support educational opportunities for everyone. The education system of Canada is divided into three parts: Primary, Secondary and Post-Secondary. Children start their schooling at the age of 5 and complete it at the age of 18-20. Home to over 90 higher learning institutions, the diversity in programs and costs makes Canada a hotspot of international students. USABeing a federal district housing 50 states, the USA has a distinct education system which is not entirely regulated by the country\u2019s government. Rather, the higher education apparatuses are either managed by independent groups of people or trustees or distributed between state and local governments. Amongst one of the world\u2019s prominent countries with the best education system, it has formulated 4 levels: Elementary School, Middle School, Junior School and High School. The students are evaluated with grades rather than marks. The country\u2019s higher educational institutes and universities have strived to maintain excellence in terms of teaching and learning methods. Australia The Australian education system is divided into 3 central levels, i.e. Primary, Secondary and Senior Secondary. The primary stage of education comprises 7-8 years of schooling, the secondary level constitutes of 3-4 years and senior secondary level is mainly of 2 years. The reason why we have added Australia to our list of countries with the best education system is that the country has formed the unique Australian Qualification Framework under which the majority of its universities are registered. This framework regulates the higher learning institutions of the country and ensures that they impart quality education at affordable rates. GermanyGermany\u2019s education system works under the principle of \u2018Grundgestez\u2019 which means integral law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The country has developed a disciplined educational apparatus and imparts education that is coupled with the teaching of morals and values to its citizens. If you are planning to study in Germany, you should know that education is divided into 5 levels - Early Childhood Education, Primary Education, Secondary Education, Tertiary Education and Continuing education. It is also amongst one of the renowned countries with the best education system and has a six-mark grading system in which 1 denotes \u2018outstanding\u2019 and 6 signifies \u2018very poor\u2019. ",

And while most of them, like for example Times Higher Education, focus more on the performance and ranking of universities, other aim to present valuable data involving all educational levels within different countries. In this article, you will learn about ten of the best education systems in the world for 2019 according to the widely appreciated and followed US News & World Report. With a combination of scores involving attendance, development and quality in a variety of countries, the report brings up 6 European countries, 2 North American and 2 from Asia and Australia as leading examples of top education: Rank: Country: GDP (nominal, $): 1. United Kingdom 2.8 trillion 2. United States 21.3 trillion 3. Canada 1.8 trillion 4. Germany 4.0 trillion 5. France 2.7 trillion 6. Australia 1.5 trillion 7. Switzerland 703.7 billion 8. Sweden 550.0 billion 9. Japan 5.1 trillion 10. Netherlands 850.0 billion Interestingly, the majority of the countries above have remained at the same rank as in 2018, with only Sweden exchanging places with Japan and the Netherlands climbing into the top 10 on the account of Denmark. Furthermore, the overall ranking shows that there is a total of 8 unique languages which are either fully or partially official for the respective countries and of course, for the different levels of education. These are Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Romansh and Swedish. So if you even consider choosing the best Masters study destination abroad, make sure to consider some of these countries \u2013 as they can certainly meet many personal language requirements. But what about affordability? Indeed, for a future Masters student, costs and tuition fees are a key factor. And after looking at the economies and their latest GDP rates in the table above, you might be thinking - they all have a high living standard. However, that is no reason to claim that none of the top 10 have low or no cost higher education opportunities, especially at state universities ",

Overall literacy and graduation rates are important. Also, what percentage of grades are publicly funded and free for college kids to attend? Countries on top of this list even have high rates of graduates happening to higher degrees. Here may be a list of the five countries that rank among the simplest education systems within the world and therefore the five that are leaving their students far behind. 10 Finland What puts this Scandinavian country on the highest of the list of best education systems? Among other things, their system does well: free school meals through all grades, well-respected teachers, and a \u201clearn through play\u201d strategy of education. Not only do they need consistently high literacy rates (99% in 2018) and grade completion, but they even have good student/teacher ratios. In 2014, Finland averaged about 13 students per teacher in grade school. Finland is the model for public education. 9 Japan Japan\u2019s famously rigorous teaching system starts early, and Japanese students spend longer within the classroom than the other country\u2019s students. Japanese students consistently place higher in standardized testing, but which will be a function of the competitive school culture instead of that specialize in student needs. highschool isn\u2019t mandatory, but the enrollment rate is 98%. to urge into the competitive high schools, many Japanese students steel themselves against the doorway exams in after-school prep. it isn\u2019t surprising that Japan features a 99% literacy rate, but did you recognize they even have a 99.99% school attendance rate? Students don\u2019t skip class during this highly competitive culture. \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47  Originally published at The Best And Worst Education Systems In The World - LbniPro | Smarter Living ",

Often, discussions or statistics about US schools, or education in general focus only on government education. Today, there are large and varied private options for education, some great and some not so good. These can be expensive, but many have options to help at least some that would not normally be able to afford it. In Memphis, TN, back in the 1990\u2019s, the Catholic Diocese had a huge fundraising drive to re-open Catholic elementary schools that were in low income, underserved areas. While all families were expected to pay something, the schools were heavily subsidized by the Diocese. Only a small percentage of the students were Catholic and many of the families were desperate for an option to their local public school. So, there is really no answer. There are some excellent schools in Haiti when you consider the conditions they function under and what they are able to accomplish. ",

This has prompted an extensive feeling of accomplishment in Finland and East Asia and unending hand-wringing and head-scratching in the West. When all is said in done, classroom guideline in Singapore is very scripted and uniform over all levels and subjects. Instructing is sound, fit-for-reason and even minded, drawing on a scope of pedagogical conventions, both Eastern and Western. All things considered, instructing in Singapore fundamentally concentrates on scope of the educational programs, the transmission of truthful and procedural learning, and get ready students for end-of-semester and national high stakes examinations. Also, in light of the fact that they do, teachers depend intensely on textbooks, worksheets, worked illustrations and heaps of drill and practice. They additionally firmly stress dominance of particular systems and the capacity to speak to issues unmistakably, particularly in arithmetic. Classroom talk is teacher-overwhelmed and for the most part keeps away from amplified exchange. Singapore's instruction framework is the result of an unmistakable, even special, arrangement of authentic, institutional and social impacts. These components go far to clarify why the instructive framework is particularly compelling in the present evaluation environment. ",

There was a documentary by Micheal Moore called \u2018Where to invade next\u2019 where he visit a school there. You should check it out. Even the food in the cafeteria is top notch. They give more emphasis to play time and the overall well being of the children. Finland is also the happiest country in the world according to the World Happiness Index. This education system must surely contribute to that. I actually came across a website a while back that did pretty good job at analyzing the education system. Which countries have the best education system and why? (Had to search search a little to find it lol) ",

The best education prepares us for the uncertainty of the future - a future we can\u2019t grasp presently. No one knows what the world will look like in five years, or in a decade. And yet, we\u2019re educating them based on a system developed to suit present needs and expectations. The best educations don\u2019t squander the freedom and right to explore the creative and critical-thinking skills, and don\u2019t stigmatise mistakes. Education isn\u2019t meant to be packaged into a system to begin with, where humans follow a structure or methodology - it\u2019s taking every unique individual, each with their own unique capabilities, putting them through the present structure of the education system, and then expecting them to fit the mould in ten year\u2019s time.

After a little research over Internet and balancing the things I've heard from my surroundings till date, Here's what I've got as a conclusion.The crown of the best education system goes to South Korea.  \u200b\u200bReason:Do you know that children in South Korea attend school often seven-day a week? The national education budget estimated last year was $11,300,000,000. Korean is the primary language and learning mode of the country. The literacy rate is total 97.9% out of which males are sharing 99.2% and 96.6% of females. Korea\u2019s economic development and prosperity is a proof to its development and innovation in education. Apart, from Korean, strong efforts have been made to pour quality English language in the education systems. The GDP (PPP) per capita estimated in 2014 is $34,795. And all of these things are really incomparable. Source: www.whichcountry.co Thanks again. ",

From my experience at being a part of GudSkool - Interactive Learning for K-12, I can say that technology has played a key role in making these countries so successful. The schools, students and teachers have adopted technology completely and students in these countries can get to choose what to study, when to study and how to study. This flexibility is giving these young kids the freedom to control the way they want to acquire knowledge. ",

Overall lack of funding makes for a somewhat run-down environment.  - Norway: More distant teachers. Coordinators taking vacations without notice. Everything closes quite early at school. Very structured student social life. Everything is new and shinny.  - Iceland: Rather friendly teacher-student relationship and good quality of teaching overall. Lots of social events happening through the campus as well. Good facilities but too little space and too many students.  Hope this helps ! ",

These days from what could be found superficially on Google, China is leading the results, but again it's suspects that Chinese have stated preparing their students specifically for this test.Anyways,this test only analyses the school level education, how strong is primary middle school education system in shaping the minds of their students.

The present Finnish education system consists of daycare programs (for babies and toddlers) and a one-year \"pre-school\" (or kindergarten for six-year-old); a nine-year compulsory basic comprehensive school (starting at age seven and ending at the age of fifteen); post-compulsory secondary general academic and vocational education; higher education (University and University of Applied Sciences); and adult (lifelong, continuing) education. The Finnish strategy for achieving equality and excellence in education has been based on constructing a publicly funded comprehensive school system without selecting, tracking, or streaming students during their common basic education.Part of the strategy has been to spread the school network so that pupils have a school near their homes whenever possible or, if this is not feasible, e.g. in rural areas, to provide free transportation to more widely dispersed schools. Inclusive special education within the classroom and instructional efforts to minimize low achievement are also typical of Nordic educational systems. ",

Science and universities all have researched and brought fort possible optimal methods of learning for certain ages on average. But once you compare that research to practice. Very few follow it or are up to date with it. Nor is anyone allocating enough resources to optimise it. Good enough is what flows trough most systems. One could look at the average knowledge of a population but that also hinges on culture and how that population views knowledge. Or one could look at university averages or grades but again that relies as well on the culture and the population.

No test or evaluation can document whether a method works or not because the method is only a small part of the whole eduaction of a person.

You only retain what they explained to you in a style that YOU understand, and you forget whatever didn\u2019t resonate with your own personal style. However, whenever you teach yourself, you\u2019re bound to remember just about everything. Hopefully this answers your question correctly. ",

However, Singapore and Dubai also are possible study destinations for engineering and management courses. Europe is suitable only for a few disciplines, e.g. Russia for medicine. The main problem in Europe will be the language, because English is not widely spoken in many European countries.

I would think less about where countries have been, and more about their appetite for change as online learning becomes pervasive.  The us higher ed system is showing good signs of embracing online, albeit with first gen systems that probably won't serve more than the top 1% well.  But if they are willing to rethink what it means to be a university in the online world, then as the systems improve, they should be able to take advantage.  In the k12 space, the countries with the greatest opportunity to leapfrog and use online learning as a strategic part of their systems are most likely the ones with the least investment in their institutions and the greatest problems - india and Africa probably.

In School level Student just pass every grade with good score card so they can reach to next grade and after that mostly join engineering colleges as we all know now days engineering degree is in trade. The main problem start here is that most of colleges don\u2019t have well educated teacher who passionate about teaching and who can teach with different style and also the pays are very less to the teachers. In India education is just a another business for so called Businessman. Nobody give shit about quality education.Owner of school and colleges they just want to make good money thats all.Right now in India most of student has degree but they don\u2019t have jobs, the reason behind it simple they don\u2019t have proper knowledge still they have degree.
