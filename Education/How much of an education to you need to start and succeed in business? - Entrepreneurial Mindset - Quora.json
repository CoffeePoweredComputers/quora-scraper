            "answer_text": "If you are familiar with degree names like BS, MS, Ph.D., then a entrepreneurship is equivalent to 5\u20136 Ph.D. worth of study, learning and education. (or more) To succeed in business you need three types of knowledge: general broad knowledge (like EE, ME, history, MBA, etc);deep knowledge about a industry and market sector;skills of how to build and craft a product or at least MVP;knowledge about how to run a business in real world;knowledge about how to build a business in real world.You can go to schools and library to obtain type 1 knowledge. All the rest are learned by self education through experience and \u201cfailures\u201d - learning stuff that is not taught systematically. Actually, learning as you are diving and failing. The failure is the only real learning. You can have three Ph.D. degrees in EE, ME and Economics and still don\u2019t know a thing about how business really really work (high and low, good and bad). How to BUILD a business is a skill that even CEOs of big Fortune 500 companies may not have. It is the capturing of timing and applying your skills for your target audience. It makes entrepreneurs and founders a special class of people. If we use military analogy, you can go to West Point or the Naval Academy and graduate, but you have never been in a real war or a beach landing. You need to practice, in real wars. Founder and entrepreneur is a very special breed of people. Their education is very non-conventional. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what kind of business you want to start . And also what you mean by education, there are two types of education\u2026 formal and informal education. I recommend the second one because structures come with shackles (when it comes to the first one). But back to the topic, I really think it's about the person you should become instead of thinking how much you should learn. At the beginning you probably won't have employees. You have to spread yourself thin on knowing the following: Accounting, Economics, Sales and Marketing, AI (as it's becoming an integral part of our daily lives apparently) etc. I don't think knowing enough cuts it in business ,you have to know more than your competitors. You should execute better than your competitors. Market your products or services better than your competitors. Which means you have to educate yourself on your competitors, what do they do ,how can you do it better with less effort? Speaking of effort, find out how you can leverage other people's time, money, resources. If you become a person who regularly reads \u2026especially business books ,it should and can become second nature. And one other that is definitely a must have is making shit up as you go . Life is spontaneous, you can't plan for everything. The only constant thing in life is change ",

            "answer_text": "This is really impossible to answer as \u201cbusiness\u201d is totally undefined. Lots of people have succeeded in small businesses of all types with just a grade school education, but most didn\u2019t have a million in the bank when they retired. I would & have argued that the most important thing you need to succeed in any business (large or small) is a great ability to judge people you hire or contract with. Anecdotes are published on this in various ways, but one which was quoted/reprinted in Quora was that 2/3rds of startups failed because of founder disagreements. Startups test everyone\u2019s ability to deal with many stresses, things that break, getting launched on minimal funds, vendors that don\u2019t deliver what they said, people who don\u2019t show up. That just goes with the nature of startups and you must think logically far in advance to minimize those disruptions. You have to pick compatible & honest people to work with. When you make a mistake and a person is \u201cright\u201d, you have to fire them or forget them quickly and move on. Hoping a sociopath will change does not work. So the ultimate education for getting \u201cin business\u201d is an education in human psychology, covering all the good and bad types of people and particularly the \u201cDark Triad\u201d types. If you don\u2019t know what that term means and how those people operate, you are NOT ready for business. You need to study more human psychology. Everyone makes mistakes and the good business people find & fix them very quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "Education is poor preparation really since it\u2019s focus is on conformity to the convenience of the instructors, keep quiet about disagreements, believe everything they say without contradiction or qualification, keep research very narrowly to approved topics and shallow depth with a focus on process rather than discovery, rely on obsolete information solely (what\u2019s in the textbook, lesson), and focus on trivial rewards for completely pointless busywork. The longer you\u2019re formally educated, the more difficult those habits are to break for entrepreneurship and the more readily you can work as a highly circumscribed minion in a large organization, preferably government where results don\u2019t matter and process does, just like school. You never have enough knowledge and skills for business, even if you\u2019re 50 or 70, and most of what you need you\u2019ll discover suddenly and learn informally from suppliers, customers, competitors, regulators, advisors, books, industry conferences, workshops, and observation (trial and error is far too expensive too while books are the cheapest and fastest learning.) A surprising number of the most accomplished businessmen of the past 150 years had 8 years or less of formal education while a great many failures had completed MBA\u2019s from top business schools (and the little educated were in much more complex businesses than the MBA\u2019s usually were in. In your own business without constraints beyond time and energy you\u2019ll learn at a far faster rate and much more broadly (and deeply) than the slow, padded pace of K-12 schooling and to a lesser extent, higher education (which ignores application and skills too much.) Deep technical knowledge will help you a lot and most of that\u2019s self-acquired, you can go as fast as you can go with self-study. ",

A machine shop business? A research and development business? A coffee shop business? Again, I ask, what kind of business? The answer to your question is totally dictated by the answer to this question, \u201cWhat kind of business?\u201d As you can probably speculate from the multitude of businesses, educational requirements will differ, depending on the type of business. Your educational requirements can be everything from zero education to multiple years of secondary education and to the point of needing a doctorate degree. With your question being so wide open or vague, the first thing you need to do is determine what type of business you want to start. Most successful businesses serve people by doing 3 things. If you want to start a business, but don't know where to start, look around you and follow my 3 F's. My 3 F's: Find a problem.Formulate a solution to that problem.Figure out how to get people to pay for that solution.In most situations, you DO NOT need an education to do that. ",

Success in business requires you to be passionate about the type of business into which you want to enter and regardless of what anyone else says, you need to be comfortable working WITH other people to some extent. As long as you have passion, determination, and drive, you can achieve success in education which, as you can see, can take many forms. ",
