            "answer_text": "British Universities are regulated to a much higher degree (pardon the pun) than US ones. This means that there is not a ranking of degrees based on which university it is from. I would also say that the academic standard of a UK bachelors degree is higher than a US one. I have a bachelors degree from a British university (University of Newcastle upon Tyne, 1974), when I had to have it scrutinized in order to get a US Professional Engineering license, it was reviewed by an engineering professor at the state university. He stated that it was the equivalent of 185 credit hours, a US ABET approved engineering degree requires about 130 credit hours. I have read in US books that a British undergad course is like a US grad school. Here are two other issues : 1 That 185 credit hours was done in three years. That is the norm in the UK. 2 The entry level in a UK university is higher. Since retiring as an engineer I have become a substitute teacher. I teach honors math, physics and chemistry classes all of which are about 2 years behind what I did at their age. I had 3 years of calculus before I went to university, that is normal in the UK. Obviously the US has some great universities, Caltech, Harvard, Yale, MIT etc but also has some that can be described as rubbish or even fraudulent eg trump University. From what I have seen, a US undergrad class runs just like high school, small group, the professor takes attendance then teaches and checks that everyone has caught on. A UK university runs on lectures, the professor will come in and start lecturing, some of the lectures that I attended had over 200 students there. If you didn\u2019t understand something you have three choices, go to a tutorial class where a grad student will explain it to you, go and see the professor if you can catch him or figure it out from a book.

            "answer_text": "This issue gets me into trouble a lot !! I have degrees from Canada, America, and England. I have experience lots of differences and similarities. There are UK universities better than US universities and vice versa when it comes to rankings. It also depends on you, what you like !! Do you like constant exams and assignments then US university is for you, do you like to submit everything and do exams by the end of the academic year then go UK ! In my opinion, which is only mine not anyone else and I don\u2019t want to generalize here, so let\u2019s just confirm it\u2019s only my opinion that is based on my own experience, I think US universities education is much better than UK because I\u2019m that type of person who would rather to be tested multiple times for every class so information can get stuck in my head and learn from my mistakes. In England you only get 1 exam for that class, only one shot and it could worth 60% sometimes 80%, how could I learn my mistakes from one exam plus one exam is so frustrating !! how if I was tired that day ?? or if I was very nervous ?? I had a class that worth 80% and the project worth 20% .. I was sweating like an ocean in the exam room !!! I passed but barely !! and it was hard exam, but the question here did I learn from that exam ? the answer is NO !! ? The reason for the exam is to test your abilities and at the same time you learn your mistakes so next exam if this information that you messed up in your previous exams showed up again in mid-terms or final, or even project you would be ready for it, so this only happens in American and Canadian systems not in the UK. Sorry British friends ! I went to Newcastle University in North-East of England to do a master\u2019s degree which is a great university, but I think I learned a lot when I went to Penn State, USC, and UBC. Keep in mind top US universities many of them have more facilities than any UK university. US universities tend to be huge and and more fun. I had fun in England but it\u2019s nothing like the ones I had in America. Canada is boring as shit .. I didn\u2019t like it that much even though the people are super friendly. If you like education and fun, my advice go Florida, California, or Arizona. They have top universities with extra fun ;) ",

In my own field, South Asian history / studies, I think U.S. schools were better, but in the late 1990s that changed, and now I think U.K. schools have the advantage. I imagine this kind of back-and-forth is true for other fields and sub-fields. ",
