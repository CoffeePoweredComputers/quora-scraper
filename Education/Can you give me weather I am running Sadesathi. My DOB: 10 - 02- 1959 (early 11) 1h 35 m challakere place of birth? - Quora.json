            "answer_text": "No Sir. Your Sade Sati isn't running. You are Pisces Moon around 3 Degrees. Your Sade Sati will start when Saturn crosses 18 Degrees in Aquarius Sign. Kindly always write your DOB as 11 - 02 - 1959. Avoid mixing up two calendar systems, it creates confusion. In Georgian Calender System day changes at 00:00:00 ( 12:00 AM) and In our Vikram Samvat, day begins at Sunrise. Date Format DD - MM - YYYY belongs to Georgian Calender System so your DOB will be always written as 11 - 02 - 1959. I am sure, someone would have looked at your chart by entering 10 - 02 - 1959 and told you that you're going through the Sade Sati. Hope it helps. Thank You. ",
