            "answer_text": "I do not know why people do not consider health education important. Few things, if any, are more important than the health so many of us take for granted. teenagers are especially ignorant about it when they actually need to know about it. I have been asked more than once by an adolescent girl if it was possible for her to get pregnant if she had sex while standing up. Seems there was a time when boys were trying to sell that to girls quite often. I had to explain to them how very hard those male sperm competed to get to be the one to fertilize an ovum and that a little gravity was not going to affect the process at all. But that was back in the early 70\u2019s, fifty years ago. I hope they know better now. Especially when it comes to issues like birth control and pregnancy that can have a profound emotional effect on so many young people when they are starting out in life. But the value of exercise, diet and cleanliness and knowledge about the effects of so many illegal substances and even drugs that are used to enhance athletic performance is also extremely important in this day and age.
