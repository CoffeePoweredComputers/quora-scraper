Admission in NIOS is valid for 5 years. If you do not succeed at first attempt, then you can try through ODES (On-Demand Examination System) (only if the subject that you have selected is in the list of ODES). there you can attempt as per your convenience. You can also attempt in the second Public Exam i.e., Oct-Nov Exams. Don\u2019t loose heart if you don\u2019t succeed, just try-try again!!! Here is the link for ODES https://nios.ac.in/on-demand-examination.aspx ",
