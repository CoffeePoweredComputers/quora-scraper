            "answer_text": "Depends on the job and the certificate. they show you care enough to try and stay current within your industry and that you are using what you have available to do so. They won\u2019t replace a degree but will show an employer that you are interested in training. As far as getting you a job? No. I don\u2019t think so. Only if you are neck and neck and the certification is the only difference ( and desirable to the employer) ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. I edit manuscripts for post-grad students here in Sri Lanka (where I now live) and have been doing it for more than 2 years. While I initially used online sites like Upwork and WritersOnline to source these projects, right now I work with a local agency who does this type of jobs, and one of the main reasons why I was hired for this part-time position was due to my certification in Chicago and API style editing. I enrolled for the API style course in Coursera and got certified in 8 weeks. Now I wouldn\u2019t say that only the certification helped me because I also had an experience, but it suffices to say that such certifications, despite online and virtual, have some effect on your resume and LinkedIn profile. But you will have to be constantly focused while taking such courses. Good luck! ",
