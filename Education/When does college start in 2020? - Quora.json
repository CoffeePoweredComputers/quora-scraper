            "answer_text": "In general, if you are talking about courses then most colleges if not all will continue as scheduled. However, I assume that this question if asking about in-person classes and actually going to colleges. Actually, right now a lot of colleges are preparing to continue with in-person classes, but take extra precautions during the classes and lectures. Some colleges are also doing something where they are allowing students to come in-person until Thanksgiving and then going online for the rest of the semester. This is because they don\u2019t want people going back to their households and bringing back cases of COVID. However, to basically answer your question you should assume that colleges will not be back to normal until about January of the spring semester. ",
