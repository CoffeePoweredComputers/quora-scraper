            "answer_text": "Lack of Inspiration. That is the thing which acts as root of your sturggle. You always get distracted because your mind is not aiming for anything. Our mind needs some inspiration to keep thinking about. And when it doesn\u2019t get what is needed, then our mind starts to get disrtacted somewhere else. Find your inspiration and then, nothing will be able to distract you from your aim. Ask again if you face difficulties in finding your inspiration. I hope it helps. ",

Don\u2019t keep pets near you. if there is too much noise listen to white noise while studying. Don\u2019t study in bed, couches or anything that is too comfortable, you will loose focus easily. Find motivation - benefits of studying or the shame of not passing exams. Set realistic targets and try to achieve - try 20 mins study and 10 mins rest as a starting point. ",
