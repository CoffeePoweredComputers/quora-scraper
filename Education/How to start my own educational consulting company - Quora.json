            "answer_text": "Obliviously you have completed step one. Congrats! More on that in a bit. I have had an educational consulting business for around 15 years. The name of my business is Consult Four Kids better known as C4K. We have had up to ten consultants, we have three areas of interest to our clients including our Live Technical Assistance, which includes consulting, training, keynotes, etc. Our second area is Virtual Educational Training which includes a library of over 400 archived videos, 13 courses that include e-Books, videos, quizzes, exams, etc. and an amazing learning management system. Finally, we have what we call our Academic Support Curriculum which includes over 2500 lesson plans, 150 bundles, packets, activities, units, and kits. We have served over thirty million youth and two million youth workers collectively. We have served districts across California and throughout the United States. We also started a non-profit named Entrusted Legacy about 7 years ago that have similar interest in helping youth and youth workers. We classify youth workers as Superintends. Assistant Superintendents, Principals, Assistant Principals, Teachers, Out of School-Expanded Learning Paraprofessionals including After-School, Preschool, Day Care, Coaches, Tutors, Instructional Aides, Secretaries, Yard Duty, Cafeteria Workers, Janitors, MOT, Crossing Guards, etc. We also support and help nontraditional educational youth workers including: Youth Pastors, Babysitters, Grand Parents, Parents, Aunts, Uncles, older siblings, or anyone else that may work with youth in a supervision or semi-supervisor role. We share universal topics that help all youth workers, what we really like to call Champions of youth including:\u201d The Trilogy, Fab Four, Fantastic Five, Super Seven, Elite Eight, Nifty Nine, etc. If we can help, specifically please let us know! If not the please see below and again congrats on step one. Starting a business is a three-step process. Step One You must have an idea. Start brainstorming including: What are you passionate about? What do you love-like? What are your hobbies? Look for trouble and figure ways to fix that trouble. Now that you have an idea start brainstorming the A-Z process on what you will need to do to get the ball rolling. Step Two you must get clients-customers. I developed an entire system that I call Engineered Structured Systems. A small part of that system is called Powerful Promotional which is broken down into three areas including: Beautiful Branding, Magic Marketing, Super Sales. Branding is long term-Macro-18 months plus. Marketing should ring the register within 30 days or less, mostly surrounding paid advertisements-Mezos and finally Sales which happens in the micro. So, if what you want sales in the immediate than I would go two directions at first. Natural Networking and Real Referrals. Please let me explain. Networking has a simple definition-It is making a list of people you know. Everyone knows 40,000 people and this is how. You know 200 people and they each no 200. Simple math 200 x 200 = 40,000! Natural Networking starts with your mom, dad, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandmas, grandpas, friends, acquaintances, and then go out to strangers. That is the best example of Natural Networking. When you get your first client ask them if they will help you by contacting their network including their family, friends, co-workers, acquaintances, etc. If they refuse, then go into Real Referrals-The simple definition is: You ask one of your contacts, if you can get one of their family members contact information, and you contact them. Networking you contact your friends and family, or you get someone else to contact their friends and family. Referrals is getting contact information from someone and you contact them yourself. The final part You could also try Traditional Methods. It is a way to get more attention which means getting more business. Traditional is all social media outlets including organic, paid advertisement as well as DM\u2019s. There is automated phone, phone dialer systems, text, emails, other more outdated and ineffective marketing such as gorilla marketing, snail mail, fax, radio, print ads, billboards, etc. Step Three Keep those clients and customers happy at all costs. Repeat business is always easier than acquiring new business. Finally, I would like to tell you a story that should help. The story is about a kid that was with his dad in the middle of the forest, it is nighttime, and I pitch black outside and it was also freezing cold inside their cabin. The boy wants to go to the wood pile to get some wood so he can start a fire, but he is scared. His dad says what are you afraid of you have a flashlight, correct. The boy said yes but, the wood pile is a 100 feet-meters away. The dad opened the door and said son, shine the light down towards the ground just about 20 inches ahead of your feet. The dad asked the boy what he saw, and the boy said one step. The dad said take that step, now what do you see, the boy again said one step. I think we all understand the morale of the story which is inch by inch is a cinch and mile by mile takes a while. Just Start! I hope this helps and Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Here is how you can start my own educational consulting company | Proven and highly recommended business strategies for Educational consulting companies!  1) Consider the demands of each school \u2014 If you are planning to sell to schools, understand that the requirements of each school may be different according to their size, type, location, etc. To make the perfect pitch, take into consideration their situation, and predict the probable needs. You can search for them online or take the help of your existing customers. 2) Scrutinize the needs of individuals \u2014 After you are done with searching about the school requirements, try to figure out the needs of each individual like teachers, professionals, school students, and even their parents. Remember, at the end of the day, parents are the ones who are going to do the funding. 3) Create a user-friendly & attractive website \u2014 Imagine you want to avail any service online, what will be your first step? You will search for the service and check the websites that offer the same, right? Therefore, it is essential to have a user-friendly and attractive website. Make sure your website layout is handy for both \u2014 mobile and desktop users. 4) Approach with empathy \u2014 The best way to approach your prospect in this situation of a pandemic is being empathetic towards them. Tell them that you understand how difficult it is to tackle the problems faced by every institution right now and your motive is to help them. 5) Do not pretend to be the expert \u2014 For instance, imagine a bird teaching a fish how to swim. Funny, right? The same thing happens when you do not have the expertise and try to teach your prospect. You are going to lose your deal if you try to be someone you are not. But, if you have the expertise, use it to your advantage. 6) Use your past success stories \u2014 Education field largely depends on peer recommendations and social proves. Tell your prospects about what your existing customers think about your product and how it has helped them improve their engagement. You can provide testimonials to your prospects as social proof of your product\u2019s success. 7) Offer services instead of discounts \u2014 When it comes to negotiation, offer your prospects services instead of huge discounts, for example, training sessions or workshops for students & teachers. This will assist you in increasing and maintaining your estimated annual revenue. 8) Use SEO friendly methods \u2014 Search Engine Optimization or SEO, in simple terms, means to increase traffic to your website through organic search engine results by using the right keywords. Applying SEO friendly methods means using those words in your content which you think your target audience would search the most. 9) Ensure easy implementation \u2014 People are going through one of the most stressful periods of their professional life. If you want to make conversions, make your implementation process easy. Most people tend to ignore complicated outcomes. Therefore, giving an easy solution would be the best way to turn your prospects into paid customers. 10) Focus on the students \u2014 Do not forget that the main motive of the EdTech sector is to provide education. Therefore, the star of your pitch should not be your product or teachers but the students. In the end, your product should prove beneficial for the students. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to be honest and say I don't know. I have helped out on three \"educational business plans\", and for the life of me, I still don't see the business case. I helped out because I believe that absent education we would all be savages. I helped out because I see the value. But I don't see the money. Maybe defining the problem might help, so I will ramble on about some of the issues.  At least in the european tradition, schooling was the responsibility of the roman catholic church. The other areas of interest to the church was the administration of hospitals and charitable organizations, down to orphanages. Then by AD 1200, the italians gave us the concept of \"school\" and \"university\" (Bologna being the first). That is, instruction as separate from the need of the church to educate its members. University intended for the purpose of administration of the City State. From there we got the modern notion of the State, Jurisprudence based on Roman models, accounting and the natural sciences, civil engineering (also based on Roman imperial models) and of course military sciences (well, because you could not expect priests to teach you how to kill people). That was the sum total of non-church education right up to AD1800.  When Napoleon came to power, he needed officers trained in mathematics, so he could shoot his canons. He simplified the italian parabola into a rough and ready \"french curve\". And off he went on his conquests. The notable thing was teaching mathematics. The next thing introduced was the \"timed exercise\" from which we get our \"timed exams\" and all manner of \"IQ Tests\". If you are in the business of saving souls, you can debate the issue for millenniums. If you got to shoot a cannon ball at a moving object, you got seconds to do the math. Our whole obsession with testing revolves around this \"meritocratic\" issue. The Nobleman might make a better leader, but if you want to shoot ordinance your officer can only be selected on the basis of his demonstrable ability to hit the enemy.  Most of the educational business enterprises, aka after skool programs, revolve around fixed answer, speed testing.  The greatest consequence of the French Revolution came from the organization of the \"communes\". To cut a very interesting story that fills volumes upon volumes, communism was born.  And the first order of the day for the new communist sympathizers was the elimination of State Skools, and Church Skools. Gramsci made it his battle cry a century later. Unless you take control of the educational system, you will never be able to indoctrinate your values into the population. By the time you are an adult your mind is already made up. Which why the Salesian order does not give a hoot about saving your soul after you have left skool: They teach children, nothing more. Which is also why the socialist left is hell bent on taking over adding \"national welfare systems\" or \"nationalizing medical care\". They want the Church out of the way. Because its a prerequisite to them taking over power. And the educational business revolves around those issues to this day. Absent control over education, there can be no Progressive Revolution. The French Revolutionaries during the Terror, or the Bolsheviks a century later, made it their first order of business to raid the Houses of Learning and murder the entire religious establishment. Communists the world over have all done the same thing. Chairman Mao murdered every single person with a \"western university education\". So the battle lines are drawn: the lefties (teachers unions and socialist members of parliamentary bodies) will do absolutely everything and anything, illegal, imoral or other wise to take religious organizations out of the skooling business. And they will do whatever is necessary, to turn the tax payer skool system into a tool of socialist indoctrination.  And then you have the economic elites, oligarchic or not, that raise the funds to train their children through private institutions. Last but never least, the military still run their academies, to teach the skills necessary to operate their organization. In most third world countries, the only shot you have at an education, is either attending a church skool or a military academy.  So you have the State, the Military, the Church and some Private institutions all competing for the same funds, all in direct opposition to each other. Each trying to undermine each other's educational goals. So the \"business\" side of the equation revolves around the following: If you want to join the state sector, it revolves around your socialist credentials. There is money to be made with the text books racket. There is the teacher's union racket. And absent any educational achievement to show for the vast amounts of money spent, there is the whole meritocracy racket revolving around the one correct answer timed examination racket. That's where most exam preparatory rackets operate. Then there are the religious organizations. And they have been running those charities for millenniums. And since monastic life is mostly outside the cash economy, there are slender picking there, because you are competing with people without a profit motive. The military do their thing efficiently. And mostly specifically to their needs. If they got to train you to fire something into something, the skills are specific to the equipment. Which only leaves the peripheral knowledge to be taught, like languages and history. The private educational institutions that cater to the elites, or those that want to join the elites, are generally better funded. But they are generally not looking to teach social justice, or employ alternatives teaching methods. There credo is, \"this the material, you better learn your grammar and your mathematics or your out\". There is money to be made in teaching \"speed deficit\" testing techniques. Because entrance to elite universities guarantees better employment opportunities. And because in banking, especially risk banking, requires speed of execution. You will not work on Wall St or in the City (of London) unless you got your logos down, and can do it at speed.  There is a whole nascent \"internet courseware\" business being developed. But even the better online learning operations, are run as charities. One of the better ones in the US is the Kahn Academy. Great project. But unless Bill Gates keeps sending the check, its not self fulfilling financially. And others are competing for them, with well funded risk money behind them. But there is the problem: you are competing with well endowed competitors with big charity money behind them. And I have yet to see the business case for them either.  A couple of areas where I have seen money made individually: 1) Entrance examinations preparation.2) University applications consulting.3) Emotionally distressed student coaching. And where I have seen very good money being made:4) Company/Technology Specific Certification Programs (MS, Cisco, Oracle etc).  So where you fit into this quagmire I don't know. I do know that vast sums of money are spent in the world on education. If you were to make a determination of where money goes, I would say: housing, education and health care.  And in advanced economies you are competing with subsidized housing, education and healthcare. You can make money individually in that context. But it would be hard to point out where you can make money running a school or a hospital. You can of course, but only if your interface to the State is mandated by law.  And that's not to discourage you. That's just to point out the environment within which you have to operate. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Can you be specific? I have been running an International Education Consulting Agency since 2011 and I had no \"real world\" experience at the time. I started out by advising students on internet forums and after a few years, I became the go-to guy on the topic. People stated emailing and texting and asking for my advise and so on, until my university found out and invited me to represent them in my country. That was the official start in 2011, and I just kept doing what I did. I still do it today, although I have less time to dedicate to it but it has been successful, in my opinion, and I'm quitting my full time job to go focus on it for good. Depending on how you choose to go about yours, I can guide you through because there are a few ways to do this. My way results in less schools but is more affordable to the students (which is one way we're different) and the other results in more schools and usually costs the students more. Let me know what you have, and we take it from there. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two elements to starting an educational consulting business - the same for any business. What particular knowledge, experience, insight or capabilities do you - and your associates - have that people are willing to pay for? So what difference can you make to educational establishments and educational businesses that will make paying your company worthwhile. If you have an answer which is credible and tested to that question then you can answer the second question. What is your market - and I don\u2019t mean it in the broadest sense but in the sense of who will be your first customer? If you know that, then you have a fighting chance because you will have a reference and without a reference you will find it very difficult to gain any traction. So it really depends upon your existing network - 9 times out of 10. This is not the only way because if you have an answer to the first question and a really strong marketing budget and the ability to survive for, say, six months without a customer, you can still win through.
