            "answer_text": "Probably. Before you get me wrong, read this, please. As the question says terrible grades, I assume they do. Why? Because when students that are not very good at something (or at school in general) try hard, their grades might be bad, but not terrible. When somebody gets terrible grades (from what I see in my school at least) is because they are not putting much effort (any effort) in getting better ones. I have a friend who finds school very difficult and challenging, but she tries hard, studies a lot and always brings the homework done. She\u2019s nlt been getting terrible grades, but they\u2019re not good either, I would call them \u201cbelow average\u201d. The teachers love her. There\u2019s another one (not really a friend) who does not care about school at all. He is always late (me too but let\u2019s ignore that), doesn\u2019t study nor does any homework (hardly), he sometimes turns blank exams in\u2026 He gets terrible grades. The teachers can\u2019t stand him. I\u2019m not a studying role model either, but I work a lot less than I could (even though it\u2019s way more than him) and I get really good grades. Most of my teachers love me, other don\u2019t. From what I observed, teachers dislike students who put no effort in what they\u2019re doing or don\u2019t care about them. Terrible grades usually mean no effort, and teachers are not amused by that. No effort can still achieve decent grades, but that\u2019s likely to go unnoticed. Good grades (or really good grades) can still be achieved with very little effort sometimes, and that\u2019s gonna drive some teachers crazy. Mad. Angry. Some teachers loves these students, lots of them do, but others can\u2019t stand them either. It\u2019s more about the attitude than about the grades. ",

            "answer_text": "No. If they are trying their best and are negatively affected by circumstances beyond their control, we have great sympathy and admiration for them. We also know that success in life is not determined by the grades you get at school, but by grit, determination and hard work, and we try to keep reminding them of this. It is terribly sad when an otherwise fabulous human being loses self confidence because their grades are poor. Newsflash! Your grades don\u2019t determine your worth as a human being. Plus, even with poor grades, you can still achieve your dreams. You just might have to take a non-traditional route to get there. However, if the student has the ability to get good grades but just can\u2019t be bothered, and is trying to soft-soap me with lies and excuses, then I don\u2019t have a lot of sympathy. Be honest with yourself. Are you really a hard worker, or would you just like me to think you are? I\u2019ve seen it all, kiddo, and any lie you can tell me, I\u2019ve heard a thousand times before.

            "answer_text": "Not at all. I don\u2019t dislike a student because of his or her grades. The reason I would dislike a student have to do with the same reasons people generally dislike others. Things that make me dislike a student include: Being mean to me.Being mean to other students.Bullying.Willful defiance.Making baseless accusations toward me.Frequently disrupting my class.Of course I want all my students to get good grades. I will do anything I can to help them achieve good grades. That even includes students who exhibit challenging behaviors like those listed above. But I don\u2019t dislike students who are unable to achieve academically in my class or any class solely because of their failure to achieve. That being said, most students who have extreme difficulties passing many or most of their classes usually do exhibit some of the above behaviors. So there is a correlation between poor conduct and poor grades. ",

Teacher often understand the reasons that the student has bad grades: poor parent support, bad attendance, difficulty with the subject, immaturity etc. Teacher often have a hard time with students who feel a strong sense of entitlement. Some kids feel that they are more deserving or priviledged that others. Often their own parents have convinced the child that they are superior to others. The parents will not accept their little darling broke a rule or hurt another students. Entitlement is obnoxious. ",
