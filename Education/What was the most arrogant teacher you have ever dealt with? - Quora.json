            "answer_text": "Ooh, I\u2019m about to call out my former teacher. I forgot her name, but I\u2019m going to go through my old assignments just to call her out.. MISS DONEGAN It\u2019s a shame that I don\u2019t know her first name.. If you live in Southern California at an Alliance public charter school, feel free to link her or @ her.. Oh, and feel free to add onto my rant.  Miss Dongean was my arrogant HOMEROOM adviser\u2026 She always gave off this vibe that she thinks she\u2019s above everyone just because she has authority. She practically hid behind it.. Miss Donegan felt she was entitled to glory or something because she protests a lot, she\u2019s a vegan and a feminist. She\u2019s anti-technology.. She\u2019s all about reduce, reuse, recycle.. Oh, she\u2019s so good. WOW :S And you know, I personally have nothing against any of those. Like go ahead don\u2019t eat meat, buy used stuff, protest for women\u2019s right, like good for you. BUT if you do all those things and you expect for people to treat you like some goddess, then FORGET YOU..  She also thinks she knows best, and that she\u2019s the smartest person in the room.. But like, no!! No, no, no.. She literally doesn\u2019t understand how words work.. READ A F****ING BOOK, MISS DONEGAN. Get off your stupid high horse, and mind your own goddamn business. Remember earlier I said, \u201cshe protests.\u201d Want to know how I magically found that out? My friend and I were talking about personal stuff, and Miss F**** Dongean finds the nerve to interrupt our conversation rudely.. PSA: If you want to make small talk, fine.. But if i\u2019m having a personal conversation, it\u2019s meant for their ears only, not yours\u2026 So, she starts interrupting, and then she verbally attacks me. First off, I did nothing to her. Why is she coming for me? So, I defend myself, and I say, \u201c I protest.\u201d And if you f**** know English and you can use 2nd grade context clues, you\u2019d understand, \u201cprotest,\u201d means to disagree\u2026. BUT NO. This stupid m****f***ing b**** starts being like, \u201cOh, you protest?\u201d in a bitchy attitude. Then she starts naming all the protests she\u2019s taken part of, then she says, \u201cI\u2019ve been to all of them, and I\u2019ve never seen you.\u201d WHY IS SHE COMING FOR ME? LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IS SHE STUPID? Is she literally giving me a hard time just so she can brag to her students so we know that she\u2019s deserving of glory? Like how the hell is talking about protests you\u2019ve participated in relevant to what we were talking about. IT\u2019S NOT. I didn\u2019t want her to look like a stupid idiot, and I didn\u2019t want to lose my cool, so i let it go. I didn\u2019t say anything..  Miss Donegan was a smart-ass, grade A b**** of a teacher, and that\u2019s fresh coming from me because I was an honors kid that got along with all my teachers\u2026 Never had a problem with any of them.. One day, again, I was minding my own business, talking to a girl I like, and I tell her, \u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d Then, guess who shows up from the back, and decided to interrupt? MISS DONEGAN, the one and only\u2026 Guess what the hell she said to me? I\u2019ll wait\u2026 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\u2026 SHE TOLD ME TO DO 30 PUSH UPS. FUCKING BITCH, like what do you mean? I was doing my own thing, minding my own business, telling a girl i\u2019m cold, and this b*** starts writing on the white board, and she tells me to do push ups.. I was confused to say the least.. It was random as hell, and I didn\u2019t connect the dots. So I responded, \u201cwhat?\u201d She repeats herself, this time everyone starts looking.. Again, I\u2019m like, \u201cwhat? no.\u201d Then, guess what this bitch says because it obviously doesn\u2019t end here. Remember? Grade A b*** of a teacher.. She turns around from the whiteboard, looks at me in the eye, in front of everyone, and she says, \u201cDo 30 push-ups,\u201d in a calm and psychotic voice, \u201cor else i\u2019m going to give you detention.\u201d DETENTION. Do you not see anything wrong with this woman yet? Or do you still think i\u2019m the crazy wild one that\u2019s giving a fake representation of reality\u2026 NOPE this is real life.. So, I asked her again, \u201cwhat?\u201d Shamefully, I must admit I still didn\u2019t connect the dots.. Would you though? Be honest. You\u2019re talking to a friend, you say your cold, and some crazy teacher tells you to do push ups.. Like it\u2019s random as hell. So she says, \u201cWell, you said your cold, So do push ups. It\u2019ll get you warm.\u201d And she was giving me this psycho look.. My peers were defending me saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d But she then threatened those kids saying, \u201cDo you want detention, too?\u201d She was dead serious.. Miss Donegan never made jokes. Everyone hated her\u2026 So, I was at a crossroad.. A) I know she can\u2019t make me.. I know that\u2019s not within her authority.. I know that\u2019s an abuse of power. I shouldn\u2019t do it. OR B) Do it. If I don\u2019t do it, people would think I can\u2019t do 30 push ups.. Here\u2019s my logic. If I didn\u2019t do it, the girl I liked wouldn\u2019t be impressed. She\u2019d think I can\u2019t even do 30 push ups.. And I knew for a fact that I could do more than 30\u2014 and not those weak push ups where you don\u2019t go even go that low.. So, I decided to do the push ups anyway, for the cred.. After that, people did talk about it.. I know for a fact that it spread beyond our grade level.. Idk, though..  There are so many more stories and more reasons why people hate this woman.. But that\u2019s all I got for this response because it\u2019s already long, BTW, I believe she went to work for another school in Northern California. If you know her, give her this link so she knows how much of an asshole she was ",

            "answer_text": "I don't mean to say anything which sounds disrespectful for a teacher but this is about an attitude which made her most arrogant and insensitive in the eyes of her student. Since childhood, I was very close to my Nani (Grandmother). I used to sleep with her. Like every other child, she was my best childhood stroyteller. She used to sung lullaby for me and I used to take best sleep ever by covering her from my little hand as a sense of security so she didn't leave me. She is my Gini. Whatever I desire I get it from her. Every year when I get new books and bag, she was always there to help in wrapping up the books . So coming to the real reason. At the age of year 10, I got admission in Navodaya Vidayalaya (One of the central gov. Schools in India) there I got a English teacher who used to teach senior class and unfortunately she was my hostel incharge too. It was the incidence of year 2005 July. I was in class 11th. Like every other day after the school we had our lunch. So after finishing my lunch, I was coming to hostel with my utensils in my hand and I noticed my cousin who is quite eleder to me standing at the hostel gate with a fade smile. I was quite elated as it was a surprise visit of my relative but next moment my smiling face turned into shock with unbelievable news. He told me my Nani got expire last night and he came to pic me up as she was missing me during her last breath. I burst out tears and my cousin started consoling me but it was quite hard for me to bare the fact of detachments with my Nani. As he (my cousin) himself felt helpless, he asked one or two girl from the hostel to consol me and by that time he went to the hostel incharge to ask for the permission to take me home. After sometime, he returned with an expression of hopelessness. He told me that, your ma'am has denied to grant the leave as leave are only allowed with parents or one of your local guardian. I was astonished to sense such biasness. She was the one who herself drop many girls to their home, if she has good terms with their parents and also she allowed some girls to go alone if they are from local. Keeping my emotions control, I went with red face of mine and requested her for the leave . She, with a annoyed tone replied to me: Rashmi, you are well aware with the rules and still you are adamant for the leave then you can go to the Principal. I was totally blank at that moment and without saying any word, I went to the Principal\u2019s abode and told about the urgency and requested for the leave. He consoled me first and then told my cousin, as per of policy, he is not able to accept the leave and it would be nice if you could send Rashmi's father to take her home. It was very painful to me bare all this that time, I was crying like hell and dying to come home and hug my mother. My cousin tried hard to console me, he said to me, it's a matter of one day, my father will come and take me home. After spending some more time, he get ready to leave and one more time he went to meet my hostel incharge. I was standing beside him. She was busy in doing some house chores. My cousin requested her with hopeful tone to take care of me as I am very upset and crying. Her reply was, please don't try to teach me my job. My cousin and me both get furious on such arrogant and insensitive attitude. None of us said anything and he left me crying behind. This is the attitude, I still remember and made her the most arrogant teacher I have ever seen. Thank you for reading. ",
