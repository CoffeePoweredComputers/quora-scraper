            "answer_text": "\u201cBad\u201d grades is a relative term. I didnt get straight Fs, or even a majority of Ds, but I was a slacker in high school. I was really only interested in a couple classes\u2026I seemed to excel at mechanical design and drafting, and generally got As in that class. Otherwise, I didnt even challenge myself, and probably squeaked by with a two point something GPA. This was in the early 1980s. It wasn't especially challenging to get into a decent state college or university, and I went, just like the rest of my friends. As I enjoyed mechanical design and drafting, I fancied myself in a mechanical engineering program. No one told me exactly what that was, but having \u201cengineer\u201d in the title sounded good. My parents didn't attend college, and we didn't really have the \u201ccollege tracks\u201d in our high school. We didn't have regular meetings with advisors and other counselors that could help coach me into a good college prep curriculum. More than anything else, my math skills were terrible. Had a bad experience in middle school with a pre-algebra teacher, and never really went back to it in high school. Once in college, I was 4 or 5 prerequisite math classes behind the very first engineering course I could take. I needed to complete Calculus I before I could take the very first materials\u2019 course. That was at least a year and a half, if everything went well. So I started with College Algebra, unprepared for the basics. I tried, but I really didn't have good study habits. I didn't seek out tutors; I didn't go to office hours. After a while, I justified skipping out of class once or twice a week. By the time finals rolled around, there was no way I was going to pass that class\u2026and I failed. The other basic classes I took, pretty much went the same way. I had flashes of brilliance in my composition course, but I would slack off. I had a Western Philosophies\u2019 course and found some of the reading interesting, but I flopped on the exams. I didn't have the consistency or discipline to stay up with assignments, nor the understanding of what was needed to pass my exams. Needless to say, that first report card was not my best work. My father had a talk with me--he had been in the military, and suggested that maybe I wasn't ready for school. He suggested that I consider a branch like the Navy, if things didn't work out, school-wise. I told him in no uncertain terms, \u201cI did not want to waste 4 years of my life in the military.\u201d My father was a patient man, and left it at that. I returned to school, though on academic probation. It's been said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results. I don't even think I made it through the entire second semester, and I dropped out completely. I had a GPA measured in fractional amounts, and things were pretty grim. I drifted for another year or so, working odd jobs, and even going back to a technical college, to study mechanical drafting. Although I did well in my design classes, I still struggled with algebra. I struggled with physics. I might've received a C in composition. They had a drafting competition that second winter since high school. I was awarded first place, and received a gold medal for my work. I collected my award, and gathered my things. Despite the achievement, I knew I wasn't ready for college, so I didn't drive straight home. Instead, I drove to my Navy recruiter's office. Long story short, I scored well on my ASVAB, and didn't have anything in my background from getting into their Advanced Electronics\u2019 Program. Instead of 4 years, I signed up for 6. The training and advancement opportunities were better. Shortly after signing up, I found myself on a plane, for the second time in my life. I was headed to San Diego\u2026someplace I had never been. I was about to start Boot Camp, and who knows what afterwards. It turned out that I was a pretty decent sailor. I made in through boot camp, and went to almost another year and a half of Navy electronics\u2019 schools. I went from an E-1, all the way to E-4, following my first Navy School. I finished at the top of my class, and got the first pick of orders. I chose a new ship on the East Coast. The ship was still being built however, so I got to do some travel, and ended up in southern Mississippi, where they were building the ship. Finally, some two and a half years after joining the Navy, we commissioned our ship, and began getting underway routinely. Oh, and did I mention? I studied a lot, was a sharp, squared-away sailor, and was advanced again to E-5. I should also add, I learned some math along the way. The Navy had some good, remedial math courses, including algebra. I needed those for some electronics\u2019 work. We traveled all over the Caribbean, up and down the East Coast, and up into the North Atlantic. I saw the Northern Lights for the first time, and tried reindeer in Norway. In 1989, we deployed to the Mediterranean. We had 9 different ports of call (several of them more than once), and visited six different countries. I was 23 years old. I made E-6 in 1990, 5 years after joining, which is about as rapid advancement as one can receive. We did deploy to the Persian Gulf in late 1990, but after the war, I decided I wasn't going to reenlist; I wanted to go back to school. I began studies at a large university in the fall of 1990. I had to start from square one: no previous credits transferred, and I wasn't attending a school that would accept any of my Navy experience. Because of my past academic experience, I was admitted on a probationary status. I had to complete 20 credits with at least a C average. I felt certain I could do that. Almost forgot, did I mention that because I was on a probationary status, I couldn't take more than 8 credits per semester. No problem. I plowed ahead with 3 courses, including college algebra. My first semester, I finished with a 3.9 GPA. My second semester, I took 8 more credits, including trigonometry. I may have had a B+, and two As. Summer, my first year back at university, I took a 4- credit business calc class. I was very determined, and received an A+ in the class. I took linear algebra, discrete math, and a couple other math courses. I was never fluent in mathematics, but I came a long was since high school. I eventually graduated with honors, and a minor in math. I had a very good internship, and was eventually recruited by a large pharmaceutical company. I've been working as a consultant in the clinical supply chain. I've lived a great life, traveled extensive for work and pleasure. My family, friends and acquaintances see me as a very successful person. I'm happy, and look forward to continuing my career, and perhaps even applying to a Master's degree program later this year. Your high school GPA does NOT determine your success in life. YOU determine your success. There's no such thing as \u201cstarting too late.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "NOTE: It is quite possible that the reason you are failing has nothing to do with your level of intelligence. Here are reasons why students fail: Lack of sleep Uncertain or unhealthy nutrition. Family conflict Fear of violence from a parent Fear of violence from a sibling Threat of family breakup and divorce Moving house and changing schools too often Alcoholic parent Sexually inappropriate behaviour by someone in the family Teen being alone too much Fear of abandonment Inability to concentrate because of bullying Undiagnosed learning disability Undiagnosed vision or hearing problems Stress causing stomach upsets Conflicts or losing friends Having ratty clothing, causing embarrassment Being angry all the time being a negative distraction Undiagnosed ADD or ADHD Long periods of illness when education was not addressed Depression Escaping into sleep Hearing voices, undiagnosed mental health issues Avoiding school due to poverty Poverty and not having school supplies Not having gym clothes so the student skips those days Believing they are incapable of success Lack of interest from a parent Lack of encouragement from an adult Being around adults who devalue education Problems with a step parent Having a parent or step parent who does drugs at home Inability to cope with escalating emotions and not getting help Being embarrassed that your house is dirty or messy, so you don\u2019t make friends Embarrassment at finding a parent drunk or stoned after school and there is no food. Any, all of these things, and any combination of these things will result in having difficulties in school. But you must finish school anyway, so aim for passes, ask for help, and get the thing done. As for me, I didn\u2019t finish high school. I didn\u2019t live with my family during my high school years. My life was a mess. I was a mess. I worked in different kinds of art departments, and entered university as a mature student when I was 39. I did a four-year arts degree, and then a master\u2019s degree in anthropology. I worked as an integration officer getting young offenders ready to leave jail and placing them in programs and schools and monitoring them. I was having such a good time, I decided to become a teacher. I went back to university and did a degree in education and began teaching high school behaviour classes when I was 54. (I had just started menopause!) Had a great time. Those kids were hilarious and entertaining and incredibly loyal. I\u2019m retired now, and happy about it all ",

            "answer_text": "I did pretty poorly in high school. I wasn\u2019t a bad student, I loved learning, but I hated doing homework. I hated having to keep a binder for each class. I wasn\u2019t organized at all. In my English classes, I hated doing the assigned reading. At home, I had all of the pressure to do good, with absolutely none of the support. And that made it really difficult to do well. I don\u2019t know how much it truly affected me. I was accepted to Biola University, but I was unable to go because I had no idea how to do financial aid, and the parent that I lived with was unwilling to help me. I ended up going to community college and, due to other reasons, I ended up burning out pretty hard and fast. I loved college, but there were a number of real-life obstacles, and again: I didn\u2019t have any kind of day-to-day support network, or even friends, really. It\u2019s been a long road, and one pretty much lined with failure. I\u2019m 26 now, and at my 5th community college. I started fresh over last year and, with any luck, I\u2019ll be graduating in Spring 2018 with my AA, and transferring to another school. I\u2019m currently Shaunta Grimes \u2018s assistant and an intern to a Literary Agent, which are both great jobs. And, to be completely honest, I don\u2019t see how my life would have been any different if I had done well in high school. But you never know. ",

            "answer_text": "I did get bad grades in senior high school , though I was top 3 in the class in middle school. College entrance examination in China is kind of cruel for me, the teacher in charge of our class showed ranking to all the class after every examination, and analysed who were top students and who he would abandoned. I tried so hard to let him know I did not want him to abandon me. I did know why his support was so important for me in that period. When he told me he intended to abandon me, I was so desperate to abandon myself. I kept remaining in bottom ten, was not eager to improve any more and was so painful spending time in school. Luckily, my bad grades sent me into a not bad school. I am in junior year now, living a wonderful life. The high school life just like a nightmare for me now, I seldom recall it, since it was the worst time of my life so far. I do not think it would affect my life too much after graduated from high school. After all, I am top 3 in class now. Life should not be in shadow because of a bad experience, if you ignored it and kept positive, the beautiful life would wait for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I did !!! I failed in maths in Pre board examination of 12. I was a fallout moment for me, but I didn't let me down. I knew I still have 2 months left. I studied very hard and secured good marks in boards. . The story didn't end here. After that i dropped an year to prepare for engineering entrance exam. Studied day and night and got admission in PDPU. In college i focused on subjects i liked and with the help of professors did research work. This led to me an internship at IIT Guwahati. It was like a dream come true for me. I continued my hard work at IIT an got a very rich experience. I too published research papers in national and international conferences.. Coming back to college it was my final year of engineering, placement started. Companies started pouring in. I sat in placements. Cleared some written test, went through interviews , but rejected some companies as i thought i wanted to have some big goal. . Then at ending of 4 year came our dream company Reliance Infra !!! Cleared its written test and went to interview. The interview went well but I was suspicious about my selection as in interview toppers of our class were also there. Two days after the results came and I was among the 2 persons selected. My joy knew no bounds. I was happy like never before. The first thing I did was I called my mother and gave her the good news. It was all possible because of her blessings. I personally think failure is important for our life , it gives us an inspiration to work hard !! As it is said FAIL is \"First Attempt In Learning. \" ",

            "answer_text": "This did not happen to me, but as a faculty member in a university continuing studies program, I see a lot of people who were in this position. There are a lot of opportunities for you. If you don\u2019t know what you want to do, you can get a job for awhile until you decide what you want to do. You can learn a trade. You might join the military. If you do that, you will get the GI Bill to pay for future education. If you have ideas, you can do something entrepreneurial. If you want additional education, this is possible too. Most community colleges are open admission. You might not get admitted right away, but you can take a few courses as a non-degree seeking student until you have a GPA that will let you be admitted. If you need funding, you can start with a career studies certificate, then get a job. You can then pay for your associates degree. Once you have your associates, you can transfer to a four year college. In summary, you have a lot of options, not all of which involve going to school. Life is an adventure, and the important thing is that you\u2019re happy doing with your choices. ",

I had plans to study Botany at university, which fell apart during a bad love affair, and I joined the Merchant Navy instead, and have spent 45 years in engineering. But of more relavance to your question, I failed French O level at 16, and was thrown out of Latin and German at age 12. I have no academic ability in languages at all. Yet I have worked all over the world, have never failed to order food and beer, and have organised large engineering projects without speaking Hindi, Spanish, Arabic or Russian. I have usually used local interpreters, which is fine for simple stuff. When it gets technical I rely on diagrams, maths, or taking hold of the tools to demonstrate. There is always a way to get round limitations. You just get on with it. ",
