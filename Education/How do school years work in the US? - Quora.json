            "answer_text": "In the US, most K-12 public schools base their year on 180 days of school. Most schools begin in August to early September and end in May or June. Remember the 180 day requirement, so if you want the school year to end in May you will start in August. If you want to start after Labor Day holiday in Early September, you will finish in June. The school year moves along with occasional holidays, Labor Day (early September usually 1 day off ). Veterans\u2019 Day (November 11 one day off). Thanksgiving (4th Thursday in November, Thursday and Friday off, maybe Wednesday also). Winter break (also known as Christmas Break usually 10 days to 2 weeks, always includes Christmas Day, December 25th, off. Usually includes New Year\u2019s Day, January 1st, off.) Mid January has Martin Luther King Day (usually one day off). Mid February has Presidents\u2019 day (usually one day off). Somewhere in March or April schools have spring break,usually 7 to 10 days, it used to include Easter Holiday but not so much anymore. Then in the end of May there is Memorial Day, the last Monday of May, usually one day off if your school hasn\u2019t already made their 180 days of school. Various schools may also include other holidays, and many districts that have large concentrations of students of some specific religions may have religious holidays off, but they will not refer to the holiday by its religious name. Additionally some schools that are in rural agricultural zones schedule time off for all students so that some students may help with harvesting or other farm chores. ",

            "answer_text": "It varies depending on the school and the state, but the school year usually runs between late August/early September to May/June. Between then we have 2\u20133 months of summer vacation. We also have 1\u20132 weeks off for the winter holidays in late December and early January, and one or two Spring breaks around February-April. Some schools have one week off in February and one week off in April, while others have 1\u20132 weeks in March. There are four different chapters in most students\u2019 school lives: -Preschool and Kindergarten (which is for students ages 3\u20136) -Elementary School (grades 1\u20135, ages 6\u201311) -Middle School (grades 6\u20138, ages 11\u201314) -High School (grades 9\u201312, ages 14\u201318) Most students finish up high school and graduate at age 18 :) ",

            "answer_text": "The typical school year is the agrarian model. Late August through June, with a two week break for winter holidays and a week in spring. I was in an experimental model for grade school and middle school and it was fantastic! I went to school year round. Nine weeks on, then a three week break, then back for another nine weeks. No need for remediation, since 3 weeks isn't 3 months. We could have more students per building because we had 4 tracks, so three tracks were in school and one on break at any given time. My parents loved it because we vacationed off-season and saved money. Given how messed up the school infrastructure is, and how over crowded schools are, you think everyone would be clamboring to adopt this model. But no. It's too modern. Better we stay on a system that suited our farmer ancestors 150 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you mean school year length, and not how school works throughout the year (if it's the latter, you can read my answer to a similar question here), my answer is: usually starts in August or September, and goes until May or June (depending on when the school started) although start/end times may vary from school district to district, the amount of education time is typically standardized across the nation I believe ",
