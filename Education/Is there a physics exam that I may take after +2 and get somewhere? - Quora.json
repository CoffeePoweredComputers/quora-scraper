            "answer_text": "Unfortunately there isn\u2019t.You will have to take care of maths and chemistry also. But if you have interest in Physics you can study BSc physics and study for three years. After that you can attempt IIT JAM physics for MSC in Physics at IITs. Then you can either go to analytics company or software company if your programming skills are good. Else if you are still interested in Physics then you can persue research or teaching career in Physics. Also having an MSc degree from IIT gives you an edge for applications of research positions in foreign countries like USA, UK, Europe and Taiwan. ",
