            "answer_text": "JEE Mains and JEE Advanced differ in exam pattern, difficulty of questions, and which institutes they offer admission to.The main link between the two exams is that to write the JEE Advanced exam, you must qualify the JEE Mains exam by scoring a certain minimum score in the JEE Mains exam. JEE mains has a total of 90 questions which are equally divided among the 3 PCM subjects viz. Physics, Chemistry and Maths. Each question has only 1 option correct and carries +4 for the correct answer, -1 for a wrong answer, and 0 in case the question isn\u2019t attempted. Total marks for the paper is 360 and the qualifying marks, which change every year, is around 80\u2013100 for General Category. Total time for the paper is 3 hours. The questions in JEE mains are considered to be of moderate level and require a basic to intermediate understanding of the subject matter. Writing the JEE mains serves a candidate in 2 ways - a) They can get admission to IIITs, NITs and GFTIs, but NOT to IITsb) If the candidate qualifies in the JEE Mains exam, then and only then can they write the JEE Advanced exam JEE Advanced consists of 2 papers, each of which are 3 hours long. The number of questions per subject have either been 18 or 20 in a paper making a total of 54 or 60 questions for all 3 subjects in each paper. This exam requires a much deeper understanding of the concepts of PCM and also requires critical thinking. Each subject is generally divided into 3 sections based on the type of question which can be any of the following:1. Single Correct MCQ2. Multiple Correct MCQ (One or more than one options are correct)3. Matrix Matching 4. Integer Answer5. MCQ based on paragraph and more types. The paper setters for JEE Advanced can also create new types of questions. For e.g. in JEE Advanced 2018 they introduced a new type of question called Numerical Value wherein the candidate has to enter his answer as a positive or negative number with digits up to two decimal places. For e.g. if the answer to the question was 3/4 the candidate must enter 0.75 . Getting a good score and rank in the JEE Advanced exam can allow a candidate to secure a seat in one of the prestigious IITs. Apart from this, it is worthy to note that the subject matter based on which JEE Advanced papers are made is much more in-depth into the PCM subjects and has a lot of extra information as compared to the NCERT syllabus.

            "answer_text": "In India, to join a premium Engineering College one needs to give JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced. Getting through these two exams with a top rank gives you the opportunity to join top National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Entry into reputed institutes is the initial move towards a solid Engineering career. Candidates who are willing to get into BE or B.Tech courses in the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs) and the colleges of the participating states need to give JEE Main. A candidate needs to pass JEE Main to appear for JEE Advanced which leads to admission in IIT\u2019s or Indian School of Mines (ISM). JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced are both engineering entrance examinations but there are a few distinct differences between the two. JEE Main is for those applicants who wish to get into BE or B.Tech courses in the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), other Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs). The JEE Main is likewise the qualification test which enables understudies to give the JEE Advanced exam which in the end prompts confirmation in either the IITs or the Indian School of Mines (ISM). Difference between JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced in terms of difficulty: JEE-Advanced is far more difficult than JEE-Main. The main focus of JEE-Main is to make aspirants understand their class 11th and 12th syllabus while JEE-Advanced is more towards evaluating the analytical and problem-solving skills of the students. Difference between JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced in terms of syllabus: The JEE Main syllabus is the same as the syllabus prescribed by CBSE whereas JEE-Advanced has a slightly different syllabus. There are some topics in JEE-Main that are not in the JEE Advanced syllabus. Difference between JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced in terms of eligibility: Getting a top JEE-Main rank will help you get a seat at NITs and IIITs while a good performance in JEE-Advanced will help you get a seat in the coveted IIT\u2019s. Difference between JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced in terms of qualification: Any candidate who has given class 12th exam can appear for JEE-Main. The eligibility criteria for JEE-Advanced is different. JEE-Advanced aspirants need to get certain cutoff marks in JEE-Main and also meet minimum board exams criteria. The cutoff varies from year to year. Difference between JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced in terms of examination pattern: JEE-Main consists of a single paper (for B.Tech/B.E. programs) which consists of objective type and single answer questions. JEE-Advanced consists of 2 papers which consist of a variety of problem including multi right, matrix match, comprehension types and much more. While the examination pattern of JEE-Main mostly remains the same, the pattern for JEE-Advanced is modified almost every year. Difference between JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced in terms of number of attempts: A candidate can attempt JEE Main for 3 consecutive years but JEE Advanced for only 2 consecutive years. Difference between JEE-Main and JEE-Advanced in terms of examination time: The JEE Mains paper is for 3 hrs whereas JEE Advanced paper is of 6 hours HOPE MY ANSWER IS USEFUL. Good Luck! ",
