            "answer_text": "From childhood to Adulthood I pretty much never really had friends. Childhood nada! Friendship lasted on average 3 months only didn\u2019t make my first friend till 7th grade, and it only lasted 3 months. High School I was hanging out with my cousins college friends but school I was pretty much alone and pretty much one the handful of kids with no friends. Early Adulthood: First job yanked! I was yanked away and wasn\u2019t allowed to hangout with my peer group. I didn\u2019t do good in school and academics, and I knew I was stupid. So I didn\u2019t understand why I was yanked out and not allowed to be around the other people at work. If I went near someone in my peer group to socialize I was immediately stopped. At 18 years old I was only allowed to socialize with people 24 and up, and the adults controlled my social circle. They knew why I didn\u2019t. I still don\u2019t get how people with average IQ\u2019s get jobs so easily. I get rejected by almost every single job I apply for. I know people who have 3 jobs a year and I struggle to get 1. It\u2019s not like having an high IQ pays off for everything. Life Statistics: I have less than 1% of getting along with someone If I do get along with someone it\u2019s 75% chance they\u2019re at least 10 years old than I\u2019 am. It takes 3 years for people to understand me and see how I think. I don\u2019t think like everyone else and I struggle to do their social interactions. If you have friends and you\u2019re out socializing it\u2019s simple enough for your friends to say \u201cNice try I saw what you\u2019re trying to do!\u201d and enjoy that moment. If you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s not simple they pretty much don\u2019t know what the hell happened or what you\u2019re trying to do and it just ends up in an ugly and toxic debate. about 98% of social interaction I\u2019m looking around waiting for their next action and you can see their next move. It\u2019s too much work to socialize it\u2019s the same patterns and countering the negatives. I talk to a sort of loner baby boomer scientist and I enjoy talking to him because I see him countering the negatives he has around 33 Gestures Per Minute with out having to fully animate and freeze frame using body language. Like an \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d isn't shrug shoulder freeze..freeze\u2026freeze\u2026wait get acknowledgement unfreeze gesture. ",

            "answer_text": "Frankly speaking, it\u2019s because most people are intolerably boring and repulsively dumb. And you meant to say \u201cfewer\u201d friends, not \u201cless.\u201d See how I am? I\u2019m truly sorry I feel that way, sorry I am this way; I think it\u2019s likely a defect and a character flaw of mine, but witnessing extreme stupidity and bungling physically nauseates me, while witnessing the expression of intelligence and competence gives me pleasure and satisfaction. I can\u2019t change that; it\u2019s as involuntary as any other physical reflex. I don\u2019t mean to hate you or get disgusted by your incompetence. It just happens. And I guess even if I smile and try to hide it, it shows. Sorry. I\u2019m not among the smartest by any means, but even for me, it\u2019s hard to do anything remotely normal. Normal life is just so fucking stupid, bass-ackwards, and genuinely, truly, literally, retarded. In a technical sense. Held back. Not advanced. I can\u2019t sit there and pretend to be interested while my obese cousin discusses the pasta prices at various supermarkets in great detail. I physically can\u2019t stand it, and I suppose it shows on my face. Yes, the combination of obesity and obsession with pasta prices triggers me. I want to vomit. Is that because I\u2019m smart, mentally ill, an asshole, or some combination of the three? Can those three ever be teased apart? I do not know. What I know is, people often get offended at my rudeness and I often hate spending time with them, so why do it again? Invites dwindle, to mutual relief. Alone, I\u2019m free. I can read, think, and write at my own speed. I can do three or four things at once, or focus on what I want, for as long as I need to. Talking is so very slow, at best. Talking to stupid people is intolerable, and I avoid it whenever possible. They avoid me in return, which is certainly fair enough. I\u2019ve had few friends, and they\u2019re mostly all dead now. I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019d trade it all for more friends, but I guess I wouldn\u2019t, after all. I\u2019d like a few more friends and I\u2019d like better friends, but so far, they\u2019ve been few and far between. C\u2019est la vie. YMMV. ",
