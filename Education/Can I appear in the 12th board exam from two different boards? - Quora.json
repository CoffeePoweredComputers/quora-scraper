            "answer_text": "Absolutely YES ! The headline Absolutely YES refers to a condition where your eligibility of appearing in two different boards is in question. According to Indian Supreme Court there are no specific regulations of the concerned examination board which prohibit a person from given two examinations at the same time but it is advisable not to do so as it falls under violation act. If you want to qualify for your Boards from two boards ; try to register in both the Boards with a minimum gap of 1 year . Indian law also states if a student is caught appearing for two exams the same year he can be suspended from appearing in any Exam for next 3 years and trust me the rules are very strict. As mentioned in our answers segment earlier this month - if you are not happy with your marks achieved ; PLEASE do not waste your time studying the same class and appearing for Boards from another year - use the same time to prepare for the next class and with a vision and dedicated focus to succeed. Best Wishes ",
