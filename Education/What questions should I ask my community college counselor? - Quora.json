            "answer_text": "They will be asking you more questions than you ask them. Go in assuming that they are qualified or they wouldn\u2019t have their job. You\u2019ll probably want to build a rapport with them before you start laying your problems at their feet, so maybe ask how long they\u2019ve been at the college, what they like most about their job, that kind of thing. Maybe if they\u2019ve been at the job for a long time, you could ask what changes they have observed in college-age students over the years. But mostly, your job is to let them know why you are there. Are you having relationship issues? Academic issues? are you suicidal? Homicidal? Have you been sexually assaulted (not necessarily recently), are you depressed and don\u2019t know why? These are the kinds of things they will ask you, and they\u2019ll want you to set treatment goals (maybe not in the first session, but early on). They\u2019ll help you with the goal setting. Their job is to put you at ease; they know you are anxious. So relax as best you can and just go with it. Good luck! ",
