            "answer_text": "This depends on what kind of benefits you mean.  Benefits packages: Depending on your library type (public, academic, special), you will most likely have a benefits package through your institution that involves health insurance and benefits. If you work for an academic library tuition for family members may be included. I know that at my current position, my domestic parter's ability to work on a degree for almost no money is one of the most valuable parts of my benefits package. Job Satisfaction: If you're the kind of person who loves (and this will vary by position) helping people find information, suggesting books, talking about books, teaching research techniques, unjamming printers or organizing and classifying things, you'll likely really enjoy working as a librarian, and that's worth a lot. Do note that most librarians do not spend their working hours reading books. This appears to be a common misconception. Usually, we love reading so much we do that at home on our own time.Personal Fulfillment: You benefit from knowing that your work is helping people. As an academic librarian I spend much of my days either teaching a research methods course or working with students on their research projects, and it feels good to help them. Public librarians are contributing to the education of children, as well as helping hobbyists, retirees, and even the homeless depending on the library.Job Specific Perks: We get first dibs on popular items (Books, DVDs, etc).Many libraries are much more forgiving of late penalties and borrowing periods for staff.",

            "answer_text": "I'm not technically a librarian. I work at an elementary school , and my job title is \"library media technician.\" In my school district only the high schools have librarians with masters degrees. I do all the work of a librarian (already described by others here) and more, and so I mostly call myself a librarian. I work only part time and have to have a second job, but I do have great health benefits and retirement. The real benefits are in job satisfaction though: 600 children think I'm one of the smartest, nicest, prettiest, coolest people they know (although I'm really not exceptional in any of those ways), and tell me so often. There's always a line of kids waiting for me to open my doors. One morning I was actually greeted by a group of kids cheering, \"We love the library. Hip hip hooray! Three cheers for Ms. Pultz!\" I'm still not sure what motivated that level of enthusiasm, but it sure makes for a happy day.Every day I make a huge difference in the lives of 600 children, teaching them to love reading and helping them learn skills that will benefit and enrich their lives.The teachers and principal all really appreciate me because my job is to support what they do and give them resources (and encouragement)Although my principal supervises and helps me set goals, I pretty much have free reign to decide how I do my job. I create my own schedule. I choose my own lessons, programs, and events and run them how I think is best. I choose the books that I buy and read aloud to students. I control the set-up and decoration of the library.Although I'm only a part-time employee, everyone considers the library to be my space, and I have a very nice office of my own (which I loan out to whoever needs it, generating more love from the other staff).Just the day-to-day pace of the job is wonderful. There's plenty of excitement and interaction with both kids and adults, but also chunks of time where I'm completely alone in my lovely quiet room full of books. It's a balance that works wonderfully for me.As Anaya Jones mentioned, I don't get to read adult books at work, but I do read several children's books every day either with classes or as I'm making lesson plans.There's plenty of not-so-great stuff too, but having a job that brings me so much joy every day makes those things matter much less.
