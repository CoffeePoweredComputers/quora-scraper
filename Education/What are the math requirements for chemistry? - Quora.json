            "answer_text": "I totally agree with Carl Witte that algebra is essential and will be used throughout your career if you work in industry as a chemist or chemical engineer. An understanding of calculus will also be needed, for example, if you work in the area of reaction kinetics. If your question refers to what math is required to get an undergraduate degree in Chemistry in the US, you will generally be required to take linear algebra, the amount of calculus that Carl mentions (intro through multidimensional calculus), and often a statistics course. A course in differential equations is usually not a requirement for US college degrees in Chemistry, but could be needed if you do undergraduate research in physical or theoretical chemistry, or intend to go to grad school. My advice - take as much math as you can handle when you are an undergrad. You can always take extra courses in biology, materials science, environmental sciences, etc., in grad school to become broader. But if you do not become well grounded in math while an undergrad, it can severely limit your options later. An analogy I have used to coach students: if you want to become a scientist and do not have a sufficient understanding of math, it is like living in the US but not knowing how to drive. You will be limited in where you can go and how quickly you can get there! ",

            "answer_text": "As a chemical engineering I can say that I use algebra with chemistry every day. To major in chemistry Calc through Calc 2 or 3 would be helpful. The Physical Chemistry class needed the extra math. Other wise being good with Algebra is enough to get you through most of what you need both day to day and through an undergraduate degree. ",
