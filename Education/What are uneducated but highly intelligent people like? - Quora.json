            "answer_text": "I have never known a highly intelligent person who was \u201cuneducated.\u201d \u201cUn-documented\u201d maybe, in that highly intelligent people are often turned off (especially in the United States) by the ploddingly slow pace of \u201cformal education\u201d in American classrooms. This problem has been known for many many decades, but remains unaddressed to this day. As a result, many highly SELF EDUCATED people have no \u201cattendance earned\u201d college degrees, though some self educated individuals may have one or more HONORARY Degrees given to them by colleges or universities that want to tie that self educated person\u2019s fame and contributions to the honorary degree awarding university. I\u2019m not one of those recipients, but\u2026 Chances are that I am one of the \u201cuneducated highly intelligent people\u201d you\u2019re asking about. I\u2019m \u201cself taught\u201d through and through. Taught myself to read when I was three. I was reading at a 9th grade level and doing \u201carithmetic\u201d at a 5th grade level by my first day of school. Not knowing how else to grade me, my first grade teacher assigned me a group of six classmates and told me to teach them how to read. I did that. She also told my mother not to allow me to do any more arithmetic because doing so would impair the development of my \u201cfemale brain.\u201d My mother listened, and I was angry at teacher and parent for many years because of it. I was also an artist, and won a San Diego school district wide art contest that same year I was teaching other first graders to read. The teacher gave me the blue ribbon to keep, but SHE kept MY painting! I lost blind trust in all teachers in first grade. Overall, probably not a bad thing. I\u2019m not without college credits. I just don\u2019t have any \u201clower division\u201d (freshman or sophomore year) credits, therefore I have no degrees. But that\u2019s a choice that I consciously made during my first year of college. After 2 weeks of freshman classes, I realized I was being \u201ctaught\u201d things I\u2019d already learned (with great redundancy!) in the 12 years of public school I had just completed. So I made an appointment with the president of the college and asked for his permission to take any classes I wanted that I thought would teach me something I wanted to know more about, whether it was nuclear physics or geology, William Shakespeare or Sigmund Freud. This was way back in 1953 at San Diego State College. Dr. Malcolm Love was its president then, but he is now deceased, though the main library of San Diego State University bears his name. Anyway, Dr. Love was quite amused by my request, warned me I would not get a degree without lower division credits, but after reading my transcripts he granted what I asked for with 1 condition: If any of the classes I signed up for carried a prerequisite, I had to meet with the instructor and get permission to take his class before enrolling. I followed that rule. And true to his word, Dr Love must have noted it in my records because it was still in force when I went back to school after my 18 year first marriage ended. It\u2019s now 64 years later, I still have no degrees despite 2 matriculations at SDSU, but I have held numerous jobs in my lifetime that \u201crequired\u201d a degree. I have taught in 2 universities and 3 post secondary schools. I\u2019ve had a variety of careers and worked with and known some truly amazing people, including world renowned physicians, scientists, artists, musicians, and a spy (as in \u201cespionage\u201d) or two. My life experience has always been that if I have the knowledge base and skills required for a job, I will be accepted as a peer by those who have walls full of diplomas. But there is still one question that comes up on written applications and census forms that always stops me dead in my tracks! The question is: Education level? I don\u2019t fit in society\u2019s mold! But writing this has forced a little retrospection\u2026 As far as I can recall, the ONLY job applications I\u2019ve ever filled out were for a summer job in a department store when I was in high school, and a job at the phone company when I was first married. I was \u201crecruited\u201d for all of my really interesting \u201cprofessional\u201d jobs. One of my greatest regrets is that the educational system of the United States is so inept at teaching kids how to think well, regardless of how bright or challenged the child may be. Mankind in general, but Americans specifically, seem incapable of distinguishing \u201ccan\u201d from \u201cshould.\u201d Which clearly states my dilemma over this Quora Question\u2026 I CAN answer this question, but should I?

            "answer_text": "This answer hinges on defining \u201cuneducated\u201d as not having had much education beyond basic public schooling. Many extremely intelligent people likely wouldn\u2019t strike you as uneducated, so long as they had basic schooling at a young age. I personally have little in the way of formal education beyond 3 years of high school. I dropped out and got my GED after my junior year. In my mid 20\u2019s, I took some college courses but eventually got bored with the extremely easy material and left college, eventually starting my own business and being fairly successful. Highly intelligent people are still just people, so they will vary from one to another, but I myself have always sort of absorbed information very quickly and easily. In college, while others scribbled notes to study later, I just listened to the lecture and remembered pretty much everything. I got pretty much all of the answers on the tests correct with the exception of answers that were gleaned from assigned reading material and absent from lectures, since I would rarely be that interested in the assigned reading material that was full of redundancies. They weren\u2019t designed for people who quickly understand and absorb information. I got pretty much all A-\u2019s without really cracking a book, until I got bored and stopped going. To be honest, I often find those who are highly educated but not particularly intelligent people to be some of the least tolerable people on the planet, because absent the intelligence to think on their own, they are so set in the ways of their \u201ceducation\u201d that they can\u2019t conceive of the possibility that something they\u2019ve been taught might not be scientifically, socially, or morally right. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone through periods where harmful procedures and practices have been the norm for a very, very long time without change, because educated people who don\u2019t possess intelligence tend to rigidly stick to what they \u201clearned\u201d, rarely truly understanding why or how things work, only knowing that they do because someone else told them so. The 2 biggest indicators of intelligence are probably 2 simple questions: \u201cHow?\u201d and \u201cWhy?\u201d. Intelligent people seek to understand things. Almost everything makes sense when you dig enough. Knowing the answer isn\u2019t enough. We need to know WHY it\u2019s the answer, and HOW to arrive at that conclusion. Only through \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d can we have a deep enough understanding of any given topic to truly innovate in the field. You can\u2019t make something work better if you don\u2019t really know HOW that something works to begin with. In my opinion, the greatest minds among us don\u2019t really need a formal education, particularly of the sort which can be obtained in most public universities in the US. An extremely intelligent individual who did a little bit of independent study in a field could probably convince a room full of experts from said field that he/she belongs among them, so long as credentials never have to be furnished, or references checked. I didn\u2019t attend an elite, Ivy-league school, so I can\u2019t comment on how the environment differs from public universities. But I surmise from my stint at a public university that such an intelligent person who obtains a degree probably does so more to show others they \u201cknow stuff about X\u201d than to really \u201clearn stuff about X\u201d. We can learn on our own. We just need the educational certification to convince others that we know it, since most people don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for extremely intelligent individuals, and there are more liars than geniuses in this world. I routinely have friends who have medical issues and I guess their medical diagnosis, along with treatment, prior to them visiting the doctor. Amazingly often, their initial visit to the doctor results in a different diagnosis, which turns out to be wrong, and after 2\u20133 visits to different doctors, a specialist in a particular field ends up reaching the diagnosis that I took a stab at to begin with. I have no formal medical training(aside from psychology, which I suppose is loosely related), but I\u2019ve heard people talk about their problems all my life, and I read a lot of non-fiction/news. So, without any formal medical training, people justifiably prefer to consult an \u201ceducated\u201d doctor, but the truth is, intelligence and true understanding, even in intellectually elite fields like medicine, are almost as rare as it is in the general population. It\u2019s just a bunch of people parroting things other people have told them, for the most part. And in this country, where kids are brought up being told they can be anything they want to be, so long as they work hard, it\u2019s basically a cardinal sin to tell someone you were genetically gifted to be more intelligent than the average bear. Since there are many more liars than geniuses, a healthy majority won\u2019t believe you, even if you furnish proof. And most that do believe you will view you with contempt, either due to some sort of subconscious jealousy, or due to some misguided personal theory that \u201cIQ doesn\u2019t matter\u201d, which is really just a feel-good statement to make the majority of the population feel better about not being a genius. This all actually makes it suck to be a genius, by the way, so they really don\u2019t need to feel bad about not being in this lonely black sheep club. Not only do people not understand you due to the communication range(as described here: The Inappropriately Excluded) , but they don\u2019t even respect your intelligence. They often find highly intelligent people to be arrogant, aloof, or even stupid due to a lack of understanding. Much of this would presumably be resolved through a formal education, since it would grant said intelligent person a degree(pun intended) of authority. But, as in my case, by the time I\u2019d had the life experiences to realize that people would never respect raw knowledge and intelligence if it isn\u2019t certified by a piece of paper, it didn\u2019t really make sense to spend years of monotonous schooling into my 30\u2019s to \u201clearn\u201d things I already know, only to be in debt and incapable of making a better living than if I simply worked for all those years that I would have went to school and took control of my own future. I would have loved to have been a doctor, and I may even have contributed something important to the field, but in my experience, the system wasn\u2019t designed for people like me. It was designed for people of above average intelligence to be able to become doctors, which inadvertently(I presume) alienates people like me, who can\u2019t handle such a slow pace of education without getting bored. So I became a capitalist instead, which was absolutely designed for people like me. There is always room for innovation there, excellence is rewarded, and there is basically limitless potential for new experiences/knowledge. ;) Anyhow, since I mentioned it: If you don\u2019t feel confident in your ability to discern a highly educated person\u2019s true level of intelligence, I have only 1 recommendation when it comes to choosing a doctor, and it probably goes against conventional wisdom: Pick a young one. While less experienced, they will have been taught the most recent medical information, and won\u2019t have so much anchoring bias working against recently discovered information that goes against whatever the status quo was at the time they became a doctor. There are some fantastic, intelligent, older doctors out there. But the vast majority of them are just going to be \u201caverage\u201d doctors, subject to anchoring bias, and so I don\u2019t recommend taking that gamble. Since they\u2019re ALL educated in the specialized field of medicine, to the average person, ALL of them will likely sound \u201cintelligent\u201d, which is what makes them dangerous. Being educated and being intelligent are not one and the same. Being educated means knowing a solution someone else figured out. Being intelligent means being able to develop solutions to begin with. If you found this answer to sound arrogant or otherwise unpalatable, try starting over and reading it as if you were Data from Star Trek:TNG, or Ben Stein. Completely monotone with no inferred inflection. I\u2019ve found that people tend to add emotional inflection and \u201ctone\u201d to my writing that doesn\u2019t actually exist. ",
