            "answer_text": "So\u2026 I realize this question was asked quite a while ago, but since I feel that the asnwers given weren\u2019t detailed enough about the specific requirement to study medicine in Denmark, I thought I should give it a shot. Before I get too far into what\u2019ll probably be a waaay too long explanation of the requirements to study in Denmark I should be very clear. No, you cannot study medicne in Denmark if you only know English. Currently Danish bachelors in medicine are only offered in Danish (to be a medical doctor in denmark you have to complete both a bachelor and a master in medicine). This means that you have to be proficient in Danish to be able to apply (which makes sense since there\u2019s no point in entering a programme you can\u2019t understand). If this means anyone isn\u2019t interested in studying medicine in Denmark, then don\u2019t read any further, If you want to enroll into a Danish higher education with foreign qualifications I recommend you read this first of all: Admission to Danish higher education for holders of foreign qualifications The general entry reguirements for any higher education in Denmark is that you must have a qualification of an equal level to Danish upper secondary school, depending on your country you might have to receive suplementary studies in addition to you upper secondary certificate. You can apply for an assessment of wether or not your certificate meets the general requirements here: Application forms for assessment of your foreign qualifications The specific requirements for studying medicine in Denmark is technically dependant on which university you wish to enter, but in the case of medicine they are generally the same. The levels of subjects passed required is: Danish AEnglish BMath AA combination of either physics B and chemistry B, or physics B and biotechnology A, geosciences A and chemistry B, or chemistry B, biology A and physics C.The levels can generally be translated as A = advanced, B = intermediary and C = elementary. Additionally most universities require a minimum grade average equivalent to 6.0 on the Danish scale to be eligible to apply to study medicine. For foreign students the language requirements might differ slightly and you should consult the individual institutes websites. You are currently able to study medicine in 4 different universities and their requirement are in the following links: KU (in Copenhagen) Admission requirements - University of CopenhagenSDU (in Odense) Entry requirementsAU (in Aarhus) MedicineAAU (in Aalborg) Admission RequirementsSince the programmes are only offered in Danish you\u2019ll need to pass the Study Test in Danish as a Second Language (oftentimes referred to as \u201cStudiepr\u00f8ven\u201d or \u201cStudy Exam\u201d) You can read more about the Study Exam here, (you\u2019ll also be able to see where you can learn Danish in Denmark): Study Exam | L\u00e6rdansk If you want to learn Danish abroad you can read more here: Starting Danish lessons ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on where you come from and what your previous education level is. I came to Denmark with a masters degree from New York. Since Denmark recognizes my education, I had no problem using that to apply for a PhD degree at DTU. On the PhD level, you learn in English. However, most undergraduate education is taught in Danish. So if you want to study on an undergraduate level, you will need to learn the language first. That means you need to take Danish level 3 and complete all 5 modules. If you start full time, that should take a year and a half. But if you want to study in Denmark, you are required to take an additional 6 months of Danish language, on top of that, and they only take the best of the best. Once you did your 2 years of intense Danish, you can apply for HF, which is somewhere between high school and college. There you will continue to take classes in English, Math, Danish etc. HF lasts around 2 years. Once you graduate, you can go to a 3 - to 3.5 year college and study medicine. And then another 2 years for a master degree. So in all, it\u2019s 2 years of Danish, 2 years of HF, and 3\u20133.5 years of college. So, in all you are looking at a minimum of 7\u20138 years to get a bachelor\u2019s degree in Denmark. Add another 2 years for a masters. I lucked out because I already got my masters before coming here and the PhD is in English. Good luck. ",

But if you are willing to use 10 years to become a doctor. Using a bit of time first to learn the countries language is a small investment.
