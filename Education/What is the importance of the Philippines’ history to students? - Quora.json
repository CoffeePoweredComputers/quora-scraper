            "answer_text": "The past, it is a dangerous place.It is a story that is full of mystery.It is interesting if not censored just like any other movieBut most important of all, so you would not repeat the same mistakes for your generation. Unfortunately, humans still do. They never learned from the Napoleonic wars and began World War I. They did not learn from World War I and began World War II. They did not learn from Martial Law and began the Extrajudicial Killings.Philippine History for grade school and high school is boring like the multiplication table. You have to mrmorise it so you can understand mathematics. Philippine History for high school was mellowed down for Catholics and children, which made them boring. However, you have to know the people involved and dates they occured to understand the conspiracies that will be taught in college. Then history becomes exciting. Honestly, it is not important. In fact it is destructive and used as propaganda. The past, it is a dangerous place. And history is written by the victors and those who lost are remembered as demons and monsters. And much of real heroes are forgotten and even much more villains now standing as monuments across the archipelago. But you see, humans opted to errect monuments commemorating the haulocaust. massacre of manila. rape nanking, pearl harbor, tirad pass, etc. Because nobody wants to br forgotten no matter how dark the past. And that is why you are made to study Filipino History. ",

            "answer_text": "To Filipino students, it is important because they are part of Philippine society, and you always want to know where you came from, what sources or influences shaped you. Just as with your family - if you have no idea what your parents were like before you were born (who their parents were, where they lived, what they did, how they met, what obstacles they overcame, etc.) you are deprived of some of what makes you \u201cyou.\u201d You can still go on - as most orphans do - but with a poorer sense of your heritage than other people have. To Filipino-American students: as above, but somewhat altered by the \u201cAmerican\u201d component of your past, depending on how closely you are linked in time, space, or social connection, to the Philippines or other Filipinos. To other students: no more important than the history of any other part of the world, and no one can master all of it. But to learn about a society that is NOT your own is a different kind of blessing - it forces you (or should force you) to reevaluate your own assumptions and perceptions, because what you grew up with as \u201cnormal\u201d - This Is What History Is Like, This Is How The World Works - turns out to be a \u201cspecial case,\u201d since other people in other societies had other experiences. Your way is not the only way; it may not even be the best way. To study ANY history should enhance your appreciation of humankind. If not: UR DOING IT WRONG. ",
