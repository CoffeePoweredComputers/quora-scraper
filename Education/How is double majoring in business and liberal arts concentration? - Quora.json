            "answer_text": "I got a 2-year AA in Liberal Arts and Science and an AS in Business in 3 years ($24,000 compared to 1 year of state and more for university and private). I think they mix well, if you challenge yourself. I can see the world through liberal arts, while focusing on business; or, business with the liberal arts. I did the liberal arts for educational purposes and got the business to get some skills \u2014 both can be applied to any job. Liberal Arts makes you much better with information (general literacy) and paperwork (time management). Business on the other hand, is managing and handling money with a few people skills thrown in. I don\u2019t have a bachelor\u2019s degree, and that\u2019s okay right now. My main goal is to learn and apply anywhere I go and these majors are a strong combo imo. Also knowing our thought process in the liberal arts, and how we work today to get money in business. Overall, do what is comfortable. If you see it as beneficial for yourself personally, do it! Don\u2019t cheap out and do what is easy, challenge yourself. Some employer will appreciate it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I went to school with friend that had the Fine Arts major and Business minor.  The idea was that he could market his fine art and the business savvy would be good for other endeavors.  He said it was rigorous. He worked a good 10 or so years as a waiter before he got some headway with his art sells.  After that, we parted ways, so I didn't take tabs on him.  As for a double major, I did a couple in fine arts and science, and with one of the majors I did was a double major.  (Art and Art History; Science/math, music concentration.)  So, I was very busy most of the time.  The downswing of this is that some grades suffered for other great grades.  I still got a combined B average for all the degrees.Double majoring is rigorous and time consuming, and some burning of the midnight oil.  There's 24 hours in a day, so what's the problem? ",
