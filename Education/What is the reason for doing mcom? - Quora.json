            "answer_text": "I have seen many negative comments here due to misunderstandings and confusions about MCOM course so I would like to take initiative to clear them. See, each every thing in this world is made for the specific and defined purpose. There is nothing in this world which is useless or worthless... One cannot use car for transportation of goods and cannot use Tampo for transportation of people. So there is a reason behind everything... Nothing happens without any reason... Coming back to the point.. Mcom is the respected masters degree in commerce and business.. It is a typical and traditional academic masters degree. It is not a professional degree. So it is not for those who want to secure higher salary posts in the corporate sector. It is one of the three mejor academic masters degree, others are ma and msc degrees\u2026 it is also offered in UK and USA but they offer ma/ msc in business / management or business economics / accountancy and finance etc instead of Mcom. The purpose or reason behind doing any academic masters whether it is ma / msc / mcom is to go for higher studies and clear net / set / jrf in their respective subjects and become professor or lecturer in their respective subjects and further do PhD in their subject... Needless to say PhD is an academic scholar and highest academic degree in the subject of choice\u2026 just like msc or ma, it is highly recommended to do mcom full time from a reputed college and simulteniously prepare for commerce net jrf exam.. Professors will provide you excellent guidance to clear net jrf... Once you clear commerce jrf, you will get good stipend to support your further research work and you can get an opportunity to do PhD in commerce / management / business economics from reputed universities / management institutes... There is a huge scope for research in commerce / management / business economics related fields provided you clear jrf in commerce and with outstanding academic record, extraordinary research work and published work, one can enter into the management consultancy / business research / can become business economists... But only thing is it requires lot of patience and excellent intellectual capabilities.. One can do FPM from iim after MCOM + NET JRF and become a lecturer in the reputed management institutes worldwide and also enter into the consultancy work or business research areas / business economics \u2026 but unfortunately, only 5% of the total commerce students know This . Others do mcom to call themselves just a masters and for the sake of only degree. They think that mcom is to become an accountant but this is absolutely misconception and misunderstanding about this degree ... Although, one can become accountant or assistant with mcom degree but this is not a main purpose / reason behind doing MCOM. If you want to become an accounts officer than you should do ca / inter ca / inter cma and if you want to become manager in the corporate sector, it is adviced to do MBA from reputed intistute. And if you want to become banker it is advisable to clear ibps Cleark / Po exams for public sector banks or join young bankers programme/ pgdbf offered by private sector banks. And if you want to be a lecturer / professor of commerce / business related disciplines or research scholar in business / management / business economics than do MCOM + NET JRF is the best choice for you. Finally, mcom is a respected academic masters degree in commerce like msc / ma degrees and the purpose of any academic masters degree is to study further and clear net / set / jrf and become professor / lecturer and do further higher studies that is PhD in the subject of choice.. If you don't want to go for higher studies than don't do mcom just for the sake of a degree... Be sincere and hardworking, be clear with your career goals.. Decide what you want to do in your life and study accordingly right courses and right subjects, success will be yours.. Best of luck. See, good news... Many reputed universities like Delhi university, mumbai university, pune university etc are inviting PhD applications and research proposals from mcom + net (jrf) as a junior research fellow for Persuing their PhD in the following subjects : - AccountancyFinanceEconomics and policyBusiness administration and strategyTrade transport and industryManagement studiesFollowing list of different Subjects are not just subjects in commerce and management but each and every subject serves as an unique areas of business and management. Remember that old structure of commerce and management PhD has been changed to the greater extent and nowadays single commerce PhD is devided into many related subjects and areas of speciality so it's very important to complete your PhD from reputed universities where you will be given choice to select your own area of research or speciality. Earlier, there was a single PhD in commerce for all related areas so the professors of commerce were the jacks of all trade but they lack speciality and mastery in the specific area of business and research but now, as I said earlier, time has changed, now, as a business professor, you will be provided a chance to become expert in the specific research area of business if you complete your PhD from reputed universities and management institutes. With the following areas of study, one can apply for professorship not only in the commerce and management colleges but also in the reputed management institutes. One can also apply for professorship in the reputed universities of the world like Oxford, Cambridge and Standford etc and also become respected management professor and researcher in the top management institutes in the world like Harvard etc. So in short, with the PhD in business, one can go abroad for faculty positions and research positions, consultancy positions in the top ranked global BSchools like Harvard, Standford, said BSchool, London school of economics etc. After Mcom, having the global masters degree especially in the business related domain, you can even complete your PhD from abroad like Standford BSchool, Harvard school of business and London school of economics. For this, you need to clear GMAT / GRE exam and also need to clear TOFAEL exam for English proficiency and after having global PhD from top BSchools in the world, you can become a bright and vibrant, eminent professor/ researcher and consultant in the selected specialised area of business and management. Following is the list of subjects with expaination for the research and study : - 1. PhD in accountancy PhD in accountancy and finance is the highest academic degree in this field. (higher than ever green professional courses like ca , cs etc. Such professional courses are considered equivalent to the masters degree) You can enter into the consultancy work after this level of expertise. One can become a faculty professor in the reputed management institutes in the world. One can address many issues pertaining to this field and do thorough research to overcome them. One can even do research on the latest trends in accountancy and finance world. 2. PhD in business economics and policy After Persuing this research degree, one can become economist, policy research analyst, business consultant or economic analyst. One can derive various finance / risk management / business analytics and production / operations research models using econometric decision sciences and economic theory and guide corporates towards the sound decision making. One can hold faculty position in the top north B schools. You can become a professor of economics (no need to do ma economics) in the universities and collgeges. Secondly, with Mcom + PhD in economics, one can also write Indian Economic Services, RBI DEPR Exams and become reputed eminent economist doing national duty, one can also join Think Tanks of the government for policy framework and analysis. One can also appear and clear SEBI exams, rbi grade B etc beacause, after Mcom, you are a masters degree holder dude!!! I think this is really great! One can even become economist after having Mcom + PhD in economics! Means with Mcom, one can do all those things what ma economics students do! So huge scope of Mcom!!! The only thing you need is extraordinary knowledge of your subject choosen... Which you can gather during your post graduate studies... Come on friends! Why are you people joining colleges for your post graduate studies??? Utilise your college facilities to the maximum extent for which you pay fees. For this, join reputed college for Mcom like SRCC, HANSRAJ COLLEGE OF COMMERCE AND ECONOMICS, ST. JOSEPH COLLEGE OF COMMERCE AND ECONOMICS, DELHI UNIVERSITY, CHRIST UNIVERSITY etc... Don't understand why you people are joining as an assistant accountants or Clarks posts after having Mcom??? And if you are unable to utilise this all opportunities than you as a students, are to be blamed for your loss, you can't blame your degree. 3. PhD in finance and banking As the name suggest, this research area enables you to do research on the finance and banking industry, latest trends and emerging issues in this industry and so on. One can become faculty of reputed management institutes and universities and colleges. 4. PhD in business administration and strategy This area deals with the overall business strategy framework and administration. It comprises study of various functional strategies and operational strategies and linking them with the overall strategy of the business etc. One can become a faculty of management institutes and universities, colleges. 5. PhD in trade, transport and industry Involves study of transport and tourism, warehousing, communication and logistics, supply chain management etc factors affecting all these and cause effect, cost benefit analysis and consequences and role of sound transportation facilities for corporate and economy as a whole. 6. PhD in management studies PhD in management studies comprises functional business management research research by deviding entire business management into the functions and specialisations like financial management, marketing management, Human resources and operations and IT and systems management etc. One can teach all these subjects in the management institutes and universities and do functional busienss research and undertake consultancy work for the corporates. (The above mentioned subjects are globally recognised areas of business and management. So after having PhD in any of the above speciality, one can call himself as a global management professor and researcher and one can apply for the business and management faculty position in the choosen area of expertise in the universities and BSchools throughout the world. So the global career is open for you.) One single masters degree opens 6 choices and subjects for PhD and research. This is really great. No other masters degree offers such a huge choice. Now you tell me.. What is wrong / bad in the MCOM degree ??? The entire problem is in our perception and mindset. THE ABOVE INFORMATION IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT \u2014- Students should focus on getting knowledge and excellence and experience rather than degrees and marks and placements etc. This concept has been explained in the famous movie \u201cThree Idiots\u201d. Chase the excellence, not success and degrees and placements and marks. The ultimate utmost important material fact is your knowledge and excellence and experience, not your degrees and marks. No matter Mcom degree is between MA and MBA... It merely makes you eligible for doing PhD in different and varied areas of specialisation, it is upon you how you utilise and leverage your knowledge and skills after having doctorate, many prefer to join colleges for lectureship but some as I know, also entered into the rich and glorious consultancy work after having doctorate in their area of expertise. (not because of their doctorate degree, but because of their excellence, knowledge and skills and experience in their chosen area of expertise) So with Mcom + PhD in the chosen area of expertise , max to Max, one can become a business and management professor and research scholar and undertake research and consultancy work and can hold faculty positions in the top north BSchools of the world.. Not because of their degrees and doctorate award but because of their excellence and knowledge, skills, attitude and experience of decades and a lot of post qualification hard work in their chosen area of expertise. STRICTLY SPEAKING, IF YOU WANT TO BE PROFESSIONAL MANAGER IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR LIKE FINANCE, HR OR MARKETING, PLRASE DO MBA FROM REPUETED INSTITUTE.IF YOU WANT TO BE PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANT OR FINANCE PROFESSIONAL, PLEASE DO CA, CS, CFA, CFP, FRM, ACCA, CPA, CIMA, MBA / MSC FINANCE, CMA, CWM ETC ETC ETCIF YOU WANT TO BE BANKER IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS, PLEASE ENROLL AND CLEAR THE BANKING COMPETITIVE EXAMS CONDUCTED BY IBPS, SBI FOR PO AND CLERK LEVEL, AND AFTER ENTERING INTO PSU BANKS, APPEAR AND CLEAR CAIIB EXAMS CONDUCTED BY IIBF.IF YOU WANT TO BE PRIVATE BANKER, DO 1 YEAR PGDBF PROGRAMME OF ICICI - MANIPAL UNIVERSITY, AXIS BANK , HDFC BANK ETC IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOUR GRADUATION.AND, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE PROFESSOR / WANT TO BE IN A FACULTY OF TOP RANKED MANAGEMENT SCHOOLS / RESEARCHER AND CONSULTANT, THAN PLEASE ENROLL FOR MCOM AND DO PHD IN THE SUBJECT OF CHOICE FROM REPUTED UNIVERSITIES/ MANAGEMENT INSTITUTES.10 out of 15 faculty members of FMS, DFS, DBE, DSE Delhi, IIM\u2019S are MCOM + PhD OR MA/MSC + PHD, (Rest are BTECH / MBA + PHD). If they can than why can't you??? just think about it before saying that Mcom Is only for teaching... Please don't underestimate yourself... OK. IIM'S invite research proposals from UGC NET JRF Qualified candidates in any discipline for the PhD in commerce and management in the following areas of specialisations : Finance and accountingMaketing managementHuman resource managementAgri business managementEconomics and social sciencesDecision sciencesPublic policySo any masters degree holder with NET JRF in the subject of their masters can apply for the same without any additional entrance exam, if you don't have jrf than you need to crack CAT Exam for the same... Commerce masters degree holders are the best fit for the IIM PhD as compare to science or arts masters... What do you think??? But still, BTECH / MA / MSC holders are utilising this golden opportunity, than why can't you??? think about it. Please at least after 2018, keep in mind that education system is changing rapidly nowadays, by 2021 , PhD is mandatory for the post of assistant professor in the colleges and universities. Government is taking steps to implement new choice based education system and many more positive and progressive changes are planned and to be implemented sooner. And the difference between commerce and management PhD is rapidly vanishing... Whether it's PhD in commerce or management, it doesn't matter... What matters is your subject of specialisation for your PhD... That is... Accountancy, finance, marketing, human resources, economics, international relations etc etc. After having Mcom + phd, degree is not limiting their career upto only teaching and lectureship, but degree holders are limiting their careers upto teaching and lectureship due to their limited capabilities and excellence and skills or lack of knowledge / awareness or lack of self confidence or due to any other reason.
