            "answer_text": "This depends on the person. If one can handle 4 classes but not 5, then it is certainly better to take 4 instead of 5. If one can handle 5 just as well as 4, then it is probably better to take 5; provided the extra course is neither superfluous nor redundant. Of course, there is also other factors to consider in the balancing act. A 5th class would require time from your day. If it is time that will not be missed, then it\u2019s no big deal, but if it is time needed to work to pay or study for the classes then maybe it\u2019s not such a good idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Since the GI Bill was paying my tuition, I had to be full time. But I wanted to take as many classes as I could, both to earn credits, but also to learn as much as I could. It was hard. My sleep suffered, often only an hour a night, taking my lunch and both breaks at my job at the same time. This is not something everyone can do. You have to decide if you can do the time and effort for that fifth class, while still doing the necessary time and effort for the other four classes. Also, what are your standards for yourself? Nothing but As? Are you willing to accept a B? What if all five are Bs? I already had one bachelor\u2019s degree, and by taking these extra classes, I was able to finish three years work in two years. It was worth it to me, because I wanted to be in a school teaching ASAP, not in a college classroom. Think about all this and make your decision. I hope it works for you. ",
