            "answer_text": "I have given my 10th boards last year, so I am perfect to answer this question!! SUBJECTS:English/Hindi - This subject is totally unpredictable, no matter how well you have written you will not be 100% sure about your marks. I was expecting my English marks to be 95+ but it was 88(I didn't went for rechecking because it's waste).Sanskrit- You can easily score 100/100 in Sanskrit if you work hard constantly. This subject can be a percentage booster for you.Maths- Some students say maths is tough whereas some say it's easy. For me, it was a subject of practice, the more you solve the more you learn. NCERT is must because 60% questions directly come from NCERT in boards, trust me!! I got 97 in maths just by solving NCERT, I didn't followed any book like R.S Agawal, R.D Sharma etc etc.Social Studies- This subject has the lengthiest syllabus, as you know. Evaluators check 1 marks questions seriously, rest questions just you should right to the point and you will get marks. Maps are very easy, so try to make no mistakes there.Science- You can easily score 90+ in science if you practice hard. Boards result depends on your practice in last 3 months i.e NOV-FEB. Practicing diagrams are very important with neat answers.Rest it depends on your hare work. If you will work really hard, then no subject will be hard for you. Signing off Best of Luck!!

            "answer_text": "It really depends u must know what u like i repeat what u like not what ur parents want u to like it maybe science or economics or whatever it wont be very difficult because u will be more into the subject hence u will spend time on it i am in gr10 and the most difficult subject for Physical Education. With all due respect to those who find it nice i am not judging ur choice but pls tell why why why what is the importance of learning rubbish about cricket and football and all the biology part where they tell u about ur body is understandable so personally as long as u r interested in the subject it wont be difficult for u by the way this was my first answer on quora ",
