            "answer_text": "I'm a student of Kendriya Vidyalaya and passed out of the school in 1974. Now that is important because of two things:- I was taught wonderfully by my teachers in English. All subjects, except of course Hindi! :-)I was in KV more than 45 years ago and since then I'm told, very reliably, that teachers have continued to teach their students in English.But of course, it would be foolish of me to judge the person asking this question without knowing the motivation for asking. Maybe there was something written between the lines which I couldn't make out. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, KV teachers speak English. In addition, they also reinforce their teachings with extra languages, if the student benefits that way. Students in KV are usually a pan-Indian crowd. So the easiest way to communicate is to speak in Hindi and English. I remember an educational officer who would regularly ask the students what language she should use for her assembly addresses. This she would alternate between English and Hindi. While teachers don't have to follow such a system, they are linguistically well versed. ",
