            "answer_text": " We tend to have these so called man-made-misconceptions that: Rank holders are doomed to being Employees for the rest of their livesRebels and trouble makers end up as Successful BusinessmenAverage Students will be nothing but average for the rest of their lives.Amazing right when we have only 3 categories for a population of around 7.442 Billion people - that is 7,442,000,000 It like this amazing myth - we use 10% of our brains. So imagine if we used the complete 100% - then what would happen. I think people need to stop buying into all the motivational and inspirational \u2018stuff\u2019 that these author sell to people. Some of it as Obnoxious as Rhonda Byrne and her pseudoscientific nonsense \u2018The Secret\u2019 where the majority believe if they suddenly close their eyes and visualize, and repeat something enough number of times with belief and affirmation - money will get attracted to them and come into their mailbox. Sadly, I tried the same technique with hair growth with not much success. (neither did the money come into my mailbox) So now we come to another so called classification of \u2018An Average Student\u2019. Here is my list of questions: You graded him average in what specific skill? Memorization Skills of a Text Book? Mathematical Skills? English Speaking skills? Physical Training Skills? Weight Training? Swimming? Business? Management? Leadership?On what criteria were these tests conducted?Are these tests globally recognized, certified and accepted?Do you have 10 years data of accurately testing 10,000 subjects with data that can accurately assess and predict the accuracy and legitimacy of your tests as you grade the students?Do you have a 50 year time line of all the students who took these tests where your label as Amazing or Average or Bad was taken and it was proved with 100% accuracy that your assessment was accurate?Can it be possible that these tests are just mere assumptions? one trick based assessments? that they do not cover another variety of skills? that they can be wrong? that they are just created by a team of outdated professionals?So when we probe further into such so called \u2018Categories\u2019 or \u2018Compartments\u2019 created by which you BRAND children - we realize the whole system by which you evaluate someone as dynamic, creative and amazing as a Human Children - is absolute rubbish! My blood seriously boils when I hear as Child being \u2018Average\u2019 or \u2018Smart\u2019 or \u2018Dumb\u2019. Please my request to you is this - if it is as vile and unacceptable to throw racist, sexist and derogatory terms on people especially children - then is absolutely wrong, morally and legally to brand children like this. And no one and I repeat NO ONE can predict, assume or know for a fact if a child with a high marks, with bad scores or an average marks can become successful, average or a failure. Just because people read a few books, earn a little money and get a certificate that brands them a certificate DOES NOT make them a futurist for the masses. Every child is unique, every individual is unique and every one is made to be unique. PLEASE I request all of you - stop categorizing children! Loy MachedoI highly recommend watching this video by Sir Ken Robinson - Do Schools Kill Creativity - please watch it.

            "answer_text": "An average student is a one who choses to be an average student. It is all the choices we make that make ourselves, \u201cbest\u201d, \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d. Imagine waking up in the morning and deciding to go through the whole day in an average manner (a subconscious choice most people make) without stretching yourself even a little bit out of the average limits you have set for yourself. Now imagine doing the same everyday for the rest of life. And you have turned yourself as an average student in college, in life, in workplace, everywhere.  Now, imagine waking up in the morning and telling yourself that you will work today twice of what an average person do, will face the challenges no matter what comes up and will not give up. And now again imagine doing the same everyday for the rest of your life and now you have turned yourself into a winner, into the best. Many a times, we do see that a person who is average in almost everything else is excelling in a particular thing, leaving everyone behind, people chose to call it passion or obsession or give it any other fancy name, they just ignore the fact that the person made a choice to not be an average in that particular thing and is putting in all the efforts to not be an average in it and hence is not an average in it. Thus, at the end of the day it was the student who chose to be an average turned out to be an average in one aspect or in all aspects of life. Pic source: Motivationgrid.com ",
