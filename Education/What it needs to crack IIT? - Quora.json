            "answer_text": "There are only two things which you need to have for getting successful in life for whatever you aspire to do.  Will  Its impossible to get successful without motivation and the \"willingness\" to succeed.  You will have to face obstacles and cross all your mental, emotional, biological limits in order to reach the top.  Time Patience and persistence will  always be needed for doing things which require lot of hard work. Right now at school, You may think that you can do this stuff in 10 days, while you have to submit it in 30 days, so why are you doing it now? You will procrastinate and therefore as 20 days pass by you will realize that now you HAVE to do this in 10 days, you have no other choice.  Therefore respect time, don't waste it, do something, do something productive, do something for others, or at least do something for yourself.  Time is the mother of success, Success won't marry you if she finds that you don't respect her mother. Now lets get to IIT- To get into IITs, it takes the spirit to get do things differently form others.  -While others go to birthday parties,  you study. -While others watch movies, you study. -While others go on trips and camping, you study. -While others make relationships (gf-bf), you study. -While others say they \"Enjoy Life!\" and make jokes about you , you laugh at those jokes and you study. Now what actually happens to you during this period of time- -You develop the ability to complete targets (HW) on time, while others say they \"Enjoy Life!\" . -You understand the fact that you may have to deal with something you don't like, in order to get successful (chemistry in my case), while others say they \"Enjoy Life!\" . -When you almost see a pinch of failure every now and then, and feel as if you want to QUIT (as you score low marks), you develop the courage to continue , while others say they \"Enjoy Life!\" . -When you realize that Not even God could have helped you, unless you had worked hard  (the final day of exam) , while others still say they \"Enjoy Life!\" . {Read the above points without brackets, before reading below further} You realize that you were learning the essential skills of life even though you thought that you were studying Physics Chemistry Maths.  And lastly, you start feeling that you enjoyed your life a lot during your preparations, soon after you join the IITs , while others still say (with a sad face) that they \"Enjoy Life!\"   All The Best for JEE Advanced 2019 .... :)  ",
