            "answer_text": "Note: I copied my answer from this question as I felt it is more appropriate here!! Saigayatri Vadali's answer to I'm joining VNR VJIET through management quota in CSE in 2018. Is it worth it? Welcome to our college!!  I am from IT branch and can tell you what exactly it looks like to be a VNR student. As you are going to spend four most energetic and amazing years of your life, knowing well ahead will leave you more prepared.The first thing to do as you enter college is to know about clubs, student chapters and sports complex. Student clubs:VNR have every student activity with it with name -club. Due to its variety of clubs like Literary, Social ,music, dance and crafts, you can groom any of your skills here. There are clubs in photography, drama and Short films too. So be it anything, you can learn and succeed. For someone with multiple skills, it can often be confusing in choosing the best one. I suggest go and give your interview with all the clubs you are interested in the first year. This gives you much more exploration of college and interaction of seniors which is otherwise impossible. You will realise that the best thing you have done in the first year is to be a part of one or more clubs and student chapters. Picture shows the Interactive session with J. D. Lakshmi Narayana garu organised by Student force.  Student chapters:Firstly know what a student chapter is. Across globe there are famous journals and research groups which promote research and tech enthusiasm among students. They work actively through chapters in colleges. For cse and IT students there are chapters like CSI. These students chapters generally conduct some technical workshops ( which are generally very basic and I don't think, these help you learn so much about a technology). They are also known for the bonding between their members. Sports complex :As you enter into the college and walk through its length, you can see all tennis courts which will surely amuse you. Here is an image for you.  Pay an immediate visit into the building behind them. There are courts for basketball, tennis, volley ball badminton, gym with students and coaches thoroughly involved.  As you cross this builing there is a big ground where many students are found playing.All these are almost free with 100 rupees as fee per year. We are actually more proud of our sport star friends than anything in the college!! There is one friend of mine who transformed himself from a beginner into National player in Badminton in his four years of engineering with this complex. As you enter the building, the sight of many trophies and prizes proves all my words!! Faculty and departments :The same old theoritical classes form the biggest part. Some faculty have an edge over others like any other college. Get in touch with them. They can be little annoying too but are worth out patience and can eventually make our Tech interest increase many folds. But there cannot be a big number of such faculty. Yeah, its harsh reality in any private college. Your search for such faculty should begin as early as possible, right from second year. Labs are good and decently equipped with all that is needed ( This is for IT branch.)  Picture shows the visit of school children to our labs. Students:I can write a book to describe students here. This factor decides your future more than the college itself. There are all types of students here. Read the answer in the link below which gives a detailed note of students here. But best part at VNR is because of its clubs and vibrant environment, you can get like minded people easily. But be wise in choosing who are competent and focused. Definitely you can find them though they are also rarest of rare gems just like good faculty !! Again don't mistake them with toppers!!Also, don't make gender based friendships like only girl gangs or only guy gangs. Try to overcome these shy factors are early as possible and mingle more with pure heart. It makes us more comfortable and understanding in terms of humanity as a whole. Hostel :I don't know about newly built hostel but heard it to be cool. But for the first three years, I have been in old hostel which left many memories, lessons and made me more independant. Definitely worth trying. But, the hostel fee is way too high and they claim to build all courts and gym in the hostel too in near future. Here is a picture of one of the birthday celebrations of our room mates!! Hostel will be fun if you get such crazy room mates at I got!!   You can imagine how much we had to struggle to do all these hiding from the girl!! Placements :Placements are the best at VNR due to its nearness to Hi-tech city than many other colleges. Also, there are many competent students who work really hard and bag very high packages. A Vibrant coding environment is also building up in college which is also favouring more placements and coders. Amazon has paid 14LPA for the students who successful finished one year internship with them for the batch 2018. Microsoft with 9 LPA. Deloitte and JPMC come next with around 6.5 LPA. Also, the count of students getting into these companies is also very high. Placement branch is very active and the staff are genuine in helping students. Try building a rapo with them right from third year apart from working on projects and academics. They keep you updated with the requirements of industry.  Research and development:There is an active department which works in R and D. Being with them, gave me the best gift - Machine learning. The faculty and seniors there will surely help you in sorting out your career decisions and fields which you are interested in .This branch is the sole reason for my interest and project work in Machine learning. But, sadly many students don't know about exploring this even in final year. You should visit it in your first year itself. Entrepreneurship:There is an ED cell which gives incubation to start-ups with good ideas. I have seen many of my juniors working actively in building their dream start-ups with ED cell. ED cell is something which you can look up-to if you wish to be a young entrepreneur. There are some companies being run by alumni within the college even now.This picture is during a workshop conducted by ibhubs.  Fests: The fest season begins with Sports fest usually. Many colleges take part in sports fest and is considerd to be best of its kind in Hyderabad. I know very little about this. Next, we have Convergence as technical fest which has many workshops, events and Saradhi with it. I suggest don't get into events which are actually hyped by your seniors but don't help you so much. Better use this time for taking part in as many workshops as possible. The social club - Student force, NSS have many social awareness programs too during this time. Involve and invest in knowing and learning more in first year.Convergence poster hanging from SAAC building.  Sintillashunz ,the cultural fest of my first year has been the first ever time I danced for three continuous nights in life. It will be a very enchanting experience in first year and you will cherish it well. The mornings are all for cultural club -Cresendo and literary club-stentorian. The nights are for DJ, dance and musical nights. From second year, it can be little boring. Again, you will not dare to miss it in final year.Image shows Sintillashunz stage during one such power-packed nights!!Pack your bags for a whole 10 day enjoyment with these fests!  Library :We have a very good library with good number of books and large space. It can be peaceful to sit and study for straight 12 hours 8AM to 8PM. You can stay till 8PM at library. There is a free bus facility for library students till nearest bus stop at 8PM. Many of my seniors and friends have cleared CAT, GATE, placements and government exams by utilising library well.The librarian and other staff will help you and will become good mentors if they find you are dedicated. There is a digital library facility too. Salute:We celebrate Independence Day and republic day at college. On republic day, there happens a parade called Salute where each club of our college comes up with a societal concern creating awareness in other students, faculty, parents and visitors. It shows our unity in diversity!! Stentorian - the literary club creating awareness on\u201cgender sensitization \u201c issue  Demerits :Though there are many good things happening in college, students generally limit themselves to none or at max two. This leads to a restricted development.Also, the support from faculty in reasearch can be very disappointing in some branches.The communal clashes among certain student sections were also prevalent but reduced considerably. Again it is personal choice and we can be with anyone we want to. On the whole, at personal level, I love my college alot for it has given me many experiences, friends, clubs which made me what I am today!!

            "answer_text": "Can say one of the top colleges in Hyderabad for engineering (UG). There were already some topics which were answered quite beautifully regarding college. Placement Opportunities: CSE,IT>ECE,EEE,EIE> Mechanical, Automobile Faculty : more or less all are same Infrastructure: very good when compared to other local colleges. CLUBS : Lots of clubs technical and non technical Tech clubs : Not good( advice don't spend too much to buy memberships unless you plan to publish some paper through IEEE or something else) Non Tech clubs : some are hard-working like dance and singing clubs. Not sure about others Sports : I believe you will have great support from college ( I am not a sports person) Now coming to most important thing: Students: A college is more represented by quality of students than infra faculty and placements and what not. Placement only come when you have good quality of students. Yes although the placements are good thanks to TCS,Cap Gemini, Tech M( you know how mass recruitment works) (they take more through aggregate cut off 60% and a written test follwoed by interview) I am not sure if everyone is satisfied joining there. The worst part is senior junior relationship which plays crucial in turning a college to great college. You don't learn from their mistakes or their learnings are not passed down to you when they leave college. Although I had great relationship with some of my seniors I am not sure if that's the case with everyone. Although people want to get together and build something there is a factor which hinders everything no transportation to main city after 6 pm which cuts of every motivation( u need to spend some extra quality time inorder to build something). Since even hostels are not located in college people lack place to crash after college. The internet speed sucks even if you want to collaborate remotely. Then what about collaboration during fest!! Yes there is some interaction during fest let's face it it's more power quarrel then making it a success. ( My opinion). Cultural fest is celebrated with great enthusiasm with some collaboration. I don't get one thing is it a tech college or some kind of arts college then why the hell does cultural fest has more budget than tech fest. Although it helps in developing leadership skills which helps us to land us at job. Leadership qualities are imp to 20\u201330 percent the other 70 percent should be your tech expertise. Alumni : collaboration zero. Helps us to land at opportunities that clg cannot provide. Over all: Definitely top 3 in Hyderabad engineering colleges ( including ou jntu) . I am great full to all awesome people I met in college who will be part of my life one way or other way. As awesome as it is vnr needs to pull the socks up and run for improving quality in every way possible. Simply building infra will not do shit if motivation in students and faculty is not present. Note : All the above things are mentioned only to motivate someone joining my college to change things. ",

Student intiatives and guidance to juniors:  Speeches and visits by real personalities who make a difference in real life: Motivational club:  5. Place to interact and display your projects:   6. Parade by various student clubs displaying their work for Republic Day:   7. Various clubs to get into:     8. Industrial visits:  9. Intramurals and events for freshers:  10. You will get a bunch of people who will stay in touch for the rest of your\u200b life  The best for the last i guess :) Final verdict: you will grow up from a kid who got into engineering to a man who knows how to manage various situations in life. 4yrs spent here will be the ones you'll\u200b remember for a long-long time.b #for female readers- from a kid to a women :v . . . . . . . . . .

            "answer_text": "I am currently studying in 3rd year CSE. I think VNR is the best college in Hyderabad after CBIT and Vasavi(apart from JNTU and OU). Firstly placements in VNR are very good.top companies like Amazon, JPMC, Microsoft visit the campus.the highest package last year was 42lakhs/annum(some Japanese company) ,Amazon offers 30L package and JPMC offers 14L package.if you are good at coding and other technical skills, you will definitely get placed in a good company even if you are from non-CS branches. Coming to co-curricular activities, we have many technical and non-technical clubs such as CSI, Livewire(dance club), VJ teatro(shortfilm club) and many more..so you will enjoy a lot being a part of these clubs.vnr also has some great fest's like sintillashunz and convergence.we enjoy a lot by involving in all these activities. Coming to faculty, they are pretty good and we have more ph.d faculty out there in college. So if you want to join VNR for any branch apart from CSE and IT(if you get CSE or IT, you are very lucky), still it's a very good option among all other colleges in Hyderabad. Overall rating:9/10 ",
