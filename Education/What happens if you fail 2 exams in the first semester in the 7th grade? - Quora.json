            "answer_text": "It sounds like you are in a bit of distress. On your side, the fact is that not everyone who encounters difficulties at your stage in life actually worries. I\u2019d say you clearly want to do well. Your worry isn\u2019t entirely a bad thing. The good news is that middle school grades affect stuff like college not at ALL. The bad news is you probably have to come up with a more effective way to study. So - Don\u2019t be afraid of your grown-ups. They can help. Second, get someone who can help you understand why it went badly. This might be an academic advisor, or your teachers, but it also might be a counsellor or therapist. Take care of yourself first. if you don\u2019t let your worry overcome you, you will be fine. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps you will be considered to retake those classes or will be put in a lower level class to relearn the subject so you can do well in the future. It is worth noting that your grades will not affect your college admission chances and aren\u2019t an indicator of how you will do in the future at this point in your education. High school really matters if you\u2019re trying to go into the top school, so as long as you are determined and willing to work in high school your future will be bright. ",
