            "answer_text": "Hi, I might be of some help to you as last year only I gave the paper and I'm from UP as well. See, to be true, last year the cutoff REALLY shooted up. Moreover, last year was the first year when the pattern had changed and English was eliminated, so there was no bonus for us. The cutoff last year was 171 for general category( other categories I don't remember). The only thing I'd advise you RIGHT NOW is not to lay your trust on these \u201cexpected cutoffs\u201d. Last year the so-called 'expected cutoff' was 159. I was really, REALLY happy because I had scored around 167. But to my worst nightmare, it was 171. To be true, if I had not known the expected cutoff I had not been this discouraged and disheartened. So, best of luck and enjoy this curiousity of wait. I wish the best for you. And remember, this WON'T be the end and all the best for your boards too\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d ",
