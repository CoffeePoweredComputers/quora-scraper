            "answer_text": "Pros: Less crowded class and campus.Nice infrastructure.Safe parking area.Good teachers in Maths and Chemistry.Relaxation in Uniform and ID card.Clean toilets.Good drinking water supply.Canteen in every floor.Cons: Average teachers in Physics Department. Only few good are left such as SR sir and NKS(hod) sir. Even ninja(hod) sir is not able to teach due to his age.Unorganized DPPs and study material.Badly categorised questions in study material.Poor DPPs and sheet discussion in class.Some Discrimination to lower batches. Very Fast Pace of teaching. Above Average and Average student struggle alot.Worst Administration in Kota.All the managers, Rakesh Sharma, RD sharma and Jayesh Joshi are very rude.Reception staff is not co-operative.Overchilled Class rooms.Not a systematic teaching methodology.Highest fees in Kota. 1.6 lac for 12thOnly 70% syllabus completed in 11th. Rest in 12th.No motivation programmes or cultural programmes.Extremely tough question in study material, might shake your confidence.HODs only teach in top batches and very very fast pace of teaching. They assume you are genius. That why some top batch students join individual coachings specially for physics.Filthy Condition of lower batches and worst for Average Students.Vendors in Qoura, FB and Mouthshut writing fake positive reviews of Vibrant Academy.Dont join Vibrant you will Regret. In my opinion, join Allen. ",

            "answer_text": "Vibrant academy is one of the academies which has flourished in recent years. The real strength of vibrant are it's 7 directors. Let's start with pros. Vibrant is best known for it's maths. The best maths faculty in Kota is in Vibrant. Superbly talented teachers like Vikas Gupta, Pankaj Joshi, Subhanu Purohit etc. They make maths seem so easy to you.The study material for Vibrant which they call as sheet is extremely powerful. If you solve the questions from the sheet you can easily solve the IIT problems.The 7 directors teach in the P1 batch. If one manages to keep his position in that batch throught the two years their chances to get selected are more than 80%.If one goes on a unavoidable leave then later Vibrant teachers arrange back up classes for such students.Revision classes are held every week so one does not forget the concepts of previous chapter.It does not occupy more than a hundred students in a class.Now moving on to the cons. Physics is a subject where I felt vibrant needs improvement. The physics faculty is not as good as the maths.Vibrant basically does not have any study materials so the teachers mostly depend on the reference books.Students in batches other than P1 batch are not considered as capable as them. This leads to a bit of inferiorness among students.This were the pros and cons of the Vibrant academy which I found. I hope the answer was helpful to you. ",
