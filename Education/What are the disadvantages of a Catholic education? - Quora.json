            "answer_text": "Most Catholic schools are small, private schools. This means that, if you go through it from Kindergarten-12th grade, you'll be with roughly the same group of people. This can be a good thing, if you fit in with said group. I went to Catholic school from 1st to 5th grade, and I didn't fit in. I didn't have any friends. I was always the weird kid. I got bullied pretty badly. Thankfully I got out of there before going to the combined Catholic Middle/High School. I hear that this high school is kind of a dumping ground for students who have been expelled from other schools and have a choice between there or not having a diploma. I have also heard that, because of these people being there, you are not really free to express your religious beliefs. I've heard conflicting reports about these, but I believe them based on my Catholic school experience. I'm a practicing Catholic now, and plan on marrying after college (I'm Engaged now) and having kids. They're going in the public school system. ",

Oh wait, that happens in public schools, too. Dang!Going to Mass in the grade school\u2019s gym.Going to Mass in the high school\u2019s forum.No one practising any other faith, of course. My World Religions class taught me about the other faiths, especially Islam, but it would only be until university that I would actually see them in practise.Other than that, it was just like any other public school.
