            "answer_text": "The Bible is clear on what constitutes a true Christian. This info is not known to most Christians but it is readily available if they read the Bible daily as we are advised to do. Only those who truly want to know will get help from Jehovah. The truth of God and his son is not to be taken lightly. We are not automatically saved just for believing in Jehovah and Jesus for the demons believe in them also. The Bible was written for our instruction and information on how to obey God. It is important to understand that he expects people to willingly look for him. I didn\u2019t know for sure if he existed or not when I first began to study the scriptures. I didn\u2019t even know God\u2019s name. But I was raised in the Baptist religion and what the pastor taught and what the Bible said didn\u2019t match up. So I really wanted to know if God did exist. I prayed to the unknown God and asked for help. I have been a Jehovah\u2019s Witness for over 40 years and never been happier. Here is what the Bible says makes a true Christian. Illustrating how to tell the difference between those who practice the true religion and those who do not, the Bible says: \u201cBy their fruits you will recognize them. Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they?\u201d (Matthew 7:16) Just as you can distinguish a grapevine from a thornbush by what it produces, you can distinguish true religion from false by its fruits, or by these identifying features. True religion teaches the truth that is based on the Bible, not on human philosophies. (John 4:24; 17:17) This includes religious truths about the soul and the hope of everlasting life on a paradise earth. (Psalm 37:29; Isaiah 35:5, 6; Ezekiel 18:4) It also does not hold back from exposing religious falsehood.\u2014Matthew 15:9; 23:27, 28. True religion helps people to know God, including teaching them his name, Jehovah. (Psalm 83:18; Isaiah 42:8; John 17:3, 6) It does not teach that he is incomprehensible or aloof; rather, it teaches that he wants us to have a relationship with him.\u2014James 4:8. True religion highlights Jesus Christ as the one through whom God grants salvation. (Acts 4:10, 12) Its members obey Jesus\u2019 commands and strive to follow his example.\u2014John 13:15; 15:14. True religion focuses on God\u2019s Kingdom as mankind\u2019s only hope. Its members actively tell others about that Kingdom.\u2014Matthew 10:7; 24:14. True religion promotes unselfish love. (John 13:35) It teaches respect for all ethnic groups and welcomes people from all races, cultures, languages, and backgrounds. (Acts 10:34, 35) Moved by love, its members do not go to war.\u2014Micah 4:3; 1 John 3:11, 12. True religion has no paid clergy, and it does not give high-sounding religious titles to any of its members.\u2014Matthew 23:8-12; 1 Peter 5:2, 3. True religion is completely neutral in political affairs. (John 17:16; 18:36) However, its members respect and obey the government where they live, in harmony with the Bible\u2019s command: \u201cPay back Caesar\u2019s things to Caesar [representing the civil authority], but God\u2019s things to God.\u201d\u2014Mark 12:17; Romans 13:1, 2. True religion is a way of life, not just a ritual or a formality. Its members adhere to the Bible\u2019s high moral standards in all aspects of life. (Ephesians 5:3-5; 1 John 3:18) Rather than being grim, though, they find joy in worshipping \u201cthe happy God.\u201d\u20141 Timothy 1:11. Those who practice true religion will be in the minority. (Matthew 7:13, 14) Members of the true religion are often looked down on, ridiculed, and persecuted for doing God\u2019s will.\u2014Matthew 5:10- ",

You have noticed that a lot of Christians are \u201cso unlike [our] Christ\u201d which is attributed to Mahatma Gandhi [1]. And there is some truth to this. In fact, there is a lot of truth to this. In fact, its effing obvious! Of course, Christians are unlike Christ. Christians are not Christ. We are followers of Christ. We naturally fall short of His standards. So what does He do? Does He yell and stamp? Does He smite us with thunderbolts from His exalted position at the right hand of the Father? No. He prays for us. He sends us the Comforter: the Holy Spirit of God who rebukes, disciplines, heals and leads and slowly prepares us for Eternity with God. So don\u2019t judge anyone. We have no way of knowing what each person\u2019s relationship with God is. The tares are sown among the wheat and there is no way to distinguish them until they bear fruit [2]: and there is no real way of knowing when they will bear fruit [3]. This is a round-about way of saying your question has no answer this side of Eternity. :) But prepare to be surprised by whom you will find in Heaven.

            "answer_text": "It depends where you go because the church is in different states of health in different regions of the world. In the US, the best guess is that 5% to 8% of those who identify as Christians are actually saved and bear fruit in keeping with salvation. The churches in Western Europe are in even worse shape. China is the fastest growing Christian nation in the world right now, and given the harsh persecution the Chinese government uses against Christians, it is pretty safe to say that most people who publicly admit their Christian faith in China are truly saved. Men will not suffer or die for something they do not believe it, and temptation, tribulation, and persecution will make a false convert fall away. The orthodox churches in Africa are stronger than the ones in Europe and America, especially among the Anglican Communion, and the people who are members of those churches probably have a higher rate of true salvation than in the west. However, Africa is also rife with apostate Christian activity, and there are many in apostate churches just like the US. The prosperity gospel and the New Apostolic Reformation have made many inroads into Africa. Like Africa, Central and South America have seen a tremendous growth in the prosperity gospel in the New Apostolic Reformation, but they do not have a history of strong orthodox churches to buttress the population. The Catholic Church has a strong presence, and the traditions and teachings of the Catholic Church are a stumbling block to true faith. So, it is almost impossible to say what percentage of people in Central and South America are truly saved. ",

Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. Not a lot. Many think he was a complete man and completely God at the same time when he was on Earth. These people are called Trinitarians. By the very logic of the Bible, he has to be completely human. he could not be an amalgam of divinity and flesh at the same time. He had to be flesh, as the only other human God had a direct hand in creating because he was called the second Adam. No matter how the Trinity logic is spun, he cannot be perceived as Man only when he was on earth. In simple terms, Trinitarians fit the Bible\u2019s description of an Antichrist. Not all of us are like this though. ",
