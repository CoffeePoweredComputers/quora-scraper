            "answer_text": "In one week i mist answer this question at least 3 times. Go through quora question and read the ts answers. Simply and basically yhis is a parent job. As soon as kids are given money and can count, add and subtract they are taught to save. Frim age 8 to 12 simple fundimentals of financial literacy are taught. Saving,spending ,credit, debit , banking knowledge all taughr by parents for a purpose. The advanced prtion of the topic needs advanced critical and conceptual thinking which the brain is not developed that skill until 20+. Teens are not interested. At 18 some just want to know how to get money fir college but not really ready to understand the concepts of compound interest, loans , leveraging and investing. You need money and income to do that. they dont have the ability to do that. Best place for advanced financial literacy is last year of college/university. And it realky is a PARENT job. There ste noght community coures on all these topics soat any point in time you can take one. Stop thinking the school sysyem is a dumping ground for what parents should be teaching you. The school system is already too full of duties that parents should be doing that has been downliaded into the school system like breakfast and lunch programs! Teaching kids to blow their nose, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who taught economics, financial literacy, and media literacy (and has three books on how to teach it), I wholeheartedly agree it should be taught more. There, are, however, two snags that hold up such programs: How do we define Financial Literacy? There is no set curriculum, and I have seen everything from separate courses to a single unit in a math class count. Some teachers focus on big picture topics like mortgages and long-term savings/investment, others on more immediate and \u201creal\u201d issues for students like buying a car (or food) or how to pay for college. I personally include lots of behavioral economics (what nudges our financial decisions), but of course that\u2019s my thing.What do we take out? As an economics teacher, I see everything as a trade-off, especially with regard to optimizing the limited resource of time in a school day. To teach any new topic comprehensively, something has to come out, and everything already taught has their defenders (the STEM turf-protectors have had the upper hand, though they are yielding a bit to the STEAM advocates of late). Then there are also all the other great ideas that need to be introduced (sex ed/health, civics, ethics, computers, data science, speech). All of these are competing to grab a little space in a student\u2019s day, and by introducing them all, education becomes a series of hors d\u2019oeurvres rather than a meal of any substance.I\u2019m not saying FL should not and cannot be taught, but it is a daunting task to redo any curriculum. Be well. ",
