            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a good question. I will share my experience on how I learnt React. I am working in a startup in NYC which uses React on the front end. So, I had to learn React in order to work on their codebase. When I started learning React, I had no idea about webpack, ES6, Babel, JSX. I didn\u2019t even know what people loved so much about React. Following are the things you should learn: HTML/CSS: Have a good understanding of HTML/CSS.Javascript: Javascript is the base of React. If you know Javascript, then you have won half the battle. But if you have a good understanding of DOM and why they are so slow when you update them, then you will understand the power of React.ES6: ES6 is the advanced Javascript that everyone is using in their codebase. You should know how to use map(), arrow function, string literals, spread operator, const and let, class, etc.Webpack: This is optional but important IMHO. Webpack is used to compile and run React projects. If you know how to use webpack, then it\u2019s great else you should know how to add loaders such as Babel, SCSS, Style loaders etc.NPM: This one is to install npm packages.If you ask me how I learnt React? I made tons of mistakes and spent couple of hours on debugging them. I watched YouTube videos and coded the programs side by side. So I highly recommend you to just open Sublime text and start doing it and make tons of mistakes. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask people or platforms like StackOverflow and Github. I did the same and got help from them :) ",

            "answer_text": "Prerequisite Before learning ReactJS in-depth, you must have a good knowledge of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. The knowledge of ECMAScript 2015 syntax can also be helpful. What is ReactJS? React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. How does it work: While building client-side apps, a team at Facebook developers realized that the DOM is slow (The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.). So, to make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in Javascript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browser\u2019s DOM. Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements. The reason for this is that JavaScript is very fast and it\u2019s worth keeping a DOM tree in it to speed up its manipulation. Although React was conceived to be used in the browser, because of its design it can also be used in the server with Node.js. The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM. We can use ReactJS on the client and server-side as well as with other frameworks. It uses components and data patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain larger apps. The smallest React example looks like this: ReactDOM.render(\u00a0  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,\u00a0  document.getElementById('root')\u00a0);\u00a0It displays a heading saying \u201cHello, world!\u201d on the page.
