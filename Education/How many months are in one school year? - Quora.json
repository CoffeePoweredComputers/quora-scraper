            "answer_text": "In most states, the school year is about 176\u2013185 days of a certain number of hours/minutes in instruction per day. There are places where the number of days can be as high as around 200. Most places, there a certain number of work days that are non-instructional for teachers,and a number of days for \u201cin-service\u201d training (usually 18 to 24 hours). These days are pretty much paid work days, while years ago, many were not.. Some school systems will be able to devote more days to any of these by being more financially advantaged, and willing to pay for more student days ,\u201cnon-instructional\u201d or training days. What is \u201crequired\u201d from a state department of education/or instruction is always the minimum, meaning they can always exceed whatever\u2014days in school, training or teacher work days. There is no requirement as to when these 176\u2026. days are. This is up to what each system wants to when the school days are. This is found in that system\u2019s \u201cschool calendar.\u201d This allows for a school system to set the calendar to fit the needs and situation of their setting. Some school systems might have schools on a variety of actual schedule (such as a few schools that are year-round. These schools have long breaks, but are usually on a schedule that is different from the rest of the schools in the system.) In US school\u2019s history, dates/days at school were originally very arranged on when students were needed on the farm. Also, school staff\u2019s were related to and needed for the farms work also. So early on, schools in the country would take long breaks for planting in the spring and in the fall for harvest. The summer break was pretty short, but the fact that most schools did not have air conditioning, nor did the homes, the school times were more along the lines of early morning only till it was cooler. I know of schools in mountainous areas today that start pretty much in late summer, because they know there will be many days in the winter when transporting students or having teachers on the roads is not safe. When days are missed, the school systems usually has to add days to meet the minimum number of days. I live on the Gulf Coast, and families here want to start going to the beach pretty early in May. So here, school is out well before Memorial day, even if students have to go back to school in early August. Most school systems today, do all kinds of research on community work and vacation patterns, weather patterns and predictions, putting lots of work on the calendar, which is finally approved by the school boards. I taught at a school system where they started having two days \u201coff\u201d because of events in the community because the teachers would be out and there was not enough substitute teachers. Two more school systems I know, there are community events that leave no parking for teachers, and the buses can not get to the schools. (Not enough police to be involved with traffic for the event, and to police school parking lots, and schools that have to also use street parking of a daily basis. I grew up in Mobile, AL where the schools, as well at the schools in South LA,?New Orleans were always out for Madi Gras. ",

            "answer_text": "Traditionally, starting back when the United States was a country of agricultural families, children had the summer off to help work on the farm. Even when the culture shifted away from family farms, most families scheduled their vacations in the summer (ironically, to get away from the *city* heat). Summer was a full three months, June, July, and August. Traditionally (again), school started right after Labor Day (early September) in the U.S. and ran through Memorial Day (the very end of May) or a few days beyond. Thus the \u201cschool year\u201d was nine months, even though those nine months included a Christmas or year-end break of almost two weeks and an Easter or spring break of a week. Nine months is 39 weeks, so that left 36 weeks or 180 (Monday through Friday) instructional days. In more recent decades the school year has encroached back into August and crept forward, nibbling away at June. Now it's almost ten months, first day to last. Still, there are expected to be the same old 180 classroom days. Note that any missed days during the year will probably require extending the school year further into June. Days are missed due to extreme weather and teachers' strikes, and for extraordinary events such as fires in the building, required health code cleanups, vermin infestation extermination, or widespread community illness outbreaks such as the flu. A few days off are frequently built into the schedule for teacher institutes (or ongoing education) as well as such holidays as Thanksgiving and Washington's Birthday (colloquially called Presidents Day). Still, the answer, one way or another, is typically 180 days for students, another +/- 5 for teachers. ",

            "answer_text": "Which country? Children are in school anywhere from 6 to 12 months, depending on where you live. Some countries only have a 6-month period due to how long the school day is. Schooling only lasting 6 months means they often start at 7 or 8 AM but are in school until 6 or 8 PM (10\u201312 hour days), most only go from 8 AM to 2 PM (a 6-hour day), Some go \u201chalf days\u201d (which last anywhere from 2 to 4 hours). In some countries (and, yes, even a few districts in the U.S.A.) school is year round. Not that kids are in school every day of the month, all year\u2026but, rather, for winter break, most kids get 2\u20133 weeks off - in a year round school they get a full month to a month and a half off. In most U.S. schools, \u201cSpring Break\u201d is a week, in a year-round school, it\u2019s 2\u20133 weeks. Etc. So, while they do have to be in classrooms during the summer, they get longer breaks than those who school for 9\u201310 months. Even the ages are different. In some countries, kids start school at 3 years of age (average in the U.S.A. is 5) while in other countries, they don\u2019t start until they\u2019re at least 7. In some countries, kids go to school until they\u2019re 18 and/or graduate. Some schools stop when kids are 16/graduate\u2026and in some countries, children only go to school until they\u2019re 13 or 14/graduate. Usually, the younger they are when they start school, the younger they are when they graduate, but that isn\u2019t always the case, either. So\u2026in order to be specific\u2026what country are you in/asking about? ",
