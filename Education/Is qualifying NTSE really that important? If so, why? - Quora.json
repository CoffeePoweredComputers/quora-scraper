            "answer_text": "Today I'm going to tell you how has NTSE (if at all) helped me throughout my life so far. We will analyse at each major point in life, and there you can judge whether qualifying for NTSE is really important. -I qualified NTSE in 2007 (By the time I appeared for the 3rd round interview it was 2008) so the scholarship started from 2008 onwards.  -Bit of luck, lot of hard work and some amount of confidence is required to be able to crack all the rounds (at my time it was conducted for the first time in 8th standard, with 2 written and one interview round) -As soon as I cleared board exams, the lucrative offer of going for engineering appeared. Preparing for JEE and AIEEE was fixed. I was getting free admission (without any entrance) into Kota Bansal classes by the virtue of NTSE. Not only that, I was getting at least 50% off in all major course materials for JEE preparation. That's the first advantage. People take it for granted that you're smart.  -After my 12th, I also had the chance of applying for Bachelors of Engineering in Nanyang Technical University, Singapore, as they have a special provision for NTSE scholars from India. Sadly I was rejected only because my percentage in 12th was not in the 90s, which I will always regret. -Maybe I was not that smart as people took me for, so I couldn't qualify for JEE as well. But I got into NIT Rourkela, Chemical Engineering, in 2011. No role of NTSE here, though. -Now when you enter into a college, there is a heavy competition for clubs, internships and (three years later) jobs. Slowly and steadily we all came to know that profile matters a lot.  -Clubs are a cakewalk but it depends more on your personality and know-how than your qualifications. No role of NTSE here. -Bagging an internship (research ones) is a very tedious and painful process, because there is no right way to do it. And getting an internship in the second year itself, with less than half the knowledge of your branch, is next to impossible. Almost all professors ignore your emails, all universities reject your applications.  -But I bagged an internship in one of the best institutes of India: IIT Madras, that too in my second year. After a long process of sending (100+) emails and waiting, I got confirmations from IIT Madras and Anna University, Chennai. Here is my profile till 2nd year: NTSE Scholar, 200796.40 % in 10th80.60 % in 12th7.38 CGPA till second yearYou must wonder, why on earth will someone give an offer to someone with steadily declining academic performance? (chuckles). This is where NTSE gives you an edge. Clearly it was the only good thing in my resume so far, and even though I was average in all fields, I got a positive reply. Therefore chances of getting accepted increases. -From thereon, I started building up my profile by attending conferences, organizing events and winning few competitions. But the internship at IIT Madras gave me a head start to a professional life, without which I couldn't have learnt how research happens in the world. So, I am always thankful to NTSE for that opportunity which made way to bigger ones.  -Final year job interviews (if you make it to them) are mostly based on technical knowledge than your profiles (if you're going for core industry) but during my interview they first saw my resume and said, \"NTSE Scholar? Alright\". It boosted my confidence. And I bagged the offer and now I'm working at a company that is the world leader in building materials, LafargeHolcim.  This had been my life so far. Other advantages: -Scholarship: It wasn't a big motivation then. During my time it was a meagre Rs 500 per month, given as a lump sum of 6000 per year, and it continued as long as you didn't take a break from studies. So I got my scholarship till 2015, when I graduated from NIT Rourkela. Had I continued studies in technical field (MTech, PhD, in India only) then it would have continued as well. Nowadays the scholarship has increased to Rs 1250 per month till senior secondary, and Rs 2000 per month till undergraduate, and even more thereafter. I don't have the exact details, but it is lucrative compared to my time. -Admiration/Esteem: When someone knows that you're NTSE qualified, they make such and such faces. They hold you in high regard. Although that has never been a great thing for me personally, but if you're someone who likes to hear nice things about yourself, then you'll be treated with an awestruck manner.  Downside: People start expecting wonders from you, like they expected me to clear JEE and get 9+ CGPA in undergrad. So the pressure to perform later increases. If you're the studious type, then so far so good. But if you're the lazy type like me, then get ready to face the pressure to cope with rising expectations, just because you're an NTSE scholar. I hope this has given you a very good impression about your query. Whenever I look back and wonder, if I could have done all the things I have done now, without NTSE, I think \"maybe\"... but surely NTSE has made everything easier for me. You are counted as one of the smartest people in the country.It is a stamp of approval. ",
