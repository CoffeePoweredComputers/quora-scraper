            "answer_text": "Go out after it's been below zero for approximately three days and you have your first warm sunny day that the wind is not Gail force. I use a handcrank air raid siren to see if there are any yodel dogs in the area. If you hear them Howl then instantly start howling with one of your calls. Stop and quickly get into place on the top of the hill or in such a position that for them to come in on you downwind they have to be out in the open. The camo up with face mask gloves etc. and do not scheduling yourself. Try to break up your outline with a little bit of natural cover but remember you do not want to have so much that it makes it difficult to find your coyote in your gun sights. Predators like coyotes can pick up movement exceptionally well,they have amazing hearing and their sense of smell is excellent. once set in your hide, ,,;;:: then blow a dying Rabbit call or use it an electronic caller. The first time you call with the dying rabbit call do it loud and for a fairly long (1\u20132 min) Wait at least 20 minutes before trying again and when you do call for only one minute or less. Do not move around a lot when you're calling and it is best to have a partner facing the opposite way when you call so there is a 360\u00b0 field of view without making movement of heads. Don't get so excited when you see the coyote that you blow the call too much. It's better that they have to do a little searching. If it looks like they're going to circle around and come at you from downwind then it's best to start calling again but not too loud. It does not hurt to have a coyote decoy someWhere in your field of view but not right near you. Put A piece of fur on a piece of cord in the decoy\u2019s mouth so the wind will blow it around and make some movement as if it had caught something and it was still alive. Also the first time you shoot a coyote cut its tail off and attach it to your decoy in such a way that it also blows around in the wind and makes movement. Use a laser rangefinder to calculate the distance of the coyote and you should already have your range card taped to the stock of your rifle to know how much holdover you need to do to place a precise shot. Wait until the coach stops before you shoot and if you miss start doing a Diane Rabbit call immediately and you may stop the coyote again for a second shot. Always pack garbage bags and a can of raid with you for When the coyote is dead you can take a loop of para cord around a tiny legs and place it in the garbage bag and spray it with Lysol before tying off the bag. This will keep you from catching fleas from your coyote. Wives and girlfriends do not appreciate it when you come home with fleas. I like to put my coyote in a toboggan so I don't tear the garbage bag dragging them back to the truck. Good luck! I hope this helps you ",

            "answer_text": "Your minnesota coyotes are a lil smaller then our eastern coyotes. They can be hunted just the same. A side arm is definitely a good tip. I used to hunt from the ground but they'd come by awfully close sometimes. I now hunt prone from an elevated platform. Not sure on your local laws at baiting, you should check, but don't use just one kind of bait if you can bait. If you can't bait, scent drips are your friend. Cooked a greasy meal? Left over blood from thawed meat? Perhaps you got a big shaker bottle of coyote in a bottle? My tip is turn that shaker bottle into a liquid with water, and put it in a gardening drip bottle and hang it few feet away from your attractant bottle. You can find plans for them online using 2 and 3 liter soda bottles for watering your garden. The only thing I do differently, is I leave the bottom on the bottle. Them funnels from the dollar store get put in on the side and a peice of rubber hot glued over the side. I want to keep water out of my scent drippers while being able to refill them easily. It's a side step to baiting since there is no food and coyotes are very territorial and will think there was food there and that this outsider coyote came and took it. Just don't use grease during the winter, it'll solidify and won't work right. In fact if it gets below freezing it'll burst the bottle if there isn't enough space in the bottle when it freezes. I also reccomend writing your name, address, number, and hunters license on them and label what's in them. In the event they are found you can be reached by game wardens who might be perplexed as to what they are. Hang them high, bears can get to them in areas that bears are at. I hang it with a length of rope using a nut and bolt in the bottom of the bottle and paracord to hang it then when I need to, I lower it and refill it and hang it again. Doesn't do much good if your hunting fields like me, but bear here in ri is kinda rare and I tend not to use drip bottles in bear country due to the time and effort involved in putting up a post in a field. Pair it off with a wireless remote electronic call (usually legal check your regulations) and do a lone coyote call with a rabbit in destress call they come a running. My other tip, is to learn how to skin them. Them skins with the feet and ears attached can fetch you good money in some places. Between 50 to 100 dollars depending on your tanning skills and the demand and supply for coyote. Use as much of the animal as you can. Bones? Process and sell your own organic bone meal. Teeth necklaces, earrings, etc. The meat and organs? Well if you soak the body after skinning for tanning in water for a few months to clean the bones to make that bone meal, mix the resulting liquid with dry dog food until its a paste like consistency. Excellent stink bait for catfish. ",
