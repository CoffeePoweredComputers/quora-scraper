            "answer_text": "A new study by the organization of economic cooperation and development they actually did a study of twenty nine industrialized countries to figure out which country has the hardest worker or hardest Education System. I mean I love this I love this story because I love learning about other countries and what their work ethics are and how much they work for us is how much they take time off but it turns out that when it comes to both paid and unpaid work Mexicans work. The longest hours they work about ten hours a day while Belgians work about seven hours a day now this includes both paid and unpaid work and unpaid work includes chores and things that you would do at home.  And that you know these surveys of you know some of the top countries in the world OECD countries and they're trying to results that are in it twenty nine countries overall so the absurd stereotype that Mexicans are lazy which I have on the show said and million times over makes no sense is the world's most inaccurate stereotypes I know sometimes in stereotypes they're wrong etcetera but years ago maybe a kernel of truth in this one there's no colonel whatsoever and I love that they actually did a study and found out we were right mixes that are in fact the hardest working six act opposite is their attack but meanwhile I'm within it Belgians come in dead last year part of the reason is they take many many weeks of vacation they retire at the age of sixty off and they don't work that long hours during normal week anyway and at the end I thought damn that sounds really good.Yeah the Danish by the way when it comes to paid hours and paid work the Danish work the least amount only four hours a day all that feels impossible. Yeah I Wasn't only four hours a day I know it's because the average in your vacations etcetera that's what brings it down but I'm still blown away by how little that is and remember here in the United States every Cyclops socialist Europe out there herbal the dangers of the Belgians are you kidding me this in a cafe having the time of their lives where the suckers.Yeah absolutely this study is so incredible and also. But yeah as you mentioned the Belgians I get to retire by the age of sixty which is such a luxury because at the rate things are going here in the United States we're not gonna get to retire until we're eighty out so Was literally if if the deficit commission gets its way which apparently president Obama agrees with we will be able to retire to a sixty nine so for nine long years as were busted our the Belgians are sipping coffee in a Capricorn Americans.The free market with your bought politicians by the way and. Yes Turks also made it on the list when it came to up cooking I love the even looked at cooking it turns out that Americans spend the least amount of time cooking which is about half an hour a day but the Turks spend the most amount of time cooking out with a full seventy four minutes a day and that is how you got this. Now my cooking I spend zero time cooking I can't stand it but my mom's good Turkish cooking this you spent seventy four minutes a day doing this.And it's so that so sometimes there are times are true and Turks love to cook and it turns out the proof is in the pudding this case quite literally.

            "answer_text": "Right now I would say that the American system which passes students in schools without the need to understand books, attend lectures and tutorials, study and prepare for the exams but go to the next grade without effort is possibly the worst system. What's more is that it has been stamped and encouraged by the Western liberal scholars to pass on the same thing to other countries with some seriously stupid studies and research for the same. As such many countries like India have started following this system in the present decade. The no detention policy is in the centre of it. Well no detention policy means \u2018no fear of failure \u2018. IT HAS IN FACT ENCOURAGED STUDENTS TO NOT LEARN FROM TEXT BOOKS AND OTHER RESOURCES. As no one is concerned about being detained for lack of passing a certain level of understanding. It has in fact encouraged truancy and lack of respect for elders and teachers. It has also encouraged lethargy as students no longer feel the need to understand and learn. So yes India has been hurt by the policy and we can see the impact specifically in the government schools where learning levels have dropped dramatically over the past few years. Children have become more violent and distracted by the lack of goals set up by the present no detention policy. Right now Delhi school under Delhi government and municipal corporations are undergoing BUNIYAD CLASSES IN SUMMER VACATIONS. This means that many students who have been unable to achieve their learning goals will be coming for extra classes with additional books for another chance to study and improve their reading writing and arithmetic skills. IF THIS IS NOT THE WORSE SYSTEM THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS!!! ",
