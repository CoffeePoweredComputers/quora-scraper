You are required to write any 5 experiments from your practical book in notebook and study these experiments as the examiner will ask you questions from these experiments P.S:- There are some greedy examiners as well and they will ask you to give money and get marks in practicals (this happened with me) so beware of such examiners you can pay them money and get marks or can complaint about them ",
