            "answer_text": "I was not a good student as a teen. That doesn\u2019t mean I did not have the capacity, but I had too much else going on in my world to take learning seriously. I was not comfortable in my own skin, in my own family, so I chose a (dumb) route and ran away from home. Never finished secondary school. By 26, I had my shit together (thanks to my gorgeous partner of the last 35+ years) and went back to University. It was easy. My environment had settled and I was comfortable with myself. Everyone said I would never stick at it, but I came away with a Bachelors Degree in Sports Science and Mathematics, and Post Grad in Education. I now teach, and the kids that appreciate me the most, are the kids who were like me. Disconnected. Everything effects our learning - but how you feel in your own world is probably one of the greatest. It doesn\u2019t appear in any charts about class sizes, or teacher knowledge, or economic factors, because an individual can come from the poorest of backgrounds, in a large school with average teachers and big class sizes - and still nail education. I know - I have taught them and they never use their circumstances as an excuse. ",

            "answer_text": "During the Covid shutdown, I took the training to become a CASA, a court-appointed special advocate for children in foster care. We had a very powerful presentation one evening on the learning brain vs. the survival brain, with information from TCU and Dr. Karyn Purvis. We learned how children from abusive homes are flooded with stress hormones that cause changes in the physical structure of the brain. These children come to school with what Purvis calls \u201csurvival brain.\u201d Their primary motivation is to survive each day. They are constantly on the look out for danger and ways to avoid it. They can\u2019t learn. Not because they\u2019re lazy, not because they\u2019re stupid, not because they\u2019re unmotivated, but because their brains are inundated with cortisol. Other children show up with learning brains. They\u2019re fed, sheltered, loved, healthy. They\u2019re ready and eager to learn. They aren\u2019t constantly on their guard, preparing for the danger they inevitably encounter at home. This is information I wish I\u2019d had when I was in the classroom. It would have changed the way I interacted with students and how I viewed some of my students. ",

            "answer_text": "Frequently a major factor. Sometimes longlasting though sometimes temporary. For example some children are carers and have a lot to do at home which might make homework hard. If they have an alcoholic person at home the way their moods veer between bonhomie and aggression can affect a child mentally and make it hard for them to concentrate or even sleep at night. Children who move between separated parents may never have the correct resources in the correct place. Hunger can also affect concentration. You can\u2019t blame a child for prioritising keeping safe over studies. ",

            "answer_text": "When a child is born, it\u2019s parents and it\u2019s home environment are it\u2019s first, and one could argue, it\u2019s most effective teachers. Survival literally depends upon the child\u2019s ability to navigate its home environment. If the child is not nurtured and made to feel secure, it will develop psychological defenses it will exhibit throughout its life. If it goes hungry or is abused or ignored, it will develop coping strategies for dealing with those afflictions. That psychological defenses and coping strategies may very well interfere with the child\u2019s ability to adapt to and learn in a school environment. That inability to adapt and to learn can have broad implications For the child\u2019s later life in terms of career and relationship development. Some children with difficult childhoods grow up and overcome their rocky beginnings, but many don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "So many things can affect how students perform in school. If they are worried and distracted, it\u2019s hard to concentrate. If they\u2019re sick, they cannot focus on the work. If they\u2019re hungry, they cannot learn. I refer you to: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow described how we all have to fulfill certain needs before we can \u201cself-actualize,\u201d that is, learn and grow and become our best selves. ",
