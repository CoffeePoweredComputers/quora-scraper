            "answer_text": "There are some institutes and places where they don't accept NIOS although its legal for studies from the Govt. but they don't value NIOS . But everywhere in the world NIOS is valid and you can continue in the University of your choice as per your wish. Disadvantages of Nios are as follows:- No proper guidance from teacherschecking and evaluation of the papers are patheticOn demand examination papers are generally tough Since there are no TMAThere is literally no response from NIOS Regional centres .They don't attend phone calls when there is any doubt in the minds of the learners they wont clear it.For every small doubts students have to visit RC (REGIONAL CENTRES) and their behaviour is very bad and they won't help you much unless and until you have a verbal spat with them.Sometimes examinations are not confirmed and hallticket is not received and one has to visit RC to confirm it.",
