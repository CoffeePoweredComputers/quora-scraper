            "answer_text": "This is a question I can relate to, since I too am planning for the future of my daughter. Here are my pointers: 1. Start a monthly SIP (equity mutual fund ) as early as possible to save for her education - at an estimated 12% return with minimal LTCG, this instrument will give you the best shot to build long term wealth, surpassing inflation. 2. Invest in health insurance ( ASAP) - save money by including your child into your family floater plan instead of starting one of her own. Make sure to plan for enough to cover medical inflation until she becomes an adult. 3. Invest in a term life insurance policy - Plan to cover 10x of your annual income so that your family is covered in case of any unforeseen event. 4. Start early! Use her pocket money to teach her how savings and investments work - make her understand how to live within a budget, and treat her to a reward if she is able to stick to it.

Birth of a girl is always the best blessing for a family. \u00a0\u00a0While you've specifically asked for 'best mutual fund' for your daughter, it's useful to understand that mutual funds are largely gender agnostic. Hence, let's look at the real operative part of your question which is for 20 years and education. \u00a0\u00a0Investment Horizon = 20 Years\u00a0Investment Objective = Child's Education\u00a0\u00a0You have a long investment horizon and typically Equity as an asset class should be your target asset class when you have this sort of a horizon. Equity Mutual Funds have delivered 12-15% CAGR over a 10 year time frame and this is in general 2 to 2.5x inflation over an extended time frame. Within Equity MF, you should look at allocating your money between Large, Mid and Small Cap funds. Ideally a basket for 3-4 funds to meet this objective. \u00a0\u00a0Apart from mutual funds, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana scheme is a product you should consider - it's essentially a PPF for a girl with a marginally higher return than the traditional PPF. \"\u00a0#investing #finance #mutualfunds #equity #PPF\u00a0",
