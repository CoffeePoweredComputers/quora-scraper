            "answer_text": "Since there are not any statistics, as far as I know, to indicate whether there is a trend towards more children being brought up to speak Esperanto as a mother tongue, any reply to this question must be subjective. Only months after I had become an Esperantist, 60 years ago, I met the famous English Esperantist, M C Butler, who told me about his children who were brought up to speak Esperanto from birth. In the same year I went to my first World Esperanto Congress and met a number of \u201cdenaskuloj\u201d. Some of them have gone on to raise their own children to be the same. So this is not a new trend in the history of the language and I see no reason why it will not continue, but as I said I do not have the statistics to prove this one way or the other. ",
