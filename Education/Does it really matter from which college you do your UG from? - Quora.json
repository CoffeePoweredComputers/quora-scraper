            "answer_text": "This is a fully loaded question but one that I\u2019m happy to answer. So there are multiple factors that need to be taken into consideration when you are choosing a college- 1. The college you are considering needs to offer the course that you are interested to study. Don\u2019t choose a college just because of the name it has. In order to be successful, it\u2019s important that you study a course that\u2019s the best fit for you. So take some time to find out more about the content of the courses that colleges are offering. 2. Make sure that the college is accredited. Even if it\u2019s a small college make sure that the degrees that they offer are recognized and accredited by an authentic governing body. 3. Research to find out about the teaching methodology at the college so that you can make sure it fits with your learning style. If you are a student who is an independent learner, then you might fit well into a large classroom but if you are a student who needs personal attention from the teacher, then it\u2019s important you look at smaller classroom styles where the teacher is able to give you the attention and assistance you require. 4. It\u2019s also important to have an idea of what graduates from the particular college you\u2019re considering are doing currently. Have they found jobs? Are they successfully placed in different companies? What is the success rate of graduate? 5. Lastly, make sure that whatever college you choose, it gives you a well-rounded college experience both inside and outside the classroom. If you have been actively involved in different sports or clubs in high school and are keen on continue with it, then make sure that you have opportunities to do so.  What I\u2019m trying to say is that when you go into the workforce, what employers want to see are the skills that you have acquired through your education. So it doesn\u2019t matter how big or how small the college you choose to do your undergraduate degree is. What\u2019s important is the different learnings you got from your time on campus and the outcomes you were able to get at the end of your time there. There are so many stories you hear of students going to really small colleges, making a name for themselves, being in the top 10% of their class which has in turn given them a chance to get accepted to some of the best universities in the world for their Master\u2019s! All you need to do is make sure it\u2019s a good fit for you and that you make use of the experience that you have. All the best! ",
