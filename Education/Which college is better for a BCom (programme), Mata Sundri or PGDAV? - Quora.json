If you are okay with both then comes the answer, according to my perception PGDAV is way more better than Mata Sundry as it's commerce faculty is very good, but almost same in various aspects. Choose according to location. P.S - almost same level colleges, but choose pgdav! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Sonia, In my opinion both the colleges are tier, and are similar in almost all the aspects. But, I believe P.G.D.A.V. College is a little better when compared to Mata Sundri College. P.G.D.A.V. has very good faculty in commerce department, plus placement opportunities at P.G.D.A.V. College are much better than Mata Sundri College. Infrastructure wise Mata Sundri has got an edge. Hope this helps! All the best! ",
