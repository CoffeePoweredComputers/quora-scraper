            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak too much for the later years, but for my experience it\u2019s been an interesting lesson in patience and cringe. I\u2019ll start off with the bad and work my way to the advantages. Why it\u2019s difficult and not for the faint of heart: You become torn between your significant other and your life goals. So college either takes a back seat or your work schedule only permits a few \u201cnice evenings\u201d a month.Your cashflow may not be ideal, so considering transportation and date nights are quite the budget killer, you may back off a bit.Matching your lifestyles while \u201cfiguring yourself out\u201d is nothing to be underestimated\u2026. it honestly took me to some breaking points in my life.Parents won\u2019t be incredibly respectful of you in most instances unless your first impression is ON POINT, and you\u2019ve got some sort of \u201cvision\u201d of how life will be in five years. I think it\u2019s horse, but later on you realize that it does make sense\u2026. it\u2019s still horse though.Even if your life dream is already fulfilling by age 20 and you\u2019re living alone and decide your honey should move in, it\u2019s a mental process of balancing your life and theirs. You are signifying your satisfaction and cannot back out. As sure as you may seem or as chill as the situation may present itself as, you have to achieve something not a lot of people can by that time, and that\u2019s an ABSOLUTE sense of contentment and consistent satisfaction with where you\u2019re headed.Why you should totally try and meet people at this time (18\u201324): Tough times create the best of relationships, mutual hatred for college and part-time gigs can be a great foundation for a weirdly caring relationship.18 and onward tends to be the solidification period for the brain, where you realize what you want to do and who you like. Maybe you haven\u2019t dated anybody or have dated a lot, but now is the time where everybody feels that. You don\u2019t need to be awkward, just trade a meme or act casual and somebody else will follow.You\u2019re young enough to be hip but old enough to enjoy those \u201ccool\u201d hangouts like bars or dance clubs. You get one shot at these places and if they\u2019re not your cup of tea, don\u2019t complain when you\u2019re pushing 80 and saying \u201cDamn, club pLACE sounded like a hoot, and that Dr. Dre used to turn out sick beats\u2026\u201dYou\u2019ll figure out where people are headed, how they\u2019re getting there and maybe how you could help each other on those pathes. I once met a girl who wouldn\u2019t have pitched an idea to Adult Swim if I hadn\u2019t suggested it to her. She didn\u2019t get the timeslot, but they said they\u2019d keep her in mind. I also was able to apply for and receive a late scholarship, only to the poking of one ex who lived in Chicago at the time.However you look at the dating scene, you won\u2019t grow with your mind, you\u2019ll grow with your eyes. And at some point, you\u2019ll grow with your heart and that\u2019s when you\u2019ve found your honey. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it's not worth actively seeking a relationship during these young adult years. I rephrased your question because they are mostly benefits to things in life, and it's important to consider them in decision making (in this case whether it's worth being in a relationship or not). I consider my young adult years (still in them) to be the prominent years of determining your future. If you evaluate my answer based on a pros/cons, I'd say I elaborate on the cons. Hopefully these things can apply to you, because in these years you are highly unlikely to: Have credit or debtHave parenting responsibilitiesKnow what you want to pursueThis is your golden opportunity to establish your identity and well being. Because of the three factors above I personally take into heavy consideration, I see myself trying to discover and settle my life first, having the need to prioritize it first before adding another person onto/in it. I've seen people lose their way just because they no longer are with a certain person, and you shouldn't really be reliant on another being for yourself imo. I also rephrased your question because if a relationship does fall into one, then whatever happens happens. I'm not 100% against having a relationship at this time, but it seems counterproductive to me in the midst of this sort of \u201ccrisis.\u201d I'm trying to build credit (around 700s with a 7 month history), I have no debt so far in school, I have no children to worry about, and I know what I'm pursuing. I feel that if I had a relationship at this moment, I wouldn't be able to efficiently handle it. And I strive to take full responsibility in anything I commit myself to. Thanks for asking, and happy new year! ",
