            "answer_text": "This is only possible if your KV is situated in a rural area. Otherwise, it will be illegal for you to get admission under rural quota. The policy is clear. Residence doesn't determine rural or urban status. Rather, it is the location of the school which determines it. Further, all the preceding three years before admission must be spent in a rural area.
