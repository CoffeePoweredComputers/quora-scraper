            "answer_text": "books quantity doesn't matter, quality is. if you are naive in cgl preparation, first you have to solve at least 5\u20136 previous years papers to check your subject wise score. the following are the best books for the preparation of CGL: ENGLISH: a single book & resource is not sufficed for your preparation, English is divided into 3 major sections: (a) vocab (b) grammar (c) comprehension.vocab: (a) sp Bakshi: read repeat, do this process umpteen times. this book provides vocab ie. OWS, IDIOMS, PHRASAL VERB, PREPOSITIONS, WORD MEANING, provided in a lucid manner. gave special emphasis on preposition chart and a phrasal verb.learn religiously previous year antonyms, synonyms, one-word substitution, idiom and phrases compiled in qmaths websites. believe me or not it is highly beneficial.(b) grammar: read plinth to paramount 4\u20135 times, that's more than enough. solve practise sets given in a mirror of common errors.(c) comprehension: the more your reading, the better the marks will be. so ultimate mantra is to read & apprehend any source ie. newspaper or novel on the daily basis. mostly people lack here, they neglect this section and become in the rat race of learning grammar. understanding sentence structure cannot solely understand by grammar rules, it is your reading aptitude which gives u a better edge over others. vocab, PQRS, CLOSE TEST, COMPREHENSION can be solved easily by this. give time to this\u2026. pleaseQUANT: (a) Rakesh Yadav class notes (b) Kiran chapter wise previous years paper (c) lucent higher mathematics part-2 or sarvesh Kumar quantum cat, do level 1 & 2 only.GS: (a) previous year papers (b) if you have time then read science, geography, history from NCERT, otherwise, take any source ie. any coaching notes or Adda capsule etc. now current affairs questions also played a major role, hence you should buy a monthly magazine or download current affairs capsule from Adda 247 or testbook website. the arrival of TCS as a vendor may surprise you in the current affairs section, so you must be ready for in-depth current affairs.REASONING: no such book is required for this section, only previous years papers & mocks are more than enough. topics like series, figure counting, statement & assumption demand special attention which you can seek from youtube.don't neglect previous year papers, solve it umpteen time. and track your weakness and progress through mocks. and lastly always remember revision is the key, do a book umpteen time.addition to this, some of the important fundas you should be aware of in preparing of SSC CGL:Concept clarity is sufficient and recommended as per as new types of questions were introduced in cgl mains 2017, so it is highly recommended that you must do preparation with new pattern\u2026 I listed some of the dos and donts:1.if you are lacking in concept building then it is high time you started your preparation with NCERT (class 8\u201310).don't cram just understand the topic and maxim given in the book. No book or tutor can teach you better than NCERTs. 2.when you find you grasp the concept, move on some exercise given in NCERTs or R.D. SHARMA book. 3.try to solve previous year sets of maths (not topics) and figure out what is the core area where you lack the most. 4.if time persist kindly solve the level 1& 2 exercises given in QUANTUM CAT by Sarvesh Verma. 5.take a good mock series like KD OR SSCTUBE, and take it in every weak whether you able to solve fully or not.just sit and try to maximise your score every weak. 6.don't be panic and persistent in note making, solving quizzes, diverse questions daily. (DON'T SKIP THIS). For English you have to figure out what is the major concern you are facing?? are you not find English interesting or poor in vocab or not able to solve the reading section? well now I give the answer one by one in stepwise below: 1.era of repeated questions is somehow ended so it's time to change your strategy, for vocab just read any newspaper (I prefer THE HINDU), read any 2\u20133 article which you find interesting in reading, an editorial section is not must. English is a language so first you have to develop a passion for reading and apprehend it in the right manner. 2.just watch any Hindu editorial vocab session in YouTube and JOT down, you may take the screenshot as well. 3.make a daily habit of solving mini mocks of various topics. 4.don't cram one-word substitution and idiom and phrases, just see it daily and it is more than enough. 5.put special effort on reading comprehension and close test(55 marks), error section with sentence improvement(40\u201345 marks). 6.don't ignore the importance of phrasal verb and vocab which is asked in every section of English. 7.take English as a way of your daily life, you never find English boring. 8.don't cram grammar rules, just solve enormous and diverse questions of error and then see the rule where it is applied. 9.mocks are the real analysis of your preparation, so pick any good test series like textbook or KD or ssctube and give it on a weakly basis and try to maximise your score ",
