            "answer_text": "Malala with her father use to run a school in Swat. They use to promote Girl's Education. She along with her father were threatened to stop educating girls by Mulla Fazlullah A.K.A Radio Mullah. She was shot in the bus by Tehreek-E-Taliban Pakistan Militants. For medical assistance she was brought to Birmingham, UK and she lives there since then. She was a survivor. Fair Enough! Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai is popular because the 'First World Propagandists' want her to be. They are shooting their bullets, keeping the gun on her shoulder. Now the big question is WHO CARES FOR THE GIRLS IN SWAT VALLEY? People are building centres and schools in her name, gathering the girls and raping them. Who raises there voice now? Malala Yousafzai is famous because the West thinks of her as a puppet that can help them put up a great show in the global arena. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A I might draw lot of flak for this answer but I think Nobel prize (specially for peace) is somewhat influenced by current geopolitical situation. Also her \"fame\" is result of strong marketing atleast to some extent. I believe her ascendance to fame is partially because of war on terror and rest due to string media backing (both domestic and foreign). I don't discount what she did - ofcourse she is brave and an example for others including me. But to say she got the prize or she is the only one is simply not believable. Also how she carried herself was strange sometimes. But anyways everything is past and it is futile to discuss these. Lastly irrespective of Nobel prize, my respect for her remains intact. I, anyways, am not that courageous in any sense. She deserves the applaud for her spirit. ",
