            "answer_text": "Ecology is the study of the ways organisms (biotic factors) and their environments (abiotics factors) interact.  It is a multidisciplinary science because of all the other fields you need to be aware of to grasp its concepts.  To understand these interactions, you have to first be able to understand the different parts.  For the organisms this means biochemistry and biology, including genetics, botany, animal physiology, animal behaviour, microbiology.  For the environments this means geochemistry, weather patterns, nutrient cycles, geological processes, human impact (in terms of physically changing our environments and also the pollution of water, soil, and air). When we talk about interactions between these two, we can look at adaptation and evolution of individual populations/species, successional changes in environment types (from say plain to forest over time), changes in biodiversity and overall ecosystem health/resilience. The study of ecology is important for nature conservation and resource management (agriculture, forestry, fisheries, etc.), and ultimately to the creation of a stable and egalitarian society with a strong economy; disease, poverty, inequality, and exploitation result from degraded environments and the following resource shortages.
