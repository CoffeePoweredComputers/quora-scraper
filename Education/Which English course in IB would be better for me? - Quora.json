            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve taken English before, I would suggest you do English Lang and Lit HL. This is because whenever you take a language categorised as a B language, it generally means you\u2019ll be learning English as a second language. If you think you can handle English Lang and Lit which is a very fun course (my best friend in UWC CSC is taking it), I think you\u2019d rather take that up. English Lang & Lit is a lot like IB History (Paper 1), where you have to evaluate sources and it\u2019s not that difficult. (At least in History). Since I don\u2019t take either, talk to your coordinator or go through the syllabus focus/subject guides for each subject. Weigh the pros and cons and decide for yourself which is better. Here are some guiding materials: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxoaW5kaXJlc291cmNlc2ZvcmlifGd4OjZlN2EwODRkYmM1ZjlmYjgLanguage B guidehttp://sdgj.cdhuaying.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/8f7224fe995343750d89431e4a440332.pdf",

            "answer_text": "Hey there! Since English is not your first answer, you have an advantage of taking English B. I suggest you do English B HL. It will be a lot less time consuming than English A. It will look good on your exams / transcript if you get a 6 or a 7 as opposed to a 3\u20134. In all honesty, you'll save yourself a bit of time and stress. (According to my friends who take English B HL) Choose your courses wisely and good luck! :) from one IB student to another. ",
