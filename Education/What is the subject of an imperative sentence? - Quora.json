            "answer_text": "A good test is to see which pronouns require the reflexive in the imperative. So, If I say \u201cLook at yourself in the mirror,\u201d you know the implicit subject is \u201cyou,\u201d because only this pronoun can require the reflexive on \u201cyou.\u201d As David Mahoney has said, the imperative can also be in the 1st person plural. \u201cLet\u2019s get ourselves out of here!\u201d demonstrates that the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d is the subject in this case.
