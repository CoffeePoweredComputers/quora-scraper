            "answer_text": "Nope. They do not have an economy that promotes employee ownership over private ownership, so they're not socialist. When Hugo Chavez took over he did increase government spending on the general welfare of the people to a level proportionate with that enjoyed by Canadians; and that is what we stupid Americans call \u201cSocialism\", but the rest of the world just calls that government. What Chavez did to piss off America was nationalize the fossil fuel industry in Venezuela; so instead of 99.9% of that revenue going to American based fossil fuel conglomerates, it went into the government coffers and was spent on the general welfare of the Venezuelan people. Then Chavez did something that even at the time couldn't have seemed like a good idea: he based his countries tax policy on oil revenue. That was fine as long as the price of oil kept increasing, which most of the world thought it would. Anyway in 2002 the CIA backed a coup attempt against Chavez that failed miserably. Who could have guessed that the common people of a nation would prefer a government that helps them rather than an American backed puppet dictator? And this scheme worked so well in Iran! After the coup failed, American based corporations started pulling their factories out of Venezuela, purely to spite Chavez. To stop the corporate flight Chavez was forced to spend a large portion of the oil money on bribes to corporate executives. With almost no domestic manufacturing of consumer goods, Venezuela had to import everything. This devalued the country's currency until imports became too expensive for anyone but the government. Then around 2010 Obama's expansion of domestic oil drilling made America the world's top oil producer, and the price of oil collapsed. The value of Venezuelan currency collapsed with it. And for a few years even the government, now run by Chavez's poorly chosen successor Maduro, hasn't been able to import the goods the people need and has been reacting violently to their anger at the hardship.

            "answer_text": "Not really. If I\u2019m not mistaken, the majority of their economy or GDP or whatever is privatized. I think I remember reading 60% or more. But don\u2019t quote me on that. Also, when Chavez went in, he didn\u2019t nationalize the oil. The oil was already public. He merely just changed who gets the money from the rich to the working class and middle class and poor. This is similar to what Norway does. They tax private oil at 78% I think, and they also have public oil and all the money they make from that is given to the people of the country. Doing that is not enough to cause a crisis in a country. What caused the Venezuelan crisis was a few stupid things Chavez did which Maduro made worse. Aside from the obvious fact that both are tyrants in their countries, Chavez didn\u2019t do proper quality controls in the many things he was doing, and this caused corruption to easily be formed. They made great strides in education and other stuff, but the main thing that took a deep hit was the economy. Chavez virtually did not put any money into oil reserves and other oil stuff, and then when oil prices fell and Maduro was in power, the idiot started printing money. That and other things are what caused the crisis in Venezuela. It\u2019s mainly the entire inflation crisis, as well as the fact that Maduro is a tyrant. They are to blame, but it is extremely unfair to not admit that unilateral sanctions on Venezuela by the United States HAVE exacerbated the problem. ",
