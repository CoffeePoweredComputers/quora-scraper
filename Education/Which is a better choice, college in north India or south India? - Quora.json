            "answer_text": "Wow! The mere fact that you had to ask a question such as this makes me believe that you are not fit for any college. Or may be, you need to gain a little more knowledge! Which college is better, you ask? A college that imparts good and value education in the field of your interest should be your choice of college, irrespective of its geographical location. Let\u2019s assume that you are an engineering aspirant, would you give up the chance to study in IIT, Madras because it is in the south? Or say you have issues with the northern part, would you give up a seat in IIT, Delhi? No, right? Then, how does it even matter where in the country is a college located as long as the college is providing you a platform of learning!!? Seek knowledge. Seek education. Seek values. Seek a source that can provide you with the best of all these. There is no need for you to dig where the source is located. The quality of education does not depend on the state/ city in which the college is built upon. It has to do with the faculty and the students who make an institution what it is. And for the last time, stop dividing India into north and south. India is one nation and one state may lie to the north or south or east or west of another. Edit: I apologise for being harsh, and would like to accept that I missed out on the deatil of your question. Having said that, I would still hold my ground that no college is good or bad based on whether it is in Delhi or Bangalore. Make a list of all the colleges you wish to apply for. Before taking admission into one, make a well-informed decision about the curriculum of the college, the faculty and their quality of teaching, the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the student-teacher ratio, the past records of the institution, its alumni, placements and all other related information. I have studied in Bangalore and the only advantage you would get here is the weather. Rest assured, if the college you study in is a good one, there should be no reason for you to worry if it is in Delhi or Bangalore. ",
