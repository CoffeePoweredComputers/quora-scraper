            "answer_text": "Nobody gets to tell you how to feel. Ever. Feelings belong to you. Don't be, or feel, embarrassed, ashamed, angry, upset, shocked, confused, perplexed, puzzled, belittled, ridiculed when someone else doesn't understand or acknowledge your reaction or concern. Feelings are automatic, immediate, internal reactions to events surrounding us. No two people in this world think, act, react, respond, understand or acknowledge in the exact same way. Most likely, any of your responses or feelings to any event or situation, is common. Human beings tend to have approximately the same type of reactions or responses in same-type situations. Meaning, probably you're normal, and reacting normally, like people would in your particular situation. That being said, if your grades are below a C average, you should be concerned, stressing \u2018should be\u2019. You think so, too. Otherwise, this question wouldn't be on Quora. Assuming you're still in either middle or high school, consider a few things on your own. Your parents are concerned because they love you more than anything in this world. They want you to be successful, get an education, find your niche, have a (satisfactory) job or career, and someday provide an income for you, and possibly you and a family. Yeah, see thats the thing \u2026 they want you to find the person of your dreams to love, cherish, and have companionship with - be happy with. Though you probably don't fully get it now, your future self will really love you if you make it easier by spending a little time considering the f u t u r e . Don't lose me, here, okay? Still painting a picture for ya. They've already been your age. It was tough. er. So, now, they want something BETTER for you. It starts with paying attention in class and doing yer dead level best at everything you do, being kind and respectful, keeping your word on a handshake, picking up all yer own messes, and helping others. Parents sometimes over react. Just be calm when they do. After you've done the suggestions, below, you will be totally ready to talk about how you. are. going. to work at doing better. They will be impressed if you've already got a solution to the problem. Got it? Be working on the solution to the problems before ya git in more trouble. That, my friend, is maturity. Consider visiting your teachers or a counselor at school. Ask them how you can improve your grades. Ask for 3 pointers. Try those. See if they work. If that doesn't help, ask if they can provide a tutor, or someone to help you understand the classwork better. Maybe you need a tutor, a quieter environment with fewer distractions, glasses, to sit closer to the front of the class room, more time on tests, help with reading, more study time at home. Go to school for help before or after classes. Or, ask a school counselor for help. I promise you, people care. People care. They want to help. Find the one person you like, or feel a connection with, and ask them how you can get better grades. If that doesn't work, it's probably time to visit a tutor outside of school to see if they can assess your particular learning style. If that doesn't work, it's time to visit a therapist who can do some testing to see if there are other issues going on that prevent your ability to learn. Praying for you. Oh, and \u2026 one more thing. Your actions mean WAY more than any feelings. Feelings happen. It's way more important what you do with your emotions once they pass. ",

            "answer_text": "If you tried and still got terrible grades, then it\u2019s very possible that you have a learning disability and need extra help. The first step is asking your parents to arrange to have you tested. Since this testing is expensive, sometimes schools have psychologists who do testing while they are on salary. If not, you get tested privately. Get your eyes checked, hearing checked as well. Speak with your teachers. Many offer tutoring time or have office hours where you can go over the homework and see where you had trouble. Sometimes an older student can tutor you for free. At the end of each class, see if you can summarize what was taught that day. If you can explain the concept to someone else, then you\u2019ve probably understood it well. If you cannot explain the concept, then you probably didn\u2019t understand it and need to see the teacher to explain it again. If you do understand it and still are struggling in tests, then you probably have difficulty reading the question or getting to the point of the question. Doing practice questions, and practice exams really helps. Getting help from professionals such as speech therapists or special education teachers also helps. But the first step is pinpointing where the problems are. good luck! ",

My parents did this to me and it completely destroyed my wanting to go to High school and I didnt enjoy any study until I went to University when I was 28 years old. Old memories die hard and I ended up in therapy for the most of that time too. Extend yourself and see if you can join a study group in the libary or anything to show them that they are taking their own problems out on you.
