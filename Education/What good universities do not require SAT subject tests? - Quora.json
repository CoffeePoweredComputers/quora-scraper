            "answer_text": "The key to your question is in the \u201cgood\u201d requirement. Without knowing what qualifies as good for you, it\u2019s very difficult to answer this question. Are you talking about the 100 or so schools everyone knows? The Ivies, Stanford, MIT, etc.? The \u201clittle Ivies\u201d? Or are you looking at something else. Dig past the brand names, and you\u2019ll still find plenty of \u201cgood\u201d universities, and almost none of them require SAT subject tests. The SAT subject tests are becoming less important for most universities. Yes, the universities considered \u201celite\u201d, the \u201cbrands\u201d so to speak, will still ask for subject tests. One important thing to keep in mind is the \u201coptional\u201d statement some schools will use. If the university\u2019s application says the subject tests are \u201coptional\u201d or \u201crecommended\u201d, you\u2019re going to need to do them. In the college application process, \u201coptional\u201d doesn\u2019t really apply to the applicant. ",
