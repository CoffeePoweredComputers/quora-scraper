            "answer_text": "The number of credits in a degree is the same regardless of how the courses are delivered. Bachelor\u2019s degrees are about 120 semester hours and master\u2019s degrees around 30\u201340 credits. This works out to 40 3-credit classes or 10\u201313 grad classes. The question then is how many credits can be earned in a compressed period. The shortest term I have seen is 5 weeks. That means at 1 course at a time you could earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in 200 weeks or almost 4 years. If you double up, you could get that down to 100 weeks or two years. A master\u2019s program could be done in about a year. In the U.S., all courses have to be the same amount of work regardless of whether they are online or on campus in 15 weeks or 5 weeks. Taking 2 classes in 5 weeks would be intense. The expected workload would be 46 hours of school per week. The alternative option is what is known as competency-based education. Western Governors University uses this model where you are not tied to a course schedule and can go faster if you work harder or know more to start with. I don\u2019t think they will advertise any speed records, though, because that is just asking for complaints for a variety of reasons. ",
