            "answer_text": "To score good marks in grammar section of SSC exams, you don't need to mug up rules. So how to prepare it? Answer: Just take a reliable source( I prefer Plinth to Paramount)for grammar rules. Then start reading rules of a chapter and then do the examples and exercise questions of that chapter. Similarly do all the chapters one by one. Then after completing all the chapter, repeat the above procedure 2\u20133 times. After completing this book 3\u20134 times, all the rules would automatically set in your mind. Then to ossify them more in your mind, solve as many previous years questions as possible from chapterwise book. While revising,don't forget to mark all the different questions which are based on different rules. Try to revise those marked questions 3\u20134 times. After solving those marked questions 3-4 times, all the rules would automatically memorised to you and you would be able to retain them for a long period of time. To retain all rules for a very long time, try to revise all the marked questions atleast once a month. To further improve grammar, read an english newspaper daily for atleast half an hour. Because if you have good reading skill then identifying errors in new type of questions,during exam, would be easy for you. Try it. It'll definitely work. For any other help you can contact me on quora. Thanks. ~nikhil sharma. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. First of all, stop remembering the rules of grammar. Read the sentences and try to analyse their correctness as per logic. You can score more than 80% in grammar section in any exam. I would like to advise you to go through below books before solving/analysing any questions on grammar, logically. English is Easy by Chetnanand SinghHigh school grammar book by Wren and Martin.I have referred the book mentioned in point 1 and I find it incredible. Grammar is covered in such a great manner that you won't feel the need of remembering the rules of same. Follow the book religiously and read the book atleast twice before attempting any previous years questions or practice sets. Solve the exercise from the book first and take a mock test on grammar. You will be able to notice a great improvement in your score. Word power is another factor which sometimes play an important role in solving questions in grammar. Those key words are also mentioned in the chapters of grammar itself so that you don't have to look anywhere else for that. Book is designed by keeping all that in mind. May you enjoy the reading! All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Scoring in english is really a nightmare for may SSC aspirants. English is a language where you cant increase your marks in just a few days or complete you syllabus and say i have read everything and i remember all the concepts. In maths it can be done. See i can tell you the approach in which you can increase your marks do not think of great improvement in marks. You will increase marks very slow in english. First read everything in english, whatever material you get. Like newspapers (Indian express do not read Hindu) etc. Read vocab section regularly like 10 words or 5 words everyday. Read chapterwise rule daily like one day preposition next day noun with there questions and analaze the rules with detailed solution (regularity is most important), and one practice set either of pre or mains may be in two days or daily whichever suits you. Simultaneously do topicwise previous year questions of all chapters regularly. I am not mentioning books as there are many books available and it dependa on an individual which book he/she needs. Just choose a book with no or minimum errors as you should not read anything incorrect. Always analyse you mistake work specially on those sections. Practice practice and practice is the key. The more you practice the more you will reduce you errors. ",
