            "answer_text": "Its a 50\u201350% situation.You might be knowing that the NTSE stage 1 exam is conducted by the state and if the state education council feels that the condition in the state is not suitable to conduct the exam then it might postpone the exam but if situation in the country gets better till November then the the possibility to conduct the examination increases. But I feel that the exams will be postponed since the registration of school as examination centre begins in this month and the schools are closed these days so more likely they will postpone the examination for a month. In my suggestion you should focus more on your preparation in these crucial times. Solve Mental ability Ques. daily whithin time limit + Study SST part only from your State board book. Buy a previous year NTSE question bank and practice as much as you can and finish the syllabus one month before the exam.. so that you have enough time for revision. Fun fact: My NTSE STAGE 2 2020 EXAM IS ALSO POSTPONED :) Thank for Reading.. Om Mishra. Ntse stage 1 2019 Scholar.. ",
