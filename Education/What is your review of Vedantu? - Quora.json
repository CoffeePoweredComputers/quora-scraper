            "answer_text": "I am a teacher at Vedantu for more than two years. I would like to add my perspective to above reply. Vedantu provides personalized education. To personalize a service, you have to understand the person availing the service. Any good/experienced service provider would first understand the client and his/her requirements before providing services. A novice would just jump in and start working on a project without understanding the goals. Before you start building a bridge, you have to know the requirements. You also have to understand the platform on which it would stand. You will then explain your building process and plans to the client. Depending on the kind of soil, you will lay a strong foundation. You will then start building the bridge on that foundation. The steps involved before making the bridge are not over-heads. They aren't waste of time and resources. They are not optional. They are required. If any step is missed, bridge would not be completed or would not be strong enough. Here at Vedantu, we are trying to build a bridge to let the student reach his/her goals. Before we build that, we have to understand the goals (dimensions of the bridge). We have to understand how strong the past concepts are (the strength of the soil). We have to explain how Vedantu works (explain process to client). We start by clarifying pre-requisite concepts (laying a strong foundation). Then we start teaching the exam oriented topic (build the bridge). Online tutoring is a new concept and we have to explain the process to new students. During our first session, we spend a small amount of time in above. This is not \"time wasted\". This is \"time invested\". There is no \u201cone-size-fits-all approach\u201d that can be used to provide a customized service. Also, a personalized service is going to be a little costlier than \"cookie cutter\" service. Pricing at Vedantu is fair. Vedantu sessions are billed per minute. Billing is only active while both parties are present. Billing pauses if one of the parties is not active (internet disconnections, laptop battery dead, stuck in traffic etc). ",

            "answer_text": "I have been enrolled in Vedantu CBSE Class 12 batch. It is a free course (till lockdown opens I guess). My criticism wouldn't be that valid since I don't pay for any services but here goes nothing. *Live Classes* Live sessions are most of the time interactive. Example- My Physics ,Maths and Bio teachers do solve the doubts asked by students at the end of the session. But Chemistry teacher doesn't pay attention to any of our doubts because according to him his teaching is so awesome that we won't have any doubts. Post Live doubt solving is useless because Telegram links don't work and majority of doubts on the doubt section of the App aren't solved for months. *Quality of teachers* It is a mixed opinion because some teachers are great, some are average and some are very less experienced. So it just depends on which teacher you get. But I would say except some teachers most teachers lack the advance/out of syllabus knowledge of a particular topic. *Level of Questions* I would say questions aren't that pattern based. Specially the questions discussed mostly in Live session. Simply solving MCQs won't do us any justice. There should be a variety of questions to understand the concept. *SAM and customer care* It is the worst part about the App. I still don't know who my SAM is and what is their role. If you email Vedantu Care your email gets a ticket id mine is in 20,000+ so you can imagine it will be eternity and you still won't get an answer. *Types of students* It is nice that there is Quiz in between lectures and a Leaderboard system but most of the students and even teachers are focused on that even more than the lectures. It's good to have competition but attending the Quiz shouldn't be the main reason to attend the Live. It should be about gaining knowledge. Constantly getting irritated because your name isn't appearing on the Leaderboard is just such a petty behavior. Firstly it is an automated system so it doesn't matter how fast you gave your answer if the machine didn't detect it then you won't be on top. I understand it can be frustrating but the focus is giving the answer fast rather than correct and this is reflected in the % of correct answers. *Lastly* It is free now so I would recommend to use it in lockdown since there aren't many free classes available anywhere. The quality is okay if it is free but if I would have to pay for this then I wouldn't enroll.( at least till when they don't improve their system) ",
