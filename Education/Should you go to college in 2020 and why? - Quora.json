            "answer_text": " At the best of times going to college is a risky business. It is extremely expensive and there is a serious imbalance of Supply (grads) vs Demand (well-paying jobs). Perhaps you have heard the rumors: THESE AREN\u2019T THE BEST OF TIMES. After The Great Recession of 2008, recent college graduates struggled. (I have a 2011 study showing 51% underemployed or unemployed.) The COVID-19 crisis is going to make The Great Recession of 2008 look like a \u201cwalk in the park.\u201d Our country currently has 36,000,000 people UNEMPLOYED. It\u2019s going to be years before our economy is back to where it was three months ago. Here\u2019s my advice. The impact of COVID-19 is going to vary widely, i.e. state by state and school by school. Think about the extremes, e.g. the CUNY schools in NYC vs someplace like the University of Montana in Bozeman. Colleges and universities are under tremendous financial pressure. You need to do your homework on the quality of the education that will be provided and on what provisions have been taken to make the campus safe. If you decide to enroll this fall, your major must be rock-solid marketable, and you need to hold student loan debt to an absolute minimum.  Seriously think about spending the first two years at a community college near home. If you haven\u2019t identified a rock-solid marketable major, think about that TWICE.  Note Thomas B Walsh's answer to How many people with college degrees are underemployed? This was BEFORE anybody ever heard of COVID-19. IMO, in 2024 60% of college grads could end up unemployed or underemployed. ",

            "answer_text": "If you had planned to go to college (for the first time, or as a continuing student), don\u2019t let the COVID-19 situation change that. We may indeed be open for face-to-face classes. Even if we have classes online, please know that hundreds of thousands of students take online classes every year. It\u2019s not the end of the world if you do so as well. You may like the flexibility it affords. Even if you don\u2019t like it, the semester is about 15-16 weeks long. Don\u2019t change a long-term plan for a sense of discomfort lasting 16 weeks! What is the alternative? It\u2019s not as if there are so many great jobs out there for a high school graduate. Don\u2019t waste a semester or a year for the sake of a non-productive alternative. If someone is telling you that there are college graduates doing jobs below the level of their qualification: Think about people who are even less qualified, being out of work or working at even lower-level jobs,Think of the recession as being a dip rather than a trend, This, too, shall pass.Study in a field or a major that did have great jobs available with high salaries. Don\u2019t go into a field that already had poor prospects and then complain that you don\u2019t have a high-paying job.Please read Beheruz N Sethna's answer to Would you suggest taking a gap year because of COVID-19?
