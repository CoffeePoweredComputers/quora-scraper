            "answer_text": "Hi Good question. Thanks for the A2A Hmm. Simply put, Yes and No. Yes because the education system is flawed can cause high levels of anxiety and stress, and why not bring back pastoral care? It\u2019s needed after all and desperately, for many reasons, and also support should be given to help the poorest amongst us to have an equal fair chance . Also, The universities charge more than enough for their services, study papers, books and degrees \u2018et al\u2019. So\u2026 And no, because I don\u2019t believe the responsibility lies SOLEY on the university. But equally if not more so, on the government. Furthermore, whenever and wherever affordable and viable, a small percentage of the family of parents of the student I do believe they have an ethical solemn duty to provide financial support for our future depends on our workforce our young and older alike, to be able to qualify and earn decent enough wages to support the huge financial cost of living this government forced upon us. Instead, the government should step in and be a healthy participator. And pay at least 50% Not just for the priveledged few, but for all. Lastly, wherever possible, I do believe a very small portion of the costs should be met by the students themselves for prompt and timely access and usage of a decent running in house mental health service provider services. .

            "answer_text": "\u201cResponsible for\u201d is a loaded phrase. Of course the individual is responsible for their health. Universities are responsible for supporting their students\u2019 mental health. The traditional college age student is: at higher than average risk for suicide, developing binge drinking habits, becoming involved in intimate relationships that are counter to their educational goals, developing relationships which may build toward earned secure attachment, building on their anxiety management skills, intimate partner violence, the ability to come to grips with childhood sexual abuse and first psychotic breaks unless prodromal symptoms are addressed and treated. Students at risk of dropping out are less likely to do so if they go to their college counseling center. Supporting student mental health is important as supporting their physical health. ",
