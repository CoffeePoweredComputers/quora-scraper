            "answer_text": "I find psychology an extremely interesting subject due to the wide range of topics it covers and it\u2019s depth into how our subconscious works. The case studies are particularly interesting in my opinion as although it lacks generalisability and reliability, the results can be so interesting/ Psychology is the science of behaviour and mind. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as feeling and thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. The way the mind works is something that amazes me and has inspired my interest in Sigmund Freud. He believed that actions and dreams are influenced by subconscious desires and interests and if analyses these desires can be discovered and fulfilled. Freud was the founder of psychoanalysis and has impacted psychology today. He created the psychology analytic theory, the Oedipus Complex which covers how during the phallic stage the child can feel desire for their opposite-sex parent and want all their attention and therefore feel anger towards their same-sex parents for having some of the said attention. My knowledge of psychology, Freud included, is limited and only based off what I have learnt during my psychology classes in school. I hope to do well in my GCSEs for this subject and hopefully go on to take it for A-Levels. One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful. - Sigmund Freud Stay strong c: Alice. ",

            "answer_text": "The choice for the best subject changes, my view. In small grades usually students like solving sums and social questions that intrigue them. In Secondary school the languages become more interesting because man mostly passes through a love affair, so, he wants some poetics to say to his beau. When he joins higher secondary school he considers himself a freebird and fly randomly. He cares least for subjects. Thats why boys fail in college\u263a. And when in the university, A mature man gets in love with philosophy, Who is to seek job study maths and company, one who has to compete for civil services go for social sciences and what I like is an amalgam of politics and philosophy.
