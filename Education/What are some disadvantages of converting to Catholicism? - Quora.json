            "answer_text": "One major problem is they took out the 2nd commandment. Read Exodus 20 of the comments given by God. They are specifically commanded by God don\u2019t worship or make any images of anything praising a person or animal or anything. If you go to anything or person before God that is worshiping that person or thing. In scripture it says God is a jealous God. Plus in order to still have the delusion of Ten Commandments they split the 10th commandment. Read it yourself. Plus God says their is only One God. The Vatican says there are three gods. The trinity. But the Trinity is not in the bible. Only name given is Godhead. Godhead tells us that God as the Soul, Jesus as the Body and the Holy Ghost as the Spirit. You can\u2019t have God without these three being present. So when God created us in His image. He gave us a spirit, body and soul. In the beginning God with His image that means with a Body formed man out of the dust, clay, dirt with water formed a body. This body was like a cadaver. No life yet then His Word says He breath into his nostrils his own spirit and by the union of these two he became a living soul. It also takes these three to be a living human. Now God created him like His Image BUT not equal with Him but able to have his own free will to choose just like God. To be a separate person. NOT 3 persons but 1. 1 spirit, body, soul = 1 human. Then after awhile He created Eve the same image for her out of Adam. The marrow of his bone and with her own spirit. So she became a image of Adam both from God\u2019s Image. Still only one God. But Catholics make Mary as God\u2019s Mother. God has no Mother but when God created himself as a seed with God\u2019s own pure blood and went into Mary by no humans blood or seed formed within Mary and Mary then had her first son. Because no man touched or went in Mary but God His seed formed in Mary\u2019s egg God was able to have flesh just like man put around His Spirit thus God in the flesh around His Spirit became the Son of God and also the Son of Man. The only begotten Son of God. Means the only person in flesh God had and none afterward. God had to die for us. Go through life without sin to save us who will follow. He died and became alive again and only the One True God could do this. But Catholics teach Jesus is separate from God and the Holy Spirit is separate too. 3 persons. 3 separate yet coexist. NOT TRUE. There is only 1 God. No other God but Him. NOW we can act like a god. Meaning we can ignore the True God and only listen to me, myself and I. Thus we take the place of God but calls these people antichrist. Catholics like the pope, Cardinals, bishops all say they are taking the place of Christ. But how can they take Jesus place when he LIVES. He is present as the Holy Spirit in all those who recognize He Lives. His Spirit guides and teaches our spirit. We then are born again. Because what He did on the cross to save us. He shed all His blood for us. That Blood that God put in the Seed in Mary\u2019s egg. Adam and Eve or mankind could not save us like God as Jesus did. Sin caused death. Satan deceiving them cause them to doubt God. God condemned Satan and his followers of angels to judgement coming and they will go to the lake if fire with NO forgiveness. But because mankind was deceived God will forgive all those who stop following Satan and follow Jesus Christ who was made like Adam. Adam was made from the dust but Jesus was in Mary by the Spirit. Jesus was not created but went into Mary. He always was before as I AM. The God who talked and walked with Adam and Eve. Who spoke to Moses who walked and spoke to Abram and Sari who spoke to Abraham as Melchesidec. Catholics also pray to Lucifer you can listen to their chanting on the Internet plus look up the pope\u2019s throne on google. Has Christ as the serpent head on the cross. No where in the bible is Jesus image given as part serpent and part man. The only time is God told Moses to make a serpent on a staff to represent Christ on the cross because to the people he was considered evil sent by the devil. But Christ was innocent and without sin. God did not tell us to pray to this type of image of Jesus. God said Jesus is among the Living not of the dead. Meaning of the lost misguided sinners who are stubborn like goats. Satan is sometimes described as a goats image. Instead become a bible believing Christian. There is no Catholic mentioned in the bible or any denomination. There are Jews mentioned and Christians. Be a follower of Christ by letting Him be your Shepherd who as us as sheep leading us out of this place to His Kingdom. Repent and Believe in the Word and try to be righteous and Holy like He is. ",

            "answer_text": "When I became catholic (and before I left) a few things I learned. You have to be strong in your faith in the Church/Christ, strong enough that all the bias and mess* won\u2019t deter your relationship in Mass. The disadvantage is that it is a process and patience to get to that strength and people\u2019s faith gets insulted at the same time. It\u2019s hard to build charity and Mass with all christians when the rest of the world hates your relationship with christ.Another disadvantage, well to some, aligning your worship in opposition to your core values and personality. For example, if you\u2019re a free-spirited person and rituals suffocate you, it would be hard to worship in Mass. A lot of reflection helps to know if catholicism (the way of Practice) is a good fit. Not all can do it.If coming from evangelist christianity I\u2019d say a disadvantage or maybe a challenge is to change one\u2019s worship to humble devotion rather than evangalization. You would need to put the physical bible aside and actually participate in Mass as that is the bible in and of itself. I don\u2019t call it a disadvantage but more of a challenge really. That, and really understanding the nature of the church and the meaning behind the rituals and prayers saves a whole lot of ills and misconceptions.I\u2019d only convert if you been to church/Mass for a good while, understand the sacraments, and actually see the internal meaning behind communion, repentance, confirmation, and being born again. It\u2019s a personal relationship with god so the advantage is you can have that personal relationship as a Mass as scripture says. But I wouldn\u2019t convert lightheartedly and I definitely wouldn\u2019t listen to anti-catholics. Takes time. I love the church and practice. If I clicked with the theology, I would have stayed. But that\u2019s what I experienced it to be. ",
