Shanghai, China GDP: $516.5 billionArea: 6,340.5 square kilometersPopulation: 23,019,148  With the Chinese economy experiencing a big boom, it is no wonder that a Chinese city will make it to the list. While Beijing is the cultural and political seat of China, Shanghai is known to be its commercial hub and will remain as such for many years to come.

Moscow, Russia GDP: $520.1 billionArea: 2,510 square kilometersPopulation: 11,503,501  The Russian capital offers more than their famed vodka and luxurious caviar. That\u2019s for sure. After getting dethroned as the official seat of the country when St. Petersburg was founded, Moscow was reintroduced as the capital city of Russia after the 1917 Revolution. After getting involved in countless wars and historical milestones, Moscow now provides a huge fraction of the country\u2019s supply of food, steel, minerals, and chemicals. 8.

It is also home to the deep-dish pizza, a culinary offering rarely found anywhere else. But Chicago is more than just basketball and an Italian dish. The city\u2019s roots are so deep they would trace back to Native Americans that called the Windy City home.

New York, USA GDP: $1,210 billionArea: 1,213square kilometersPopulation: 8,244,910  The Big Apple. The City that never sleeps. If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere, or so that old Frank Sinatra hit goes. New York is one of the most historically rich cities in the United States, particularly in the East Coast. It figured in the Anglo-Dutch War, where the Dutch won the city but eventually turned it over to the English as decreed via a treaty in 1647. New York was one of the cities that called for the abolition of slavery in the United States and it also served as an entry port to immigrants from Europe, which made New York into a culturally diverse place that it is today. Attraction in the city includes the Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building. 1. Tokyo, Japan GDP: $1,520 billionArea: 2,187.6 square kilometersPopulation: 13,185,502  Great things come from small beginnings, or so the old adage goes. And it is the case for Tokyo, Japan.

Edo is the former name of Tokyo. The city suffered a turbulent past \u2013 an earthquake in 1923 almost levelled the city which was also the receiving end of extensive bomb runs during the Second World War. After Japan\u2019s surrender in 1945, Tokyo went to rebuild and grew into the most progressive city in the world today. Tokyo\u2019s leading industries are electronics, telecommunications and publishing. ",
