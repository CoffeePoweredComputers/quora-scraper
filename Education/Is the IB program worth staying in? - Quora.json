First of all, the way IB is taught is so effective in universities because it allows you to manage your own time. IB is student-based and requires students to put more effort into their work than other curriculums. Also with works such as ToK, EE, CAS (Theory of Knowledge, Extended Essay, Creativity, Activity, Service), it makes a student so much more rounded. For ToK, it gives students a deeper understanding of how we act and even though a lot of people will call this a useless subject, it helps people in understanding why some of us make the decisions we make. For Extended Essay, it lets one explore a deeper topic in a subject they take and it can be based around anything which lets the student be more open-minded. Also, the research needed for this will help students in the future by being able to learn which sources are reliable, accurate and helpful and which are not. For CAS, it makes the student well-rounded. It makes them do activities which help improve them. For example, a \u2018service\u2019 could be helping out less fortunate kids and this just makes students learn about new cultures, assimilate into them and hopefully improve themselves based on these experiences. Even activities such as going to the gym help improve one's lifestyle. Even though IB is rigorous, it\u2019ll help students in the future by allowing them to manage their time in a more effective manner and it\u2019ll also help you set your priorities when there are tons of deadlines coming up.
