            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. I wasn\u2019t much more mature at 16 than I was at 14. I think you would have to deal with different rules? Like, when I was 14 I was allowed to stay at parties until 12 m and at 16 up to 2am (yes this is normal in my country because your parents pick you up from wherever you are, always). When I was 14 I wasn\u2019t allowed to get into anyone\u2019s car, when I was 16 my parents allowed me to get into my friend\u2019s car, if they knew them and during daylight. So, those are the issues dating with age gap in high school has: the lifestyle. In my opinion, it\u2019s not a bad thing a 2 year gap ",

            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you mean in a relationship. The age gap is relatively small and like another commenter said, the lifestyle may be different based on maturity. Ex: A 16 yr. old can drive and might have their own car. As long as the relationship is not explicitly sexual, you should not have a problem. But having sex could be seen as statutory rape since in many places a 14 year old can't give consent but a 16 year old could. In other places, neither a 16 nor a 14 year old would be old enough to give consent. It all depends on where you live if you're in a sexual relationship. But general dating is okay. Aka kissing, etc\u2026 ",
