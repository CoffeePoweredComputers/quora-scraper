            "answer_text": "The term 'degree' could be Freemasonry's biggest confusion. All full-member Freemasons are Master Masons (3rd degree). There are two probationary degrees, Entered Apprentice Mason (1st Degree) and Fellowcraft Mason (2nd degree). After becoming a Master Mason, there are easily over 100 other degrees one may receive. None of these is higher ranking than Master Mason, they are just additions - think of them as toppings on your three scoops of ice-cream. You can choose to go for flavored syrup, or go for sprinkles, or both, or neither. The choice is up to you. The Ancient and Accepted [Scottish] Rite consists of thirty-three degrees. In many places, the first three degrees of the Scottish Rite aren't performed, substituting the local version of the first three degrees instead. In the United States, the first three degrees are part of the 'York' system, but I'll get more into that later. There are some places that use the Scottish Rite version of the first three degrees. Again these have some significant variation, but the general gist of them is the same.The other 30 degrees are additional, with the 33rd degree being a designation for those who have accepted upper level leadership positions, or (more often) given as an honor for extraordinary service to Masonry. The 33rd degree itself does not grant any authority over the common rank-and-file Mason. Authority within Masonry only comes from being elected into a leadership position. Once you leave the position, you will still be given respect for having held the position, but you no longer have authority.In the Scottish Rite degrees, the numbers don't necessarily mean anything. Many times the degrees are not received in any particular order. In the United States, for example there are three recognized separate sovereign organizations that use the Scottish Rite: the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction, the Southern Jurisdiction, and a Prince Hall United Supreme Council. In the north, a 'reunion' is held twice a year - Friday evening and Saturday - where an average of 5-6 degrees is given. The reunion always includes the 32nd degree. So you come to reunion and leave Saturday afternoon as a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason. The other degrees vary. It can take 6-7 years before all 29 of the degrees have been offered at least once. In other parts of the world, the degrees are given in numeric order, and it can take many years to advance. Oddly though, the degrees aren't necessarily arranged in an order that really makes sense. Some persons in high places have pushed for moving the degree order around to make more sense (and this has been done some in the north), but tradition holds out for the most part. You can petition today and possibly receive the 32nd degree (and become a Shriner too) in about a month and a half if you attend a one-weekend combined class. I highly urge everyone to NOT go this route. If a one-day for the three degrees of Freemasonry is likened to drinking from a firehose, adding the Scottish Rite and Shrine the same day/weekend turns it into a tsunami; you'll have no clue what you just sat through. The 33rd degree will take you at least 10+ years past that. There are two forms of the 33rd degree - Active and Honorary. Active 33rds are sitting members of the Council - the leadership body of the Scottish Rite (NOTE WELL: The Scottish Rite is not 'Freemasonry'; it is just one of the concordant bodies to Freemasonry - it exists by permission of the Grand Lodge that has jurisdiction over Freemasonry for that location). Honorary 33rds are not sitting members of the Council, their 33rd is in recognition of long and significant service to the Scottish Rite.Therefore, there are two ways to receive the 33rd degree: 1) work your way up the line by volunteering for administrative positions in your Valley and eventually volunteer to get elected to the Council (key words here is 'volunteer' and 'elected' - it will take a substantial portion of your time for which you will not be paid or receive material compensation and the decision for you to take the role is a democratic one).2) Volunteer a significant amount of your time, knowledge, skill, money for a significant period of time (jurisdictions vary but usually at LEAST 10 years [EDIT: it is possible by the established rules, to make it in just under 4 years - but I think this would be extremely rare]).

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no such thing. In Freemasonry, there are only three degrees: Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason. To correct some misconceptions: The 33rd Degree in the Scottish Rite, an appendant body to Freemasonry, isn\u2019t \u201cgiven\u201d to anyone. The 33rd Degree is awarded by one of the two Supreme Councils (Northern Masonic or Southern Jurisdiction) for outstanding service to the Rite, Freemasonry, or humanity.The \u201cgoverning body\u201d for the Scottish Rite is known as \u201cthe Supreme Council\u2019s Board of Directors.\u201dAll 33rd Degree Scottish Rite members - known as \u201cIllustrious Brothers\u201d - are honorary. Active 33rds is the distinction made between honorary 33rds and members of the Board of Directors.There are no \u201cgrand jurisdictions\u201d in the United States for the Scottish Rite(s. There are, simply, two jurisdictions; the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts, and the Southern Jurisdiction headquartered in Washington, DC.The Scottish Rite Northern Masonic Jurisdiction encompasses 15 states north of the Mason-Dixon line (Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin).The Scottish Rite Souther Jurisdiction includes the remaining 35 states, the District of Columbia, and \u201call U.S. Territories and Possessions.\u201d32nd Degree Scottish Rite Masons are NOT \u201cmaster masons that have completed all the degrees in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.\u201d Just being a member of the Scottish Rite in the United States means you are a 32nd Degree Scottish Rite member - even if you have not had the 4th through the 32nd Degrees conferred.If you have questions about Freemasonry, it\u2019s best to ask an actual Freemason; they\u2019re going to be the only ones who can accurately answer questions about the fraternity.
