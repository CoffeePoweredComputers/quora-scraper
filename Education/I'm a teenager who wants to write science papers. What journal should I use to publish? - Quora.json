            "answer_text": "When I was in high school, I was in a college-prep chemistry class. Several of my classmates wrote research papers that described an area of interest, provided background and published research, devised an experiment, and reported the results. The goal was a partial scholarship, and one program offered admission to Washington University in St. Louis (a pretty darn good school as it turns out). The best advice our teacher offered was that it doesn\u2019t matter where you get published. The objective is publication. Of course, if you\u2019re published through your target college or university, then that\u2019s even better. The key is to work with the publisher. Academic journals are good. But don\u2019t rule out foundations and research laboratories. The Batelle Institute offered a scholarship through a research contest. My classmate accompanied our teacher on an overnight trip to present his paper. That was pretty cool to the rest of us. Later in my academic career, the message was reinforced: If you want to publish, the goal is to get published. It doesn\u2019t matter as much where you are published, as long as it\u2019s not the popular press. Focus on academic and trade journals, organizations, research foundations, and college publications. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many teenagers that want to do something, but until you take action, nothing will magically materialize. If I were to recommend anything to you, and take this with a grain of salt, contact various science journals and/or current science journalists you are interested in publishing similar material to and ask them if you could provide them with value of any sort. This could be helping to write one of their papers or presenting them with one of your previous papers for review and consideration/critiques. Remember, you likely will not be able to choose your publisher if you have never published any professional articles before. In spite of my criticism, congratulations, it is always fenomenal to see people of your age setting goals and pursuing their passion, do not stop. ",
