            "answer_text": "OK, let\u2019s start some project ideas from top of my head. First of all we need to create some projects to learn features of React ecosystem, they should be simple and clean. Easy level. Your CV page. Own portfolio. You learn how to create web app using React.Clone random.org. Create some randomizer.What in the picture quiz. Show some picture from local storage, give 4 options where 1 of them is right.Medium level. Create Reddit reader. To do that go to Reddit API page. You will learn how to work with third party API, how to make requests and how to handle them.Create clone of the bitly project, shortlify url.I think you need to know how to work with forms in the js project, and working with the forms is painful in the React ecosystem. So create Google Forms clone, where you can generate some questions, and choose type of answer (input text, drop-down list, choose one or multiple). After creating a form you can share it.Hard Level. Create movie recommendation app. You need module to scrap movies. You need some database to store a data, it could be cloud (firebase), nosql like mongo or relational db like postgres or mysql. Then add some ML to your app, for example Tenserflow JS. When user comes to your app, ask him what he thinks about movies (like or not, and next movie in the quiz should depend on answer). After completion of quiz show your the movies recommendations to watch using Tenserflow JS.Nowadays one of the hot topics in the front-end World are micro-front-end and web components. Let\u2019s mix them together. Create web application which stores all information in your city: weather, cinema table, events, bus table, currency exchange, restaurant list, drug stores, some local news and etc. Implement each of them as micro-front-end project and wrap them as separate component.Courier Tracking App. You need to create 2 application here. First application sends user geolocation, implement it as mobile app using React Native. And second application, web application, where you see courier movements on the map. Look at mapbox.",
