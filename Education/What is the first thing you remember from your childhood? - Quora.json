            "answer_text": "My first memories \u2026. The house I grew up in was one we moved to when I was under 2 years of age. So\u2026. At the first house I remember (not the one I grew up in), there was a house behind ours, and a little girl called Tutu lived there. She was my age, wore her long, dark, curly hair in pigtails, was wearing bright red and blue clothes, had dimples and was sitting on the asphalt playing \u2026 jacks? Not sure. Mom called me in and as I went toward the house, I stepped on a sewing needle that went deeply into my heel. I went to the back steps, which were on a large concrete \u201cporch\u201d that I had a lot of trouble getting up on to. Mom pulled the needle out while I cried. I remember, too, chasing the little girl (who became my lifelong best friend) through her house, trying to tell her it was \u201cdolly\u201d, and not \u201cdally\u201d as she called her doll. Now, in the house I grew up in, I remember being scared awake by music and laughing as my mom had come home from her split shift and was having a party with some coworkers. I hid behind boxes of clothes that had yet been unpacked from moving. Around that same time, at maybe 3, my dad drove up and told me to get in the car with my brothers. He didn\u2019t tell my mother (they divorced before I even remember living as a family). He took us to Marineland and he held me up so I could see into the hammerhead shark tank. That picture of all those enormous fish has stuck with me all my life. Around this same time, my best friend and I were running around the car, getting in, being the driver, switching places. She shut the car door on my right toes. I remember crying, mom carrying me in the house, putting a rolled up blanket under my bed sheets to create a tent over my foot so the weight wouldn\u2019t lie on my injured foot, and dad coming to see me late in the night, bringing me warm peanuts from The Pike.

            "answer_text": "This one childhood memory always brings a SMILE to my face. :) I don\u2019t remember everything clearly now, but i was 7or 8 years old back then. One of our long distance relative visited us in summer holidays. When he came to our home, since i was seeing him for the first time i was little scared going near to him. He was an old aged man somewhere around 60. soon i got relaxed and everything was fine. I used to call him \u2018DADA\u2019. :) One fine evening, my mom was making \u2018Kheer\u2019 or \u2018Shirkhurma\u2019 for us. I was playing near the kitchen and he was sitting on the bed. my mom went to take some ingredients outside. I saw my dada standing and going somewhere. suddenly i heard the sound of falling something. Probably the sound of utensils. But i didn\u2019t took any effort to go and watch what happened, and i continued playing. After some time, my mom came, went to kitchen and she called my name loudly, ( In an angry tone ). I went to kitchen little scared. And there it was, all the prepared mixture or something like that all over the floor. She started scolding me, telling me how bad i am becoming day by day. She thought i was responsible for all that but i wasn\u2019t and i knew who was. Though i was a kid i remained silent, i didn\u2019t tried to give any proof of innocence, listening to my mom.she told me how shameless i have become. I knew if i told my mom what is true then my Dada had to face embarrassment. Next day while leaving he came to me, and gave me a 100rs note. I was hesitating to take it( only from outside ;) ). Then he told me something i don\u2019t remember now. I took that note (Afterall after so much scolding i deserve 100 rupees ;) ). And then he left. This is one of the sweetest memory i have from childhood. \u2764 Now whenever i think about this. It instantly bring smile to my face. :-D Thank you. :-) ",
