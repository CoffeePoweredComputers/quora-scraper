            "answer_text": "Friends\u2026.! Let the rational between present ages of A and B is x. Therefore their respective ages, A, 4x and B, 5x. The ratio of their ages 4 year hence, become 14 : 17 4 years hence, their ages will be 4x + 4 and 5x + 4, and the ratio of their ages 14 /17 (4x + 4) / (5x + 4) = 14/ 17 Cross multiplication 14 (5x + 4) = 17 (4x + 4) 70x + 56 = 68x + 68 70x - 68x = 68 \u2013 56 2x = 12 x = 12/2 x = 6 Thus the rational x is 6. Their respective ages: A's present age 4x = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 years B's present age 5x = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30 years Answer B's present age is 30 years. Let us check for correctness of answer 4 years hence , the age of A will be 24 + 4 = 28 and age of B will be 30 + 4= 34 years and the ratio between their ages will be 28 : 34 or 14 : 17 Means answer is correct.
