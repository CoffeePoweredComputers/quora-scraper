            "answer_text": "Well, let us first understand the meaning of \u2018Sarcastically Illiterate' well, I could only get the definition of Sarcasm. Sarcasm is an ironic or satirical remark tempered by humor. Mainly, people use it to say the opposite of what's true to make someone look or feel foolish. For example, let's say you see someone struggling to open a door and you ask them, \"Do you want help?\" If they reply by saying, \"No thanks. I'm really enjoying the challenge,\" It makes someone look foolish , I mean the people you are using it against. Though it might be funny but some people find it not friendly or just rude. So if you are talking about Sarcatically illiterate, which I know that is what you mean, then I think maybe people don't understand that, what you are saying is the opposite of what you mean, all you are just trying to do is to make them laugh, but since they are not intepreting your humour the way, that you expected it to be, instead they find it outright rude or assume you mean something else.

            "answer_text": "Don't know exactly what you mean but I guess you mean those people who claim you said something then you scratch your head like \u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d and end up quoting your own text at them which they apparently didn't read or misread on purpose. I guess it's cognitive dissonance (passive) and actively thinking that only your opinion is the right one. I have had these where a part of my text sounded like I was opposing some idea and in the next part I explained that even though I think this way about a very few things related to the thing I am mostly like others. Next someone comes and claims that I said the exact opposite of what I actually said. I end up quoting the last part back at them feeling like I'm talking to a someone completely illiterate. ",
