            "answer_text": "MOOC certificates are still a relatively unknown credential among employers, although they are gaining ground. As Ratan suggests, it's how you can demonstrate your skills acquired through MOOCs that is key. If you are taking MOOCs in order to improve your employment prospects, having a verified certificate on your CV gives you a talking point from which you can then illustrate the specific skills you have gained and how they can support you in a particular role. In this case, I would recommend gaining a certificate. If, however, you are taking MOOCs for personal development, I would say paying for a certificate is unnecessary. ",
