            "answer_text": "I'll be honest here. The college you choose after passing you EAMCET exam doesn't really matter. It all depends on how much you want to grow in your future and the path you wanna be in. For instance, if you want to go into research, concentrate on publishing research papers and attending conferences. If you want to work, get a job and start your battle in the corporate world. For the latter, both the colleges for that matter, every college that uses EAMCET as a standard provides pretty decent choices. But for the former, the most likely depends on the professors and department heads. This has to be your general outlook for the future. Now if we try to be a bit practical here, you could choose Grier over BVRIT because of the journey time. But if you ask me, you could choose BVRIT as well as you can utilise the time to commute in a productive manner. In the end, you have to make the choice keeping you convenience and your plans for the future in mind. Remember, every minute is important. I've learnt it the hard way\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "Ranking wise GRIET stands first than BVRIT, and it something goes like this.. If you already have an idea of what you want you to be in the next 10 years or if you are studiuos and want to be settled in a good position, go for GRIET. As you will be having a good guidance to your future and if you are a bit good with your academics, iam sure you will be placed at a good position by the time you leave the college. And if you wanted to have some fun even along with the studies and if you feel that you can maintain a balance between the academics and co-curricular activities, then go for BVRIT, as some of my friends studying there will say that you will be given full freedom irrespective of anything. And which is even not good sometimes. And go through some of my previously answered questions in which i explained even more clearly about GRIET and still if you have any doubts about GRIET, I would be happy to answer them. ",
