            "answer_text": "Have you ever had 20\u201340 people yelling, not doing what you asked, checking their phone every time they think you\u2019re not looking, several times a day, day after day? You might get a little irritable. Students can be like customers that don\u2019t want the product you\u2019re selling but you have to sell to them anyways. Not every class is like this and not every teacher is uptight. Its better not to generalize. Some teachers are uptight because it\u2019s their disposition. Some are uptight because they are tired. ",
