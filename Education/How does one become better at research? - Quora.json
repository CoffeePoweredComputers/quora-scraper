            "answer_text": "From many years of learning from my mistakes in doing research, here are the key lessons I've learned: 1. Read a lot of literature on your topic. Based on the literature, pick a very narrow subtopic. Now, read all the literature on that narrow subtopic, everything that's ever been written on it. 2. This is particularly important if you're doing experimental research. Pick a really modest question to answer in that subtopic, one that wasn't answered before. Make sure it doesn't delve into unknowns that are very distant from what was answered before. Aim for only an incremental contribution. Now, I hate small ideas and I love big ideas. Yet success in experimental work requires proceeding in incremental steps. If you have a big idea, that\u2019s awesome and unboring. Break it up into smaller questions or goals and pursue those one at a time (especially if your work is experimental). The bigger the contribution you aim for initially, the smaller your actual contribution will likely be, unless you're an absolute genius beyond your peers and your superiors/supervisors. The more modest the question you choose to answer, and the more realistic your goals, the more likely you are to go even beyond them and offer deep, great insight, and be recognized for it ... It's counterintuitive, but this is the reality, especially in experimental research. You might be able to get away with aiming for bigger leaps in the theoretical world (also, see the edit right below). Most importantly, chances of a great contribution skyrocket if you're genuinely interested in the topic (maybe obsessively so), and are very careful in thinking through the caveats - i.e. you're not overconfident and know how to challenge your own assumptions. Edit: some research is meant to be \"high risk, high reward\". It\u2019s among the most interesting research to work on if you can get your hands on it. The advice I gave above doesn't apply directly to this kind of research. However, to determine what approaches to try when pursuing this kind of research, one still needs to use present knowledge to see how close it gets to the desired goal of the research. The challenge is in bringing in some other external knowledge (maybe from another traditionally separate discipline) to create a new and intelligent approach that is \"outside the box\" and really creative and unconventional. There still has to be some strong suggestion in present knowledge that things might possibly work with this new bold approach. We have to have a reason to think it could work, and this reason needs to be reasonably convincing. In this regard, there is some similarity to incremental research in that we need to figure out how close present knowledge has come. Where high-risk, high-reward research differs is in that it requires reading literature in other traditionally unrelated or weakly related topics. This is the way we can get creative and think outside the box. Sometimes, it also helps to talk to people with expertise in different disciplines. So high-risk research is more likely to be interdisciplinary and is hopefully collaborative (it should be). Still, the contribution to each of the disciplines individually can be incremental, but combining the concepts from each of the disciplines into a new approach, this is what needs to be ground-breaking and completely new and unconventional. So in some regard, the advice can still apply loosely. But it likely requires understanding several topics to different levels of depth, rather than just focusing on one topic in great depth. 3. Form an intelligent hypothesis and have a clear way to test it and to answer your research questions. If you've followed advice from 1 & 2, you should be on the right track to doing this. Have a clear definition of \"when you're done\". 4. Involve whomever you're working with as much as you can. If you have an adviser/supervisor, talk to him/her almost on a daily basis. Let's say this would be a reasonable minimum of interaction: 2 times a week briefly, plus once a week at length (maybe 45 mins to an hour at least). This is a minimum. Depending on your and his/her preference, communication can be even more extensive. 5. Don't be afraid to email and contact other people to ask a question. Someone from another department? Someone from another country even who wrote a paper you have a question about? Yes, definitely email him/her. The worst thing that can happen is that you won't get a response, but in my experience it's much more likely that you will get a response. 6. If you're going to collaborate with someone at all, especially if s/he is not required to collaborate with you, make sure the agreement is really clearly spelled out. Make sure it's clear what the expectations are, what the deliverables are, who's going to do what and when, and what will be the attribution for the final result (who gets credit for what). It should also be clear what this final result is: a paper? Many papers? A brief presentation? There are many levels and many types of collaborations. Spell it out. If it's someone who has a boss, make sure his/her boss is not only on board but is also enthusiastic about the collaboration. If the boss doesn't prioritize it, the person you're working with likely won't prioritize it either. Make sure your boss is totally on board as well. Make sure everyone involved, including said bosses, understands the agreement including details of deliverables, attributions, etc. 7. Self-motivation is difficult for anyone. Don't assume you have self-discipline. Find structure wherever you can to impose discipline on yourself. Set deadlines and share with your advisers/supervisors and make sure they hold you to those deadlines. Also ask them to help you meet them. Impose structure on yourself. Have a place to work. Use timers to make sure you spend sufficient time on the tasks at hand. Find other people in similar situations to keep each other accountable if you can. Agree on rewards and penalties for meeting (or failing to meet) certain goals, and make sure you are both committed to holding the other person to the agreement, even if it means you seem like a bit of a jerk. (I never could find anyone like this, but I wish I did). 8. Live a balanced life. Have social interactions. Exercise. Have a set schedule and get enough sleep. Have a routine. 9. Things will take at least 2-3 times as long as your most conservative time estimate. If you multiply this conservative time estimate by 2-3 times in order to follow my advice, the actual time it will take will again be 2-3 times longer than that. 10. While this may seem contradictory to point number 9, a lot of things will take as long as the time you give them. So, if you give yourself less time, things can often take less time. If you give yourself more time, things will definitely expand to fill that time. This is actually not contradictory to point number 9. In fact, it goes right along with it. Things take way longer than expected especially if you allow them to. 11. The trick to reconciling 9 and 10 is understanding what details can and should be skipped. Many details that multiply the required time only improve the results marginally. Apply something like an 80-20 rule. Usually 20% of your activities will yield 80% of your results, and the remaining 80% of your activities will only contribute to 20% of your results ... Focus on the first 20% that yield most of your results. The rest is extra if you have time and don't want to spend it on something else (like starting your next project or taking a much deserved and needed break). 12. Start outlining and writing things up well before you're ready to. This will help you focus on important things, organize your tasks, and implement point number 11. I can't emphasize this enough. You're still learning about a topic but have an idea of what you're trying to do? Start writing a paper as if you know what the heck you're talking about. It's okay -- no one will need to see it and you can change it / scrap it any time. This is a trick that will help you in ways you can't imagine. Just trust yourself, trust the process, and start writing. This answer gets into this a little bit more: Sherif R. Fahmy's answer to What is the easiest way to write a research paper? 13. You'll likely have a really hard time following most of this advice, but keep trying. It gets easier over time, and you'll become a better researcher in the process... 14. Related to 13 - don't get discouraged. Everyone sucks at whatever they do when they start, and if you're doing research in something that's highly specialized, you should realize that if it weren't complex and intricate, there would be no opportunity to do research in it ... So, by construction, you're bound to suck at it for quite a long time. Just embrace your ineptitude and don't focus on what great achievements and expectations you're failing to meet. Only have the expectation that you'll learn and better yourself. That is enough. If it's not enough for you, you likely won't be a good researcher. You'll likely be a grumpy one, which is almost a guarantee of being a bad one. The only time you can have grand expectations of yourself and meet them in research is if you are a true genius. However, you're probably not, and even if you were, you too are likely to overestimate your ability in contrast to your actual ability just like everyone else does ... So this advice will likely still apply to you. Realize that there are many unknowns and that all you can expect is to learn while you navigate them. Hope this helps. Have fun - or at least try to. ",

Try to reproduce the results of some good journal papers then you will get confidence.  We like to label people so we can understand them; it\u2019s just the way human psychology works. It makes it easier to associate this new person with the template we\u2019ve set up in our heads that it is represented by the label. Call someone a biker, skater, rock star, drug dealer, doctor, lawyer or marketer, and an automatic set of assumptions pops up in your mind. It makes it easy to pre-suppose what someone is like, and someone is stands for. And it is the kiss of death for your brand. If you have a simplistic label that you identify your brand with \u2013 life coach, internet marketer, consultant, whatever \u2013 people will see you as part of this great big group that they already have templates for in their mind. And you will not stand out. At all. You don\u2019t need a label \u2013 you need a mission. Things you stand for that the rest of your industry doesn\u2019t stand for, or has a painfully weak stance not worth mentioning. Your mission is to bring _______ to your industry. Only you can decide what that is, and once you do, you\u2019ve got to push for it with all you\u2019re worth. Then you\u2019re not another _______, you\u2019re you. You\u2019re worth remembering. You\u2019re not a talk show host, you\u2019re Oprah. You\u2019re not a CEO, you\u2019re Richard Branson or Donald Trump. You\u2019re not a motivational speaker, you\u2019re Tony fucking Robbins. You need to decide what it is you stand for and what you bring to the industry. And then you need to live that out loud so no one can possibly put a label on you. And then nobody forgets you. When I started out as a marketer, I never positioned myself as a \u201cmarketer.\u201d I had mission. I walked in determined to bring class to the online marketing industry, inspire the hell out of pressure-crushed entrepreneurs, and give straight talk without the bullshit you see everywhere else. You can like me, you can hate me. Whatever. I\u2019ve got mission, and that\u2019s why business comes to me and I\u2019m not scrambling. Get your own mission. I want to see the same thing happen to you.  I\u2019m tired of people saying they\u2019re experts at something when their content doesn\u2019t reflect it. It hurts their business so much. They focus on trying to make trendy blog posts that will get social media back-scratching and they scramble to get people active in their comments. They focus on getting retweets, likes, comments and page views and they don\u2019t focus on the most important thing: Blowing people\u2019s minds, again and again and again. And again. Then they wonder why business isn\u2019t booming. Forget social media, forget blogging three times a week, forget about \u201cextending the conversation.\u201d Screw conversation. Monologue instead. Monologue about everything you know, about things only you know, about amazing insights that you\u2019ve come up with. Imagine that every post you wrote was required to bring in $10,000 in business for you. You\u2019d write differently, wouldn\u2019t you? Damned straight you would. Take a page from my book. When I wanted to establish authority, I started writing articles that were 4,000 \u2013 6,000 words long, and their depth of content alone attracted more pageviews than any traffic gimmicks you see out there. I created product-quality workbooks \u2013 around 100 pages of them \u2013 and gave them away for free. And since I\u2019m a product launch consultant, I started dissecting other people\u2019s launches in real time, for the viewing public, and gave it away for free. I don\u2019t need to say I\u2019m an expert. I give more strategy away for free than most people do in their paid products. That does the talking for me. What\u2019s doing the talking for you? An \u201cabout\u201d page or a Twitter bio that says you\u2019re an expert? Don\u2019t say it \u2013 show it in every post, every download, every video \u2013 everything. Show it, and do a better job than anyone else. Word will spread, people will come to your website, and when they see how much content you have talking for you they\u2019ll wonder what the hell is wrong with your lazy competition.  We all love self-promotion. It\u2019s human \u2013 and I\u2019m not knocking it. If you kick ass, you should let the world know. You just don\u2019t need to do the talking yourself. If you say you\u2019re great, who\u2019s going to believe that? Of course you say you\u2019re great, you\u2019re you. If I said \u201cI\u2019m the greatest product launch consultant in the world,\u201d you\u2019d roll your eyes and say \u201cWhat a tool.\u201d  The sign of a true authority is not that they\u2019re the smartest person in a conversation, it\u2019s that they\u2019re making the conversation. They\u2019re bringing up the things no one else will talk about, they\u2019re asking the scary questions, they\u2019re putting their ass on the line by taking a stand. They\u2019re controversial (not for the sake of controversy, but because they\u2019re vocal about their stand), and the market pays attention. They\u2019re not spouting fluff on their blogs or rehashing what everyone else is saying. They are taking a stand, in a big way, on a regular basis. They are telling their audiences, \u201cTHIS is what we need to be talking about. THIS is what\u2019s important to address. Like it or not, popular or not, this needs to be said.\u201d When another big player says something that\u2019s just not right, they push back. They\u2019re willing to take that stand, voice their opinion, because it\u2019s more than just opinion, it\u2019s conviction. It\u2019s a confidence that they know better for a good reason. And again, it\u2019s not about manufactured controversy. It\u2019s about knowing your mission, and knowing how you want to change and improve your industry (or change and improve the way your customers get served), and playing full out. As I write this there are ballsy people out there who earn authority by taking their stands. Gary Vaynerchuck telling people to \u201cStop watching fucking LOST,\u201d and to build something meaningful with their passion. Rae Hoffman warning affiliate marketers that the market was due to change, and if they didn\u2019t change, they wouldn\u2019t survive. Naomi Dunford telling social media junkies that the platform\u2019s purity was gone forever, and it was their fault. Julien Smith and \u2013 well, just about every damned thing he says. These people are authorities because they\u2019re making conversations worth following. None of this \u201cNice post\u201d garbage \u2013 they\u2019re saying things no one else has the stones to say. You do the same. You\u2019ve got stones \u2013 use \u2018em.  It\u2019s easy to get it into your head that you have to \u201cpay your dues,\u201d and that becoming the Next Big Thing will take years. That thought will keep you poor as hell for a long time. I\u2019ll keep this last strategy short, because I want you to really remember it: Acknowledge how damned amazing you are,Prove it to the biggest players in your industry, andAlign with them.That\u2019s the core. That\u2019s what you need to remember. Certainly, work your way up, connect with small and mid-level people to help you grow, but not exclusively. If you want to BE an authority, you\u2019ve got to get in the sights of the other authorities in your field. You don\u2019t get labeled as \u201cA-List\u201d when most people see you with the \u201cD-List.\u201d Another important point: There\u2019s nothing wrong with the D-List. Plenty of people who aren\u2019t big players in their niche have no desire to be. Not everybody has that ambition, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s like with money \u2013 there\u2019s nothing cool about being a millionaire \u2013 if $30K a year makes you happy, then be happy. If being a small player appeals to you because it\u2019s easier, less stressful and let\u2019s you live the life you want, more power to you. But if you want to rise fast, then you have to walk in with your sights on the top from day one. If you want to be at the top in 3 years, then act like you belong there now. Not by \u201cacting\u201d (as in pretending) but by taking action as if you were already there. And that\u2019s the basics.  1. Teach a Class Before you panic: it\u2019s easier than it sounds! Check out Skillshare, a start-up focused on connecting experts in any field with people interested in learning about them. Classes can be taught locally or online, and topics range from \u201cFinancial Modeling forEntrepreneurs\u201d to \u201cLearn to Knit with Kollabora.\u201d It\u2019s a great way to position yourself as an expert and immerse yourself within a growing community of entrepreneurs that are eager to learn about what you know. 2. Guest Blog Media outlets are always looking for industry advice and insight from experts\u2014and why shouldn\u2019t that expert be you? Pitch a few publications and offer to write a series of guest blogs related to your industry. For example, if your brand is a nutrition consultancy, pitch a health blog with a series of articles focused on helping women stay fit in the winter months. If your brand builds websites, pitch a technology outlet with a blog series focused on developing APIs. Remember that the content should be focused on educating your audience on a topic\u2014not a sales pitch for your brand. 3. Join the Speaking Circuit You\u2019re likely already familiar with the conferences and events that take place within your industry. But have you spoken at any of them yet? If not, now is the time! Research the panels taking place and pitch yourself for the one most relevant to your industry (and most likely to engage your target audience). If an agenda isn\u2019t available yet, contact the event organizer and pitch your expertise, including the topics you can speak to. Keep in mind that event organizers are always looking for fresh new voices, so don\u2019t be intimidated by the roster of previous speakers. 4. Get Out and About In addition to these more organized tactics, it\u2019s just as important to meet and get connected with people in your industry. A great way to begin is by looking for localMeetups. For example, if you\u2019re a technology start-up in NYC, you should join New York Tech Meetup. If you\u2019re a beverage brand in San Francisco, check out the Bay Area Beer Socials. This allows you to network in-person, with a ready-made community eager to learn more about the industry. And who better to teach them than you! There are many powerful aspects to positioning yourself as an authority for your brand. Remember, by raising your own profile, you will, in turn, raise the profile of your company. You\u2019ll also significantly widen your reach (think about how many people read your last press releases vs. how many people could read your guest blog on theHuffington Post!). The bottom line is, people buy products from brands that they know and trust. And they\u2019ll trust you\u2014once they know where to find you. ",

            "answer_text": "Desire to know the big picture of your subject. Find the biggest pattern you can. Do not care if that does not fit present constructs. If the present systems are correct they will fit in eventually. Focus on a part that interests you most. See if you can complete that part by itself. Figure out many different ways it could fit. Find out lying parts that would make sense of one of the models you are building. Understand your view of the world may keep you from seeing obvious faults. You will think you have found a solution and get excited about it. Continue to work despite you think you cracked it. Continue to refine. It is likely flawed and if you continue to work on it, the cracks in you view will present themselves to you. It is likely you are so far from the perspective you need that you cannot get their in one jump. Work and be honest to yourself. Seek the truth foremost on your mind. Always be willing to let go of your pet theories and accept the failure of a construct for the reality. If you work at it, after many constructs taking you step by step closer to a model that fits the biggest picture. Look for the cracks. They will become visible in time if you look. I found it takes more effort to find the evidence and data hidden from view than anything else. Most of the time someone offers it as a mere off hand remark. Important data does not fit theory so they do not give it much importance. If you find that there is a gap in your picture, think on it constantly and most importantly dream about solutions. I only need 3 or 4 data points put the big picture together. Most of my solutions came to me in dreams and I remembered them after awakening from sleep in the morning. Get a dream journal and write all your dreams down after waking. It will help you to remember more of them. You can only hold one worldview in your head. Changing it is almost impossible. Most people cannot even if they are dead wrong and know it. They cannot change so they pretend to themselves that they are right. Give few things absoluteness and be willing to give them up if you need to. Allow yourself to fit new things into your worldview. Most people cannot do this. Understand your beliefs are your perception. Beliefs determine what you see. Literally. Be careful in choosing your beliefs. They can blind you to obvious truths. You chose your worldview at age 12\u201315. You never change your fundamental view but it is like a box that you empty out every 10 years and replace them with new ideas. However, at age 55 you finally accept that you never knew anything if you are wise. That makes before your choice and after 55, if you are wise, the most flexible period of your life. Most do their important fundamental work before 25 when the mind is fast and most capable. Understand everything is consciousness so meditation is the greatest discipline you can do for the deepest and greatest work. Half an hour a day minimum best done in the morning because it sets the day for success. If you want to remove blocks to your success, do spiritual energy work CDM: Grounding, centering, running body energy, creating and destroying roses. All the above helps you discover. It does not help you communicate what you have discovered. To overcome resistance to truths understand that everything is about status. Both individuals and organizations are about status. Those entities do not care about truth or you. They have status and you do not so they are not going to give it to you for nothing. Irrationalities are what give ideas long term stability because it is impossible to solve an irrationality by rational methods. They can only be removed out of the system, which if it is a basic premise of a theory would destroy the institutions power and STATUS. The herd instinct is not going away anytime soon and magazines do not want articles that end the need for the magazine. They only want articles that increase attention and money for the ongoing magazine. The publisher never finds time or accepts the paper that finishes the need the magazine was created for. Your only chance is art that can punch authority repeatedly out in the open to give up its irrationals for what any 8 year old can know as an understandable concept. ",

            "answer_text": "A high-quality research should be based upon a good research question. You should ask a question that is measurable with scientific research techniques like observation, experiment, survey, deep interviews etc. These techniques may vary according to the research question you ask. If you ask what is the average of temperature a person experiences during a road trip from point A to B? Before you go out and try answering this research question, you should answer some more questions. Is this question really the one that conveys the true aim of my research?Does this research question adequately limit the parameters of my research?Why should we ask these questions about our research question? Because, for starters, we did not point out the type of vehicle that is going to be used during this road trip. Why is it important? : Because it can affect the measurement of temperature variation during the trip. If we use a motorcycle the temperature measurement during the road trip will be different than the measurement in a bus. So it might be a good idea to mention the type of vehicle we wil use in the research question. If we are going to use a motorcycle, then the speed of the vehicle will also be a factor in determining the temperature. So we might want to add that too.. How are we going to measure the temperature? Via a thermometer? Or are we going to ask the person how s/he perceives the temperature? Because we asked in the research question \u201cthe average of temperature a person experiences during the trip\u201d. What exactly do we mean by \u201cthe experience\u201d? How are we going to measure it? What type of a person will it be? Is gender, weight, height, ethnicity, living place, eating habits important to you? Why? Why not?\u2026 If it is important the person(s)\u2019 characteristics should also be included\u2026 We can add tons of additional considerations about the research question at hand. Clearly, the research question at the beginning is not a precise enough research question and a good research question is THE most important thing to ensure the quality of scientific research. A good research question defines the \u201cparameters\u201d of research as precisely as possible and limits the research so the measurements are meaningful. Don\u2019t forget, when it comes to scientific research, \u201csmall is beautiful\u201d. Whenever you can, you should define the parameters of your research and draw the limits of it as precisely as possible. The rest will come when you come up with a precise enough research question. Good luck\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Originally Answered: How do I excel as a research assistant? Typically being a research assistant is the bottom of the food chain as far as having rank in science. Nonetheless, it's an essential introduction to how research is done. The first lesson is probably not to waste your advisor's time. The reason I say this is that advisors really appreciate it when you realize they are busy and you don't take their time for granted. The small things will make a big difference. Leave e-mails short, don't chit-chat too long, ask the grad students and post-docs first when you're not sure of something, and don't stumble into their office without notice unless it's something brief or urgent. Listen, rather than speak. If you want to impress your advisor, do it by having good questions rather than trying to show off your knowledge. Advisors vary. Some will treat you like a first-year grad student and spend hours every week with you to work on a meaningful project. Others will fail to notice that you exist, and leave it to graduate students and post-docs to make sure you're useful to them. Sometimes, the graduate students and post-docs don't even know how to make use of you and you're left not knowing what to do. That makes the most important thing to do in the lab also the most difficult, which is to make yourself useful. Focus first on learning the basic technical things that need to be done to move research forward. Understanding the theory will come later, but it definitely will come. In the end, learning from doing will be much more beneficial than learning in a classroom. ",

            "answer_text": "It is all about blind spots. Did you hear that there are present blind spots where we do not see any cars while driving? Be aware of the fact that we researchers do have such blind spots as well during our research! We researchers are often \u2018driving' on research highways automatically without realizing that in this specific situation something is hiding from us. When a researcher realizes the existence of such blind spots, he can save a lot of effort and directly go for good results.  Picture: The presence of blind spots while driving (Apa itu ''Blind Spot\" ). Unlike of driving a car, those blind spots in science have nothing to do with mirrors. They are more socially induced. We, humans, are subconsciously following the heard. It is our innate tendency because it saved lives when we were living in savannas full of predators. Now, in this time and age, this tendency becomes often a burden. Why is it so? We subconsciously follow what we were taught by our parents, teacher, and peers. This often leads to a blind spot while we do a research. A vise idea is to look for blind spots of other researchers while we are entering a new field. It is much more difficult to see our own blind spots. In my own research, I found this principle after a thorough thinking about how to tackle problems that seems to be impenetrable from the first, second, and even third sight. Finally, the ability to learn from mistakes of others and even from mistakes of whole scientific disciplines enabled me to get quickly to the core of the solved problem. There is one obstacle for researchers who discover such blind spots. They have to fight for convincing others about the vitality of the approach. Other researchers are often defending their understanding of the problem and often can try to silence new ideas, theories, and discoveries. Good luck with your research :-) ",

By flipping the dynamic of how the dependent variable will correlate with the independent ones utilizing relative theory of concepts while having the insight to predict and hypothesize with far more capability to leave far less erroneous junk and errors to produce worthless data or conclusion that cannot and will not be used in practice. There is something called the bait and switch among higher ends of psychology that does not implement actions developed from a marketing or sales pitch, but more from a stance of human behavior and psychiatric dynamics. Inter-exchanging between the observer/studier and the studied becomes synced when interjecting what is being studied yet knowing the tactics or methods how independent variables (millions) can effect just one dependent variable.

Some areas to consider for deliberate practice in the arena of research: Building your observational skillsExperimental designFormulating questionsSummarization of resultsDrawing conclusionsProposal writingFinding information in the existing literatureThese are just a few of the areas you can concentrate on as a means of improving your ability to do research. To improve, you can work with an experienced researcher, and ask them some of the ways they undertake these practice areas. For example, ask: What are some of the elements you pay attention to as you gather your observations? As a next step then talk about ways you could put some of these ideas into practice. Finally, take time to reflect on what you tried \u2026 What worked? \u2026 What could be improved? Etc.

There are a million things that probably we don\u2019t know and embracing this reality is the first step. Secondly, Bring in clarity - when you start a research, it may be possible that you see a lot of avenues and may be most of them lead to different ends. One must be clear as to what the purpose of the research is. Purpose known is as good as research half done. Thirdly, learn to eat the chocolate mountain - understand that the research is like a big mountain of chocolate, even if love chocolates, you can\u2019t eat the entire in one go. So, how do you eat it? Bite by bite. That is exactly how you should proceed in your research. One step at a time. Finally, be curious - learning is defined as being able to explain the complex things in the most simple manner. Such learning comes by being curious. This very well applies to Research.

Here\u2019s a crib sheet: Think about a problem or area of interest. Discuss it. Plan to observe it with serious attention. Ask your question(s). See what answers may be available outside of the study and in. WRITE!!! SHARE!!! Listen to the feedback you get and do it again. I leave it to others to provide traditional answers to the question, but this is a good back of the napkin approach. It differs considerably between research philosophies. Realist vs Constructionist, and as to whether or not you think objectivity is possible, as well as any number of perspectives. Don\u2019t believe anyone who tries to tell you there\u2019s a right way or a wrong way. Read Bruno Latour\u2019s work in the area of philosophy of science for some alternative thinking on how science is done :) ",

That includes the cycle: Plan the question to ask and the research protocol.Use the protocol to do the research, religiously following the protocol start to finish.Analyze the results of the research to reach a conclusion.Answer whether the research process was successful.If successful, plan another experiment and you are on the way to getting better at research. If not successful, ask why not. Was the planning sufficient? Was the protocol adequate for the experiment? Could the data resulting be analyzed conclusively? Answering these questions may suggest what you need to adjust. Perhaps you need to read about experimental design and/or analysis. In any event you will need to continue trying to do research until the above steps are pleasing to you and to a friendly critic, who could be an invaluable aid in suggesting what might have gone right or wrong. Communication of your results to a colleague is essential in learning how to do better experiments. Embrace your critics! They could be your best friends in learning to be a better researcher. ",

            "answer_text": "Like a newspaper journalist, there are issues out there that you can research on, especially those who do research for development purpose. E.G. The word development is such a big word. break it down. is it human development you want to look at, Physical- infrastructural such as roads and bridges, mining areas, areas where there are possibilities of finding gold, gas, copper etc? What sort of development or psychological? Most times lecturers guide you. That is why they screen students who apply to do masters degrees first. then they move on to doing your PhD or Doctor of education etc. In a PhD you only look at a very specific issue/problem/hypothesis and then you look for more information to prove your hypothesis. Whereas in Doctor of education you look at a broader spectrum so you are more informed of what is happening around you including understanding human psychology. Research means you have to be prepared to read a lot. ",

To add to the \"specialist skills\" mostly described so far, I'd like to add that great design researchers need to be great mentors, facilitators, and collaborators, more so perhaps than other UX roles. In such a role the design researcher would focus on doing actual research using the many technique available on \"hard \"projects, but also empower non-specialists to do simpler research on \"easier\" projects. A great way to get started is to review Google Ventures collaborative design processes, like the research sprint. ",
