            "answer_text": "Online video lectures are better than offline lectures. I\u2019ll tell you why, lets talk about cost, For example Resonance costs around 1.4 lac for a repeater student. Small coaching institutes which aren't in Kota or the local ones cost much less but then there's question of quality.Here's the list of fee of major coaching institutes for JEE MAINS+ ADVANCED courses for 2 year. ALLEN it is nearly 225000 Resonance it is 245000 Bansal it is 200000 Fiitjee it is 210000 Career point 210000 Motion it is 200000 Vibrant it is 225000 We all know that best coaching institutes for JEE are in Kota but the main problem is that it costs way too much. It's not just the coaching fee but the living expenses too. For a middle class family it's very hard for them to send their children to one of these institutes. There are several other challenges that students face in Kota other than financial challenges. After spending this huge amount of money on child parent's expectations are too damn high and the pressure falls on the students. Many students face problems with matching with the pace of the teachers as well as those toppers. Workload is too much on students and being away from home makes you homesick and due to this much workload and the highly competitive environment students get too much pressurized. There's a good solution to all these problems and that's e-learning.Maybe in the past it wasn't available to everyone. But now everybody is part of this modern world of technology. One needs to utilize all these resources available there in the best way possible. Instead of going to these big coaching institutes and facing all those problems you can easily go for e-learning. Trust me it's reliable if used in proper way. When I say e-learning most of students go start searching on YouTube. YouTube is good.. it's great but you can't go for it when you're working for something like JEE. I'll tell you why because when you search for any topic on YouTube you don't get relevant results easily and most of the time is spent on searching. Another thing is you don't know what's relevant and what's not. You don't know how to study for it. First of all make a note of the syllabus. So instead of being a prey to YouTube go for Kaysons video lectures.  I'll tell you why? Because these are the best currently. They got highly experienced teachers who are IITians themselves and are working in this field for very long. They know exactly what needs to served to a JEE aspirant. They get you a proper planner to plan your studies and that is way too important than you think. These video lectures are made especially for IIT JEE and teachers have explained each and every topic in very detail so that nothing's left. Each topic is not just explained in depth but in a very easy and understandable manner also. Getting these lectures will clear your concepts and you'll have your basics strong as we all know JEE is about how well you know the concepts. So it's very important to understand the concept before jumping for the questions.There are not just video lectures, they got everything covered , complete study material for a JEE aspirant. Complete set of questions with solutions are provided for a good practice. Previous year question papers are also available there along with the solutions . You need to use these videos lectures and questions provided very wisely. Watch the lectures ask doubts. Don't leave your doubts uncleared. Solve as much questions as possible, practice is key to success. Best of luck!! ",
