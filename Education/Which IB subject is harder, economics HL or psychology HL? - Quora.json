            "answer_text": "I have experienced Econ HL myself, but I have no experience in Psychology, so I\u2019ll just name the example of a guy that I knew. He studied at one of the British schools that offered IB for his first year of the program. During this time he took Psychology HL. I remember him complaining how difficult it would get sometimes, and how much material there was to learn. Then, he transferred to our school in his second year, but our school doesn\u2019t offer Psychology at all. So he had a big decision to make: to either take Economics or History. Naturally, he took Economics at HL instead of Psychology. He had hell of a time, since he had to cover the economics HL material meant for 2 years in the months between September and May, for his final exams. Long story short, he studied really hard, and he was often present in our Econ classes (I was Y1 at the time), to study up on the first year material more. He finished with a 5 in the end, which is pretty amazing in my opinion, considering his situation. So yeah, if I had to choose, I\u2019d say psychology is harder. Having studied economics myself, I can say it wasn\u2019t very difficult, compared to some other subjects. ",

            "answer_text": "1000% psychology HL. it\u2019s way more volume and way more extensive at least according to the information you need to know. For eco it\u2019s about concepts. once you grasp that you\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s also way harder to score a 7 is psychology than it is in economics. ",
