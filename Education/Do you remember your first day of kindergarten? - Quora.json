            "answer_text": "I went to three kindergartens\u2026 the first one was handled by an old lady. I remember my first day at my first kindergarten. Mom and dad\u2019s Mom came to drop me off and as soon as the lady tried to bring me inside the classroom, I just hugged my Mom and refused to let go, shouting and crying and pleading Mom to take me home. The lady kindly took me in her arms and told my Mom to go, that I would be alright. By this time, Mom had also started crying and Dad\u2019s Mom nearly had to pull her back home. I stopped crying and the lady made me sit in a chair. All the fear and tears vanished in less than a second and being the bubbly little girl that I was, I started to chat with everyone and asked their names, what were their favourite hobbies\u2026 etc. The old lady tried to teach me the alphabets, so she held my hand and made me draw an \u2018o\u2019 and add a tail to it, she turned for about five minutes to attend to another kid and when she reported her attention back on me, I had already finished writing \u2018z\u2019 and asked her if I should write the numbers \u20181 - 100\u2019 also. She was completely surprised and impressed. She thought that my Mom had lied and that I had already been to another kindergarten before landing at hers. She told that to my uncle, who then had to explain that my Mom had already taught me everything that I needed to know. She just wanted me to mingle with other kids in order to better develop my personality. Moreover, there weren\u2019t many kids where I lived. I was the first grand-child, surrounded by thirteen adults, uncles, aunts, grandpa etc\u2026 but no kids to play with. Mom was a kindergarten teacher before she married Dad and left her job. So, she had already undertaken the responsibility of my education. She was just sad when she saw that I had no friends of my age, that\u2019s why I was sent to kindergarten. Even then, the lady refused to believe my uncle. One fine day, we learned that the old lady had passed away due to natural causes. We were then transferred to another kindergarten in the same locality. Things were running smoothly there too, until Dad got ill and we shifted to another place. I was then transferred to my third and last kindergarten, and from there, life took another turn\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, i do. I remember my grandfather dropping me of at the school gate. I cried almost all day. This was my first time away from my family, amongst grownups, and kids, and i knew no one. I remember someone held my hand, and took me to my class. I was asked to sit on a wooden chair, which was at one side of a square. There were seven other kids around that table, which was painted green, the remaining tables in the class were red, blue, brown, gray etc. While still crying, i looked on both sides and four out-of-eight were crying. All of them, looked at me, and continued with whatever they were doing. I turned to one guy who was sitting next to me. He was about my height, my frame, and was crying too. We looked at each other, and i dont remember whether we exchanged any words or not, but we smiled at each other. Stopped crying, and leaned on each other for the rest of the day. At the end of the day, i was so relieved to see my grandfather waiting on a bench under the tree by the school yard. I ran to him, he picked me up, asked me how i was, and then we went home. The next day, we went to school, and there he was, the kid from class, who sat next to me yesterday. We held each other\u2019s hand at the gate, and walked to our class. No more crying, no fuss. Once in the class, we got to our desk, and sat there. I told him my name, he told me his, Sanjay Singh. And, that my friends was the beginning of a beautiful friendship that has lasted to this day. Sanjay is my first, and oldest friend in this world. Many have come and gone since, but he\u2019s still a friend whom i can talk to when i want, even though we\u2019re almost 20K miles apart. His wife passed away recently, and i\u2019m Sad that that I couldn\u2019t be there for him. The time, when he needed me, and i was too far away. ",

            "answer_text": "I was a precious baby angel in LKG.  Somehow my hair turned brown for UKG.  I remember our teacher asking everyone to read a small sentence on the first day, a secret test to see if any of us had learned how. When it came to my turn, I asked if I could read alone instead. She said I must try out loud first. I read the entire paragraph without struggle and she later contacted my parents and the principal to see about moving me straight to first grade. But I was rejected for early promotion, with the explanation that I was too shy. Ya. Too shy. Rubbish, eh? But it was true. I never spoke to my classmates. I learned their names only when they were being scolded. While everyone else learned to read, I studied addition alone and sometimes fingerpainted when I got bored. I'll upload the class photo when I get home in like 20 minutes.  ",

I waved goodbye to my mother and immediately began playing with the other children. Shortly after that a boy showed up with his mother. He clung to her and it was obvious that he was terrified. When his mother tried to leave he began crying inconsolably. For the life of me I couldn\u2019t figure out why this was so upsetting. I went over to him and began excitedly telling him that there was dirt INSIDE that we could play with! Instinctively, I knew to keep him distracted long enough for his mother to be able to slip away unnoticed. It wasn\u2019t until many years later that it occurred to me that the reason this was so traumatizing for him was that it was probably the first time he\u2019d been away from his mother for an extended period of time. I had been in daycare for most of my life so having my mother leave on the first day of kindergarten wasn\u2019t much different than any other day save the setting. ",

I went the first day and when I came home I declared, \u201cthat was nice but I see no reason to go back.\u201d I was stubborn on the matter. I was sickly child and was not allowed to play with other children. I had already learned to read, print my letters, add, subtract, etc. But, at kindergarten the teacher expected me to \u201cplay with the other children.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to and she made me. My Dad realized that I was just a frightened little girl who was out of her depth. So he picked a small ceramic rabbit that he had brought home from Japan after WWII and told to keep it in my pocket and the it would keep me safe on my second day. The second day was better. When I defended my dissertation, that small ceramic rabbit was in my pocket and clutched just as tight as I did day two of kindergarten. ",

This other little boy brought, of all the things, a briefcase. The Nun says, \u201cHand over the briefcase.\u201d The kid said no. She grabs the briefcase and they start fighting over it, to the point where she\u2019s lifted the briefcase up so high that the kid\u2019s legs are dangling in the air. The kid finally loses his grip and the Nun tells him to go to his desk. He does but he refuses to sit down. So what does the Nun do? She tells him that there is a terrible disease that kills little boys who stand up for too long and the kid believed her and sat down. The Nuns could play rough. But from everything I\u2019ve heard the Brothers were far worse. Those kids got a real good education but they suffered for it. ",
