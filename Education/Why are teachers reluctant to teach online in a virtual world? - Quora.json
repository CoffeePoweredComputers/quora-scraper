            "answer_text": "Many professionals who work in education (such as teachers and professors) can be convinced by research.  I administer and promote online education (at the university level), and many or even most on-ground instructors are interested in expanding their practice through online teaching.  So about \"virtual worlds,\" my question would be whether its use in an online classroom does an adequate job of meeting students' learning outcomes.  Or if you are suggesting a research project?  Then it would seem that faculty in an education department might suggest graduates to participate in the project. ",
