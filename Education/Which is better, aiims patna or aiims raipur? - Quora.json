            "answer_text": "Since I am a student at aiims raipur, I can say a lot about it. But yes cannot compare with the Patna aiims, as I have never gone there. During my counselling, I had even Aiims Patna in option, but I chose Aiims Raipur because people suggested me that it's a safer place than Patna. However, I can really assure you that the Academics at aiims raipur is awesome. The faculties are really dedicated. They come up with innovative ideas to rescue us from the loads of studies. The accommodation : First year mbbs students are given 3 bhk flats with 5 students sharing it, where 3 students get single rooms with one bathroom and the other two share the bigger room with attached bathroom. Facilities like hot water, 24 hr water supply are available. Even the college is slowly marching towards organizing functions for various occasions. We witness marathon, dance events, streetplays, and all sorts of cultural and sports activities. ",
