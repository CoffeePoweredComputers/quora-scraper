You will need excellent English - while some universities or courrses may set a slightly lower bar than others for proficiency, that doesn\u2019t mean they will go out of their way to make their courses easier for non-native speakers than those that require a higher standard . I think you might want to decide what you want to study and work on from there; not all NZ universities offer every subject and knowing what you wnat to study may make your choices a bit clearer. None of the univeristues are easy to get into and none are especially diffcult. However, access to many courses is competitive so getting into one of those will be much more difficult. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Keep in mind that there are different entry requirements depending on your program, level of study, or the institution. Generally, universities tend to be more expensive than polytechnics and private training establishments (PTEs). In terms of quality, universities would rank higher than polytechnics and PTEs. Keep in mind that New Zealand tertiary fees for international students are expensive. You often end up paying four or five times the amount of domestic students. For example, one year of a BA degree may cost NZ$20,000 while one year of a medical or engineering degree may cost NZ$50\u201370,000. I would advise you to visit the websites of the universities, polytechnics, and private training establishment. Here are a list of NZ universities, polytechnics, and PTEs: https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/universitiesPolytechnics and Institutes of TechnologyList of Private Training Establishments (PTEs) in New ZealandHope this helps.
