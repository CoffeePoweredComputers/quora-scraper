            "answer_text": "This is such a common and such a hard question. You want to do well for your child, you also want him/her to be happy. I have long maintained that it is possible for some children to get a third-rate education at a first-rate school or university. The reverse is also possible. Go to the school where you like the atmosphere, ethos, the head/principal. The program has to be good, and the school should show signs of good maintenance and management - but it doesn\u2019t have to be swimming in money. How much litter and graffiti is there? What does the artwork look like? The written work? If you can, visit the school when it\u2019s in session (with your child). That will tell you what you need to know. You will see if the discipline is good, if there is an atmosphere for learning. Find out about extra-curricular activities and sports, and enrichment programmes. At my secondary school, we do a comprehensive survey of visiting parents looking for a school for their 11 year-olds. Number one on the list of what they are looking for is atmosphere/ethos. Exam results is consistently in eighth (EIGHTH!) place. That will change as their children get near their exams, but at 11, they want them to be safe and happy. Good luck! ",
