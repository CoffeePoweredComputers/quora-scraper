            "answer_text": "I'm afraid I have to say something which you may not like it. Most probably you lack compelling, inspiring and  overarching long-range goals and  objectives, broken down into  short-term, medium-term, and long-term  perspectives and covering all  the major life dimensions, with academic  pursuit (as your top priority); mental development;  physical health; financial health; family  relationships; social  networking; recreational ventures (including  hobbies, interests,  sports, vacations, etc.); and even spiritual  development (including  contributions to society, volunteering, etc.),  followed by a systematic  game plan, in your life. Goals, priorities and a plan set your direction and direct your focus on the things, like academic pursuit, that matter to you the most. Without them, you are a boat in the ocean, at the mercy of environmental forces with their dynamics. Goals, priorities and a plan,  are like precise commands preset into the flight plan of a Tomahawk cruise missile, homing on to a predefined, long-distance target, to use a military target. Assuming that you have set long-range goals and objectives, but you have not translate them into specific, prioritised and executable tasks which you need to accomplish daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and even annually [in essence, this is your game plan],  while in hot pursuit of your desired outcomes or cherished dreams, you are not much that different. Meanwhile, I like to leave this elegant and inspiring quote as food for thought:   Think about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Raksha! My guess? You can\u2019t study because you don\u2019t know how. Re-reading a textbook is not the same as studying. In fact, it\u2019s anti-studying. Here\u2019s the reason: reading something more than once is so boring, your brain refuses to do it. Really! Your mind will wander and you\u2019ll start wondering what\u2019s for dinner or whether your friend texted you back or if any Pokemon had spawned outside while you were sitting there. Next thing you know, you are at the bottom of the page or the end of the chapter with no idea what you just read. A complete waste of your precious time! Worse yet, re-reading leads to \u201cfamiliarity\u201d which is not the same as understanding. Have you ever read a test question and \u201cKnew\u201d you knew the answer you just couldn\u2019t think of it? That\u2019s familiarity. That\u2019s your brain saying, \u201cOh! Right! Photosynthesis! I know this one!\u201d when you really haven\u2019t learned anything about photosynthesis or the concept it represents. This is why re-reading is anti-studying. Reading the words over and over produces familiarity, which makes it feel like you\u2019ve learned things when you really haven\u2019t. So, what should you do instead? Rework your notes right after class. In college this is easier; in high school this means you should spend 5\u201310 minutes every night going over your notes, adding things you forgot to write down or didn\u2019t write completely enough. Summarize key concepts. Draw diagrams to show how ideas work together, especially today\u2019s ideas with ideas from previous lectures or from your textbook. Everything in class should work together. If it doesn\u2019t, you need to ask the teacher for some guidance to help you understand what those connections are. Use a note-taking method like Cornell notes or SQ3R, which give you a structure for engaging with your notes once class is over. Use your Cornell notes to write summaries of the concepts and create study questions you can use to quiz yourself on the material. Use SQ3R to attack your textbook chapters, developing questions first and then going on a treasure hunt through the chapter for the answers. (The benefit of using SQ3R is you end up with a tidy stack of flashcards you can use to quiz yourself later. You can even SQ3R your lecture notes after class if you really like the technique.) You should also have a set time and place each day to do this homework. This is hard to do if you haven\u2019t done it before, but well worth the effort. If you go to the library every day at 5pm to do homework, for example, eventually (after about a month of doing this daily) your mind will settle into study mode as soon as you sit down. No more fighting your wandering attention for ten minutes to make it focus on your books. Having a specific plan of action for your study period (Rework history notes, 10 min; rework chem notes, 10 min.; write up chemistry experiment 1, 20 minutes, rework English notes, 10 min.; English chapter 2\u20133, 40 minutes, etc.) will help your focus, too. A note about long-term assignments: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this before, but you need to break down long-term assignments like research papers or projects into discrete tasks and then add those tasks to your daily study list. That chemistry lab report might be part of a larger unit packet or science fair project, yet your assignment (to yourself) for the day is just that 20 minutes write-up. Easy peasy! No more cramming at the last minute if you know your brain will be ready to study at 5pm every day (or whenever fits your schedule). I hope this helps! ",
