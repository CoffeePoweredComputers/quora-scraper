            "answer_text": "You seem to be assuming that the assessment you took is an accurate guage of your skill level. Firstly, I'd like to point out that your scores are only indicative of your ability to complete the specific skillset that the questions were assuming you might know. Assessments are, in my opinion, highly less valuable than personal introspection at understanding yourself. Skills come with practice. People are not exactly born with predetermined abilities towards mathematics or language. You gain skill in the things you practice - and you probably practice things you enjoy or that are in some way rewarding. Maths takes practice just like language does. In fact, maths assessments have the prerequisite of learning mathematical 'language' to be able to even interpret or answer the question. Language is used much more often than mathematics in daily life. Are you skilled at knowing grammatical rules, or are you skilled at writing in an emotionally valuable way? Are you persuasive, inspirational? Are you good at deriving the deeper meaning of literature? Are you able to analyse the intent of a writer? Construct an consice and unambiguous piece of writing? Skills in English are many and varied. What does the assessment actually tell you about your ability to use the English language? In what way do you use it well? Equally, scoring lowly on a mathematics test doesn't necessarily mean you aren't good at maths. Mathematics is based on skills in logic. Like language, logic is used necessarily in everyday life. When deciding what to do with your day, you're comparing the several potential future outcomes of what you logically predict would happen as a result of your perceived potential actions and logically evaluating what is the most desirable and achievable to you. if you are thinking about how to interpret a friends feelings, you are calculating the most likely state of mind as indicated by their outward behaviours and your own personal experience. These skills are essentially the same when applied to mathematics, but you need to learn the language of mathematics and develop your experience in mathematics for you to use that skill numerically in the way the assessment might have been testing. Problem solving can be truly fun and interesting, and has many applications. Numbers are just one reliable way to develop logic. ",

            "answer_text": "English requires deeper thinking and interpreting the language, while a part of math is following certain patterns and memorizing formulas. Different parts of the brain are responsible for different aspects. Some areas are naturally less developed than others, so they affect your performance in various subjects, like math and English. ",
