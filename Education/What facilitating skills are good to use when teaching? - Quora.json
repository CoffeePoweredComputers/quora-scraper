            "answer_text": "It depends on the teacher. i had/have a friend who taught in a different room from me. We both had PhD\u2019s and had decided to teach YOUNG children (ie. up to 11 years) We both had different methods. He was exploratory, I was strict if somewhat personally untidy! My head teacher used to tidy my room somewhat , but she both gave us difficult children. What I am going to suggest is that, like cooking, teachers make their own methods: methods that work for them. You are not a painter drawing with paint : neither are artists. You have to understand, Later on the pupils left my school and grew older and they used to come round to my house to see me and bring their girlfriends/boyfriends. I never expected that: they saw me as some sort of family. In the end I have taught from 5 to maybe 25: first school to University (where I taught Maths) It\u2019s a question of trying to understand your pupils (any age) : a skill, who knows? You have to be patient and in command. As I write this I have had a flash of understanding . . . it\u2019s not so different from teaching a dog. I had a dachshund puppy with a bent spine (at birth) the breeder didn\u2019t want to sell her. I was definite and she suggested that I could teach her to beg as it might help. Yes it worked, but sometimes the dog would walk on two back legs to see things. I never taught her that!! A good skill is one where you don\u2019t know how far it will take you (dogs as well as humans!) ",

            "answer_text": "Facilitating is about guiding and mentoring - not directing. A facilitator is a guide to help people move through a process together, not the seat of wisdom and knowledge. That means a facilitator isn't there to give opinions, but to draw out opinions and ideas of the group members.Facilitation focuses on how people participate in the process of learning or planning, not just on what gets achievedA facilitator is neutral and never takes sidesSo the skills one would need to facilitate is patience, strong listening skills, the ability to either be the scribe of the discussion or assign the role, strong observations skills in intrapersonal communications and interpersonal communications so that the facilitator can read how the group and it\u2019s members are processing, finally tolerance. A facilitator cannot take sides so they must be open minded and allow all viewpoints and opinions to exist. ",
