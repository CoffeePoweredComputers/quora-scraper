            "answer_text": "Many of the Public universities in the USA require a freshman applicant to list an intended major and Apply for that major. Indeed, an admission is for the department within the college. One of my sons applied to the University of Delaware as a Mechanical Engineering student and was admitted to the Mechanical Engineering department. NOTE: Even at some private universities, one may have to apply for a specialty: My other son attended Villanova as a business student but had to apply directly for the business schoolI believe being a business student at UPenn means that you apply directly to Wharton to be a freshmanMany nursing students must apply to be a nursing student at many collegesMost art and performing arts students have to apply directly to an arts or performing arts programHowever a STEM university like MIT or Caltech only requires you to apply to the university, and you choose a major before the start of sophomore year. On the other hand, Cornell University has five undergraduate colleges, and you must apply to the College. Similarly. Columbia University has (I believe) two undergraduate colleges and you apply to the college. There are many variations across the USA and you have to read the admissions web sites very carefully. ",
