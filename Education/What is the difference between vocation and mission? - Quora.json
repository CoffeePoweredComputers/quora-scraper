            "answer_text": "Vocation is literally your \"calling\", what you are good for or destined for. It usually is a property/talent/predisposition of your person. A mission, in contrast, is a particular task given to you. Even if you are on \"a mission from God\", there may be retirement from it eventually. If you take as an example biblical prophets, usually their vocation was being a prophet. But their missions were more concrete, like warning the town of Ninive. Most prophets were given a number of missions. ",
