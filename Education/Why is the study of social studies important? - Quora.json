            "answer_text": "Social studies is the study about our past , the economic conditions of our country, the political system that we our bound to and the sorroundings that we live in . People often say \u2018history repeats itself ' but if we learn history and study the success and failures of the past we may ideally be able to learn from our mistakes and avoid repeating them in the future . In a world were politics is riddled with corruption and where democracy is a lie, We learn politics to understand the system of the world around us, to be able to make informed choices, to know the role we play in the system and to gain a rich understanding of how the world works and why it works that way. In a world of income inequality and limited resources, We learn ecnomics as it is concerned with healping individuals and the society and to decide on the proper allocation of our limited resources. We learn geography to learn and understand the principles and phenomenon that effect our everyday life . To learn about different cultures and traditions and to gain a better understanding of our society And thus learning social studies makes a student an asset for his country and helps him in serving the society better. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "In social studies students learn how issues in history and society have been resonded to. They learn of mistakes that have been made in the past and the consequences of those mistakes, whether it be in history, economics, psychology, etc. The point is that we should learn from previous experiences and societies\u2019 interpretations of their responses. Isn\u2019t it better to learn from the record of experience so that we as a society grow from our knowledge of the outcomes of previous experiences? Hopefully, we enable future generations to avoid past mistakes. As the saying goes, \u201cThose who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are bound to repeat them.\u201dAdditionally, societies can be very diverse from one anothet. In this day and age, it is important that students leaving high school and college get grounded in the fact that the \u201cworld does not revolve around them and their personal experiences.\u201d The social sciences serve to enhance the understandings of students about the world beyond their immediate experiences. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of our planet\u2019s and its inhabitants\u2019 survival.",
