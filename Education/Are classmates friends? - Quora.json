            "answer_text": "Interesting way to frame your question. The headline, in big print, is \u201cAre classmates friends?\u201d And the obvious answer to that is, some are, some are enemies, some are frenemies, and most are simply benignly coexisting. But then in the small print, you give details of a highly specific and personal nature, about someone you think of as a friend and enjoy doing things with, only to find that he doesn\u2019t view your relationship the same as you do. That\u2019s understandably a shock. But then you set up a false dilemma: is it normal, or is it just him being a fake person? Gentle reader, why would you conclude that he\u2019s being a fake person? He has told you with stark truth and utter clarity exactly where you stand with him. In what way can you consider that fake? You don\u2019t have to be fast friends to play games or hang out in school. You can be just acquaintances\u2014like he said. Is his approach to school mates normal? I don\u2019t know\u2014I kind of suspect not. I think most people would tend to form attachments to the people they most enjoy spending time with, and detachments from those whom they don\u2019t. But whether a behavior is normal is really kind of a pointless question. Normal is a rather low bar to begin with, and normal is kind of boring, really. I prefer people with refreshing, unusual approaches to life. I can learn so much more from them than I can those who value conformance to the norm above all other considerations. In summary, I would say that your acquaintance\u2019s behavior is a little askew from normal, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s being a fake person at all. I think you made an unwarranted assumption about his emotional attachment to you, and when you found out you were wrong, you assigned the responsibility for your hurt feelings to him, who never lied to you, instead of to yourself, the person who actually made the bad assumption.

            "answer_text": "Classmates, in their majority, tend not to be friends. Think about it \u2014 how often can you hang out with all 30+ people in your class? That being said, your question seems to have less to do with the fact that you two are classmates and more with the fact that although you two have spent copious amounts of time together, he doesn't consider you a friend. That can be frustrating, certainly, but some people are like that. It is not \u201cnormal\u201d in the sense that it is not the norm, but there are certainly students who want to keep their school and personal lives separate. In other words, he's not being fake (even though it's not common for classmates to act like that), he may just not want friends in school. That can be difficult for many people to understand, but perhaps he has some trauma from his past or at home that he feels people at school or elsewhere wouldn't understand. ",

            "answer_text": "He might be fake\u2026 he also might be telling the truth, he might be an unusual sort of person who doesn't feel like he can be friends with anyone. If that's the case then dont take it personally because he's that way to everyone. Also, to your original question, no not everyone is like that. Most people who have friends in school consider those people as friends in general. ",
