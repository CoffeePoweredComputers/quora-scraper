You are trying to convince the reader your thesis is worth the read. It\u2019s like you are leading a drunk person through a maze. They might not want to go where you are leading them but you gotta be super smooth and convince them. Make them believe why there had to be thesis done on your topic. Moreover, convince them why your approach was the best one. I have never seen anyone write this effectively on a first draft. So after your first draft, think about your angle an the story you want to tell and rewrite. This second draft should be tight and smooth enough to lead the mot unruly drunk person. ",

Don\u2019t filter based on what you think fits the background; just read. As you read, you annotate the research. What is the problem? The purpose? Their background? What\u2019s good and bad? Results? Lastly, you write. Well, in some sense you\u2019ve already written because you annotated. As well, annotation forces synthesis. Now, as you write the actual background you can filter. ",
