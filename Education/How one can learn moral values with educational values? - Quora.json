Now, the simple answer to the question, as I think, is contained in the above few lines. That is to say that, \u2018EDUCATION' IS BASED ON 'TRUE VALUES, i.e. TRUTH itself. Irrespective of any 'branch', 'part', \u2018 mode ' or 'method' of EDUCATION; irrespective of the 'various' 'benifits \u2018, obtained from the 'learning the various \u2018subjects\u2019 of EDUCATION, \u2018THE FIRST AND THE FOREMOST MESSAGE , or, LESSON, FROM ANY TYPE OF 'EDUCATION', IS THAT- WORLD WILL FLOURISH ONLY ON THE LINES OF 'TRUTHFULNESS AND INTELLECTUAL HONEST'. AND THERE ARE MANY SUCH OTHER BENIFITS, like, NON-VIOLENCE, FORBEARANCE, SINCERITY, GRATITUDE ETC. ",
