            "answer_text": "This is difficult for me to answer, because there\u2019s are a few specific people in my life who I try to give hope to, but I often fail. However, there are a few tips I feel qualitfied to give you. The one time I remember properly making someone feel better was when I was around 8 or 9. I remember being in my bedroom with my current best friend at the time, who was sleeping over for 2 weeks. We were talking, as we did for hours every night, and somehow or another she got to crying about her father. He had passed away a few years ago\u2026and she had loved him very much. And I remember trying to console her- but trying to reconcile her feelings about her father didn\u2019t work. So I said something funny, I don\u2019t remember what. I played pretend, I made a few jokes, I hugged her. And she was crying, but she smiled. I know it was a true smile. That\u2019s why it stuck in my memory. It was the one time I had really given someone hope in a desperate moment. When you can\u2019t make someone feel better about whatever is despairing them- make them smile. Just make them smile somehow, it doesn\u2019t matter how, but however well you know them, find that tender spot that can\u2019t resist your humor and press on it. Making a crying girl smile was like unlocking the sun itself. My dad has often given me hope at my worst moments by assuring me of the truth- I\u2019m extrememly guilt-prone, you see, and I don\u2019t think very highly of myself, but according to my dad, I\u2019m a good person. Only, it doesn\u2019t work if you\u2019re lying; this trick only works if someone is delusioned about something: make an anorexic realize he\u2019s not fat, assure a friend who\u2019s worried about being friendless that you won\u2019t leave them. Make them believe it, but always tell the truth. If you know what someone needs, and you can deliver, then deliever! I think that\u2019s the most important part. Give a homeless guy a dollar and tell him about a store you know is hiring people. Make a friend a get-well card when she\u2019s feeling depressed. Do what you need to do when it\u2019s right to do it- compliment someone. Smile at someone. Say hello to the lonely kid at lunch. Just do anything that brings light to the world- real, tangible light, because in a world of darkness, a sliver of light can be a huge saving grace to a lot of people. Wow, I oughta start using my own ideas\u2026thank you for asking this question and reminding me of who I\u2019m meant to be. Peace out! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I would start with a quote- Trust your Hopes, not Fears said by David Mahoney. In the movie Dumb and Dumber, Jim Carrey finally gets a date with his ideal woman and tells her he is in love with her. Then he asks her,\u201d What do you think are my chances -one out of ten?\u201d After barely a moment\u2019s thought, she bluntly answers,\u201d More like one in a million.\u201d Carrey grows very serious, and guess what would be his reaction- the same old feeling of being sad and devastated? NO. Instead, a huge smile breaks out on his face.\u201dWow!\u201d he exclaims ecstatically.\u201cI have a chance!\u201d For once at least, this character\u2019s simplemindedness works in his favor. He is the eternal optimist, acknowledging the one-millionth of the glass that is full, rather than the rest that is empty. His attitude is more prone to create success than someone who would be turned away by initial rejection. Many great people were rejected before they became celebrities. Can anyone imagine Einstein failed at Mathematics, or Beethoven\u2019s music teacher called him hopeless as a composer, or Beatles were rejected by several record companies before they made their first album. A Big NO, right? but all of this actually happened. Even the creator of our famous cartoon character Mickey Mouse, Walt Disney was fired by a newspaper editor for lack of ideas. And eventually how successful he became is a history!! If all these people can do it even after huge setbacks and why can\u2019t we, we are no different than them except the Mindset, because it is our mindset that determines everything we are and are capable of becoming. Our destiny is determined not by chance, but by choice. No matter what chances you are quoted by statistics, you have the ability to make your own statistic. Sometimes all you need is that one chance in a million. If you capitalize on it, it is all worth it. Say to yourself- I make every experience work for me, everything that happens to me is an opportunity to further my success.  Thank you for reading Keep Smiling|Keep Shining. ",

            "answer_text": "You give someone hope by being their hope. You try this experiment. Tell her everyday what she means to you even if she gets bored and or annoyed. She will resent and doubt and have difficulty accepting all those compliments, but that is where you stand. You are there to be her crying shoulder, to be her hope, the pillar the can hold on to when she feels like her world is crumbling. It may sound easy but it's not. It is a two man job. She has to work on it as well. Then I hear you ask, \u201cHow am I supposed to do that? She won't even listen to me.\u201d Then make her listen. Stand your ground and make it clear to her that you are not going to let her drown in her anxiety. You have to believe that you can as well. It is never an easy job, and sometimes you need convincing yourself. The key here is patience. It is a long and gruelling process to go through once she's had her mindset, but if you are determined to change that for her, you'll have to stick with all her issues and problems. Be there. You also need to tell her what's wrong with how she's acting. A problem would never be solved if the person doesn't see the problem at all. You'll have to assess it and think of ways. Experiment. Tell her you're proud, tell her that she is better and meant for better things. You have to believe in her. Be her influence. Be her hope. Once she sees that you are unfailing and sees that you are her hope. She will slowly adjust, slowly change her mindset. The words you tell her will stay with her subconscious. It will repeat over and over uuntil that's what's programmed into her mind. You be her hope. ",

            "answer_text": "Hope, like happiness, can't be given so much as it's you helping the person come to the realization or the option of hope. Hope is a personal choice that people often make when presented with certain acceptable evidences. Infomercials tend to peddle hope by showing you a perceived problem and the perfect solution. You watch and you're sure you can do it too. You can solve that problem, you are sure you can do it because you saw someone else do it and succeed magnificently. Hope comes in many forms. Some of us put our hope in material things, money, house etc. Others put our hope in more personal matters like love, relationships, peace of mind etc. We all hope that this one thing will bring us clarity, happiness. To help someone clarify and realize hope, you must first understand true hope. Not hope in something that has a shelf life or an expiration date. Those things are at eye level however grand or emotionally stirring they may be. They expire or don\u2019t stand up to the rigors of time. True hope comes from something much higher than that. As a spiritually connected person my hope comes from my belief in Jesus Christ. This might be offensive to some and ridiculous to others. But I speak not from inexperience but from the safety of a personal relationship with Christ. This relationship underlies every other issue, problem or despairing situation I have faced. It answers my questions and is as true now as it was in the beginning almost 40 years now. Now, to be clear, I am not peddling Christianity, it is your choice whether to accept or not. Unlike infomercials, I get nothing from this beyond the satisfaction that you too can find peace and clarity through hope. I have my hope set and affirmed. It brings me a peace that is beyond understanding, so I share it with you because why would I not want to share good news if I have it? So whoever you need to share hope with make sure you have personal experience with true hope. This way you are authentic and can speak with authority. Also there is no \u201cuse by date\" on your hope. It's hope that is eternal. For further notes on my hope in Christ feel free to ask if you have questions. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing to do is, 'Empathise'. There is nothing as comforting as hearing that \u2018someone understands\u2019. The next thing to do is \u2018listen without interrupting them\u2019. If you are into medicines, it's like draining an abscess. When you let all the pus out, you can hope for quick recovery. Since they have had no one to talk to or let out or share their frustration with, they tend to become sore and prefer to live alone. Always remember, 'People like being alone, THEY DONT FANCY BEING ALONE'. So they may tell you to leave them alone, but it should be your call to hold your ground and tell them that you want to stand by them. The idea should be to show them how 'companionship is better that sulking ALONE'. How you could go for a movie, have supper together at a great diner gossiping about a common friend or having sex. The next thing you could do is to appreciate them, and make them realise that their presence in the world is actually felt/realised. Tell them how they are important to you or how you would like them to accompany you to your job interview or a local game . Also appreciate them on their talents, they may draw/sketch well. They may be a great listener, or a great talker and you could make them aware of their qualities. See, they are not dead, they just need a spark of light to rekindle them. If you can be physically cosy with them, then always go for a back hug or rest your head on their lap or vice versa. Where resting your head on their lap kindles a thought of affection, that you consider them as a loved so as to lie on their lap and \u2018them, resting their head on your lap' makes them feel that you are there for them.

Are they watching tv/engaging with computer etc? Their attention may be fully engaged with things that are not discernible in the physical reality that you share. If so, you relaxing on worrying and allowing yours and their some space and time for motivations to stir may work wonders\u2026 Especially if you get rid of your television..and wifi networks\u2026 A daily meditative practice of about 15\u201320 minutes (eg, Isha Kriya) is likely to be a helpful starting point. You may prefer something more energised, such as Sadhguru\u2019s health meditation; both are available on youtube. Your daily practice will enable you to relax, and allow new inspirations. If there is anything specific and relevant for you to do in relation to this person, you can be inspired into it, rather than worrying into it. Worry and concern perpetuate their causes. They are presentations of our own state of mind, not an objective assessment of someone else\u2019s state of being, which may be as much of a mystery to them as ours is to us. One starting point can be to really ease up on these adjectives and ways of seeing them that you mention here. If you like, you can practise seeing them in ways that are beyond these social definitions, which they seem to be refusing to conform to. This indicates a strong state of desire and focus on their part. With a little freedom of mind being introduced to your experience, you may find that life begins to stir into new, and inspiring, forms of representation. ",

            "answer_text": "Just read something by Blaise Pascal that might apply to what your friend is going through. It is an observation about human nature that can only be explained (and potentially remedied) through the application of Christian theology. We know from experience that humans can fall into pride on one side or despair on the other. Your friend appears to be experiencing the second problem. Here is Pascal\u2019s analysis which I think if seriously considered can help to right the boat. \"It is, however, an astonishing thing that the mystery furthest removed from our knowledge, namely, that of the transmission of original sin, should be a fact without which we can have no knowledge of ourselves. For it is beyond doubt that there is nothing which more shocks our reason than to say that the sin of the first man has rendered guilty those, who, being so removed from this source, seem incapable of participation in it. This transmission does not only seem to us impossible, it seems also very unjust. For what is more contrary to the rules of our miserable justice than to damn eternally an infant incapable of will, for a sin wherein he seems to have so little a share, that it was committed six thousand years before he was in existence? Certainly nothing offends us more rudely than this doctrine; and yet, without this mystery, the most incomprehensible of all, we are incomprehensible to ourselves. The knot of our condition takes its twists and turns in this abyss, so that man is more inconceivable without this mystery than this mystery is inconceivable to man. It is not by the proud exertions of our reason, but by the simple submission of reason, that we can truly know ourselves. These foundations, solidly established on the inviolable authority of religion, make us know that there are two truths of faith equally certain: the one, that man, in the state of creation, or in that of grace, is raised above all nature, made like unto God and sharing in His divinity; the other, that in the state of corruption and sin, he is fallen from this state and made like unto the beasts. Without this divine knowledge what could men do but either become elated by the inner feeling of their past greatness which still remains to them, or become despondent at the sight of their present weakness? Some considering nature as incorrupt, others as incurable, they could not escape either pride or sloth, the two sources of all vice; since they cannot but either abandon themselves to it through cowardice, or escape it by pride. For if they knew the excellence of man, they were ignorant of his corruption; so that they easily avoided sloth, but fell into pride. And if they recognised the infirmity of nature, they were ignorant of its dignity; so that they could easily avoid vanity, but it was to fall into despair. The Christian religion alone has been able to cure these two vices, not by expelling the one through means of the other according to the wisdom of the world, but by expelling both according to the simplicity of the Gospel.\" - Pens\u00e9es (139) ",

You can\u2019t \u201cgive\u201d hope any more than you can \u201cgive\u201d faith or trust, or anything similar. However, sometimes, when hope doesn\u2019t seem possible, endurance may still be possible. Getting through the next chunk of time, putting one foot in front of the other, may achieve a goal in spite of the absence of hope. In that case, help that person stay focused on their goal. (Hope may sneak in along the way.) Even if there is no goal, what you can do is assist that person to find someone who will stand beside them in their troubles, even if that person is not in a position to do anything other than that. You can also encourage them to do something positive for themselves, like take a 10-minute walk, or sit in the sun for a short time. Or encourage them to do something positive for someone else. Or, depending on their faith, pray with them and/or ask others to pray with them, for them. Depression is an odd thing. And it sometimes has biological sources. Please support the person to get checked out by their physician to make sure there isn\u2019t something wonky with their body/brain chemistry. ",

            "answer_text": "No doubt that motivation is very very important but motivation cannot be applied to all the areas of problems within the mind. When do we lose hope, have you ever observed? When we have an unclear mind and it seems impossible to get rid of something like thoughts or situation or circumstances. There are circumstances where we do not have any control, then how motivation will help if a person has lost all his hope in relation to changing something beyond his control? So first we need a very clear and peaceful mind to regain inside energy. Before understanding how to clear complications within the mind, let's first understand that what's unclear mind, see unclear mind means a mind which is full of complicated situations and circumstances which causes the feelings and emotions which we try to avoid and it usually happens where we don't spend time with ourself, when we don't question our beliefs and when we don't analyse the situation very calmly. Whenever we start feeling negative we start doing foolish things like eating what we love, talking to people we believe we love, taking rest from work and etc. Whenever we start feeling negative and that could be relating to anything like to a person whom you like but that person is not available and you're just stuck in the thoughts, etc. Only you can understand yourself. Negativity is very important because whenever you feel negative that may be regarded as a sign that something is going wrong. A guy, having bank balance of 10 crores, jumped from 10th floor due to depression. This unclear mind has nothing to do with what you have, it happens when we stop spending time with ourselves. So from the above you must have understood that what's unclear mind, what are the causes and how to deal with it. Once you start spending time with yourself you'll be able to unleash many of your wrong believes. Once your mind is at peace now you need motivation to move further and not just motivation you also need self confidence so for this you need to write few moments in which you did something which was really inspiring. If you don't know where you want to go and you're motivating yourself that I'll reach my destination, you'll always lose hope . Once the route is clear with instructions life becomes simple. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on why they lost hope. If you don't know the \"why,\" it's hard to determine the \"how,\" as in how to fix the issue. It's great that you're asking so you can find a solution. I wish more people would try to understand like you are. It frustrates me that people don't realize how deeply complex it is to solve such a deep and complex issue. Speaking from personal experience, the person who lost hope is the only person who has the key to restoring their hope. It can be a grueling process. It may or may not be linear. The more chaotic the reasons for losing hope, more often than not the solution will be chaotic. If the person you are trying to help has complicated problems, be a light to them in the dark. You can't save them all on your own, but you can be supportive. Empathize and be there for them as a form of stability. Don't sacrifice your own self care (you're not being selfish, but it can appear so to someone who doesn't have a clear perspective), but explain that you can best be there for them as a friend when you are taking care of yourself (if this conversation ever needs to happen; it may not).

He makes us a new person from the inside when we give ourselves to Him (we are \u201cborn again\", becoming children of God). That said, it is not easy to entrust ourselves to someone else, to give all of our lives to Him. Yet, that is what He requires if He is to heal us. That is why faith is required, because only if you trust Him fully, will you be willing to repent and give yourself to Him fully. But\u2026 it is worth it! It gives hope, removes our guilt and shame, and allows us to live with the knowledge that we are precious and loved by God, enabling us to forget about ourselves and see the needs of others instead.

This the upper most thing that Keep humans forward in his life even he or she going in the hell. Maybe you are in great trouble or failing in every thing, but the hope is only thing that will help you to become successful in life.  All Dreams are shattered, piercing deeply into the heart and causing burning pain. Yes, I am in the hell right now. Maybe the world will be crueled for you so not an unique thing. Each of us battling a fight against the life. Every one would face hundred of failures and some would not even reckon the numbers. The missile man of India A.P.J. Abdul kalam had faced many failures in his life. When Initially he as a project director of making India's first satellite launch pad(S.L.V), he failed in this project. First S.L.V was a failure as Instead of going in Space, it went into Bay of Bengal. It was loss of million of rupees. India became laughing stock for the world and the main culprit was A.P.J Abdul kalam. I was overwhelmed by the pressure of million of people as what they are thinking about me. I fear of million of loss made by me and the failure is so great that I thought it would end my carrer soon.- A.P.J Abdul kalam However, If you know history, then must be known that India put it first satellite Rohini in the next year under the leadership of Abdul kalam. So, Failures won't last if you consistently work for improving it and learning from your past mistakes. Next example is another great man ABRAHAM LINCOLN. He was a man of great spirit. Even after hundred of failures in his life, he fought deliberately like a warrior. He never give up. After losing the election of legislative, he contested the election of president. Hus friend who gave money during crisis period suggested him \u201c Brother, Don't stand for Presidential Election, You will lose it as same as legislative election.\u201d The ability of great man is that he only hears it own voice. He won the election and became the president of U.S.A. So now tell me if they lose all hope in their life, would they become successful? They succeeded because they never lose hope in their life. At last, \u201cNever lose hope.\u201d Yesterday, I was damn failure, Today, I'm a biggest disappointment but Tomorrow I will be a sensation for the world- A hopeful man The End Have a good day!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t gain motivation from hopes. but from the fact that I have been allowed the opportunity to experience life, through all the ups and downs, for better or worse. The value of human being, the meaning of life, lies in the word \u201cBEING\u201d, to be in the process of LEARNING & CREATING called LIFE EXPERIENCING. What is \u2018hope\u2019? Could too-many-hopes be a burden? Could some hopes be trivial and useless in the first place? Could a long list of hopes be trimmed down to a short list of needs representing just the basics of a healthy living ? Could the needs for the basic turn into executable, controllable plan of actions ? Leading a simple life does not require much superfluous effort, here I assume that one still has his/her physical and mental health, and with the up-keeping well managed. A simple healthy living means less or no anxiety, and no more lost hopes\u2026 hopes for illusive gains, fame, fortune, relationship, pleasures, etc. which are originated from the illusive greed-driven ego self. A healthy life starts with a healthy mind, one cannot have a balanced, harmonious interaction with the outside world unless one has the correct mindset, composing of the right set of values and understandings, and the proper methodology to think, perceive and conceptualize. Memories, hopes, desires, emotions and the like are the outputs of the mind. With the wrong set of values coupled with a faulty processing, good inputs could turn into bad outputs\u2026 not just garbage in and garbage out, also good in and garbage out! Mind cleansing and revitalizing are most important life-long task for all humans, not just for those who have lost all hopes, but for those who are lucky enough to live in their hope-full-filling lives. A correct, peaceful mind will help one go through the ups and downs of life with ease, seeing them as just the experiences of living, being in the learning and creating process. To achieve the right mindset, one might adopt the following approach:- read up , via the internet or your local libraries, on meditation, and / or go for some reputable meditation training.explore the real meaning of meditation, dig through more cross references.verify if it works by self experimenting, experiencing.If it works on you, adopt and practice, (NOT believe and practice).trust your intuition to lead you through the path of awakening and enlightenment.knowing that in the mental realm, you, despite any physical limitation on the outside, are absolutely FREE to learn and relearn , to create and recreate; for there, in the mental realm, lies the source of unlimited, invigorating power, ready to be tapped. It is wise to make the best use of it. You may hardly change the physical constraints on the outside, but you have the liberty to perceive them differently given the right mindset.knowing that fate can play havoc on your life despite your best effort. True ? Yes and No. Given that you have the the right mindset to lead a life of healthiness (not putting you or others in harms way), the power of Nature (the Creator) is on your side, and you, with the divine blessing, can rewrite your fate and destiny, at the least, to shorten and alleviate the downs of life.Instead of hoping that you might overcome your current situation, please repeat the following affirmation to yourself, a few times daily : I shall overcome! Say it out loud, and feel it coming through, out from the deepest, purest part of your inner self. Meantime, get ready and go for the life-long learning and practicing of meditation and enlightenment. ",

Disaster was at hand. The SGI-Nichiren method bumped into me, and everything started to change when I decided to check it out. The method is based on dumping limiting concept, and using the mind-mouth to infuse rationality into life. Why rationality? That is necessary because I had made poor decisions that brought me to disaster. The job-money thing cleared up, and I became relationship capable. ",

Beginning in my late teens until now (I am 53) I have struggled with this (depression). It was not until I was in my 40\u2019s that I finally got some professional help, and it has changed my life for the better. I still have to do the work, and there isn\u2019t really a magic pill (although medication has helped me). I still have speed bumps I endure, but I have the tools to deal with them. I feel so much better about myself, and have a higher level of self esteem. I only wish I had sought help when I was younger. It is impossible to tell you the importance of getting professional help. This can be through a counselor, therapist, psychiatrist, pastor, etc\u2026.There may be free services where you are, you just need to do a google search. If you think you don\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d in this world, are \u201cabnormal\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d I can assure you that you are NOT. There is a spot for everyone at this table called life.
