            "answer_text": "It is important for the teacher to know how students learn, so they can help them in the process of learning. Most beginning teachers teach in an intuitive way - i.e. their teaching style reflects the way they learn. However, HOW YOU LEARN will be very different to someone else. For this reason, it is important to know about: How people learn? Finding out what learning style the students are may help their learning abilities. For example \u2013 being aware of different learning styles can help the teacher prepare, notes, tactics and resources to appeal to a range of styles, e.g. visual, auditory, written etc. And to try and include an activity which appeals to kinaesthetic learnersWhat factors affect learning positively and negatively? Learning is difficult for some and easy for others, so it is useful to have additional tasks that can be given to faster learners, or teachers can organise some groups to have a mix of stronger learners with those who are less strong.Learning is about increasing levels of knowledge, skills or values, so the teacher needs to prepare appropriately for these domains of learning. When lesson planning the teacher needs to consider the:Amount of knowledge \u2013 i.e. don\u2019t try to cover too much. The maxim less is more works here. (Although have additional material for the faster learners).Sequence of teaching \u2013 here it is useful for teachers to try and link new learning to \u2018old\u2019 i.e. build on what they already know.Level of knowledge \u2013 again, from knowing the students, the teacher will be able to gear the learning to the right level, so it the material is challenging, but not overly difficult.The learning process is different for all, so being aware of any pitfalls of a particular learning event is vital. The teacher\u2019s empathy will help here, by re- thinking what the potentially difficulties are for learning this specific piece of learning, and building in additional support when it is needed.How can learning theories help me to better meet the learning needs of my students? Example ideas from learning theories are: From the Behaviourist theories - the use of positive feedback in the form of rewards e.g. grades, class recognition etc helps to motivate students to build on their current learning into the future.From Cognitivist theories - teachers can draw on \u2018learning by doing\u2019 approaches, guided studies which help prompt the students to thinkSocial learning theories \u2013 e.g. the teacher can act as a role model that the students \u2018copy\u2019Humanistic theories \u2013 e.g. Finding out what motivates the students is helpful in goal and aim setting. The teacher needs to work on ideas of \u2018democracy\u2019 in the classroom and creating \u2018safe space\u2019 for the student to grow and develop.Andragogy \u2013 e.g. this relates more specifically to adult learners and one of the key expectations is that the teacher should try to use the adults experience(s) as the cornerstone of learning.I hope this explains why it is important for the teacher to know how learners learn. A knowledge of learning styles and theories can add to the armoury of approaches/teaching methods and ideas that teachers can/may use. ",

            "answer_text": "Well now that\u2019s a good question and a hard one to answer. All students learn differently accordingly to their upbringing, family life, and there problems at home. Also any birth traits. ADHD, Dyslexia, medications, alcohol and party drugs taken by the mother while pregnant, all of these can effect how a child or even in high school learns. So that\u2019s why we test so much. A lot of times we do not SEE those problems and hope that a counselor will chime in on a student. That\u2019s also why I graded on a curve but sometimes I cheated a little to help disadvantaged learners. IF I knew them!! We can and DO slant our syllabus towards the classes that we have or at least I always did according to their level. I have taught students from other countries in my courses while I was in Florida. I did a lot of chalk talk on the boards behind my desk, I also sat them next to somebody that they trusted or spoke the same or similar language. Also our roll books had codes in them denoting differences in their learning style on an over leaf. Sometimes I had to staple this shut to keep nosy students from looking down at my grade book while having a superfluous question at my desk or lectern. But we do try to use this data when it becomes available. Moving back into another state in a much smaller school system is no fun either!!!!!!!!!!! As they do not understand this nor do they want to!!! The ways they have been doing stuff is fine for them. SO not all school systems are familiar with these tools and useful information. ",
