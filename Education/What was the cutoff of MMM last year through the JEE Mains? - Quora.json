If you belong from Uttar Pradesh then cutoff is a little high (94\u201396 percentile) but if you belong any state other than Uttar Pradesh then 85 percentile would be sufficient to fetch you a seat in MMMUT. If you want to secure your preferred branch then you have to aim for at least 90 percentile for the Other States and 96 percentile for Home State. (These stats will definitely fetch you a seat).  Maybe It will help You... All the above stats. are mentioned considering you belong to general category without any sub-categories. Thank You & All the Best. ",

            "answer_text": "Never mind but I think that since MMMUT had became a university it\u2019s quality is degrading day by day. Last year in 2019 there were 120 seats for CS, ME, CE, ECE, EE and 60 seats for IT and Chemical. But now in 2020 the seats had been increased to 150 in CS, ME, CE, ECE, EE and 75 for IT and Chemical. Can you imagine studying there? It would be like a messed up coaching institute where you are going to pay 1.4 lacs + expenses every year with no career guarantee at all. I would better suggest you to do some professional course such as BCA from other universities like as BHU and Allahabad University. I do not mean to say that they are best but you won\u2019t need to pay loads of money and will get some job of nearly 20k per month in some decent places. Thank you ",
