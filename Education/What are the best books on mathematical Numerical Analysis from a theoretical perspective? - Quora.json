            "answer_text": "If by theoretical you mean mathematical, then the best one I have to recommend for an introduction to someone who already knows some analysis is An introduction to numerical analysis, by Endre Suli, who's a professor at Oxford.  I used it in my undergrad scientific computing class and eventually got to know others, but to me this remains the best I've encountered for a solid foundation on numerical analysis. It is clear and provides and proves all necessary theorems to develop a wide range of topics. The book is dense, but manageable even if you're not a math undergrad (as long as you know some analysis). If you are not much into proofs, another fairly good book that I keep right by my desk is Numerical mathematics and computing, by Kincaid and Cheney, both of which professors at UT Austin. I use this book as reference a lot. It provides several examples and pseudo-codes, as well as proof \"sketches\" of the most important theorems. This book can be read by anyone who's had single-variable calculus. If you are looking for a graduate-level mathematics textbook in numerical analysis, then I wouldn't know what to suggest, but at that level I believe it would be better to go after books on more specific topics (which is what I ended up doing).

My advisor does research in numerical analysis.  In particular, finite element methods and splines.     This is her book of choice:   A Theoretical Introduction to Numerical Analysis: Victor S. Ryaben'kii, Semyon V. Tsynkov: 9781584886075: Amazon.com: Books  Personally, I've worked out of at least 4 books.  However, I've never read any of them cover to cover.  They are more applied books, however.   I'd be interested to see what others suggest.    ",
