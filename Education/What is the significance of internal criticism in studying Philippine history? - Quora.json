            "answer_text": "One comment on the Study Of History Pinas context; even way back the 1980s we always say this: Pinas history is written with an angle. And that make the historical narration biased. Maybe this has sothing to do with who paid the Writer; if one Foundation requests the Study, that Study is biased to the Line of Approach set by the Foundation. Many so-called historians are trapped by this factual situation. One bright man was commissioned to write the history of an organization. He was told he can write freely provided it is true. He did. When the Committee reviewed the Draft, it recommended that this and that and one and the other be deleted or toned down. He refused; the study was not paid by the organization; the work was not published. That is reality. Any organization or institution big or small must have its own Internal Audit. Or in the case of an Intellectual Organization or a self-commanding organization, there must be criticism within the purpose of which is to find errors and rectify it. Without internal audit or self-criticism the organization will not be able to timely rectify Errors; it will crumble from within. That is the importance of criticism and self-criticism for the organization or the institution. Remember, much and many a time your enemy is within, and maybe it\u2019s You. ",
