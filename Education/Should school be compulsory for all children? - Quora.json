            "answer_text": "+ Yes. Almost no humans can get on-the-run all the understanding they need to be productive workers in a modern society. Education, meaning at least 1 able to do basic measuring and computing, 2 a sense of probability and likelihood, 3 able to write, 4 able to read with some discrimination (the evaluation of back-up), 5 able to speak (express one\u2019s self to others in the fewest, clearest, shortest words), 6 ability to observe, 7 confidence in one\u2019s own judgments are necessary. Why compel schooling? Because education is unhappily what economists call a merit good. That means not all parents are able and willing to pay for their children\u2019s schooling, despite all the benefits to those children and to society. So to avail all children of education, government subsidizes and compels it. That does not mean it takes. Some children enter school so unruly that they cannot be taught. Some children\u2019s parents have no clue of schooling\u2019s purpose, so their children are hardly likely to pick up much. Children should be given due opportunity to acquire the skills named in the 2d para. Most should be able to do that in four years and rest in five years. No use wasting abstract learning on those who question its worth, so offer the unwilling more concrete subject sooner. Only children able to absorb more should go past four years (of real education) and government should subsidize their schooling up thru college. Private education can offer a parallel track. ",

            "answer_text": "If school was not compulsory, some parents would pressure their children to skip school and make money instead. This would deprive them of the right to an education. We\u2019d also have a bunch of people sitting around unsupervised, doing nothing with their time, which means more kids would get into trouble. ",
