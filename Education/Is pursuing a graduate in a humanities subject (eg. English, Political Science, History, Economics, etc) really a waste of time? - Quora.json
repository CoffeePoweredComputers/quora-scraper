            "answer_text": "It depends on you. But probably. Look, nobody wants to tell you the truth: most people don\u2019t get to study academic things for a job. Colleges don\u2019t want to tell you because they want you to pay them, and because they believe in the Ivory Tower. Professors don\u2019t want to tell you because they are the Ivory Tower, and their field of study benefits when there are more people educated in it to choose from for the next generation of professors. High School teachers don\u2019t want to tell you because they\u2019ve all been forced to study under the same professors, and have all been trained not to compromise a kid\u2019s self esteem by telling them \u201cthat\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d but instead \u201cyou can do whatever you want to do.\u201d Parents don\u2019t want to tell you because they want their children to believe in their dreams, and when they grew up a degree meant something independent of what was actually studied. A generation ago, 7% of young people went to college. Now, it\u2019s closer to 40%. Even if all those original 7% went on work in academia, do you think that the share of jobs in academia have gone up from 7% to 40%?Absolutely not. So what does a degree in a humanities subject get you in terms of a future career? Very little. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are still benefits. A broader, deeper understanding of the world around you, of human history, of human experience, is a wonderful thing.But\u2026how much will you pay for that experience? Will you go into debt? Thinking about it like a product you purchased, will the amount you spend make sense for anything that doesn\u2019t help you advance your lifestyle, or better care for your family, like a car or a home? At the prices being charged by universities these days, the product they provide only makes sense in terms of investing in your career. And there is only one way that getting a degree in most humanities subjects will be worth that cost: if you go into academia, and become a professor yourself. Are you bright enough for that? Are you disciplined enough for that? Keep in mind that it\u2019s going to be harder for you to \u201cmake it\u201d than it was for your professors, because you are competing with far more fellow humanities majors than they are for scarcely more jobs. It is possible you are one of those who are indeed destined for such a career. I could have done it. But it turns out, I value my family\u2019s stability more than going back to school to get my Ph.D, a conclusion I came to after a couple years in the work force. They told us we could all be whatever we wanted to be. Even that we shouldn\u2019t aim for anything else. They were wrong. ",
