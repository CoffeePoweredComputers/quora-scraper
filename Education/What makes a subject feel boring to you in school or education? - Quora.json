            "answer_text": "Hi Raqib. Thanks for the A2A. This is a great question, and the folks who ran the high school I attended way back in the last millennium, Hawthorne, had a great answer.  (The Sumner School Building in Washington, DC, now a historical monument, former site of the Hawthorne High School) The folks who ran Hawthorne found out that when kids are bored, the work is not hard enough. Make it 10 times harder, and the kids will call it a challenge. Hawthorne helped many young men and women discover that they were a lot more intelligent than they thought they were. Here are some causes for boredom: The work is not enough of a challenge.The subject seems irrelevant or pointless. It seems like something the kid has to learn, not something the kid has any reason to learn.The child is repeating received messages about not being bright, or being bright (but so what), or guilt, should, and have to.The learning method is either not clear to the child, or not appropriate to the child\u2019s learning style.The child is not supported in discovering that hard work is fun.All of these problems can be solved with one solution: Support the child in taking the work on as a challenge. Help the child see the relevance of the learning and the excitement of mastering the subject. I am a life coach and trainer for adults, and I rarely work with children. But I helped out a friend\u2019s son, a 10-year-old boy, last spring. We met just twice for less than 2 hours. He took on this approach and his grades went from Cs and worse to all As and Bs. Everything I have said works for adults, too. In fact, as a life coach, I find that most adults are stuck in learning the same way that they were in middle school or high school. The adults who get past this and get really excited about learning as part of a passionate, fulfilling life and success in whatever we choose to do thrive and excel. ",

            "answer_text": "The teacher. I hate to put it this way, but I have to say it, only a teacher can make a subject boring. Likewise, only a teacher can make a subject extremely interesting. The teacher\u2019s passion is crucial in this matter, since the beginning. I believe that you can see right from the beginning, from that first conversation with the teacher, whether he/she loves, and I mean loves, the subject he/she is teaching. For instance, just the way my Chemistry teacher was describing the syllabus for the year made me understand that I was gonna enjoy the course material that year. Similarly, my english teacher irradiated his passion to all my class mates, and made the subject feel \u201cinteresting\u201d, or perhaps innovative, for three years straight. Until freshman year in high school I simply despised English and English literature; but thanks to this teacher of mine (who was my teacher for the last three years of high school), I now find English literature to be one of the most intellectually stimulating and mind-opening subjects out there. The teacher can also have a negative impact on the way in which I look at a subject, however. Especially in challenging subjects such as Maths. I myself find some kind of satisfaction in being able to understand mathematical concepts and being able to apply them to solve greater problems; however, my passion for the subject is less than that for Chemistry or Physics. I find that this is due to the bad experiences I\u2019ve had with Math teachers in the past. Now, I don\u2019t want to point fingers and blame others for everything; what I want to say is that the way in which my past Math teaches taught just made the subject more \u201cboring\u201d or, more specifically, less entertaining, less involving. Luckily I\u2019ve had two excellent math teachers that made up for the past teachers and managed to not put out my interest in the course. It is thanks to them that I probably have that satisfaction I mentioned above. The teacher\u2019s passion and dedication to their taught subject in crucial to the student\u2019s development of a passion/interest in the course, and that is fundamental from the very beginning. After all, why would we invest our precious time struggling on a subject that not even the teacher seems to be interested in? P.S.: Please don\u2019t get me wrong on this, I did not intend to insult the hard work of any teacher who reads this answer, and I did not mean to generalise my experiences. It\u2019s just my two cents :) E.I. ",
