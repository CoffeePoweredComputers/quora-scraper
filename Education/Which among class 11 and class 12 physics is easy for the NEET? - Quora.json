            "answer_text": " No. Both 11th and 12th class physics are equally easier or harder. There are chances, you find the 12th class physics bit easier and familiar mainly due to the following: When you started the class 11th, your science background is from the high school. The class 11th syllabus and the content are vast compared to previous years. Some may take time to adjust to the pattern, hence they may find it difficult.You will have just completed the class 12th while appearing for the NEET. You will find more natural with the class 12th physics than the one you read a year back.The first-year physics is about kinetics, kinematics, thermodynamics, etc., while the 2nd year is mostly about electricity (and basic electronic), optics and some of modern physics. You can check the following table to find which topics got the prominence during previous NEET / AIEEE years.  Please check our other Quora answer about important topics: Questionbang's answer to Which topics should I study from each chapter of chemistry and physics to get 100+ in each subject in the NEET in the last 4-5 months? This should help you with what topics to focus on. Hope this helps. ",
