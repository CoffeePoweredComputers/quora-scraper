Refer to your high school policy, non-credit classes may not be counted to your GPA, and GPA-exempt classes are not counted in your GPA. If you\u2019re attending to an US high school, they\u2019ll generally use a 4-point scale or letters scale. Some use 12-point scale and you can find the conversion between the scales. Besides of academic or regular classes, there are advanced, honors, AP (Advanced Placement), IB (International Baccalaureate), Dual-credit, Dual-Enrollment, etc. They\u2019re all counted in your GPA but slightly calculated differently.   *Honors Level: May include advanced, AP, IB, Dual-credit, Dual-enrollment, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Check with your high school guidance counselor to get the details on your school district\u2019s GPA policy. At my kids\u2019 high school, all classes which counted towards graduation requirements were included in the unweighted GPA. For the weighted GPA, AP & dual-credit classes were given additional weight over regular classes. Of the subjects you mention in your question, theatre was an extracurricular activity at my kids\u2019 high school, not a class, so it did not count towards GPA (but things like band, choir and PE all DID count towards GPA).

            "answer_text": "I get many questions on topics that should be discussed with your guidance counselor. 1) how is the GPA calculated and 2) what AP classes should I take. As for your question, typically APs and honor classes are weighted classes, and governed by the school district as what they are worth. All normal classes that are offered as regular curricula are unweighted. Spanish and physical education are counted as regular classes Some schools have theater as a class and at some schools, it is not--it\u2019s an extra curricular activity. Again, talk to you counselor. ",

However, for colleges, your core classes will be what they use to calculate a GPA. Some will take into account your electives though. Core classes include Math, English, Science, Social Studies, and Foreign Language. ",
