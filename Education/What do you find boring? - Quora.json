            "answer_text": "I am truly blessed; I'm fortunate that I have hardly ever encountered boredom in my entire life. I don't relate to people who say they are bored. How can they be bored when there is always so much to do? Do these bored people always rely on others to entertain them? Or do they lack the imagination to keep themselves entertained? How does one become bored, anyway? There are only two occasions I can remember when I started to feel what actual boredom might feel like. Maybe. Both times were when I was being \u201cheld hostage\u201d in church. The worst was a huge three-day church convention. I was not a member of the church, I just went along with my relatives who were members, because I thought we would have fun staying in a hotel! All three long days, different speakers were droning on and on, speaking in monotone voices, as I fidgeted and felt uncomfortable, and even daydreaming wasn't an adequate escape, for every time I looked out the window or down at my shoes, I was pinched by a relative, and was told to \u201cpay attention\u201d because Jehovah-God was watching, and I'd probably end up in the grave (well, duh, don't we all) and I suddenly felt very sorry I came to this Godforsaken, boring-ass assembly (which lasted three days, let me remind you) and they didn't even have live music to break up the monotony, rather sang their hymnals, like robotic androids, to the accompaniment of \u201ccanned music\u201d to a warbling recording from the sound booth; I wondered when the Hell was lunch break, anyway, because I thought I may have been developing a hemorrhoid, at ten years old, from all the sitting I was doing (even though I didn't know what those were) and boy, was this stadium filled with white people, which was weird to me, because I'd never seen so many white people together under one roof in my life, and why were we looking at comic books instead of the Holy Book; Where were all the real Bibles; The lady in front of me- how did she get her hair to stand up that tall- it reminded me of yellow meringue (what I wouldn't give for a nice piece of lemon meringue pie right about then.) And my thoughts would go on like that for eight hours. Day after day, until suddenly, my stream of consciousness saw me through, and it was the end, and people were suddenly standing up, collecting their belongings from their seats in the stadium, talking, laughing, looking relieved for it to be over, too. I have my mind to keep me occupied. I don't get easily bored. I'm too creative to be bored. However, there, in that particular culture, it was difficult not to. There, children are discouraged from fidgeting from a very young age. They aren't removed to a play room. They sit with the adults. They listen to the adult language. The sermons aren't in any way \u201cdumbed down\u201d for them. They are not given candies from their grandmother's purses. No wrappers are heard rustling. There aren't special treats passed around. They sit very still and quiet in their seats like good little robots. I think they have learned the art of transcendental meditation by age three. The glazed look on their serene little faces says it all. I might have picked up on it, this meditation trick, had I kept attending those conventions, but they were just too G*ddamned boring for me to ever want to go back again! ",

            "answer_text": "In college, a lot of teens want to date. Some people I know say that they haven't found anyone to date. I find that weird because there are so many people and you can actually invest your time in getting to know someone. But then I realized they base everything on looks. And the view of outer beauty, it differs from one person to another. Every time someone is recommended, they go like, \"Look at their face.\" And every time someone's crush is revealed, someone goes like, \"Do you think I'd date someone with that face?\" There, I've seen a guy crush on a girl and her name was the only thing he knew. I've seen two people date within a week of meeting each other. I've seen 9 guys have a crush on a girl. And most of them haven't even had a proper conversation with her. When I told my friends about my crush (mutual but not dating) and showed his picture, one of my friends smirked and asked me, \"Have you guys ever done a video call?\" It almost felt as if he was afraid my crush doesn't know what I look like apart from my pictures. Some even say that their own face or body is the reason they aren't dating. Apparently they're ugly. Some of my friends tell me they wish they could find someone who doesn't focus on looks. You judge someone based on their looks and decide who you have a crush on (completely based on looks) and you want someone who doesn't focus on looks? Weird. I mean, if you want to look good, do it. But don't make a conclusion about a person based on what they look like. And don't base something so important like a relationship on looks. Looks. I find it boring. Show me depth. Looks are shallow.
