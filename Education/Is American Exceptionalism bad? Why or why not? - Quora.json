            "answer_text": "Is American exceptionalism harmful or helpful? Clearly harmful. It\u2019s the default excuse right wing politicians use to reject solutions to their problems that demonstrably work because the current system benefits them. That way perfectly fine solutions are never tried and the US suffers from massive problems that have been solved elsewhere decades ago. Typical examples are health care and higher education, where the US still insists on an exploitative system, the penitantiary system, where the mindless law and order approach makes everything worse, and drug policies, where criminalizing drugs creates massive problems with drug related crime while it in no way reduces drug use. US Americans could have universal health care, free higher education, a penitantiary system that concentrates on rehabilitation instead of punishment and which actually reduces crime and legal possession of drugs where addicts are treated as patients instead of criminals, which reduces crime and drug use. But some of them won\u2019t have any of that because they want to believe in the US being so star spangled special that none of that would work for no proper reason at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Is American exceptionalism harmful \u2014 to whom? In the long term, it will be harmful to the USA. As Trump pushes the notion, he gets his crowds to cheer him. But his foreign policy is alienating Other Countries. In the future, America will no longer have the influence it once had. America will no longer have the prestige it once had. And American citizens will no longer be respected or even liked. Domestically, America will slide further behind. Americans will no longer have the know-how to keep up with the rest of the world, not with the Trump administration gutting public schools. That\u2019s where American exceptionalism will lead the USA. At which point we can expect Trump\u2019s followers to reject everything they\u2019ve read because they want to feel that the USA is the best and to feel otherwise would be humiliating. So we can expect them to double down on their current isolationism. And we can expect future generations of Americans to be very sorry that they did so. ",
