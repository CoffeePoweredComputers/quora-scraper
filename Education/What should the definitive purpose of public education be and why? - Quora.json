            "answer_text": "The importance of public education is to ensure that all members of society have a basic set of skills (reading, writing, math, basic social interactions, ability to create and interpret directions and directives, etc.) as well as to ensure that people are able to maintain a basic ability to learn, regardless of social status or wealth. For the rich, education has always been accessible. They can afford to pay for education, they can afford to not have children working, etc. But for the lower and middle classes, education has been a pipe dream for most of documented history. In the early 20th century, if someone had a 3rd grade education, they were considered good. Typically, education was viewed as something that people did only until they were physically mature enough to work on a farm or in a factory full time. If you were female and poor, there was even less of a precedent. With the advent of child labor laws, and more inclusive free public education (Section 504 of the rehabilitation act, IDEA, Title I, Title IX, the concepts of FAPE and LRE, etc.) it has become something that is necessary and accessible to everyone. Like I say to my students: How are you going to go on a date if you can\u2019t read the menu, or if you can\u2019t properly add the bill and tip? How are you going to drive in a new city if you can\u2019t read the street signs? How do you keep track of your bank account if you can\u2019t do math? The idea is to show that what we\u2019re learning has an impact outside of school, and for many subjects, it does. The ones without a seemingly direct impact (science, social studies, some electives) are used as soul searching classes, but are used to teach basic functions of life and the universe, and to teach history so it\u2019s not repeated, as well as geography, civics, the basic functions of the economy, and basic inquiry and research skills. While some of it may seem like a waste of time, it all serves a purpose later in life. Creating free public education is one way to allow people the tools to escape poverty, and work to improve the basic skills that they will use throughout their lives. IF it\u2019s done properly. IF schools are given the resources they need to meaningfully impact their students lives, and are given the resources to help the students who lack these basic skills. If schools don\u2019t have the resources they need, they become a babysitting center for students 9 months out of the year. Sorry for the super long post, but I hope it was helpful as an answer! ",

Obligatory education failed to gain any grip for several decades after the founding of the American Republic. Though it is true numerous founding fathers advocated some form of national education. The American people were at first reluctant to give up control of their children's education. Parents qualified their children or if their families could afford it private tutors did the job. Compulsory education also establishes to support among intellectuals in the Progressive movement. For them it was essential that the state directly control the education of its citizens. The Puritans were the first in this country to point out the need of public education. They recognized schools to teach .After the American Revolution, Thomas Jefferson argued that the newly independent nation desired an educational system and he recommended. A few public schools had popped up around the country in the communities that could manage to pay for them. Horace Mann of Massachusetts and Henry Barnard begin passion for free, compulsory school for every child in the nation. Administrators began to implement new course without any fear of bringing up the rear students. Stripped of any choice concerning their children\u2019s education lower and middle income parents were compelled to send their children to the neighborhood public school. These parents gradually lost influence over the aspect of parenting once considered most significant. Over time the method became increasingly politicized, technical, standing apart from family and most importantly devoid of any moral content. ",

            "answer_text": "Every year, millions of students are failing their state and national education tests. The reason for this is a lack of sufficient educational opportunity. This is a problem that continues to grow, especially in the developing world. The solution is simple: give students access to better education. A lot of other problems, such as drug abuse, illegal immigration, and poor hygiene, can be reduced or eliminated with adequate education, and it's time that America realized this and began investing in its youth. What is the importance of public education? First, in order to provide a quality education to the students, we must have a reasonable amount of money available. Without proper funding, our children will never receive the best education. Second, public education is the greatest way to improve the overall health of our children and their communities. Third, education provides education, and without education our society will crumble. In order to improve our educational system, we must look at what is the importance of public education. Not only is education important but so is the availability of a quality education. With an adequate education, the risk of students committing crimes and getting involved in illegal activities is dramatically reduced. Without an adequate education, many children will end up in failing schools that do not offer quality education, resulting in more lost opportunities. ",

            "answer_text": "The first publicly supported secondary school in the United States was the Boston Latin School, founded in 1635. Harvard was the first University in existence at that time. The attendance in secondary schools was very little because the curriculum was specialized and hard. The demand for skilled workers in the middle of the eighteenth century led Benjamin Franklin to start a new kind of secondary school. Thus, the American Academy was established in Philadelphia in 1751. American high schools eventually replaced Latin grammar schools. The rise in American high school attendance was one of the most striking developments in U.S. education during the 20th century. From 1900 to 1996 the percentage of teenagers who graduated from high school increased from about 6 percent to about 85 percent. As the 20th century progressed, most states enacted legislation extending compulsory education laws to the age of 16. It is essential to look at the history of public education along with the events shaping the country in the early years of the 20th century. ",

Valid, in the beginning of New England, towns were required to keep up normal schools upheld and controlled by the neighborhood citizenry. This had been done to ensure that children learned to peruse with the goal that they could read the Bible and go ahead to advanced education. Yet, there was much homeschooling, private coaching, private foundations, church schools, and women's schools for extremely youthful children. There were no necessary school participation laws, and no brought together state control over the educational programs. This framework, or absence of it, created a very proficient populace that could read the Federalist Papers, the King James Version of the Bible, and everything else that was distributed. Every one of the one needs to do is perused a Farmer's Journal of those early days to understand the abnormal state of education that was delighted in by the all inclusive community in America before the appearance of the public schools.

Now here I would like to say about the history of public education on the basis of United States. The first American schools in the thirteen original colonies opened in the 17th century. The larger towns in New England opened grammar schools, the forerunner of the modern high school. The upper south, centered on the Chesapeake, created some basic schools early in the colonial period. In late 17th century Maryland, the Jesuits operated some schools. Generally the planter class hired tutors for the education of their children or sent them to private schools. During the colonial years, some sent their sons to England for schooling. ",
