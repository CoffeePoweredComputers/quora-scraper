            "answer_text": "There are several ways to attend a university in Korea with a scholarship. National universities and public universities operate scholarships according to policies by the government or local governments, but private universities have scholarships based on the management's ideas. However, I think that the scholarship system in Korea is mainly based on academic achievement and family background. Academic achievement depends on the efforts of the acquired self, and family types are the circumstances in which they are naturally created regardless of their efforts. Therefore, I think that a good way to go to university with a scholarship in Korea is to study hard. ",
