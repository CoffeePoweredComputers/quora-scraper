            "answer_text": "A2A by four different people, but rather than 10 I will go with just two (which is 10 in binary). The best course for anybody (12+) is Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects - University of California, San Diego | Coursera. It is only about 10 hours of effort (\u201c4 hours of video, 3 hours of exercises, 3 hours of bonus material\u201d), and some of it is obvious. Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life was the first Biology course I have taken since I was 13, and for anybody willing to invest the effort, it has just restarted this month (August 2016). Although some of the other MITx MOOCs I have taken would rank in a top 10 (decimal) too, this is perhaps the best. But the other main reason I will only give two is that many online courses are either too simple or too advanced for any given individual. Circuits and Electronics (also from MIT on EdX) and Machine Learning on Coursera both require a decent understanding of calculus to master, for example. Instead: Discover Free Online Courses & MOOCs \u2022 Class Central is the place to go to discover the best online courses \u2018for you\u2019. Don\u2019t be afraid to bite of more than you can chew; most courses give plenty of time to sample before you invest money as well as time, and even courses that are not in any \u201810 best\u2019 list tend to have excellent content in week 1 lectures.
