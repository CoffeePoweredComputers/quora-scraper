            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t like the word train because training makes me think of training animals. I help. I\u2019ve attended the classes and seminars and some of the current thoughts about limited choice, pictorial schedules, and building interactions based upon \u201cfirst \u2014\u2014- (non-preferred activity) then \u2014\u2014\u2014 (enjoyed activity)\u201d make sense and I use them also with students. What I don\u2019t like is the dehumanizing and condescending attitude I feel underlying in some cases, the prescribed and systemized way to deal with autism rather than seeing and respecting the individual person. That feeling of training, like training a dog or a chimpanzee. That I reject. In my current role, I support students with autism, learning disabilities, health issues, and those labeled emotionally disturbed whose overall intelligence means that they are mainstreamed. They are in with all the other kids with less trained teachers in regards to neuro-diversity. All day, they are in a world that is uncomfortable and in which they do not fit. I get the texts when a student has lost it and has lashed out or is hiding under a table and won\u2019t come out or wailing or whatever. I go to them and say, \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Sometimes I need to gently lead them out with a hand on the shoulder. The first time I got a call like that, I didn\u2019t really know what to do. So I thought about when a baby is overstimulated and just screaming. You\u2019ve changed the diaper, offered milk, sang. Nothing is working and you feel like crying yourself. That\u2019s when it is time to go outside. Nighttime or daytime, hot or cold, it helps. The screaming stops or at least turn to a cry, they look about, they are able to re-regulate outside. So that\u2019s what we do. We walk. One lap around the baseball field, stop behind the backstop to look at the bulls on the other side of the fence. Maybe pick up a stick or feather from under the trees on the north side of the school. Second lap, I ask what is the matter, what got to be too much. I listen if they want to talk. Then we go to my room and I make sure they understand the lesson that was being taught. Sometimes we just do the worksheet but often I change things so it\u2019s more concrete, more visual, we talk about the concepts and the why. I affirm their thought processes and who they are as a person. Then I take them back. I take them back to try to cope and fit again. For a while, they will be able to, but I know the call will come again. It\u2019s really hard, especially as they hit puberty, when they are bigger and not so cute and still haven\u2019t grown out of it. People don\u2019t use those exact words, but that is the unspoken attitude. Smart but lazy. Weird. Stubborn. I try to help by seeing them, by seeing the possibilities and helping guide towards strengths. I\u2019ve also had some direct conversations on uncomfortable topics, but with some mutual respect built so I can be heard. Manners. Hygiene. Seeing things from another\u2019s point of view. I wish the world was safer and easier and more suited for a variety of people. But it isn\u2019t. I worry about my kids. I already had one who got in pretty big trouble for not taking the hood down on a hoodie nor removing sunglasses indoors. He may have also had his headphones in - he usually does. He didn\u2019t comply nor respond and it was taken as insolence. I know it is his shield from a world that is too much, his way to walk among his peers and feel okay. But I also know the sad statistics, have read the accounts of deadly misunderstandings with law enforcement officials. I understand them, and I hope to help them learn to navigate an unsafe and hostile world while being okay and accepting and understanding of themselves. That is how I help. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the child and what their specific needs are. Currently in my school (mainstream primary 400 pupils) we have 15 on the spectrum, 6 with anxiety, 1 with spins bifida, 5 with bereavement issues, 4 with undiagnosed learning difficulties \u2026\u2026, I could go on. They are all different, with different needs and requiring different approaches. I run groups to help children understand what anxiety is, I teach resilience, we put personalised support plans in to help each child face each challenge. Eg: A mum came to me because their child\u2019s class were due to start learning to play the recorder, she was worried that even with ear defenders it would be too much. We decided on a signal he could use to show the teacher he wasn\u2019t coping and that he could leave the room quietly and come to my office to do something quiet. When it came to it (much to mums surprise) he had brought in a recorder and was excitedly waiting for the lesson, and loved it! All teachers/schools have to be able to be adaptive, to think outside the box, creative and work out ways to best support each individual. A couple of days ago an ASD pupil with acute anxiety came to me in a terrible state so upset that he could barely speak, he was convinced he was in the most awful trouble. As I calmed him and unpicked the story it appeared that a ruler had fallen on the floor and he had stood on it as his friend tried to pick it up and it had broken. He was convinced that the teacher was going to kill him. I pointed out that the teacher wouldn\u2019t kill him as she wouldn\u2019t want to be arrested, sent to prison, lose her job, home and family, he then said \u2018 but I have wasted school funds and destroyed school property\u2019 I explained that we could fix it, get another ruler and explain to the teacher that it was an accident. He was desperate that the teacher should not know, \u2018I\u2019ll fix it\u2019 I said. I fetched a replacement ruler, and told him to wait with my colleague, I went to his classroom and went to his friend, in a whisper I asked where the ruler was, in my pocket was the whispered reply, I whispered \u2018give me the ruler\u2019 and the child wriggled it out of his pocket and palmed it to me under the table, I slid the new ruler out of my sleeve and gave it to him, sliding the broken ruler out of sight (up my other sleeve) \u2018Tell no one\u2019 I hissed quietly and like a spy left the room. The teacher did not know what had happened (until I told her later in the staff room) and the worried child was able to return and continue learning. Job done!! In all things, with all children, what ever their disabilities or challenges we must be creative and work with them so that they feel safe to try and safe to fail, and understand that failure is not a bad thing but an integral part of learning.

            "answer_text": "It depends on the definition of autism. All the formal training is designed for non-verbal level autistic students, which isn\u2019t valid for the level that I teach. The greatest lesson I got was the very first lesson got about it. They take things literally, and you have to be direct. Since then I\u2019ve taught 100\u2019s of students on the specturm- and I\u2019ve yet to see one exactly like the other. But I do the same general thing- set up a routine (no matter how complicated), and any change in routine is prepped. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not currently working with kids but I remember what I did. I helped them by being patient and tried to meet them where they were at socially and academically. This was the only way to be successful: keep expectations high that they could learn and build their skills but keep the expectations reasonable. Kids with any special needs are not going to outgrow all of the areas that are hard for them and they need understanding that they will always be making progress. ",
