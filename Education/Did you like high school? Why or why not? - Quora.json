            "answer_text": "I had aspects I liked and parts I definitely didn't like. Let's get the negative out of the way. My high school started at 7:05 am. Since I wasn't zoned for the school, when I drove, I had it down to the minute, I had to leave at 6:22 am. I also did ballet 5-6 nights a week an hour away from my house and took AP classes. I'd usually get 5-7 hours of sleep each night. I legitimately forgot what I looked like without bags under my eyes for awhile. I also hated driving while so tired because it scared me but I had to get to school/dance. I disliked the dresscode. I could easily put together a professional looking outfit not \u2018in' dresscode. Yet, the guys at my school could wear t-shirts with bikini clad women or women with only their nipples covered to school. By these rules, I could take a picture of myself in a bikini and put it on a guy\u2019s shirt but not wear a shirt that showed my shoulders. People missed classes, like calculus, cause they had to wait for clothes to show up. Please explain how it is more important for a straight A student in AP Calculus BC to sit in an office because their exercise shorts are too short than to be in class learning for their career (engineering in this girls case). High school also wastes a good deal of time. There's busy work from some teachers but there's time wasted on standardized testing, sitting around waiting for bells to ring, etc. You don't realize how much it adds up until you don't have it being wasted. As a former homeschooler, this annoyed me beyond belief. I was used to having my time being well managed by me and any poor uses of it being my own fault. These were the main things I was happy to leave behind. On a much better note, I enjoyed high school because AP classes grouped me most closely with people of similar intelligence and ambition. It was such a joy to work with these people. In college, you're not so neatly grouped and so I have had many head banging moments wondering if they were doing things or asking them as a joke. Also, with all the excess time comes great humor in the shenanigans people get up to. It's the little things but those 5 minutes sitting around waiting for the bell to ring can bring fun and form friendships. I loved my teachers and how well they taught me certain subjects and a love for them. In high school, I really developed a deeper interest in a number of subjects due to my teachers. They also made some of the most interesting activities, like a history debate about Columbus or reenacting different countries from 1848 through WW1 and making our own choices. Best of all, my education at this time was free! Never took that for granted. I think one of my favorite parts of high school were the opportunities I got. I was able to travel to France, New York (with my choir), Virginia, and Italy (with the history honors society) because of my high school. My apologies this isn't very cohesive. Overall, I liked many aspects of high school but wouldn't go back because I am mostly happy with how it played out. I also don\u2019t have the patience to deal with the things I disliked again. ",

            "answer_text": "To quote Dickens, It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us\u2026 These words describe perfectly well my high school experience. Or at least how I remember it. I have already told two funny stories about my high school experience (here and here, if you are interested). Time to provide the general frame. I was 14 years old when I started the high school (Harmonia Lyceum, later Museum Lyceum) and had next to no experience of dealing with people of my age (here for more details, sorry for so many links to other answers). I was very tall and heavy and looked older than my classmates despite being one year younger then them. I was extremely shy with my classmates, as already mentioned. I could not start a conversation. I could hardly raise my eyes when speaking with anyone. Natalia, the girl I was in love with, to this day remembers me as \u2018that autistic guy\u2019. Amazingly, this shyness disappeared when I was speaking with the adults. I was self-confident if not arrogant when speaking with teachers. I always started discussions, especially with teachers of History and Literature. It was not easy to deal with me. And yet they overlooked everything because I was by far the best student in the Lyceum. In fact, the Lyceum was a very peculiar place. It was one of the first private schools in Russia. The USSR existed no more, and all sorts of private enterprise started to flourish. My father, back then a businessman and an ardent believer in free market, decided that I should go to a private school. He paid $200 monthly, an absolutely incredible sum for the time when an average monthly salary in Russia was $67. Frankly speaking, I would probably have received a better education in a free state school. However, the Lyceum provided a unique experience. Some of the teachers were excellent. Classes were small, which allowed for individual contact with teachers, especially as most my classmates did not overstudy. In the same time, discipline hardly existed at all. Some kids would drink vodka and cheap wine directly in the school building. My classmates were children of businessmen, intelligentsia (Lyceum teachers could get their kids into the Lyceum for free) and one was a son of a mafioso. It were the days of the Glorious Russian Nineties, and it defined the system of values of my classmates. America was good, USSR was bad. Work in agriculture, industry or science was not cool. It was cool to be a businessman, a racketeer, a pimp, a mafioso. It was cool to smoke, to drink and (for a man) to have lots of sexual partners. In this system of values, I was not cool at all. I was a nerd. A bookworm. A hopeless bore. A fat kid. I did not smoke and had no habit of drinking alcohol. It took me two years to understand that it was not necessary at all and one could become a fairly popular kid even without following the example of others. I was obsessed with my problems - I started listening to the problems of others and discovered that others often had it even worse than I. I was unable to imitate others - by the second year, others started to imitate me. It was an incredible time. I would go from absolute despair to absolute happiness and back to despair in matter of seconds. And we did lots of crazy things - and I did them even more than others. I don\u2019t want to make this Quora answer too long so I will use another occasion to tell you about studying at the home of our Math teacher, playing cards on the roof, climbing into the window to decorate the classroom for the New Year, removing the classroom doors from the hinges, playing simultaneously chess and skittles on the same board, cutting electricity, cancelling all the lessons to celebrate the birthday of the girl I loved, about litres of alcohol and kilogrammes of chocolate consumed and other peculiarities of the Russian high school of the 1990s. I am still in contact with many of my classmates (not the son of the mafioso, though). They did not became pimps or racketeers, by the way. Our great hooligan, Mr. Tough Guy, now is a devout Christian who works on helping people to get out of alcohol addiction (he had to do it himself at a stage of his life). In October, when I was in Moscow, six of us met each other at the home of our beloved Math teacher, Nikolai Nikolaevich. Me and one of my classmates took our kids with us.  ",

            "answer_text": "I do not think I really liked the experience that much. I think saying that I endured the experience is an accurate assessment. I made up my mind to get our as quickly as was possible with a diploma and that is exactly what I did, It was not what I would characterize as a joyful experience, but neither was it horrible or unbearable. I simply did not like it, most of what I was taught was of little interest to me. I did learn some valuable lessons, things that have helped me out in the real adult world and continue to do so even 40 years after the fact. I simply did not like being there, I had to teach myself about the stuff i was really interested in. Most of the kids did not seem to be interested in the stuff i was interested in. There seems to be a romantic stereotype or myth that surrounds high school in North America, more specifically in the USA. It is supposed to be some wonderful, idyllic happy experience, where all the kids are participating in grand social events, or socializing with friends after school at some teenaged venue. Loooking foreward to the \u2018FUTURE\u201d being filled with wonder, amazement, endless opportunity, success, cutting edge technology and some eutopian eutopia. Thence graduating to adult life and enjoying the world\u2019s highest standard of living. No political upheaval, no unrest, no protests, all believing the propaganda put forth each evening by the world\u2019s most trustworthy propaganda mills. This seems to have been the mood from the 1950\u2019s. There were no drugs, alcohol or teenaged pregnancies. No crime, everybody showed up on time. Etc etc. Etc. This did not apply. We may have been brainwashed at junior school level to fantasize about how wonderful everything would be in high school, all the extra freedoms and priveleges that came with age. That did not happen. The kids were as childish as they were in junior school. The teachers lounge still operated as a Petri dish of mental illness. We did not magically transform into straight a students, the muddled lessons did not become any clearer. So, the most memorable day was the last day of school in June of 1980. I drove away and have not looked back. The whole thing has become a smaller and smaller dot in my rear view mirror. I do not anticipate attending reunions, I would rather spend ;the time with my grand children. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not done yet. 16 May. That's my last IB test. It's for Spanish. It's the last test I will have to take for high school, even though I might be there for two weeks afterwards. I refuse to say that I didn't enjoy high school because there were moments that I did enjoy. I enjoyed my junior year English teacher. She's my school mom. I enjoyed my ninth grade science teacher\u2019s dry humor, even though I did poorly in the class. I enjoyed taking Environmental Science, even though I feel like we don't do anything besides talk about Zoo animals and feel guilty about consuming meat. I enjoyed my AP US History class. I enjoyed the goofy teacher who would mock President Nixon with a Nixon mask and who I would chastise for his college sports team\u2019s bad years. There are things that I haven't enjoyed. I have enjoyed the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Junior year was fantastic; I did extremely well and almost got all As. Senior year hasn't been fantastic. It all caught up to me; 4 Internal Assessments, my Extended Essay, CAS. I wish they were spread out. College admissions has been rough too. I've applied, been accepted and been rejected (but no waitlistings). I visited 13 schools and applied to 9, one of which I never even visited. I've written essays about myself and destroyed one due to word limits that by the time I reread the essay after the whole process was done, I realized that the essay wasn't the one I hadn't originally written. I've been accepted to schools I can't afford and given money by ones I didn't want to go to. There were mistakes, such as my AP Biology class. I liked the teacher, however, as a sophomore, I just couldn't handle it. I didn't enjoy all of the all nighters and mental breakdowns. I didn't enjoy having to cry in front of my school counselor multiple times. I didn't enjoy the stress-related hives on my feet. I didn't enjoy breaking my ankle or giving myself a concussion out of frustration because I didn't understand my math homework. I don't enjoy sitting in a desk for six hours a day and expected to do four + hours of homework at home. I didn't enjoy a lot of it. It\u2019s coming to an end. My last first day of high school was 22 August, 2016. That's where I began to dislike high school. Whomever says senior is great is a liar or they just never cared about high school. I've hated this year more than anything. I've never hated school before like I did this year. I've never not wanted to go to school as much as I did this ear. That history teacher I loved so much? If I saw him today, I would probably burst into tears and run away. I've never had to see a therapist before this year. I\u2019ve never needed to do things on my own before. There's a fear to graduation. My friends are all excited, but I'm afraid. I've realized that all of my issues with this year stem from the fear of being away from my parents. There\u2019s a fear of going to college and not doing well enough or completely hating it. There\u2019s the fear of not knowing what to do once I get there. It's the end of my childhood and my transition into adulthood, and I haven't enjoyed it as much as I think I should have. ",

            "answer_text": "My middle school was every motherf***ing stereotype you could get, only worse! There was a sharp divide between the regulars and the Gifted kids. One side were the drugged idiots, and the others were the condescending elitists. God forbid you were in the middle like I was where neither group wanted you. The girls either were (and I do not use my terminology lightly) whores, otakus, or super f***ing nerdy (never discuss anything popular or they will chit chat you to death). The guys were wannabe Instagram models, otakus as well, super into videogames, or people who think they are \u201csavage\u201d. I despised middle school. I didn\u2019t fit in. I was an outcast. To give you a perfect example, my leg muscles failed and ripped when running a lap, and everyone ignored me and they even laughed and spat on me. I had to hovel myself WITH EXCRUCIATING PAIN to the nurse in order to get checked. No one even noticed I was gone. So when I entered highschool I was like: \u201cOh fun, four more years of degeneracy, lunacy, and the whole world treating me as their punching bag while I slowly slip into a sociopathic state ready to kill everyone slowly with a rusty knife. Great. Absolutely terrific.\u201d First day of class, everyone was super nice and kind. They would actually say hello and not \u201cf**k you\u201d when you tried to be nice. People actually said \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and \u201cI am worried about you\u201d for the first time in my life outside of my parents. The principal wasn\u2019t an apathetic douchebag, and the assistant principals didn\u2019t treat you as if you were in a detention hall. My classes weren\u2019t dumb or idiotic or slowed down by people who obviously didn\u2019t belong. I was around people who were high achievers and my classes were challenging but fun! MY SCHOOL HAS WINDOWS. ACTUAL. REAL. WINDOWS. The campus I go to is huge, with a nice courtyard too. Has to be, the largest school in my state. And I love it!!! <3 Seriously, I have never had more friends, opportunity, or happiness in my life so far! It feels like I\u2019m home in a sense. I\u2019ve reached that point in my life where I can just live it without too much hassle. Sure its difficult adjusting to such a high energy and positive place after living in what is essentially a hellhole for three years, but I\u2019m working on it. I have friends now, my teachers are nice, and my school\u2019s not even a block away. What\u2019s not to like? ",

            "answer_text": "One of my favorite YouTubers, David So, said this:  The reason I smile is because despite all the hardships, from academic struggles in the IB Diploma to underperforming in volleyball to bumps in relationships, I chose to make high-school fun. High-school presents a host of unique struggles; I should know, I was there. But all my memories of scrambling to get good grades are tied inextricably with incredibly enjoyable times as well. I\u2019ll never forget the time in english class when we discussed the nature of profanity, getting into intense bouts of (academic) cussing, and continuing to do so as the vice-principal walked into the classroom and then out, a little perplexed by the turn of events. Enjoying high-school is a choice. Your attitude towards high-school and everything in life is a choice. I chose, for my earlier years in high-school, not to have fun. I didn\u2019t enjoy underperforming in school and sports, and moping about losing a girl I really liked. Beginning junior year, I wanted to make a change. And I did! I instilled discipline into my life with schedules, worked my butt off to get into shape with the insanity program and got a girlfriend! High-school doesn\u2019t come without regrets. But it\u2019d be foolish to say that high-school was \u201ca living hell where everyone was against me and I was alone and school was so hard and life was so stressful\u201d. I enjoyed sitting alone in the library readings books (and eventually sitting with my old girlfriend in the library reading books together). I enjoyed struggling through different concepts in my economics classes. I even found satisfaction in solving math problems- they represented triumph over numbers (my mortal enemy). It\u2019s always up to you to take what you deserve. Go get\u2019em. ",

            "answer_text": "I loved highschool, when I was a highschool student I wasn\u2019t exactly a popular kid I was the kid everyone knew and would say hi to occasionally. My group of friends consisted of wannabe gangsters, body builders, popular smart kids, and a few girls who got pregnant too early. Most of them were cool except for 1\u20132 peeps. My classes were fun for the most part I still remember being in video editing and messing around with my friends filming horribly cringe worthy videos. And like most students P.E. was my favorite class. In my P.E. class me and my friends loved to mess around alot, making dumb jokes and inappropriate noises for fun, getting into fake fights when the teach is not around. The P.E. teacher liked our class so much that she had a pizza party for us. She was rich and went to the best pizza place in town. She bought so much that she even let students take boxes of pizza home. I was also in tennis and the team pretty much did what my P.E. class did mess around but still got the job done. Also we did not vandalize anything, nor hurt anyone outside of our group of friends and all friend had consent in these fake fight none was hurt as the punches were soft/ fake punches. It was such a good time sometimes I wish I could go back. I was very fortunate to have a positive experience in school I am glad that my school was a smaller school and people there looked out for each other even the gay kids where looked after, whoever picked on anyone did not have a good day. Even the wannabe gangsters were chill and did not mess with anyone for most of the time. ",

But I despise almost every moment in high school The only moments I've ever truly enjoyed it were moments where I was with friends. The rest of it felt like a waiting game and a sanity game. \u201cHow much longer will this jackass keep screaming \u201cHelp\u201d?\u201d (This did happen in my own school by the way) \u201cWhen will I leave this chemistry class where all we do is sit around and do nothing?\u201d I've always been asking my mom to put me into online schooling but she won't allow it. It's understandable as to why. I need to socialize (even though the schools always says that \u201cthis isn't the time to socialize\u201d) But to me, my own high school makes me depressed. Some of the teachers(at least the ones I've hear and had) are honestly a little narcissistic. It once got to the point where even my own parents saw the bullshit of my own teachers (specifically one of them). I could also talk about how the school system gets students less enthusiastic about school [1]but I'll be basically talking about the entire US school system. There are good things in high school (amazingly) like clubs. Clubs essentially help you find the right people. Good thing is that you can even make your own club as well. As long as the teacher approves it and such. There's also lunch if your lunches aren't split. And while I mentioned some teachers at my school being somewhat narcissistic. There are and always will be good teachers even if they are rare. I will say that there are more bad than good. But don't worry; after high school it gets better as long as you play your cards right you'll be fine. Footnotes[1] Student Enthusiasm Falls as High School Graduation Nears",

            "answer_text": "I was a social outcast during my brief high school experience, which was the only good part of it. In Switzerland, most people finish their grade school in the ninth year and go into apprenticeships/trade schools, where this whole deal about \u201cThe High School Experience\u201d does not apply. During my high school years, my grades were too good and my athletic abilities in contrast were nonexistent. That was a fatal combination for me as a boy. Add to that the fact that I was not getting any allowances and was sent to bed at 8:00 P.M. and you have a person that is not fun to be with or talk to. Not that it would have made a difference! I never talked to anybody. I feared being laughed at. And I feared to look into people\u2019s faces because they might react unfavorably. In class, I kept silent as well. My motto for my school times: Better to keep silent and being thought a fool than to open your mouth and removing all doubts! (I think, this is from Ben Franklin) I could not read the chalkboard for my nearsightedness. I was afraid to tell, because I would get glasses. More rejection and laughter would have been all but guaranteed. But the teacher usually told was he was writing there for us to copy. I got some of it and learned to memorize the rest. Soon, I would memorize all. What about dating? At least I was spared that humillation! Puberty did not fully set in until I was 15 or 16 years old. I had no inclinations to treat the girls any different than the boys. Ignoring everybody, mostly, hoping that they would leave me alone. I have yet to attend a high school reunion. Yes, I am still a bit resentful. But it was not their fault. However, I do not feel any need to revive these long since passed and buried times of another life, a life that luckily had come to an end a long time ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: Did you enjoy high school? I consider high school to be a chapter of my life that is now closed. I am almost two years out. You see many people have legit problems with the public education system. But I feel everyone should get to live the sterotypical, high school experience. Some say high school does a poor job at preparing youngsters for life beyond. I disagree. High school taught me so much about myself. It taught me how to deal with stress. It taught me about friendship. It taught me how to deal with rude and nasty people that may come may. It taught me not to be a wuss anymore, like I was in middle school. It allowed me to gain confidence. It made me appreciate the rewards of hard work and effort. It taught me how to interact with people. Being in that social environment for four years taught me so many life lessons. If I was homeschooled, I think things would be very different. I learned from my friendships that have come and gone in high school. I meet some good people there, but also some shitty ones. I had a friendships fall apart. I have had people who took issue with me made it known. But by the time I was done with high school, I stopped caring what other people thought of me (to a degree, of course). Being in high school means you're going to make mistakes. That\u2019s inevitable. But teenagers need to make those mistakes to learn. I can certainly atest to that. And I was the innocent one. Not doing drugs going to school high on Mondays, not drinking, not vaping in the bathrooms. Everyone in high school is going to make mistakes. These are 14 to 18 years olds, by the way. I enjoyed high school for two main reasons. One is that I developed a connection with these people in my Class of 2016. Even though we all didn't know each other personally, we all know we graduated together. We share general experiences of what happened in our high school. The scandals, secrets, and the bad teachers! Two: The memories. I laughed to the point of tears so many times during those four years. Lots of funny stuff happened, and it wasn't just confined to the classroom. The projects I did with people were cool at times. Me doing the high school newspaper in Senior year and interviewing my acquaintances. The movies I watched. So many memories. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I did, although it was the strictest school I\u2019ve ever been in. My school had many strict rules back then, like: We could only go home on weekends, which means we stayed in the school the whole week (from Monday to Saturday afternoon).We had to wake up 5AM every morning to do exercise. Students who wake up later (skip exercise) were physically punished later at night.No electronic devices allowed, which means no phone, no mp3 player, no laptop. They said that those devices keep us from fully concentrated from studying. Another reason for that rule is the school\u2019s privacy, they did many heavy physical punishments everyday, which is illegal.Especially, 12th grade (final year) students study place is completely quiet most of the time, and have to follow different set of rules: Could only go home once every 3 months. You are only allowed to leave the school for 2\u20133 hours on Sunday evening to buy stuffs in the nearby supermarket.Get up at 5.30 AM every morning, but no more exercise. They decided to let us sleep for 30 minutes more, which was great.And here\u2019s the crazy thing. We had class from 6A.M to 10 P.M from Monday to Saturday. Of course, we had breaks in the morning/ afternoon/ evening for eating purpose or just relaxing, which was 30 minutes each. In addition, 5PM to 6PM was the time for sport + showering.You might wonder what were we studying the whole time. Basically, we Vietnamese have a university entrance exam after the 12th grade, which I think is the same with many other countries in the world. It\u2019s life-changing exam. We study for 12 years for that moment. After those hours, you either become a future doctor or become parents\u2019 disappointment. What really made me enjoy my highschool are strict rules. No electronic devices means no distraction. Those 3 years in my high school was just studying/eating/sleeping. After graduating, I find it so hard to keep focus like when I was in high school.The school\u2019s name is Nguyen Khuyen or NK in short. When we were still high school students, we called it NKP, which means NK prison, where you can just study but nothing else. After graduating, NKP becomes NK paradise, where you can just study and don\u2019t have to worry about anything else.Honestly I miss that place sometimes!  ",

            "answer_text": "Some of the best moments in my life occurred during my years in High School. I met best friends who are still in touch with me till now, my first love, some hot women teachers ( damn I still remembered them ), I had fun with friends after school, did school pranks occasionally, discussed about video games and movies, talked about the prettiest girls in our schools and how to get their attention and other memorable things. In my country people say \u201c Masa paling indah adalah di SMA \u201d it says you had your best days in high school. But there were bad times I had in High School when : I forgot to finish my homework and got scolded by teacher.During math lessons, our teacher was famous for telling students to come forward to finish math problems on the white board and when you could not do it, you would stand in front of the class until the teacher told you to go back to your seats.During physical exercises, I hated it when it came to our schedule to go to local swimming pool and had swimming lessons. I could not swim and had troubles keeping myself floating on the waters.Not wearing complete uniform attributes during Monday because every Monday morning, we had mandatory flag ceremony and if you did not show up with complete uniform attributes, you could be punished by standing in front of the flag pole for 15 minutes.Teachers gave us a lot of home works.I was not the smartest kid but I was not bad student either and If I had a time machine, I would like to return to those days when I became high school students. I missed moment like this which I had before in my high school  I hated moment like this when local top government officials came to our school and explained about the government programs and you had to participate.  We were to young to be informed things like, national defense policies, five year long term government programs and others we did not understand because were still too young My favorite moment : Basketball competition against other high schools. If you won, you would look cool to the girls in your school and if you lost, you lost with pride  High School time is the best ",

To me personally, it just felt like a waste of time. I had \u201cfun\u201d fun, but that meant just hanging around with friends doing fuck all. That fun, in hindsight, didn't really add any value to my life. It wasn't a surprise I failed my last year in high school. It was only because some teachers actually implemented that list above, specifically geared towards me, I finally flourished. I was about to be the usual drop-out, as a result of a typical school trajectory. Following the A-B-C of school, my behaviour was deemed inappropriate. I should have been a dropout, who knows, even ending up on the streets. I succeeded because of others. I was lucky, many others weren\u2019t. ",

But if you\u2019re asking about everything else, the big chunk of high school, it\u2019s the worst. I can\u2019t wait to get out and go to college, in fact, I\u2019m applying to colleges right now. Go class of 2018 :) I\u2019m ready to leave because I\u2019m ready to learn about things I actually WANT to learn about. In high school, you\u2019re forced and obligated to take classes that have nothing to do with your actual interests. When will I ever have to solve a polynomial or work with conic sections if I want to be in media? This is stupid. Also in high school, you\u2019re with the same classmates all the time, so it\u2019s easy to gossip about each other because everyone\u2019s bored and everyone\u2019s with everyone. In college, I don\u2019t think gossiping will be too apparent, or at least I hope not? In college, we\u2019ll take classes we want to take and be able to be with people who are interested in the same things we are. There are also tons of clubs to join, and I\u2019ll have independence and freedom away from home. I\u2019m going to meet so many new people, get internships, maybe get a job, I mean\u2026 I\u2019m excited just talking about life after high school. I know the workload in college will probably be very heavy, but it if it\u2019s work that I want to do, I\u2019ll be fine. Part of the reason why I had anxiety in junior year of high school was because of the crazy amount of standardized tests and homework that was so far away from my passions- I had to do them for the grades. I\u2019ll miss my family a lot, and I\u2019ll miss this time where the current friends in my life are the only friends I know, but at the same time, I\u2019m ready for this change. Bye high school! You kinda sucked but you were also kind of interesting. ",

My first thought was that\u2026high school doesn\u2019t really do much but force the idea of having to go to college to kids at a low level of learning and especially teens. It doesn\u2019t support the idea of branching out. It just \u201cprepares you for the real world.\u201d That real world part is another big thing. It\u2019s the dumbest excuse I have ever heard! While at school today something happened and it surprised me. After lunch, I was going to class and my friend was beside me. Someone, a girl who we knew, pulled his ear he said, \u201cPlease, stop touching me!\u201d He said it considerably loud that the principal could hear. So what did she do? She gave him a detention\u2026with the excuse of being too loud. Now switch their positions. He pulls her hair and she yells, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d He gets a detention. Or maybe even a suspension but nothing happens to her. This has happened multiple times. And it's annoying, especially in high school. Is that how a school should be maintaining a high school? By teaching the future women of our society that they are above men with the lazy excuse of the real world. It\u2019s pathetic. Instead of teaching the future generation to avoid this they skip that and put women on top of men. So my thoughts on high school? It favors one gender, it doesn\u2019t support creativity, and it's just plain boring. ",

After 6th grade, all the town kids came together. All of a sudden, I was a small fish in a big pond. It was quite a shock at first. I had several friends and we had a lot of fun. I still hang out with one of my very best friends after 52 years. Grades 1\u20136 were kind of a rough time for me because me and the teachers didn't see eye-to-eye. After that things improved. The main problem I had with high school (grades 9\u201312) was that I wasn't real popular with the girls. Some of the boys I paled around with in earlier years began to shun me. They were popular with the girls and didn't want to be seen with me. This really hurt me deeply. Kids can be really mean sometimes. Overall, I guess I was fortunate. I didn't have to face punishments and strict teachers every day like some in the world do today. So yeah, I liked high school. There were more positives than negatives. ",

            "answer_text": "It was a huge roller-coaster to be honest. 9th grade: I enjoyed high school in the beginning because I didn\u2019t have to deal with the hormonal hell called middle school. I also didn\u2019t have to follow some stupid dress code anymore, where I was only allowed to wear jeans and a t shirt. I also had some really cool teachers that let me do whatever I wanted because they liked me and I also had improved my social skill a bit more. However, this was only the first semester and the second semester was hell and I failed Algebra terribly and I felt worthless because I didn\u2019t have extracurriculars. 10th grade: This had been the best year for me so far, I was a varsity athlete, My grades had been better then before and I had finally found an interest in psychology with a bunch of seniors while I was the only sophomore, I felt smart. I also had found two really good friends that I am very close too and we share many interests. I also felt so brave because I approached a guy I really liked. Let me continue this, I stopped at 10th grade months ago.. 11th grade: Things started going downhill again, I didn\u2019t take the SAT or ACT because I finally made my choice to to go to community college. I failed math once again, My US History teacher hated me. My counselor hated me. I had a bunch of anxiety attacks, but on the bright side I took 2 AP classes (did well in them to be honest.) 12th Grade (currently): Things are looking positive, good grades (because of a super easy schedule to be honest.) 5 classes instead of 6. Making new friends, learning new skills. Finally coming to terms with my past because I thought I was a failure because of my shitty grades but I am getting another chance because of community college. Being proud of the people I once hated because of their Ivy Leagues and UC acceptances. However, what saddens me the most is that I grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other since elementary school, some I never talked to until this year and I realized people are so cool when you give them a chance. I am graduating on June 7th and only on that day will I know if I truly enjoyed high school. However, the weirdest part is for the past four years I wanted to graduate so badly. Now once that day is coming closer I feel more and more depressed, I started to realize how much I\u2019d rather be with the people I\u2019ve known since kindergarten then complete strangers. Its also strange because my actions that I once could get away with is now going to be replaced by adult responsibilities. ",

I love being assigned tons of homework in each class so that I have to stay up to 2 AM. I love having to get up at 4:30 AM because my school, for reasons, starts so fucking early at 7. I love how several of my teachers unashamedly express their bigotry (including both sexism and homophobia) and their belief and always try to say \u201cStudents, you should also be a bigot like me!\u201d and \u201cYou should have to check if you have some disorder about your gender because you are too close to friends of same sex\u201d. I love how my previous Maths teacher taught us to learn Maths by memory rather than thinking logically, whereas my current one is always scolding at students when they can\u2019t accomplish all the homework because they lack ability to solve it (which is because of the previous teacher XD). I could go on forever, but in short, I abso-fucking-lutely enjoy my school; thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. I wish I could just shrug off my years in high school as uneventful, but they were more than just passing classes and fitting in. The environment felt so superficial, I would inwardly grimace when people tried to act genuine. It was suffocating. Some popular kids would sometimes talk to me about assignments, stuff the teacher said, things they need to borrow from me, or something mundane and insignificant. Most of the time, they would openly gossip or complain to me, as if I agreed with their biased, unfounded opinions. Sometimes, they would discuss issues in school that need intervention (eg. bullying, physical fights). Then, if they witnessed such issues, they ignored them and went about their day. They seemed caring, but their actions and thoughts said otherwise. It didn't help that I was going through my angsty, emotional phase. I had a pessimistic, cynical view of high school. My faith in humanity had dipped, at that point. Even the way my teachers taught and graded wasn't real to me. I received average grades, but I felt something could be done to make class more enjoyable. I ended up disliking schoolwork and the majority of my classes. But there's one upside to high school. I had fun cracking inside jokes with my friends during lunch. Occasionally, our conversations would be overly polite and awkward, but they kept me company. I appreciate them. Other than that, high school left a bad taste in my mouth. I can breathe a little easier in college. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone who says that high school years are the best of your life needs a nice, solid slap in the face and a serious reality check. In high school, you are gangly and angsty as you transition into adulthood. The Class D athletes think they're hot shit. The gossipy kids torture each other. Physical fights are rampant. The teachers are as cliquey as the students. If you're not a \u201ccool kid\u201d, you're useless. Tell me what's enjoyable about any of that. In high school I was well-liked but not popular. I kept to myself. I pretty much wanted to get in, get my diploma, and get out. I saw some genuine cruelty and injustice in those walls. College was a welcome release from the pettiness. The kids who were into all of the vicious drama haven't seemed to grow up in the four years since graduation. I couldn't wait to get away from their toxicity. Evidently I was right. ",

            "answer_text": "I went to a private school from 9th to 12th grade and academically speaking, it was good. Not a lot of homework, ridiculous tests being thrown at you without any knowledge, teachers helped you and let you work on whatever missing work whenever you wanted to. Socially, it wasn't terrible but it was decent. I made 5 good friends in the beginning of 9th grade and we did a lot of things together all 4 years. Most people hated the school I think mainly because of the social aspect of it. We had proms, and dances but not a lot of extracurricular activities. We did have sports like Soccer, Lacrosse, Track and Basketball. I wasn't really interested in those things and honestly I should've joined Lacrosse but looking back I could honestly care less. But the 1 thing I did like about the social aspect of the school was the girls that came with it and the hot teachers I talked to. After high school I went to trade school and I made more friends there and including the job I worked at as a life guard. Looking back I only enjoyed the stuff I did outside of school with my friends and the girls I dated. Other than that, I don't care. Making friends after high school is better because there is no clique bullshit and you have more freedom. That's were I think the peak is at. ",

            "answer_text": "I did, actually. I graduated in the spring of 2016, and even though all throughout high school I had tons of times where I thought, \u201cI hate it here\u201d at the same time, I knew that once I graduated, I\u2019d miss high school. I had a lot of good times even though I was anxious and nervous half the time about classes where I had no friends and classes where I had to talk in front of the class a lot. I have a lot of good memories and it felt nice knowing what I was doing, you know? Because I took a gap year and I\u2019ll be off to college in the fall and I\u2019m terrified that I won\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing or what I\u2019m going to do. In high school, mostly during junior and senior year, it was the perfect mix of freedom and security for me. I was still at home with my parents, not completely on my own, but I was old enough to drive and go where I needed or wanted on my own. Now I find myself missing classmates or schoolmates I never thought I\u2019d miss, and thinking about all the funny moments, or even the little things like sitting in silence in our special spot on some mornings that my friends and I just had no energy. When my best friend comes over, we always end up looking back on high school memories at some point. When I wake up in the morning, I think about how I kind of miss getting ready for school, driving and then walking from my parking spot to the school itself. There were too many times during high school where I almost died of laughter because of something funny that happened. I can\u2019t say or predict how college will be. I\u2019m scared and nervous, but it\u2019s not like I can go backwards in time. ",

Firstly this was my High School  Practically in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by a beautiful estate, full of only guys with a sprinkling of female staff my high school experience was certainly unique when compared to what most experience. Now that I have had a few years outside of the school to reflect more soberly on my experience I can unequivocally and without a doubt say I enjoyed high school. Although this experience was certainly not for everyone and many really struggled to fit in. This was not unique to our school but it was certainly exasperated by the isolation and typical boarding school culture. Regardless there is a brotherhood and camaraderie that is fostered at the school which translates out into the greater world linking us all in our shared experience.  Michaelhouse was and continues to be outstanding school, although by no means perfect. I look back fondly on my time there, the values instilled in us continue to shape the man that I am today. As our founder James Cameron Todd said on the first ever speech day in 1897: \u201cOur aim is to make, not accountants, not clerks, not clergyman, but men; men of understanding, thought and culture\u201d  Michaelhouse Armour For Life ",

            "answer_text": "High school is something like a page, that is darkened and with some burnt spots in my life. I don\u2019t really enjoy it. The first day of school after the long end of year break makes me feel excited. I have a friend that has been in the same class with me since middle school, a few acquaintance that are nice, and a few unfamiliar faces. The teachers are quite nice, not too strict or too picky with us. Then I was appointed as the deputy class representative, and I felt devastated. Why? Because I will not have time left for my early dinner after sending the class\u2019s homework to the teacher\u2019s office. Oh, our school has a rule that even class representatives can\u2019t go to the teacher\u2019s office during lessons. Due to me skipping meals, I got quite the severe gastric. I started to get absent from classes, and of course, my homeroom had to choose another deputy class representative. Finally free, right? That\u2019s that, but there were also a few things that worsen my high school life. Bullies. Luckily, they didn\u2019t dare to bully others physically, but just verbally. So, even though you are not physically hurt, you will be emotionally hurt. This might seemed alright at first, but the situation worsen. My small group of friends kept getting dissed by that bullies. Sometimes, our stuffs were gone when we need it, but at the end of the day, the item magically found it\u2019s way towards our desk. Oh, and they sometimes tries to accuse us for cheating on exams, even though they are the ones trying to cheat. This accusation was due to us having better grades than them. I had to went to the school\u2019s counseling to calm myself. My family situation at that time didn\u2019t help either, as my relatives are fighting over the inheritance my paternal grandmother left us. Luckily, she left a will and we got what we deserved as the only grandchildren that carries the family name (it\u2019s a heritage where the family will always favors the son rather than daughters, in fact, they already got lots of money when she was still alive). Due to all this conflict, I didn\u2019t do well in high school. I no longer has the interest in attending extra curricular activities compared to the me in middle school. I hide myself more in the school library, where I have the peace and quiet. I got called nasty things, where I am a loser nerd, good for nothing, ugly and fat, a slut for having a boyfriend (they kind of like my ex at that time, and got jealous that we have a relationship). They don\u2019t do it at my back, but discussing and laugh about it right in front of me. I choose to ignore, and focus on my studies. At least I still have my friends, which we stay friends until today. The only best day of my life during high school is the day when we got our results of our high school national exam, which can be the most important exam in our life. I got 7 As and 3 Bs, but I heard the bullies crying when they open their result slip. It seems that they fail their exams, and have to retake again. I hope I don\u2019t see them again in any other events in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "With a few exceptions, I did not like high school. During my first two years, I tried hard to be liked and popular, but soon found that endeavor exhausting and unrewarding. I got elected class president sophomore year, but socializing a lot felt unnatural when I just wanted some quiet time. In this respect, I felt a little stifled. High school placed constraints on what I could do and who I should be. High school want me to be brilliant, athletic, and well-liked. And it succeeded at making me this way. Overall, I found attending a competitive public high school constricting. Personally, I didn't make many close friends. After school, I would usually just head home alone. I had one good friend and that's it. I like college a lot more because the relationships and conversations go deeper. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, no. The way high school depicted in movies, books, or stories is fascinating. You got a group of friends that always support you. The thing about having a crush with your senior. The way that you will carelessly leave school without any burden. You are mentally healthy and the bad is \u2018bad\u2019. No backtalking, no act like your good friend, telling you that she/he is your enemy. Whatsoever. And you won\u2019t live like this is your last chance. In reality, I\u2019m never happy. Okay, maybe that\u2019s a bit too much. I\u2019m happy when surrounded by positive people, everyone is so helpful, they wanted to also give me some tips or solutions for my problems, and they are honest and kind. But everything isn\u2019t under your control. The countless essays, projects, group assessment, or even a homework with 50+ questions. That\u2019s really fine for me. And toxic people came in. I never thought that their opinion would matter much for me. I\u2019m overwhelmed and barely can relieve the stress I got from their talking(badmouthing to be exact). Sometimes I forget it, but when my condition isn\u2019t good, it started to affect my whole mind. I never knew, that someone will be this negative. ",

I didn\u2019t care about football. All I wanted to do was take AP classes and graduate. I did. I was 17 years old. I resented not having been able to graduate a year earlier.

            "answer_text": "I have fond memories. I was on the fringes of the \u2018popular group\u2019 because I was involved in several sports so people sort of knew who I was. We had some cliques like the rich kids, the good lookers and cheerleaders, the greasers, the kiss ups who always raised their hand and ran for student government, the kids who were from working class Pitcairn who hung out together. (Of course, there was some overlap between groups.) I had friends in each group and I liked and respected them very much. I could not wait to go to my 10 year reunion and see everyone from high school. When it neared I began to ask former classmates if they were going and got some shocking answers. Many who were in the popular groups or the kiss ups who I thought had their high school world by the tail said something like, \u201cHell no, I am not going to that, I hated high school and I do not want to be reminded of those miserable years.\u201d So there was a range. Some, like me, really enjoyed high school. But others, including some that surprised me, hated it. Now my 60th reunion is coming up. I will not miss it. See you class of 68! ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. I went to two different high schools. The first one was okay. We had some interesting subjects like Woodworking and metalworking, I had friends in various groups and there wasn\u2019t too many bad social experiences. Second high school was awful since I had to move to an entirely new city and start from scratch. I didn\u2019t know how to talk to the new people so I was very isolated. It was mostly my fault since they were all nice, I just felt anxious and uncomfortable when I was around them. So I left after 5 months and did homeschooling until I was 16. Then I got a fulltime job for a month, moved back to my previous town and have been doing a tafe course ever since. So I\u2019ve only done about 1 and a half years of real high school, everything I did after that was too avoid going back. ",

Tiny tiny school.) which gives an hour and a half of homework a night, and 3\u20134 hours extra on random nights and even more closer to test time, along with our \u201celectives\u201d that are just bs busy work i\u2019d hate it. As of now where I take all CP classes and an art class and study hall, I like it a bit more. I personally think I could learn and achieve more in a free will environment, but now I have the ability to do it at home and through college classes at my local uni. I enjoy it to an extent, but I can't wait to leave. I don't care to deal with people who I have trouble being around either. I do believe it could be way worse. So yes, I enjoy aspects of high school (art class and free time) to an extent, but mostly no I do not. ",

We didn\u2019t have strict divisions by categories, like jocks, popular kids (in a strict sense), nerds, etc. It was more of the same as middle school, except that the boys had weird tiny mustaches. I studied with the same kids daily since the age of 6. So, by high school, we were essentially like brothers and sisters. I remember one day we were having a large family event and my classmates were loitering around our home. So, my mom sat them all down in the kitchen and made them peel potatoes. ",

There was only one teacher I disliked in any capacity, but other than that, I liked them, they were mostly understanding and supportive, and I got to know some of them on a more personal level than I expected to. There were quite a few like-minded people with whom I either discussed and shared writing, attended drama classes, indulged in musical theatre, or all of the above. Sometimes, I didn\u2019t enjoy high school greatly; there was at least one teacher who I found too rigid and dismissive for my taste, and the rehearsal schedules for the musicals were usually ridiculously long, so for roughly half of the production cycle of any given musical I was in I was quite miserable (my last year was an improvement in that regard, though). I also had quite a few panic attacks in the last two years, but taken as a whole, I enjoyed high school very much; I met quite a few interesting, opinionated, and open-minded personalities, most everyone was good to me, and I came out of it feeling like I learned something, so as a result I enjoyed it overall.

            "answer_text": "Going through high school can be a very difficult and stressful time. At least it was for me. Piles of homework, merciless teachers and annoying classmates. Alongside that I found some of my best friends and met people that shaped a part of what I am today. Depending on the situation it was either the greatest thing that happened to me or the worst. I graduated from high school two years ago. In the last months of school I didn\u2019t go regularly as I already had my grades and it wasn\u2019t compulsory. Even though I had no reason to, I had a feeling that I wanted to go. Why would I go back to the place that I spent almost 5 years at, not all of them pleasurable? After prom I realized that I would never go through the front door as a student, I won\u2019t sit at my desk everyday with the people I grew so close. It really is an interesting thing, how you don\u2019t value things in your life until they are gone. It can seem that half of the things you study don\u2019t matter at all, that you can\u2019t find your place, but don\u2019t despair. Take full advantage of the time you spend there. You think time moves slow. It doesn\u2019t. High school went by like a flash although it felt like an eternity. It all boils down to how you approach it. Just grab the bull by the horns and believe in yourself. If you do that, you\u2019re unstoppable. ",

Nothing special, wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t particularly good either. My class wasn\u2019t the best I could get in - if anything, it was characterized by constant gossiping and very often, heated arguments between certain individuals. I had two classmates who literally started pulling each other\u2019s hair and kicking and 5 teachers barely separated them so the situation wouldn\u2019t escalate into a full fight. There were many good and bad moments, so I\u2019m not really sad that it all passed now. ",

I remembered AP Lang class where we would enact Shakespeare plays. I remembered fridays I used to watch movies with my friends after school and played cards during lunch time. The cards were banned. I remembered when our school used to have final exams but now they stopped and replaced them with quarter assessments. Oh the years passed by since freshmen year.

I did my high school in China. Every day I was drowned in exams, mock exams, tons and tons of math, English, etc. Our grades were publicized. After students were ranked according to their grades, the ranking would be in the bulletin and visible to everyone. We all know who was the top or bottom of the class. I have no life. During the years in high school I didn't know what was going on in the world. I didn't know how to make breakfast, open a bank account, use an Excel, lead a team, etc. For 16 hours a day 7 days a week, I sat at my desk doing math, English, politics, geography and history. When I graduated from high school, I was mentally a 10-year-old. I slept four and a half hours a day almost every day. It's totally unimaginable for me now. I sleep eight hours a day, and I can't function at all if I sleep less than six hours. Whoever loves such a life must be a masochist. ",

I would count down the minutes until it was time to go home. Having social anxiety was very difficult. My participation in all classes was nil (actually, the same was also true for college and graduate school). Oh, and the food sucked. The only positive thing for me was seeing friends during the day. I guess it wasn't all bad. ",

My bullies became some of my good friends! Our priorities changed from being childish to talking about girls or playing the guitar and forming a band. We discussed about heavy metal music and what our majors would be in college. Oh, and facial hair happened. All in all, high-school was very enjoyable - my first Ibanez guitar, my first major crush and so many other moments to be cherished! ",
