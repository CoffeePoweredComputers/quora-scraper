The American education system is fractured by design, so I don\u2019t count that. It may be in a state of emaciation due to funding, but it\u2019s certainly not damaged directly. As for \u201cno longer in one piece or in working order\u201d - this is definitely not the case. As I\u2019ve said recently in other posts, the American education system is exactly, precisely, and specifically what the American people (as a voting majority) want it to be. People often get very angsty when I say that, so allow me to explain: \u201cHow can you say we want the system to be like this? (Insert example of genuinely bad, inarguably frustrating American education system issue.)\u201d A ten year old boy approaches his father with a request for a new video game console. The console costs 500 dollars. The father listens intently and nods. \u201cOkay. There are two ways you can make this happen. You can either give up some extra personal time and mow lawns, wash cars, and so on, and make the money yourself. Or we can pull money from your allowance and save it up over time - you can give up your Friday afternoon arcade money, basically.\u201d The son immediately balks. He doesn\u2019t want either of those things to happen. Neither of those things are acceptable. The father: \u201cThen you don\u2019t really want a new video game console.\u201d Everything in life - absolutely positively everything - has an opportunity cost. When people tell me that they want education to improve, I think (but don\u2019t often/always say) some of the following things: Do you even know who makes decisions about educational policy?Do you know which politicians make those decisions?Do you know how to contact them?Have you ever tried to contact them?Have you ever examined what the things you want to see changed would cost?Have you ever, specifically and directly, pointed out the other things you would be willing to exchange to make these things happen?Have you ever, specifically and directly, identified the benefits of this change you propose - surely you\u2019re not just off-the-cuff directing major changes to thousands of lives (some of those changes affecting them for decades on decades?)Have you ever attempted to rally general support from enough people to influence change through a grassroots swell?Have you ever attempted to be a part of the system and create change through being an exemplar from the inside?And when the answer to 90% of those questions is \u201cno,\u201d then the answer is simple: You don\u2019t really want a change in the education system. You want to talk about changes to the system. You want to internet-activist those changes; you want to imagine how magical changes would make everything better without actually thinking through the day-to-day specific and concrete implications of those changes. You want to imagine the world would magically agree with your changes. You want to imagine that budgets and training costs and personnel are infinite. You want to imagine that all students are compliant and all teachers don\u2019t have personal lives they might not be willing to infinitely sacrifice. Maybe, at best, you made one feeble attempt at talking to a school principal once (who, by the way, has an amazingly small ability to impact education policy) and on failing there, you threw your hands up and decried the problem as permanently \u201cbroken.\u201d You don\u2019t.really.want.a.change. You want to be an armchair quarterback who wants to win without sweating. So no - the education system isn\u2019t broken. It\u2019s doing exactly what people, as a majority, really want it to do. Definition 2: \u201cHaving Given Up All Hope. Despairing.\u201d Oklahoma and Kentucky are proof enough that no one\u2019s given up hope. A despairing teacher quits and finds other work - they don\u2019t travel to the state capital and go without pay to fight for a cause. A teacher on my hallway today is proof enough that hope exists. Stays late every day. Shows up early every day. Always positive. Veteran teacher. Frankly, I\u2019m proof that hope still exists. I entered the profession fifteen years ago, because I wanted to change things. I\u2019ve changed a lot of things, locally. I know what I\u2019m doing here, now, and so I\u2019m trying to climb the food chain to make changes that impact larger, broader areas. I really DO want a change in the education system, and I\u2019m using one of the methods that works to make that happen. Education isn\u2019t broken in any sense of the word\u2026 but it could use a few more people who actually want to improve it. If that\u2019s really you, take the time to find out the best method and get to work. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with the American education system is inequality. The wealthy schools in America provide a world class education. The poor schools in America provide a third world education. American schools are funded partially by property taxes so there is a national average funding gap of about $1500 per student between the rich and poor schools. [1] That means that the wealthy schools have better facilities, resources, and they can pay more to attract better teachers. The poor schools get less and they get the teachers who are left over. Here is the latest PISA test, which is an international test to rank the education system of different countries. These are reading scores ranked by how many students in the US school are on free and reduced lunch.  Here is the rankings by country for that test.  The wealthy schools would be ranked #1 in the world and the poor schools would be tied with the Slovak Republic. [2] Notice that the US is about in between of those extremes? It\u2019s not that the American education system is broken. It\u2019s that the voters and politicians have chosen to fund wealthy kids over poor kids. The system is working exactly like it was designed to work. The countries who rank at the top of that list do so because their scores are more equal among socioeconomic levels. [3] If America wants to move to the top of the list, then it needs to do a better job of finding schools with poor students. I don\u2019t know that America has any intention of doing that in the near future.
