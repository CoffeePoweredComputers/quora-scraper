            "answer_text": "According to science, both XY or XX give quantitative trait locus, it means that both of your genes give add up a trait and you express the sum, just like height or average weight. So in average a small person and a tall person with well distributed locus (half their size in each gen) will give birth to a medium person, something like: (As an example, I am not using real values) 1 meter woman (X 0.5 locus + X 0.5 locus) + 2 meter man (X 1m locus + Y 1m locus) will give birth a 1.5m son (X 0.5m locus + Y 1m locus) The problem comes when you mix people with different locus, lets say one person can be 2m, but one loci gives him 1.5m and the other 0.5 gets a son with someones with the same trait and locus, the possibilities are: a 1m son (0.5+0.5), a 2m son(1.5 + 0.5) and a 3m son (1.5m and 1.5m), so chances are they can have a smaller, equal or taller son, IQ has the same locus description. But thankfully people that followed mendel further studied this topic and identified that the highest propable outcome is the average of both parents, so unless the parents have really bad luck (if you consider high IQ a misfortune\u2026.. well, it is) the children will inherit worst traits and be low IQ , or if they have \u201cgood luck\u201d the child could be even above them in IQ, but odds are that he will mostly be between them. Curiosly enough, Y loci is said to hold a higher capacity in IQ traits, so if the father is inteligents there is a higher posibility of the child been more intelligent than in an scenario where the mother is the High IQ one. Farewell friend. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is impossible to answer. While intelligence is heritable, it is unpredictably heritable. You could probably find several thousand genes in the human genome that have something to do with intelligence, which can then interact with each other in millions of different ways. Then when you toss in environment, which is arguably a bigger factor in human intelligence than genetic variance, you're fooling yourself if you think you can predict anything about how the kids will turn out.
