            "answer_text": "I do not remember a time being unable to read, but when I was growing up there were still people who could speak but who could neither read or write. When I was quite young I remember an incident involving an older man stopping by the car parked on Robins Avenue after Mass one Sunday morning. He asked my father for \"a ride in your machine.\" We were full and couldn't provide that, but when he pulled out a piece of paper, my father read it to him.I had to ask about him while we were driving home. My father said that many people knew the man; he was not homeless, but didn't have a car. That didn't shock me. Even his calling or car, \"your machine\" wasn't that odd to me. Then my dad told me, before I could ask, \"He cannot read.\" Thant shocked me. I had assumed that everyone could read.I thought that school is where you learned to read better, bur since there was never a time I could recall when I couldn't read, the thought that some people -- adults! -- could not read at all was alien to me.I had discovered that there were people, even adults, who could speak, but could not read or write.I asked special education teachers if their students knew that they were unable to do what most of the rest of the school could do. They all said that their students knew full well that they had a much more difficult time learning and that their schoolmates could do easily and quickly what they could not.I assume that people who can neither read nor write know that such skills exist and that most other people possess them, but that they do not.It must be incredibly irritating not to be able to read the instructions on a prescription bottle or on a purchased item. Maybe they learn other skills to compensate. Surely they learn early which restroom to use and what street signs mean.On the other hand, universal education is not all that old a process, and for centuries there were people who could understand and perhaps speak in more than one language, but who could neither read nor write. I have read that an illiterate villager in Medieval England would have been able to understand at least three languages -- a developing English, French, and Latin, but could not read any of them.Most anyone living in the Roman Republic or Empire could use Latin, Greek, and their native area's language, but might not be able to read or write any of them.Perhaps, in earlier times, people didn't feel much of a loss if they were unable to read and write, but I cannot imagine anything but frustration for anyone today.

            "answer_text": "Old question, but I lived in Thailand for 3 years, and because of my personal circumstances I never learned more than a few basic words in Thai that I could speak. Most long term expats there who have acquired a modicum of fluency in the Thai language, can speak it, but a vast majority cannot read it. I presume it\u2019s a similar feeling but it may be different than being completely illiterate in any language (or your main language). Being illiterate in Thai language in Thailand with it\u2019s \u201csquiggly\u201d characters means at best you can recognize certain patterns in certain locations as what similar signs you may find in your first language (for example \u2018exit\u2019 signs in parking lots), but without a reference written language to associate to, perhaps true illiterates can still associate it to the idea of a \u2018parking lot exit\u2019.
