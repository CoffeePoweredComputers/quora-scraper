            "answer_text": "The benefits are limitless as we utilize technology for everything and this fact will only increase as the years to come. What you will be doing by learning about Computer Science basics is generating a foundation that you can build a lucrative career around... but if money is not your drive, then you can use that same foundation to develop systems to support humanitarian efforts. I could give a hundred examples but I feel you understand the point I am trying to make. I am deeply grateful for the path that has been placed before me with respect to Technology and its advancement. Just remember, do not give up! p.s. - A strong background in mathematics will be beneficial once you begin to engage in higher level concepts... but it is not a requirement. ",

            "answer_text": "Deciding on a laptop; I\u2019ve been asked this question countless times on Quora, and the answer is \u201cit doesn\u2019t really matter\u201dThat\u2019s all I can think of. We don\u2019t expect new students to know much (or really anything) about CS or programming, because most don\u2019t have any background when they start. I\u2019ve also found it irrelevant; the ones with some background don\u2019t have much of an advantage, and often have a lot of ego tied into a little knowledge. The courses are challenging. The work is hard. Programming is hard. Expectations are high. Tests are test. Finding internships and jobs is hard (although easier than for majors in other subjects). An education should be hard, and unlike many of my peers, I\u2019ve never been pressured to make my courses easier or to take a lighter hand while grading. Even getting admission into a program can be very hard. ",

            "answer_text": "Warning: Answer focused to Indian Education. Although the scenario may vary from place to place, but on a general case, students are not explained even basic topics properly. Only some students realize the gravity of words casually mentioned by professors in their lectures (maybe due to time constraint). Example: POSIX, mentioned casually, taken lightly and moved upon. At the end of their 4 year long courses, most students have no idea why was POSIX even there. (Unless someone researched and read opinions like these. ) My solution: We started a publication, The Bit Theories , where we try to explain complicated topics via very short and fun articles. You may want to click \u201cFOLLOW\u201d at The Bit Theories . Read less, learn more! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Most computer science students are never exposed to the problems of designing big systems, which require attention to all sorts of things that can simply be ignored in small systems. For example, a condition that requires a system reset with a probability of 1 in 100,000,000 can usually be ignored in a small system. In a big system, it will jump up and bite you every few seconds, so the system won't work at all. ",

Its magic. That you can create something and it will be used by everyone (if u share it) You can create any app by sittingon ur sytem which can be used by anyone\u2026 It will be hard at starting but it is very nice it also teaches you to think from different ways..
