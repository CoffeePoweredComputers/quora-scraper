            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not fixed my friend. Previously, I was working as a Managed Network Expert, so, I used to select the topic on which I want to work, then they used to provide hard copy containing questions via courier to my home address. At that time the payment for per question solved by me varied from Rs 60 to Rs 190. After that they stopped giving questions to me on offline mode basis and put me in an online Expert Answerer Community. Pros in EA Community: I can able to work at any time according to my wish, though the peak hour to work is from 02:00AM to 07:00AM IST.I can take as many questions as I can.Hassle free work without someone questioning you that why you have solved very less questions within a particular time period. So, you may or may not work for a month or two.No investment if you have laptop and internet connection (~512 kbps). The only thing needed is how smartly you solve a particular kind of problem without plagiarism.It is simply learn and earn kind of thing.In the month of mid October to December end, they give a good bonus (approx. 30% more than the actual price if the number of problems solved exceeds 60) for every question solved by you.Cons in EA community: Sometimes queue is dry so I have to keep refreshing and filling captcha for the question to appear on the screen.If you want to solve easy and less time consuming questions, then you may need to work during peak hours that I already mentioned above.So, finally I would love to give you answer of how much a person can earn rather then telling my earnings :P Now, the pay varies with the type of subject and topic you choose. It may be from Rs 50 to Rs 200 including taxes. Also, I have seen that they hired good expert answerer. You can refer to the link: NIT surges ahead in package race Moreover, I have heard people earning more that a lakh a month just by working on EA community. Chegg keeps on providing us information about the star performer of the month in Chegg MN India Newsletter.

As you asked for earning from chegg, I would say it completely depends on number of questions you are answering per month and the subject you are choosing. Maximun rate per question is paid for Computer science which is 187 and lowest is for basic maths subject which is around 75. On an average I work around 20\u201325 days and spend around 2 hrs on working day on Chegg. I\u2019ll try to do around 2\u20133 question. So for a month from 50\u201360 questions will be covered. If I take 55 as my monthly answers, I am able to make around 10000 rs (after 10% TDS deduction ) by working part time on Chegg. Now just imagine how I have earned so far. NB: Chegg is pretty good in paying salary on time. All the best\u2026.. ",

I had a huge Education & Personal loan to pay, so initially I used to work full time like 8\u201310 hours a day. Now for last 6\u20138 months I have been focusing on my study and working very less like 2\u20133 hours, and in this 2\u20133 hours my target is to solve just 5 questions. For my subject Chegg pay rs 135 (after deduction of TDS). I think it is the best platform for those who want to study further and ladies who have subject knowledge and can spent few hours. ",
