            "answer_text": "Nothing is an alternative for peace, but education about how to deal with issues in a way that brings about peace cannot hurt. Teaching students how the conflicts and wars came about and letting them brainstorm what might have been done to find peaceful solutions might prepare them to work toward peaceful solutions to conflicts; however, many factors cause a lack of peace in the world and all the education in the world cannot put students in control of those factors in the future. Essential for building a culture of peace is education for peace. The United Nations has called on every country to \u2018ensure that children, from an early age, benefit from education to enable them to resolve any dispute peacefully and in a spirit of respect for human dignity and of tolerance\u2019. Most disputes between people are solved without violence \u2013 but not all. If we are to move away from violence as a means to solve disputes at home and abroad we must work together to help young people learn how deal with conflict creatively and nonviolently. ",

            "answer_text": "I would get a college degree in some specialty, e.g., pre-international law; then, go to law school. Volunteer for the Peace Corp with the specialty. Then you'll be able to get some experience in international law which could lead to other travels and possible political office in a foreign country. ",
