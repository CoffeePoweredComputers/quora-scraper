            "answer_text": "Yes, they do. I went to the Univ. of Pennsylvania, an ivy league school. And I came from a public high school in Philadelphia. There were many of my classmates at Central H.S. in Phila., who also went to the UPenn. I knew students who had gone to private (mainly prep) schools as well as public schools. The high school I went to was a select high school, with modestly high admission standards. But it was still a public high school. I haven\u2019t seen detailed stats on admissions from private and prep schools at Penn and the other Ivy League universities. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there was a fairly even balance in public and private school admissions. Especially with all the financial aid awarded. ",

A number of our children\u2019s friends from their poor, inner city high school went to Ivies, including Harvard, Cornell and Columbia where they did very well. A couple of the laggards went to MIT. One of those laggards got a Ph.D. in polymer science from MIT, but the other had to settle for an MIT masters degree and a position as a senior software development engineer at Apple. ",

Even if 50% of students admitted are from public schools, the proportion of students who go to public schools is much greater than the proportion attending private schools. This source says 10% of all students in PK-12 are in private schools (CAPE | Private School Facts). That said, this doesn\u2019t mean that going to a private school means that you have a 5-fold greater chance of getting into an Ivy League school. ",

But according to this article Top US Private Schools with the Most Graduates Getting Into Ivy League Universities 94 out the top 100 feeder schools into Ivy League college are private. So it would appear that some private schools are better positioned to send graduates to the Ivies than public high schools. ",
