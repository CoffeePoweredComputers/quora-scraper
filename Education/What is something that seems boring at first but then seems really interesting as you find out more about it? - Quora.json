The more you read about it , the more mysteries you will unfold and mysteries are always interesting. Black holes Dark matter Nuetron stars Supernovas Exoplanets (not a part of our solar system) like CoRot-7 b And millions of other things that you will find once you start exploring.The more you will learn, the more interesting it will become.
