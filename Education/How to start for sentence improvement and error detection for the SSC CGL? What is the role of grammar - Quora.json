            "answer_text": "English Language has around 60 percent weightage in the cumulative marks across all the stages of SSC CGL examination. Sentence improvement and error detection makes for around 20% in the English section of tier 1 and tier 2 of this exam. The above raw figures helps one in deciding the cost benefit analysis of the topic in this particular exam. No particular methodology could work for every individual. However, I particularly started with solving the previous year compilation of sentence improvement and error detection. Initially I had close to 50 percent accuracy in these section. Gradually with lots of practice from online tests and simultaneous newspaper reading, I increased the accuracy to more than 90 percent. This took more than three months, and no particular book or source can be attributed for this learning. As far as grammar is concerned, definitely it plays a very huge role, as a person with sound grammar will certainly have high accuracy with minimum practice in this section. But I strongly believe rigorous practice with a moderate and weak grammar can surpass the average score in this particular section. Often the questions asked are directly from news article published in the same month in which the exam is conducted. P.S: I secured 182 marks out of 200 (91 percent) in CGL 2017 tier 2 English examination. Overall my All India Rank was 460. ",
