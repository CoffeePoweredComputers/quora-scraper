            "answer_text": "Original Question: How do I study for understanding? This is a really good question. This was never really taught to me but I\u2019ve been doing it since High School so I can give you my perspective on it. Studying is one of those things that becomes as diverse as the people doing it, there really isn\u2019t a fixed best method for doing so. Ultimately the goal of studying is obtaining new usable knowledge. I think there are two types of ways you could study, either for memorization or for understanding. The current education systems focuses on knowing certain facts that could be used to support other facts. This biases memorization over understanding. To know a concept you have to be able to recall and repeat it as needed, but to understand a concept is to have the ability to integrate and innovate on the concept. The difference seems small but practically it is quite relevant. The main issue with our current education system is that it provides no practical understanding that makes it applicable to the students life. You can think of memories like locations. Each memory location represents certain information and different locations are connected by other locations. To \u201crevisit\u201d a memory you need to find the memory you want by tracing through the memories that connect your desired memory with the memory you\u2019re currently experiencing. Studying should not just be a process of memorizing information, it is a process of connecting memory locations and creating new ones. If thinking and recollection is a process of finding the right location, the more routes you have to get to that location the easier it will be. The more memory locations you can connect through a single location the stronger that single locations memory will be. For example, if you know how an apple looks, the image of it will create one reference to your understanding of an apple. But if someone else knows about an apples entire biological make-up and life cycle, that person will have far more knowledge that is contributing to his understanding of an apple. The difference between your perspective and his/her perspective will be the difference between knowing and understanding. When you memorize words you tend to learn the thing that takes you to the word the quickest, when you memorize images you\u2019ll learn what reminds you of that image the quickest. Although it seems effective for getting to information it creates isolated information. This is why personally, I always disliked getting taught mnemonics in school. For the purpose of fixed tests where standard questions get asked it is very helpful to just memorize some facts but in practical scenarios it always requires more intricate adjustments. But if you do not have a deeper understanding of the information you will not be able to use the knowledge effectively. Using your knowledge effectively depends on how well you understand it. For example, you may not know much about apple seeds but you know a bit about apples and you have a background in biology, chemistry and physics. Despite your lack of information on apples, your background understanding allows you to break down the apple seeds into information you understand. You could say your understanding for things is as good as your ability to break it down into better understood concepts. Memorization can only give you new locations but you still need to improve the connections between locations or you will not be able to find it when you need to. Practice makes perfect, and perfect practice makes understanding. When you practice using your information you strengthen the links between those locations and create new links to new information, making it easier to reconnect those locations in the future. If you only memorize information without practice or any real understanding of it, you might be able to memorize it effectively but you won\u2019t be able to recall the memory when you need to. For example, you fully memorized newtons first law. You then observe a rocket turning off its engines in space. By observing, you will on impulse conclude on the rockets follow-up movement. Your sub-conscious conclusion is expecting the rocket to slow down at some point, based off your understanding of moving vehicles. Even though you could perfectly repeat newtons first law, your lack of understanding of it prevents you from even taking the correct factors into account in a scenario. So how can you study specifically with the intention of creating an understanding? Well its both simple and complicated. Put simply, you just need to directly connect the new information with your current knowledge. But to connect the information it first needs to broken down into information you already understand. If you don\u2019t understand anything you\u2019ll first need to improve your base understanding of the topic to be able to add on to it. For example, lets say that you need A, but you are C. You know that C connects to B and D but you don\u2019t understand B or D enough to know who they connect to. Because of your lack of understanding of B you couldn\u2019t get to A despite having the ability to do so. When studying for understanding it comes down to two main things, practice and comprehension. You need to practice using what you know to grow your understanding and you need to comprehensively learn to grow what you know. When I say comprehension I am referring to how you would read or take in information. Your perspective on the information needs to be changing as you learn so that you understand the information from multiple perspectives. From each perspective in which you understand something, the perspective will give you access to that information. Breaking down information into already understood concepts will give you access to the information from perspectives you already experience. Breaking down information to view it from a new perspective will give you a new perspective to experience the information from. Each perspective gives you access to different information and different perspectives. The more perspectives you understand something from the easier it will be to find information relating to it. You can use this answer as another example. Whether or not you are able to understand what I am trying to say is going to depend on how well you understand the perspectives I used to convey the information. You might even understand the concepts I\u2019m explaining but unable to link my explanations to your understanding because my language use and words do not correlate to the words you use in your perspective. In conclusion if your goal is true understanding you shouldn\u2019t just study content but try to experience it from your everyday perspectives. Be conscious about your perspectives and understandings of information because it\u2019s not about how well you can memorize information its about how well you can navigate through information you\u2019ve experienced.

            "answer_text": "You first need to build your sense of direction in your studies. That means you need to be constantly aware what are the topics you already know and what are the topics still require you to spend more time to study. In order to build your sense of direction in your studies, you need to study to understand, which provides for solid memories, rather than studying to remember/memorizing. This is what I will suggest you do On working days or any busy days, allocate a fixed time for homework and studying in each day. This will give you an idea on how much time you need each day to do both which makes you more organized.For each day, ideally before you go to bed, allocate 1 hour to finish your homework and the next hour doing some short revisions from what you learned during school.The short revisions include writing some short notes of what you know and what you still need to learn from today\u2019s lessons.In the final 5 minutes of that one hour revision session, you do a reflection on what you have learn in all your lesson today. This meaning making a summary of what you have learned today and what you still need to learn or not sure or seek help from the teacher on the next day.By doing a reflection, you get a clear idea of what you know and don\u2019t know which then gives you direction on what you need to learn in school. This will naturally give you a sense of purpose in studying as well as keeping you engaged in your study session. Thus, you will naturally have the motivation to keep learning and studying.During the weekends (or any full day), allocate for a 2 hour study session, with a 15 minutes break in between, on each weekend for a study session. The most ideal time to do this is in the morning when you just had your breakfast. In the last 15 minutes of each study session, you also do a reflection on what you have learned and what you still need to improve on. This will give you a sense of direction on what you still need to learn in class for the next week. If you repeat this step, you will realise you are studying more efficiently by constantly focus on improvement. You may add one more 3 hour study session on a full day if you do not have anything else on. All this allows you to study efficiently and still have time to work, do your fitness/exercises or whatever that is close to that, have a social life and have a good night sleep ",

            "answer_text": "Repetition. Mind numbing, boring repetition. Here are ways to make it fun, but the bottom line is that anything new that you try to learn calls for new synaptic pathways to remember and understand. Without a thick myelan sheath around the connection it will be difficult to recall the information into your conscious mind. You thicken the sheath by repeatedly using the information over time. It helps to use it in different ways too. Read it, write it, do some \u201cmad libs\u201d with it, make flash cards, write a poem or story, draw a picture, whatever. Get creative to keep your mind interested and active, but if you really want to upload information in your brain, you will need to build up those new connections in order to retain the information.

Before, I often cramped my revision, ended up highlighting my whole textbook like a kindergarten coloring book during the night before exam.
