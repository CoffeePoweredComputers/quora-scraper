Verified Certificates, as you may know, check the identity of the user by a series of photos. So, at the end of the day, they would bring a sense of comfort to others who may want the assurance of authenticity. In spite of all that, you can equally showcase your course achievements with an honor code certificate but just be a bit more elaborate when anyone asks about your course work, just to make them believe you took it.  Cheers. :) ",
