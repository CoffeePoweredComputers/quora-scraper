            "answer_text": "yes, watch lectures, use book and other resources as needed.  You learn the most when you do the problems, interact with fellow classmates, discuss with others, work on projects.... These are all important components for learning effectively.   Participate actively, this will give the full experience.  MOOCs are very social, so,  these also give you a lot of opportunity to learn and discuss with your fellow classmates around the world.   So, do not miss out on the social aspect of learning on MOOC.I also agree with Erik, start with what excites you the most.  Everyone is different and you will discover your own style of learning.  This is the most exciting part of MOOCs,  it supports many learning styles. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "I prefer to do the lectures first. This way you get a good feel for how comfortable you are with the subject and whether you need to do any more. If you have not fully understood then usually re-watching the lectures (or studying pre-requisites) can help, but reading the textbook or finding more information online may also help. I find textbooks helpful to accompany a course when I want to go a little deeper into the subject than the coverage in the lectures. Quite often you may find that the lectures / exercises between them give you the knowledge you need (the textbook may still be useful for future reference). ",
