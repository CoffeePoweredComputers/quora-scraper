            "answer_text": "No, not at all! If you want to take the SAT multiple times, go for it. Many people take their standardized tests two or three times (though above that may be more uncommon and perhaps unnecessary). Some colleges even take \u201csuperscores\u201d or the combination of the two highest subject scores you\u2019ve received. Example: Matthew takes his SAT for the first time. He scores a 680 on the reading portion, and a 630 on the mathematics. Retaking it, Matthew scores 670 and 650, respectively. His \u201csuperscore\u201d would be a 1330. Even if your school of choice doesn\u2019t offer this, taking it multiple times is still always an option. Remember, though: taking it upwards of 4+ times or trying to achieve above a, say, 1530, won\u2019t make a difference. After a certain number, colleges won\u2019t take too much special consideration to a ten or twenty point difference. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not at all. I believe that it depends on your desired university. Up to three attempts are fine if you have improved in every attempt as it shows a determination and progressive nature of your personality and creates a positive impact on the review team. Now, You must be wondering, why I wrote that it depends on the university? This is because some universities accept the super scores whereas others may accept the recent scores. So, to avoid such confusion, I would suggest you, visit the official websites of your shortlisted universities and go through their admission policies and score requirements. > If you have got a low score then certainly you should take it again to get a high score which will eventually open a lot of opportunities for you. On the other hand, if you have got a sufficient score to get into the university then, you should just focus on strengthening your profile instead of taking the multiple attempts to get the perfect score. I hope you got the answer. Note: I am associated with Achievers\u2019 Point. ",
