            "answer_text": "FAST, is ranked higher than LUMS by the HEC for Computer Science. It is noteworthy as word of mouth considers LUMS to be the better school. However, FAST is a specialist institution for computer science, whereas LUMS is a management school offering a computer science degree. The level of focus, and diversity of course options, degrees and extra curricular programs in research, networking and career development are not the same. LUMS is a university with a high academic standard and competitive entrance, but it is not a computer science school by definition. ",

            "answer_text": "FAST is the best choice because it is famous for CS while lums is famous for business. This is the industry impression. However there is more to computer science than just University choice. If you have good money and you are not very deep into programming then go for lums but if you have love for programming then go for FAST. If you want to start your own business in future then both are good. ",
