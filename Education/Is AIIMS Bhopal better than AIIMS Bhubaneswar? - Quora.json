            "answer_text": " Well! I can answer based on my experience in AIIMS BHUBANESWAR.\u00a0All the peripheral AIIMS have the same quality of teaching. The difference lies in the administration. The administration of AIIMS BHUBANESWAR is strict when it comes to academics. There are regular weekly tests based on which your eligibility to sit for the final professional exam depends. So academics is very much scheduled and strictly monitored in Aiims bbsr. Coming to hostel, since the new batch is expected to have increased strength, allotment of single rooms in second year is doubtful. In the first year, three girls are allotted a single BHK flat! Yeah you heard it right.. it is a flat with attached bathroom and balcony. Boys have double rooms with common washrooms. Academic block and hospital in AIIMS BHUBANESWAR are complete and well established. Some renovations are going on during this lockdown, so I guess the campus is going to be even more developed. Administration of AIIMS Bhubaneswar is very powerful. There is no chance of any internal and external conflicts in Aiims bbsr. This means academic schedule will be smooth without any disturbances. Peer group in AIIMS BBSR is awesome. We have a mini India here. There are people from all over the country thus ensuring great exposure and development of communication skills. The student association SAAB also organises several events providing a platform to showcase and develop various talents. Coming to language issues, within the campus it is enough if you know English. In the city almost everyone understands and speaks Hindi. People from the south! No issues.. they constitute around 50% in the campus and most of them have managed to learn decent Hindi. We have Odiya classes twice a month and there is a good scope to learn Odiya with clinical postings from the third sem. Bhubaneswar is a beautiful, peaceful,capital city. It is less polluted. The campus is on the outskirts and you have hills around offering an aesthetic view. The city has all facilities and there is a regular availability of ola and uber thus contributing to great connectivity. The airport is just 15 min drive from the campus and there are flights to most cities from BHUBANESWAR. The railway station is around 15\u201320 km from the campus. All the trains moving along the eastern railway stop at BBSR, thus offering railway connectivity to most parts. Food :| Hostel food is always boring\ud83d\ude44 Last but not the least, choose the one which is closer to your home \ud83d\ude09 P.S. AIIMS BBSR IS PERFORMING GREAT IN PG ENTRANCES TOO WITH AIR 1 IN AIIMS PG JULY 2020, AIR 2 IN JIPMER JULY 2020 AND AIR 6 IN PGIMER 2020 WITH MANY MORE TOP RANKS.  \ud83d\udc46Our second home!\u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "This was the million dollar question for me during the councelling, I was in a lot of dilemma to choose between these two. So I had been to both the colleges and I think I could answer it well . Both are great institutes and are have developed well. We can't say that one is better than the other, but I would compare them in some aspects which I considerd while joining and the decision is yours. Being a South Indian(AP) my comparision would be in a South indian point of view. 1. Academics: Faculty, Teaching and Facilities are best in all peripheral AIIMS but the curriculum is quite different. The schedule of AIIMS BBSR is pretty hectic with weekly exams. I don't think it is too bad but Eventually you would be exhausted and become tired of them. In BPL there are no weekly exams but only part completion tests after completion of a chapter. 2. Language: This is the aspect that should be considerd the most while joining. In AIIMS BPL the language is purely hindi but In AIIMS BBSR you need to understand the Odiya as well. Even though you can manage with Hindi in BBSR but the patients would vist the hospital from all over the state including Villages who don't Know Hindi well So you need to Learn Odiya as well. There were Odiya classes in AIIMS BBSR every week. As I don't know much Hindi and personally I felt learning Hindi would be more beneficial than learning Odiya. 3. Sports facilities: In this Aspect AIIMS BBSR winsas it has almost all the facilities. The Sports facilities are under development in AIIMS BPL. There are Volley ball, Basket ball, foot ball grounds and there are also Table tennis tables but no Gym and indoor badminton court in AIIMS BPL. 4. Climate: In AIIMS BBSR, the climate is very humid. You would sweat a lot even in normal days as it coastal area. In AIIMS BPL the climate is less humid and moderate weather. 5. Location of the institute from city: Both are not too far from the main city but comparitively AIMS BBSR is farther as it is in outskirts of the city. 6. Fest: Both have their own fests which are pretty good and are trying their best to compete with Pulse. Along with them AIIMS BPL had an additional Sports fest. In AIIMS BBSR there are more cultural type of fests and are more medical conferences. 7. Interaction with Seniors: In AIIMS BBSR there are strict rules for the first year students to prevent ragging which is good. As there is less interaction in Bbsr Personally ( personal opinion only no offence) I feel there is a better senior junior relationship in Bhopal. 8. As Both the institutes have more number of South Indians, Food is prepared to fit for both North and South Indian Students. These are very minor aspects which the both institutes differ as they Both are similar in major aspects. Both are great institutes and there are no major disadvantages in either of the institutes So you can choose any of them. I tried to provide the information I know and the decision is yours.
