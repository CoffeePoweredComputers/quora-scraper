            "answer_text": "[Note: This answer is northeast specific] Basically, because summer is HOT! Back in the late 1800s and early 1900s (when traditional urban/suburban public schools as we know them today were first really getting started) when summertime came around, anyone and everyone with the means simply up and LEFT the overheated, smelly cities and temporarily relocated to cooler areas for the season. [Clarification: For upper middle-class families, this generally meant just the mother and the children; the father would work for the week and join his family on the weekends. Only the richest men or \u201cmen of leisure\u201d stopped working for 2 full months and joined their family for the whole season] Think of New Yorkers fleeing to the Hamptons, Bostonians to the Berkshires, etc. Or even Baby\u2019s family in \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d spending their summers at a resort/camp. Ever heard of the fashion concept of wearing white only from Memorial Day to Labor Day? That\u2019s where this came from. Anyone with enough money left the cities, wore their vacation whites (which wouldn\u2019t get dirtied with work) for the summer, and then headed home to resume normal activities in the fall. What does this have to do with school? Well, it\u2019s kind of hard to send your children to school when you\u2019re out of town for 2 months. So schools started following the calendar we know today, 10 months of school with the two summer months off. By the 1950s and 60s, when most of our current schools were being built, this calendar was more or less set in stone. So \u201cnew\u201d schools were never built with air conditioning. Therefore, today we have buildings that are far too hot in July and August, so we don\u2019t have school during those months. Side note for those whose answers mentioned farming: Schools in rural farming areas in the 1700s and 1800s actually did NOT follow the schedule we do today. The few children who did go to the rural, one-room schools in those times (since formal schooling was often viewed as an unnecessary luxury then) would attend school during the summer and winter seasons. Spring and fall (planting and harvesting) are the truly busiest times on a farm, and that was when the children were needed at home, so schools would not be open during those seasons. ",

            "answer_text": "The American school year is 180 days to follow the agrarian calender. The idea being that your long summer would allow your school children to tend to the family farm during the harvesting season. Since this period there has been little desire to change such a system, teachers don't wish to work more days without more pay which is understandable, and students nor parents are calling for more education. Additionally the political will to needed to increase the education funding available to pay for more schooling isn't about when compared to the desire to end sequester cuts.In series seven 7 of The West Wing the democrat candidate spent a lot of his campaign on education and trying to elongate the calender. In the UK, my homeland we have a much longer school year with only 6 weeks summer holidays and we regularly score higher in OECD testing so it could be possible that as we spend more time in the classroom we become smarter but whether a longer would be better is subjective, the quality not quantity of education is probably more important.
