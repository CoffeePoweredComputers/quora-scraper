            "answer_text": "It depends on one's persona point of view, actually. There is nothing special about government colleges, unless. They too are just MBBS colleges. What you are going to find different is the crowd and the mentality of theirs. Obviously, better crowd tends to choose a reputed college and hence providing it with a better result in turn. I think that's enough of this philosophical mumbo-jumbo. Lets get to the point here. A new AIIMS would not be bad in terms of teaching and all but you are sure to find some factors that one can find to outweigh the pros. of being called AIIMSonian. You will lack the support of seniors, which is really a big deal. Being gone through the similar phase, they can guide you properly. Which matters a lot in MBBS, may be even more so than other fields. You will come to know this in time. Curriculum of AIIMS is a bit different than other universities. Study it on the first hand; collect more information about it. You will not get advantage of regional quota for PG, if you want to get a college other than AIIMS for PG. To sum it up, the atmosphere of the campus will not be as lively either. I am telling you this by personal experience\u2026 In our college, we enjoy an event or programme most when everyone joins together; for fests and all. If all these things are fine with you, go ahead to be called an AIIMSONIAN. Well, there are also few things you get to find in AIIMS alone\u2026 Your own room, you can even modify it in any way you see fit. It has free wifi and all. This is in case of the old AIIMS, I dont know though, if this is the same in new AIIMS as well\u2026 ",
