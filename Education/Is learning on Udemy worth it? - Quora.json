            "answer_text": "Offcourse, it's great. I would suggest and prefer you to take up Udemy as a learning platform because it stands out from other learning platforms like Coursera. In Udemy you can buy any course you like and the course is absolutely with you for a lifetime and you can complete the course at your own pace. Unlike Coursera you don't need to have an active subscription in Udemy. And you also get tons of free coupons for getting the courses for free, and the best part is the instructors in Udemy are highly trained professionals and talented. Just check out the best selling courses in Udemy and you will experience it yourself once you go through the course. You get a range of courses from IT and development and all the way through self-development, just check it out by going through the website you will be amazed by the number of courses that are available. I personally have completed a lot of courses in Udemy and some of my personal best is ethical hacking and web development in 2020. Well, I can assure you that Udemy is one of the best learning platforms to get yourself skilled in any field and for self-development. #KeepLearning. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Anna! The question is nice and I would like to answer it on my personal user experience of Online Courses - Learn Anything, On Your Schedule | Udemy . Taking free courses on Udemy is like a two coined artifact; sometimes you get benefit out of it and sometime you get what is already available on internet. On other hand, paid course are worth to take but depends on \u201cWhat actually you are looking for in a courses\u201d. Before subscribing to any course, you must understand what you are going to get from course, benefits and value of course rather than just taking course for certificates. Every courses have a overview of what the course tutor is going to cover and so taking the leverage of these information, you can enroll in a beautifully designed course. Ultimate goal should be to \u201cenrich and enhance the knowledge\u201d which you are going to get from the course. Tips - Read reviews carefully coz they are the used cases which helps you to know the importance and impact of course on user. ThanksShashank Bhardwaj ",
