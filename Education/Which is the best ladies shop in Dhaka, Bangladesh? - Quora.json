            "answer_text": "Best ladies shop in Bangladesh? Best shop, is a relative term. And there is no such specific assessment criteria as well. It might differ from place to place, product to product also customer age, purchase power, education etc. Here I am considering only market in Dhaka City not the whole country. I can remember among students or ex students in Dhaka City, \u201cCHADNI CHWAK\u201d in Nilkhet is one of the most popular market for 3 pieces and other dresses. This place is very popular among girls for variety of supply and reasonable price. Also there are many good tailoring shops for ladies in this place which also made this market very popular. Ladies having medium to high purchase power like to shop in \u201cBashundhara City Mall\u201d. This place has good outlets for: ShareesJewelry & OrnamentsCosmeticsUndergarmentsShooesMobile phonesEtcLadies like to shop this place for good environment plus movie halls and food courts. \u201cBENERASHI PALLI\u201d in Mirpur is very popular among ladies for Katan shares. For wedding shopping this place is very popular specially among medium income group due to its diversication, quality and cost. For exclusive shopping lading like to visit \u201cAARONG\u201d most.
