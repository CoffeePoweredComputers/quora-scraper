            "answer_text": "All the Boards of School of Education whether National or State including NIOS are following National Curriculum Framework brought out by NCERT. Hence the acceptability of Certificates issued by NIOS is the same as that of the certificates issued by other Boards of School Education. The Secondary(10th class) and the Senior Secondary(12th class) certificates of NIOS are at par to the Secondary and the Senior Secondary certificates of other National and State Boards. All entrance exams- JEE, Medical entrance exam, all universities and colleges in India will honour the 12th pass certificate of NIOS. ",
