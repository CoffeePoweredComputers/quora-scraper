            "answer_text": "There was an obscure old riddle in my medical school, reserved tongue-in-cheek for the female applicants who, like me, thought they could beat the statistics: Q: How does a woman wind-up marrying a doctor? A: She must be lucky. Q: But what if A MAN marries a doctor? A: She\u2019s even luckier. Yeah. So it shouldn\u2019t have come as such a shock to me when I arrived home from a girls\u2019 weekend in Vegas to find Nate\u2019s note, scrawled in yellow highlighter, lying on the kitchen counter. There was no explanation, only a list of items he felt I should store for him, in the garage, to pick up once the house was sold. Starting with the big screen TV. 14 years of marriage and he left me a note in yellow highlighter, couldn\u2019t be bothered to find a ballpoint pen. People ask me to this day if I saw it coming. I didn\u2019t. I mean, did we have problems? Yeah. We were married. Of course we had problems. But I supported him, emotionally and financially, when he left the Marines just before our vows, during the first 7 years of marriage it took him (while jobless) to finish his bachelor\u2019s, and the next 7 years it took him (still jobless) to \u201cfind himself.\u201d I loved him. I believed in him. And he\u2026 cleaned out our savings account and left me with a mortgage. What the fuck. He never did explain to me what happened. In fact, he didn\u2019t speak to me again AT ALL after the day he left. One day we were feeding the chickens and celebrating his birthday with cookie dough ice cream, as we cuddled on beach towels beneath our back porch, hidden from the mid-July sun. Two days later he had vanished. I must have gone through a million plus different explanations in my mind, but never really knew. He did, however, say something\u2014 I don\u2019t know what\u2014 to my fundamentalist Christian parents. So while my father, with his gentle smile and helpful hands, did show up unexpectedly a few days later to provide moral support and help packing, I also felt the judgment of my church upbringing descend upon my head. I just couldn\u2019t imagine why Nate, who I married, in my mind, with a very literal sense of for-better-or-for-worse, til-death-do-us-part\u2014 why my faithful husband, the solid and dependable man I trusted implicitly all those years\u2014 would suddenly betray me so shamelessly. I resorted to blaming myself. I guess that is what ultimately drove me to do the unthinkable: I reached out in desperation to his parents. Specifically, I called his mom. The woman who, from the beginning, had informed my virginal 22-year-old self that I would never satisfy her son: \u201cBut WHY did he leave?\u201d I sobbed. \u201cWhat HAPPENED??!? No one will tell me.\u201d Her voice, at 6 a.m. her time, was drowsy, but her cruel words resolute. \u201cWell, Meg,\u201d she philosophized, invoking the pet name she had no right to, \u201cNathan grew up seeing his father and me, and how much we are in love\u2026 \u201cAnd I guess he just wanted that kind of love for himself.\u201d When I think of those first few days, weeks, and months, it was all a nauseating stumble through the toxic fog, a slow-motion punch in the gut. But I do remember a misty quiet sunrise, the color of fresh bruises, creeping up through our backyard, and illuminating the half-dug duck pond\u2014 just a hole really\u2014 where Nate left his shovel stuck upright, as if in suspended animation. I remember the guilt and reluctance I felt when my shrewd divorce lawyer reviewed Nathan\u2019s suit for spousal support and advised I counter-bluff with the threat of an imaginary P.I.\u2019s findings. A suit that Nathan, coincidentally, thereafter dropped. I remember cutting the bolt on the door to his \u201cpersonal workshop\u201d and discovering, literally, hundreds of thousands of dollars in spanking new gadgets, tools and toys I never knew he bought or had. And I also remember calling the Salvation Army to come pick up all his stuff. Starting with the big screen T.V. *****P.S.? It just feels so damn good to tell that story. I overcome a little more with each set of eyes that read it. *****P.P.S. Although I don\u2019t think I will ever know for absolute sure, a number of things have begun to occur to me over the years. Minor private details of our marriage. His very conservative Christian mother\u2019s harsh but elusive words both at the beginning AND the end of our marriage. The out-of-character impulsive manner is which he left, refusing to explain himself. Whatever he was afraid the nonexistent private investigator had found out. And the signs and symptoms of what, looking back and taken together, I now believe to be depression (leaving the Marines, not working for many years, buying and hiding unused expensive new things). I have come to suspect that the male roommate a friend of a friend tells me he now lives with is, in fact, his committed longterm partner. While what he did was nonetheless shitty, I feel I understand a little better the inner conflicts he must have struggled through. Moreover, as vital as my anger was for me to escape, while wounded, the initial attack, I now find compassion\u2014 for both him and myself\u2014 to be deeply healing. ",
