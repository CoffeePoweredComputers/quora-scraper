            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhat is the best way to evaluate students ability?\u201d If a subject has been communicated to the student with words, you can ask the student to define some of the words. If they can define the words you ask, then you check to see how long it took them to give you the correct answer. It they take a long time to answer, you can assume their ability to receive the words used to communicate the subject to them is poor. If they can not answer, then you know they have no ability to receive the words used to communicate the subject to them. If they can give the correct meaning for the word you asked about, and give you the answer smartly or quickly, you can then ask them to use that word in a sentence that clearly demonstrates its use. If they can do all this then you can assume they have the ability to understand and receive the words used to communicate the subject to them. Then, you ask them to demonstrate their understanding of a few of the concepts or abilities required of that subject. I would include a few demonstrations where they actually have to apply something using some mass, like small objects, clay demonstrations, or dioramas, drawings, or actually do the actions required in the subject. Lastly, I would have have them demo their ability to use the concept or ability where you define a situation and then ask them to solve it or apply their ability to it. I would also check them over when they are being a student and see if they they have excellent study skills, to learn things easily. I think that would be the best evaluation of ability in a subject.
