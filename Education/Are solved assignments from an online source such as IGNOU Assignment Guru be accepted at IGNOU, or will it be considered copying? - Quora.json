            "answer_text": "I will suggest you to solve it on your own because they are easy and one can find all the answers in study material provided by the IGNOU. If you worried that your assignment will be rejected due to copying then rest easy there's no such thing in IGNOU. They hardly check the assignment completely if you have written your assignment in neat and clean manner then you'll easily get 70+ and more in assignments. All the best ",
