            "answer_text": "Admissions in all schools in India including IB schools start in the month of December and January. So, if parents want to apply in any of the IB schools in India, the admissions for the Academic Session 2019-20 have already started. It is always good to check the eligibility criteria of the school before starting with the admission process. Moreover, the admission process for IB schools requires parents to follow a certain procedure, which is as follows: Register your child with the school where you wish to seek admission. You will also be required to pay a registration fee. Post the document submission along with registration, the school will hold a student interaction session, which will be followed by a parent interaction session. Post this, the offer letter shall be issued by the school and the admission will be finalised once you pay the admission fee and fill the admission form. There are many IB schools in India like the Mount Litera School International (Mumbai), Kodaikanal International School (Kodaikanal), GD Goenka World School (Gurugram), Dhirubhai Ambani International School (Mumbai), among others.
