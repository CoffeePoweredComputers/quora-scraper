            "answer_text": "A2A Though I was a NEET aspirant, but having studied there at Allen I can say their system is amazing if you're able to utilise it to the max ( teachers, doubt facility, modules, test papers, analysis, support , everything). Having said that, you must know that joining Allen won't make your dreams come true unless you put in your heart and soul into it. Someone from VMC might crack JEE with a better rank than yours if you don't give your all into preparation. I don't want to dishearten you, just trying to make it clear that most coaching Institute's materials and methodology is similar.. At the end, it's your hardwork that'll fetch you good results. So, it's totally your wish to join Allen , but make sure wherever you study, You must put in so much effort that every night when you go to bed, you should ask yourself proudly \u201c who on this earth would be working this hard to reach their goal \u201d?.. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "NO pls don't do such a terrible mistake. You will regret it later.Pls dont do it.If you are feeling that Vmc modules are not helping that much then do previous year questions and solve complete hcv . Also vmc has recently launched their youtube channel which is awesome.AS a senior listen to me. There is nothing called a good coaching intitute . It all depends on you.Don't change VMC you will regret later. Whatever I am now all thanks to Vmc. [and a tip , Vmc will provide a lot of free classes and tests at the end and material also,which no other institute provides.] Practice hard .Revise the same notes daily. Bruce Lee once told\u201dI am not afraid of a man who has practiced thousand kicks but i am afraid of a man who has practiced one kick thousand times.\u201d Be happy cheer up boy . Study hard.Time once gone never comes back. ",
