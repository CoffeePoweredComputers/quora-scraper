            "answer_text": "So, let's begin 21 years + 4.5 years of mbbs study = 25.5 years 1 year of internship - stipend will be anywhere between nothing to 45k a month (depending on the institute). 26.5 years - either work with the MBBS degree or do post graduation. If you work, you'll get a salary between 35\u201380k a month depending on the institute. If you get a pg seat, then you'll be paid between nothing to 80k a month. Mind you, this money comes with back breaking work. 26.5 + 3 years = 29.5 years - you would have completed pg degree and are now a fresher. You'll earn anything between 70k to 1.2 lakhs a month for about 5 years. 35 years - this age maybe you'll start earning decently, unless you become a medical college professor where your salary will be capped at 2 lakhs a month maximum. The above calculations do not take into account if you take breaks for pg studies, bonds, super-specialization or fellowships. Mind you, if you do super-specialization/fellowships, then you'll again have to take the 50\u201360k a month salary for another 2\u20133 years. Bond is extra. ",
