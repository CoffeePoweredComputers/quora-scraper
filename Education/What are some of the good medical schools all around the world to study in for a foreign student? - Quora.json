            "answer_text": "Hello Dear Medical Aspirant! I will assume that you are in grade XII, perhaps in a central board (C.B.S.E?) or A levels in IB? Either way you have already opted for Physics, Chemistry and Biology as your major subjects and are mastering these topics! Good! Here are your options: 1) Study medicine in India 2) Study medicine in North America 3) Study medicine in UK/AUS/NZ 4) Study medicine in other Asian countries 5) Study medicine in the middle east As per your question, you wanted to go somewhere foreign, so I will again assume you have considered and know about the NEET exam to enroll in an Indian Medical College. But let me touch on a few bits of advice: As a thumb rule, Indian medical colleges are worth it if you try for the 30 best in India (READY RECKONER 2016 RANK in medical India Today Survey ). These institutes are solid and won\u2019t charge you an arm and leg (if you get in through merit of course!). My personal favourites are AIIMS, CMC-Vellore, and Kasturba Medical College. AIIMS and CMC-Vellore will give you a very solid education but are extremely hard to get into. Kasturba Medical College gives you a very good education and is relatively easier (still hard!) but a bit more expensive. Once successfully completed, you will achieve the M.B.B.S degree.  Ok moving on to North America. The system is a bit different. You don\u2019t enroll in a Medical School (that\u2019s what they call Medical colleges there) directly after high school but first go through an undergraduate/pre-med/bachelor\u2019s degree program. So in essence you first apply to a regular college and earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in Science/Maths/Engineering\u2026whatever that you are interested in. Of course do your research because some subjects are seen more favourably when you apply for medical school later. Your performance in college combined with your MCAT sore (you will have to give this exam) as well as other experiences (volunteering, shadowing) will form your application for medical school. It is a long journey but very rewarding as medical schools in North America are some of the best in the world. The issues are the long journey you will take, the lack of surety (you may not get into medical school even after completing your bachelor\u2019s degree) and it is very very expensive!   If you are still ready, you can research about the IVY league schools. But North America also includes Canada! They have similar requirements but also have amazing medical schools such as McGill University, University of Toronto and Mc Master University.  My personal favourite is Weill Cornell Medical College. There is something simply breath taking about the campus    If you successfully graduate from an American or Canadian Medical school you will be an M.D (equivalent to M.B.B.S in India and not to be confused with M.D post graduate degree in India). A few programs in USA also offer a combined premed-medical program of 6\u20138 years (such as the Baylor College of Medicine) If you want to try the United Kingdom, you have Cambridge and Oxford which are two of the world\u2019 best medical colleges. They are usually known as OXCAM. There are of course other well known medical colleges as well (Imperial College London; Brighton ad Sussex; University College London). The programs here either have a standard pathway (6 years straight after high school) or direct entry (graduate entry) pathway (4 years straight after undergraduate college). You get some of the finest medical education in the world. To enroll, you need to have good scores in the Biomedical Admissions Test(BMAT) in addition to other highlights in your application. Some of these colleges offer individual scholarships but I think only few are available for Medicine (sorry). Moving on to Australia, the situation is similar to UK. The university of Melbourne school of medicine is a good pick but so are Monash University and many others. The quality of education is very good. However a good option to get a world class education in an amazing campus as well as live close to India is in Singapore!  The National University of Singapore gives you two pathways to graduate with a degree in Medicine: You can enroll in Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine directly after high School for the M.B.B.S degree or into the Duke-NUS graduate entry program for the MD degree (requires MCAT). Both are very good choices and highly competitive!!!! A third option in Singapore is the Lee Kong Chian school of medicine which is a collaboration between Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Imperial College London (It requires BMAT). Lastly I want to talk about Qatar, a country in the middle east which has its own campus of Weill Cornell Medical College. It was established in 2003 and has fantastic infrastructure and offers very good medical education. It is an accelerated 6 year MD program (2 years premed after which you clear MCAT and then enrol for 4 years of Medicine). Additionally they offer a generous financial aid which is payable back once you graduate and have a job.    I hope these help! ",
