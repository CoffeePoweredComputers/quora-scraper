            "answer_text": "There's a reason that many girls in third world countries are devastated when something unexpected happens (perhaps related to family issues or more broadly, poverty) and their parents can no longer afford to send them to school. From a third world perspective, education is one of the only keys of breaking the vicious cycle of poverty. Basic education is able to substantially lift up a family's quality of living. Say a mother has fundamental basic education, such as simple maths, English etc, her children would already be at an advantage. A mother who has basic education is more likely to send her children to school rather than expect them to rear children at a young and vulnerable age of 13. Basic educational skills will also likely mean that you are more likely to understand methods that protect you from easily preventable illnesses (for instance, you may know to boil water to prevent bacterial induced diarrhoea from drinking dirty, unfiltered dug-up well water). Moreover, those with an education are more likely to be able to get a higher paying job, let's say in tourism rather than one of subsistence (using your own labour in the fields). Although in third world countries this may not be the biggest advantage given the inherent lack of jobs, it definitely gives you a fighting advantage over someone who does not have any education. Obviously, things differ a lot more in developed countries. If you look at some extremely wealthy people, some of them did not pursue education beyond secondary level. However, I would argue that if anything, education provides you with a mindset that encourages you to use your brain in an analytical way- to not passively accept situations as they arise. It provides you with the confidence and tools to form your own opinion and stand up for yourself. I think it also doesn't hurt that you can capitalise on your education to earn a healthy salary that can be exchanged for material goods and experiences also. ",
