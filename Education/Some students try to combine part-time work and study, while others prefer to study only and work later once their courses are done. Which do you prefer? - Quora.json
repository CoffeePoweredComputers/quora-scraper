            "answer_text": "I actually did full-time study because my family could afford to pay the tuition at University of California, Santa Barbara for the Bachelor of Arts in Business Economics. I always thought they were upper middle class in their occupations and socioeconomic class, though taking descriptions from Pew Research Center, they are considered upper class. When I graduated, I did not expect to find work and did not even apply, but rather went straight into a position my family recommended at the VA Palo Alto Healthcare System, a federal healthcare system. I started as a STEP Student or federal intern, and worked part-time while going back to school, which I was considering between a Master of Business Administration or a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. I decided for the second bachelor and did this until I went to University of San Francisco, where I then only worked in the federal internship during academic breaks. So I was going full-time at the university again. My family also paid for this academic degree and this time I excelled and did well. I applied it to graduate school and did not do well there, and still haven\u2019t applied my college education to a job. I am now focusing on real estate in community college and planning for managing my family business, which will happen within 5\u201310 years while my parents are still of sound mind. When they retire, both from civil service jobs, they will be in rest mode and not really in the capacity to teach me how to own and manage residential real estate they invested in. This and also teaching me more about interpretation in Vietnamese and English, which my dad can do because he graduated from university in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He does translation for the government and corporations, and I've been doing independent study in Vietnamese, so I have some background to pick up the language in these real life scenarios. My family simply values education, and if I want to go back to college to study another subject, for which I already have 2 majors and 2 minors, over 317 semester units, they will pay for me to occupy my time with a societal good. My mom specifically told me I should consider graduate school, because I have excess intelligence and I need to occupy my time with good things in life, and so she advised I should consider graduate studies in theology, philosophy, business, or linguistics, some of the areas I have been studying or have studied in the past. She doesn\u2019t expect me to study any mathematical field, because that was what I stopped studying during graduate school. I can see that for students whose family cannot or will not support them in their educational pursuits, will have to decide how to manage their finances. And the answer is best resolved if they can qualify for scholarships because they are good academics, or grants because they need this money and the state will provide it. This or they have to settle for student loans or part-time work. The former gives them more flexibility but an outstanding principal they will have to pay down through full-time and stable work after graduation, so they both need to do well in school and also commit to a career to pay down liabilities. This or they work part-time during school such as at a federal internship or at a corporation, and also go to school part-time. Doing work and study at the same time is only good for people who are financially independent and want this to be their character in how they manage tuition and providing for their own real estate such as through rental and all life expenses. Doing the loan way is for students who expect to be earning a reliable and high paid job, which they expect will pay down the student loans in 5\u201310 years. So they will only study full-time and place great effort into excelling with no work obligations during university. ",

            "answer_text": "It is much easier to excel when your time and focus isn\u2019t split between multiple priorities. At my busiest, I was juggling 17 credits, part-time research, full-time paid TAing, and my academics took a hit because there was literally not enough time to give everything my best effort. I was sleep deprived, had stress induced tachycardia and was nodding off in lectures. Was the money worth it? Not really. The extra curricular experiences were infinitely more engaging and valuable than memorizing Dieckmann Condensation reactions though. I experimented with 13 credits, part-time research, TAing for two classes, and working as a Microsoft student partner in a subsequent semester, and the additional time did wonders, despite the increased \u201cpart time\u201d load. If school is your priority, study hard and don\u2019t let other things distract you from it. If money is a concern, work hard to be able to afford to study without distractions. If you want to do both, be realistic about what you can accomplish. ",

            "answer_text": "I studied full-time through my undergraduate program and my MBA, and did part-time work only in my last two years of my doctoral program, after I was through with all my coursework and most of my qualifying exams. Now, that comes at a cost. I was willing to sacrifice all the creature comforts and live like a completely broke student, which I was. If you don't have the fortitude to go without all possible cool stuff, to take the bus and trains rather than have your own car, sometimes to go without meals, then don't try that at home! I have no regrets at this approach. If someone prefers a different approach, so be it. I have no problem with that. However, I do find it curious and inconsistent for someone to say, \u201cI just bought a great new car; I'm going to have to quit school to work to pay it off!\u201d Postponed gratification is a good thing in this instance.

Most work part time and go to school full time if we have scholarship, grant or parental help while others who are paying on their own often work full time and take classes part time in evenings and/or weekends. Obviously going to school full time without a job is preferable but not always possible. ",
