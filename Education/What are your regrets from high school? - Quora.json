            "answer_text": "1. Choosing a relationship over your friends.  Trust me: I did this, and it is one of the biggest regrets of my life. I know that a first or new relationship is exciting and you want to be with your S.O. all the time. I get it! But please try to refrain from revolving your life around them. Your friends are so important and this is one of the times of your life where you will really be able to be with them a lot. Don\u2019t waste it. 2. Acting like you didn\u2019t like someone just to make things \u201cwork.\u201d  Why be in a friends with benefits relationship if you really like the guy more than that? Why act like you\u2019re fine with being casual if you\u2019re not? Stop settling! It will lead to heartbreak and trust issues that you will carry for years. 3. Not standing up for the underdog.  I know this sounds cliche and boring, but it\u2019s true. It\u2019s so hard to find high school students who stand up for the underdogs and the bullied kids. Be that person, because you\u2019re better than being a bully. Years later, when you think about how mean people in school were to one person, you\u2019re going to feel horribly guilty. 4. Choosing not to do something because you were worried about what other people thought.  I know that you\u2019re bombarded with messages like \u201cBe yourself!\u201d and \u201cStop caring what others think!\u201d After a while it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, but how?\u201d or it just gets frustrating. It\u2019s easy to spread this message, but it\u2019s not easy to follow it. But when I think back to high school, I think of all the things I DIDN\u2019T do because I was worried I would look like a \u201cnerd.\u201d I\u2019m disappointed in myself even now. 5. Not saving money.  I worked all throughout high school, but you wouldn\u2019t know it because I didn\u2019t save any of that money. I spent it on stupid things like clothes from Pac Sun that I wore once and food I didn\u2019t even need. Do you know how much you\u2019ll have for college if you save during high school? 6. Wearing things or doing things you were uncomfortable with just to be cool.  Yes, I\u2019m talking about peer pressure, and yes, I realize you all are sick of hearing about it. But it\u2019s important to discuss, so we\u2019re going to. Real talk: when I was in high school, the \u201ccool\u201d older kids all smoked cigarettes. I wanted to be cool, so I smoked. I only did it socially, but\u2026. I didn\u2019t like it. And I did it. Why? It was so stupid. 7. Fighting with your parents and telling them you hate them.  I know parents are annoying and restrictive and are trying to ruin your life. I had such strict parents and I really get how infuriating and upsetting it can be. During high school, I fought with my parents constantly. I told them I hated them all the time. I pushed them away. I refused to get to know them. Now my parents are seriously my best friends and I feel really bad about how hard I made things back then. Just don\u2019t say things you\u2019ll regret, okay? 8. Letting a friendship fall apart because you didn\u2019t want to seem like you cared.  When I was in high school, I got in a huge fight with one of my best friends. I was devastated, but I thought that if I showed how much I cared, I would look like a loser. So instead I acted like I didn\u2019t care and refused to try to patch things up. I STILL miss that best friend, guys. And things never, ever went back to the way they were. If you care about someone, it\u2019s okay to show it. I promise. 9. Choosing a guy over a friend and backstabbing her.  Not. Okay. This happened to me and it sucked. It\u2019s mean. The thing with the guy probably won\u2019t last, but your friend will never talk to you again, probably. Just don\u2019t do it because I promise it\u2019s not worth it. 10. Not telling a friend you were angry with her because you didn\u2019t want to start a fight.  This was literally my life in high school. I would get mad at friends for legitimate reasons, then refuse to confront them because I was terrified of confrontation. The result? I developed emotional and anger issues and it took years to be able to speak up for myself. Also, it made me bitter. I know it\u2019s hard to tell a friend if you\u2019re angry, but you should, because it will prevent a lot of problems. 11. Not paying attention to grades at all.  Yeah, school sucks and homework is boring. While there are plenty of students who DO try a lot, there are also plenty who don\u2019t. I was an okay student with Bs and As, but I didn\u2019t try as hard as I should have. I regret that, and you might too. 12. Following the path you thought you had to follow.  Maybe your parents had an idea of what they wanted to do, and you\u2019re doing it just to live up to their expectations. Maybe you had a plan and even though your mind is changing, you don\u2019t want to abandon it. Maybe you absolutely hate school but you\u2019re applying to college because it\u2019s normal and expected in our society. But you know what? You should take your own path and do what feels right for you. And only you will know what that is. 13. Spending all your time trying to please people.  I did this a lot. I wanted to make my parents happy. I wanted to make my boyfriend happy. I wanted to make my friends happy. My teachers, my guidance counselor, my family, etc. I never focused on making ME happy. Don\u2019t do this. 14. Acting super, super shy.  I was painfully shy in high school. I know how incredibly difficult it is to NOT be shy when you are. But please try. I regret so much of that shyness. It held me back from so much. 15. Obsessing over having sex or kissing someone.  If you spend 99 percent of your time wondering who your first kiss will be or wondering if you\u2019re weird for never having been in relationship or obsessing over your first time, stop. There is more to life than this stuff. 16. Choosing your future based on a guy.  My biggest regret in life is not going away to college because my high school boyfriend didn\u2019t want me to. My other biggest regret is not studying abroad because he didn\u2019t want me to. We broke up shortly after. GUYS I WISH I DIDN\u2019T DO THIS. I can\u2019t even express how much I regret this. Please, please, please, consider ONLY you when making future plans like these. 17. Sticking to just one group of friends.  A lot of high schoolers make a little group of friends and stick to those friends. Expand your group! I didn\u2019t do that in high school, but I do it now, and it\u2019s great. I have a few separate groups of friends and it\u2019s so much better than having just one. 18. Refusing to do things alone.  Learn how to be independent! I promise it will make life so much better. 19. Choosing to do drugs.  Is this GIF funny? Yeah. Are drugs? No. I don\u2019t want to sound like your mom, but drugs suck. I\u2019m not talking about weed or cigarettes, I\u2019m talking about the harder stuff that ruins lives. Starting young is asking for an addiction you will have a serious problem shaking. Drugs are the worst. I have watched so many promising lives get destroyed by drugs. It\u2019s heartbreaking. It\u2019s not a joke. Please don\u2019t do them. 20. Not showing or telling your crush how you feel.  Yeah, I know, you\u2019re told this all the time. But try it. Seriously. ",

            "answer_text": "I have to go anonymous on this because it could cause problems for people, sorry. I recently was dragged to my 25th high school reunion by my best friend growing up. Although I had a great time in high school (it really was some of the best years of my life), I had never really felt the need to go to one of our reunions. Everyone who I wanted to keep in touch with, I still kept in touch with, and I never really cared much about finding out what happened to so and so. The 25th reunion was a special one, or so my friend kept insisting, so I agreed to go. Surprisingly, it was a blast! So many faces that I hadn\u2019t seen in a quarter century. My high school is huge (I mean really huge) and we had a great turnout (hundreds of grads), so it really was fun reconnecting. In particular, it was fun reconnecting with one specific girl, let\u2019s call her Jane. Jane happened to be a girl I had worshiped for my last 3 years of high school. We ran in adjacent circles \u2014 me with smart kids and smart jocks, her with dumb jocks and smart jocks \u2014 and I just thought she was the bees knees. Jane wasn\u2019t the prettiest girl in school, but she was probably top 10 in my estimation. She wasn\u2019t the smartest girl in school, but she had a sprinkling of honors classes. I had girlfriends in high school, but I always liked Jane better than any of them. Jane was a cheerleader (of course) and she was always dating football players. She never knew about my affection and I never admitted it, even to my closest friends \u2014 I was too chicken to say anything to her about it as I figured she was out of my league. We graduated after having said maybe 10 words to each other and went our separate ways. Over time, I loved and lost and eventually happily married and started a family. I am truly content and happy. As it happens, Jane sought me out at the reunion \u2014 much to my surprise. After not having spoken to each other in high school, we talked for quite some time at the reunion. It turns out that Jane wasn\u2019t going to come to the reunion until she found out I was coming (say what?). She had always wondered what happened to the \u201csmartest kid in our school\u201d and wanted to see me. Jane said she had always liked me in high school, but it always seemed like one of us was dating someone else. Worse yet, during the times when we weren\u2019t both dating, she was hoping I would approach her, but I never did. Even worse yet, Jane never talked to me in high school because she thought I wouldn\u2019t like her because I would think she was too dumb. I never talked to Jane in high school because I was intimidated by how pretty she was. Great googly moogly, what a moron I was back then. **** Update Due to quora\u2019s new handling of anonymous posts, I can no longer reply to any comments. Here are answers to a couple of common questions: Jane and I have no plans to pursue a relationship. While I am kicking myself at missing out on what could have been a great life experience, I am happily married with kids and this event has largely just been a wistful look back in time.Back then, it was highly rare for girls to approach boys. It just didn\u2019t happen in that era, so the burden was not shared equally. I accept 100% of the blame for my inadequacy of courage.",
