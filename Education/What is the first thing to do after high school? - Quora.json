            "answer_text": "Get a job and your own apartment. If not your own, then have roommates. Again, get a full time job, better yet. For the love of God, don\u2019t live with your parents. It teaches you to cling to them and not to be independent. Learn to pay your own bills, buy your own things, do your own household tasks. Go to college. If you don\u2019t want to go to college, do something constructive with your life. Do something meaningful and purposeful. I don\u2019t mean wasting time trying to \u201cfind yourself.\u201d You never will. Yourself develops with your life experience. I mean do something meaningful; volunteer, fundraise for causes, do something that brings purpose to other people\u2019s lives. In turn, that will give your life meaning and purpose. If no college, explore technical education. Learn a trade. Become a plumber, carpenter, auto mechanic, electrician, etc. They will lead to high paying careers. And the advantage to them is they are jobs that won\u2019t be outsourced. You\u2019re not going to send your car to China to be repaired, are you? The sad thing is, these are fields that lack skilled workers because everyone is mislead in high school to believe they need to go to college in order to be successful. This is simply untrue. Schools put no emphasis on the value of technical training. Option 2 if no college, join the military. Learn some discipline. Obtain military training. Out of high school, travel if you can afford it. See things. Learn about other parts of the world or even our country. Learn about other cultures and belief systems. Learn about the history of other cultures. It\u2019s fascinating stuff. Whatever you do, do not sit around being lazy with no motivation or drive. Don\u2019t get into that slump if you can at all help it. Once you get into it, it\u2019s very hard to get out of. Once you\u2019re out of high school, you realize pretty quickly that you\u2019re an adult with adult responsibilities. ",

            "answer_text": "Dress comfortably under you gown to that you can deal with the temperature. It\u2019s usually very hot. If you can, convince your parents that light-fabric dresses or khakis and short sleeves are fine. You probably won\u2019t get pictures of what\u2019s under your gown anyway. Most of your time is spent sitting. Except for marching up to your seat and marching away from your seat, you mostly sit. Well, you don\u2019t only walk and sit. You may also do other things. You say the pledge. In some school districts, you bow your head in prayer, as well. You will probably listen to speeches of the valedictorian and salutatorian and other speakers. At some point, you will move your tassel from one side of your mortar board to the other side. You might throw it up in the air, and if you haven\u2019t decorated it or wrote your name somewhere on it, you will spend too long looking for the cap so you can get those pictures taken. I don\u2019t know of anyone who has ever wished that the graduation ceremony could last forever. You are there to participate in a ceremony that marks that you have become a grown-up and have graduated high school. You will not return to the high school as a high school student, only as a graduate. ",
