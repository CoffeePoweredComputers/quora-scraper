            "answer_text": "This comes down to definitions, but to my mind the most natural answer is \u201cno.\u201d It\u2019s true that if you want to create solid-looking statistical evidence for almost any claim, you can do it. You can get public opinion changed, laws passed, legal cases won, journal article published and other victories with these results. But you do it by violating good statistical practice. Your methods are invalid. Two quantitative analysts will often disagree on a question, but the scope for disagreement is much smaller, if both look honestly at the data and apply valid methods, than it is between non-quantitative analysts. More important, people using valid statistical methods express a range of uncertainty about their conclusions. So there is a limited range of results you can support using valid statistical methods, and most of this range should be inside the range of uncertainty from any valid analysis. ",

Take a look at False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant: In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists\u2019 nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (\u2264 .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process. ",

Yes, one can design a study that perhaps will show results by using some statistical techniques. Here is one for the beginners . In a Elementary classroom one can select enthusiastic students to collect data from all the students of the school on, \u201cwhat are the 3 most favorite Halloween treat during the Trick or Treat evening neighborhood trips? \u201c You can then put the response from each on a chart prepared ahead of time. After the survey, analyze the data to find out the most popular treat and rank those. How many actually like it, percentages of students etc. You might be surprised to find interesting information, ",
