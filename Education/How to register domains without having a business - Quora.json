            "answer_text": "Easy. Same as you got other names. Keep in mind some extensions are harder to get and they have different conditions. .ru you can register only for one year and need to renew annually  .com.au must be registered for at least two yearsAlso you might want to consider to get these names for cheap and it will require you to host them with different providers.For example I host .ru domains on 2domains.ru because I paid only $1.6/1 year and later it's about $10/year compare to godaddy where it's $15/year flat.If you will do extra research and find the cheapest provider for each extension you might be able to save around $50-100/year.
