            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A You can apply to Southern Institute in Invercargill where tuition fees are not charged. That alone is a whopping NZ$ 16,000/per year. However, it may be different for overseas students. You need to check this out on the web. Besides tuition fees students need to find accomodation, food, transport and travel on their own. Southern Institute is way down south and not as densely populated as Auckland. Hamilton , Wellington or Christchurch. Include Palmerston north. Accommodation is expensive in these cities. Other than this all the rest are about the same. Good luck if you choose any of these universities. Be guaranteed you will get a qualification respected worldwide. Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "Their tuition fees are much the same. The quality of teaching and research at all of the universities is world standard. But it depends what course you want to study. For example, medicine is only available at Otago or Auckland. Dentistry can only be studied at Otago. If you can study at any university then rent will be cheaper at Otago, Massey or Waikato because they are in smaller and cheaper cities. Auckland rent is the most expensive. ",
