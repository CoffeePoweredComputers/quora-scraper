            "answer_text": "To serve as a school librarian in California one must first hold a teaching credential. That allows one to teach in a regular classroom. [I held a standard elementary credential issued for life and a life diploma to teach high school. I had taught in high school, elementary school, and in the level I most enjoyed, history and English in junior high school.] To move from a classroom into the library, one must add a librarian credential. [ I went back to college to get a second master's degree, this one an MLS, Master of Library Science. With that the State of California gave me the librarian's credential. With my teaching credential plus my librarian credential, the district transferred me from a regular classrom to the library. In theory, the library was my classroom and every student in school my class. (I remember the district explaining that on the official state form, I had to put the total student population in the box asking for my class load.)] A teacher librarian is a school librarian who holds both a teaching credential and a school librarian credential and who is employed as a school librarian. These are older terms. I retired almost twenty years ago. Some librarians are called by different titles in different districts. The MLS is sometimes called an MIT or MIS or some other name. Colleges decide the titles used. I believe, but am not sure, that the credential still uses the term, serve as a librarian. Another point. The state no longer offers general secondary credentials which allowed me to teach any high school subject. The only secondary credentials offered are now limited to a particular field. If I had obtained my credentials afte the change, I would be limited to teaching English and history. With the addition of my librarian credential, I would also gain the right to teach Library Science (information technology or any other name being used today.) ",

            "answer_text": "A Teacher Librarian runs a school library and may supervise an assistant and teaching assistants. I supervise a .5 time assistant and up to 28 student teaching assistants in my high school library. I also teach research classes and can be called upon to substitute teach classes. You need a teaching credential and a MLS or MLIS, Masters in Library and Information Sciences, and a library teaching credential. In my case, I have an additional Masters in Anthropology. I works as a science teacher for about 15 years. I wanted something new and was tired of preparing l as lsbs and grading homework. It took about 2 years to complete the MLIS in a virtual program at San Jose State University. I was in the Teacher Librarian track, so I had regular classes in cataloging, Library and society, etc., an elective in story telling, and courses in curriculum development, research, books for young adults, collection development, plus a semester of internships and an e portfolio or thesis. I worked fulltime during my studies. It took about 3 years to get my first position, mostly because I was already employed fulltime and was being picky. I finally got two: running a middle school library in San Francisco and working part time for San Francisco Public Library as a Librarian 1 TEAN. After one year, I moved to being the high school Teacher Librarian for Piedmont High School. I really enjoy it. During the Covid 19 I gave up the extra job as I don't want to travel into SF anymore and be exposed to patrons in many different branches. Being a Librarian is great. I highly recommend it and wish I had done it earlier in life. It is a growing industry. Many baby boomers are retiring, so jobs are opening up. ",
