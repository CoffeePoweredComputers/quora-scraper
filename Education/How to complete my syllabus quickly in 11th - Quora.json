            "answer_text": "Don't go to fast as \u201chaste makes waste\u201d give proper time to all the subjects and all the chapters ! Though I understand that syllabus completion is needed so I'll just discuss what I did for ensuring both a good pace and quality of study :- I didn't rush !! If something took time I gave it the required time || if something takes up your time then somethings save your time too.Don't go running after every book or content you see. Follow one book keep calm and stay confident what you did using the book is sufficient in itself.Devote regular study hours that help you average at least 9 hrs a day ! And try to be more productive during the weekends !!Ask doubts then and there don't wait , the later you ask more are the chances of you not understanding the doubt.For chemistry of 11th class it is very easy to finish the syllabus very quick as the syllabus is very less.For Physics I suggest you take your time and build a strong foundation for the Jee Advanced examination ! You can work this by Studying big chapters upto rotation in 3 months and then going for the thermodynamics part and then oscillations and waves.For math ! Ignore NCERT ! Do some good book or math modules of coaching only. If you are a dummy school student then you have a lot of time use this to practice maths and gain edge over other aspirants.Hope it helps!

            "answer_text": "Hey !! See this question is common among all 11th standard students . As i understand that half of your year is gone and coming 6 months are literally crucial . The syllabus is more than time left. According to me i would suggest you to go for online classes. They provide you recorded lectures that help you study anytime like whenever you want . Best thing you don\u2019t need to waste your energy and time for going out for classes and even you can utilize that time for studies. Below are some names of the institute or sites that provide you online classes: byjusTakshila LearningExamfearVedantulearnpickAccording to me , the name i heard the most for best in this business is Takshila Learning.They provide you login id and password which you can use anywhere and anytime. Se what happens we want to study in night but problem is that you don\u2019t have things according to your aspect . But here you have your own login id and you can access whenever you want . They even provide you 24x7 faculty . You will be added on a whatsapp group with the faculty . So you don\u2019t need to wait for the turn to ask question as happens in the offline coaching had it. You just need to mention your doubt in whatsapp and will be cleared there and then . I hope my answer is helpful . ALL THE BEST ! ",

Its not about how quickly you complete the syllabus, its all about how deeply you understand the subject. You can finish the syllabus by working out overtime and finish within 2 months and then you can start your 12th grade. Note: Your 11th maths are important if you choose engineering stream",
