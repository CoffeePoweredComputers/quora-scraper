            "answer_text": "Choosing or shortlisting universities/schools for higher education is one of the most important and complex tasks. Choosing a school doesn\u2019t only mean that you will be just completing your education there. But, your personal and intellectual growth, opportunities to be availed, employability, career track, all depends upon this single decision and that\u2019s what makes it the most important task to do while taking a decision on your higher education. Choice of universities may be influenced upon by various factors. Following can be considered while shortlisting universities for yourself: A) Ranking: This is the first thing that attracts prospective students. All want to get into top ones. But is ranking of the university alone satisfies your needs? The answer is NO. Rankings depend on various threads of data released by the schools. There may be schools/universities whom you may not find any where in rankings but they still are the best bet. There may be schools which may not be ranked good in overall rankings but may fall in top ones for few programs. Are you looking for a top ranked school or are looking for a school which may not be in top notch but may be very good in the field of study you are looking for. You must not get attracted by the rankings alone and should do your homework properly about the school before you finalise it. B) Standardised Tests: What are the test scores required by the target school and what is the average score that can help you compete for admission. You must consider the same and prepare yourself accordingly. C) Cost of Attendance: Finances play an important role when shortlisting a school or university. You must go through the cost of attendance and match the same with your financial worth so that affordability and student debt doesn\u2019t hound you after you get started with the school. D) Acceptance Rate: Although averages are always misleading and acceptance rate doesn\u2019t always throw the exact picture about the chances of admission. But it\u2019s still an important aspect to be considered while finalising the universities. It gives an idea about the kind of competition you will face while competing for an admit and the kind of profiles that particular school\u2019s admission committee is looking for or had been interested in. E) Opportunities Available: What kind of opportunities does the school offer to its students, academically and professionally, for your growth. You can research about the school, get in touch with few alumni, current students and faculty to get a fair idea about it. The opportunities must match your career interests in order for your choice to be fruitful for you. F) Curriculum: The curriculum offered by the school should match with what you want to study. This is very important and this is where lot of people make mistake while choosing a school. What you want to study is what is most important and one should not compromise on that. I always advise students to research the academic offerings and to get in touch with few faculty to get more clarity about the academic stuff at the school. G) Location: Location of the school is one factor worth considering. Say, if you want to study some program in finance, you would surely want a good school situated at or nearby NYC so that you can avail best of the opportunities available outside school. The location of school can play an important role when looking for internship opportunities/networking opportunities/employment opportunities. H) Alumni: This can also play an important role in deciding a school to study in. The vast alumni base and their professional success helps you avail opportunities to get in touch with them and network yourself successfully. Remember, successful networking is the only key to success in today\u2019s competitive environment. I) School Fitment: Does the school match with your own profile. Is your profile a good fit for the school and vice versa. Your profile must match with what the school is looking for and school\u2019s offerings must match with your career goals. This, according to me, is one of the most crucial factor to be considered while shortlisting the schools. These are the few factors among many which can be considered while shortlisting schools. It is always suggested to research about the school thoroughly before you make your final choice. Hope it helps. All the best!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Totally agree with whatever Gaurav Mehta has said. :) While zeroing in on the university/college, it is very important for an international student to keep in mind their academic and financial backgrounds (though it is very easy to get a student loan these days). Being an international student myself, I chose my university based on my academic scores, the ranking of the university, the course I was interested in pursuing. Some international students (and a couple of my friends too) also consider universities that are usually accessible by public transport and have ample of accommodation options around them (these aren\u2019t really important though, but a lot of students consider them). Good luck! :) ",
