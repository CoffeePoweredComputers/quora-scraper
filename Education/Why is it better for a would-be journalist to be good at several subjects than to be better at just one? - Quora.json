            "answer_text": "I am copy-pasting my response to your other related question, because I had both of your questions in mind when I wrote my answer. In the late nineteenth century the journalist was either a hack or a renaissance man. The ideal was the latter, because all things in life are considered interrelated. I recall Walter Lippman's \u201cpictures in their heads\u201d of the common man which was to be overcome and who were to be protected by the learned man, and so journalism had grown largely out of sociology. But there was also H. L. Menchen who wrote an encyclopedia on the American language while being a witty, biting erudite commentator on business and politics. He obviously cared about the dignity and worth of his readers. Experience with the trials, trivialities, and triumphs of man was also beneficial, whether you rose up out of the popular social scene like Walter Winchel or from the combat zone like Ernest Hemingway. Many times today, though, subject areas are considered so complex it is preferred you have a degree in the field you are reporting in, such as medicine, finance, or aeronautics. But it's not just about the technical. All told, the more rounded - and compassionate \u2014 you are the better your reporting will be. You'll have a more mature take on life and be able to view subjects in more than one perspective, and see the interrelationships of the various actors. When we see the plight of the migrants in Lesbos or the fear and exhaustion of medical staff fighting the pandemic how quickly we in the field return to our sociological origin. ",
