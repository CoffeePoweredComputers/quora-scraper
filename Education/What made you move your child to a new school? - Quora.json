            "answer_text": "When my kids were little, I was considering moving them to a different school, due to some issues with their current schools administration. I had discussed it with a friend who was in the process of moving her kids. When my kids got off the bus one day my 8 yr old daughter was visibly upset. I asked her what was wrong\u2026 it turned out the principal had pulled her out of class and grilled her about potentially switching schools trying to ascertain if it was true. I called her teacher (she was in the 3rd grade), she confirmed that my daughter had indeed been called to the office and did not return to class missing the last 1.5- 2 hours. She had not been told what was \u201cwrong\" and assumed a family emergency had come up, this was a Thursday. Friday morning I drove my kids to school, instead of them riding the bus, to confront the principal about this. He confirmed that yes he has \u201cspoken to my daughter at length\u201d yesterday, saying he was only doing his job as principal trying to determine if I was really planning on switching their schools. I informed him that questioning an 8 year old in that manner was inappropriate, especially about an issue that should have been directed to me. Apparently when my friend had been at the school the previous day to drop off some papers, she mentioned she wasn't the only parent considering switching schools. This was a small school with around 100 kids enrolled from about 70 families. He deduced the other parent was me and immediately called my daughter to the office. Monday morning my kids were enrolled in another school, closer to where we lived but not on their bus route. I also filed a complaint with the school board, voicing my concern about the principal's immaturity and bad judgment calls that lead to my considering to switch schools and ultimately my making the decision. Over the summer he was reassigned as an assistant principal at the county middle school, the school board had decided he wasn't yet ready to be a principal. After I withdrew my kids, several of the teachers and the office secretary had voiced concerns about his \u201cmethods\", worried that he just wasn't ready to be a principal. And just in case you were curious. I loved the close knit school, i knew all of the teacher, the secretary and even the bus drivers by name & they knew all of the kids whether or not they were in their class. Once the new principal was selected a couple of the teachers called me and asked if I would bring my kids come back to their school! The administration issues at the school had been resolved and my kids started back at their little school, glad to be back with friends! *there was no malice on his part, he was just young, and inexperienced, this had been his first time working as an administrator.

            "answer_text": "TX School Restricts Parents from Walking Their Kids Home?! I see the link didn\u2019t work for me. Google Fox News Bear Branch Elementary and see my 15 minutes of fame on national TV. I moved my children out of the elementary school in my neighborhood after a new Principal took over and began changing everything. She yelled at the teachers with a bullhorn, removed the Pledge of Allegiance from the classrooms, she forced eleven staff members out of the school over the summer, and then the real fun began. We and many others moved into this expensive gold course community because our kids could walk, bike, and be driven on golf carts to school. I would get off work every day, park in the school lot and walk to the front doors where the staff handed kids off to parents (parents had to be ID\u2019d of course.) The car rider line wound through the neighborhood but by allowing several hundred children leave this way every day, the line was very manageable. Well new Principal decided it was much too dangerous to allow kids to walk, with parents, to their homes or cars. Absolutely not allowed, no way, no how. The car rider line became out of control, taking over an hour to collect all the children and blocking the neighborhood traffic and emergency response access. The final straw was when my friend, who lived right behind the school, had been volunteering at the school one day. When school ended she collected her kids and walked home. The Principal called the police on her and several others. The police actually responded and warned the parents they would be arrested if it happened again. My children started at a private school the next day. ",
