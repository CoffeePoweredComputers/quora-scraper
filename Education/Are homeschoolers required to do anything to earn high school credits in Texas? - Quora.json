            "answer_text": "Hi! With 3 grown homeschooled kids, I can tell you there are only 3 requirements to homeschool in Texas: The instruction must be bona fide (i.e., not a sham).The curriculum must be in visual form (e.g., books, workbooks, video monitor).The curriculum must include the five basic subjects of reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics, and good citizenship.And, because homeschoolers were given the legal status of private schools, we can implement these as we see fit. So, specifically to your question, a family *could* design whatever they wanted that would be considered AP or credit by exams. Usually those are only used by the school system though. Homeschool families simply create whatever learning environment they choose and when they\u2019re ready to move on to either careers or higher learning, parents declare them graduated. When my kids were teens and wanted to go to college, they simply took the placement exams at the community college and enrolled in the classes. We created transcripts based on what they had learned up to that point. All the admissions office really wanted was a signature from the Principal and a Teacher (my husband and I both signed it) and a graduation date. Then we were on to the next table for the admission process. One of my kids went to a university (Texas State) after accumulating 15 credit hours at Austin Community College and transferred in as a sophomore. No SAT/ACT needed for transfer students. (And if you\u2019re wondering how he did - all A\u2019s and 1 B - Magna Cum Laude) We created a transcript for my second child to go to an acting conservatory in New York. She did take some classes at ACC too prior to that. But the conservatory didn\u2019t really care about those. And the third used her transcript to get into cosmetology school in Austin. No one has asked for a diploma. ",

            "answer_text": "I did a bit of research on the Texas Board of Education website and also some homeschool support groups and blogs in Texas. In Texas, homeschooling families function as small, privately-run schools, and parents do not have to submit any tests or evidence of schooling to the state. Here's what I found: Homeschooling parents must keep accurate written record of all of the high school courses their high school student studied, including:The curriculum that was used (books, online, videos, etc.)What the curriculum coveredHow long it was studied (6 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc.)Samples of the student\u2019s workSamples of the student\u2019s testsHomeschool parents must prepare an official transcript stating the student\u2019s name and personal information, courses completed, and grades received in each course.The students then complete their high school course of study as set by their parents, although it's suggested by the HSLDA that parents consider starting with the minimum coursework required of public high school students in their state. Here\u2019s Texas\u2019 minimum requirements for completion at any public high school: After their personally set requirements are met, homeschool parents can then issue a diploma verifying the completion of high school. The diploma must state:the student\u2019s name,the name of the home school or the parents who are in charge of the student,a signature from someone who oversaw the student\u2019s education (the parents),the date it was issued,Text stating that the student has fulfilled the requirements for graduation.This parent-produced diploma is considered legally valid for both college admission and entering the workforce just like a normal high school diploma, according to the Homeschool Legal Defence Association (HSLDA).Students who wish to receive AP credit must take an official AP test at a testing location in their state.Students who wish to enter colleges that require either the SAT or ACT should take them at an official testing location.No other notice or state testing is required for homeschool students in the state of Texas.Hope that is helpful! Any corrections or advice from former homeschoolers is welcome in the comments. ",
