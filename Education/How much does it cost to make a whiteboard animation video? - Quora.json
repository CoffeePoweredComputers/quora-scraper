            "answer_text": "How much does a whiteboard animation video cost? Are you really going to make us say it? Ugh. Fine. \u201cIt depends.\u201d There, are you happy now? The truth is, whiteboard animation cost runs the gamut from $0 to $1,500+ per minute \u2013 and more. To complicate matters further, you can\u2019t factor the price alone in your decision. You have to take into account other things like turnaround time, quality, and the future ROI you want to get. So today, let\u2019s compare the three most popular options for making a whiteboard video: DIY, in-house, and outsourcing. We\u2019ll give you an estimate of the whiteboard animation cost involved, and explore the pros and cons of each. We\u2019ll start with the DIY option. After all, if you want something done well, shouldn\u2019t you do it yourself? Well, let\u2019s find out if that applies to whiteboard animation!  Option A: (Don\u2019t) do it yourself for free Money cost: varies, but could be as low as $0. Other costs: opportunity, time, your brain cells. When you\u2019re just starting out with video marketing, it\u2019s very tempting to go DIY. After all, you can write and narrate the script yourself, create whiteboard animations, and edit the video \u2013 all with free software! Then you just put the fruits of your labor out there and see what happens. If you get some ROI, you can always invest in professional help and higher production values\u2026 right? Well, no. In the immortal words of Admiral Ackbar, \u201cIt\u2019s a trap!\u201d (What? Like you don\u2019t rely on Star Wars for all your life lessons.) This option usually fails for three reasons: Low production values will drag down the perceived value of your brand as a whole. Sure, some of your content can be rough around the edges \u2013 most people will forgive that. But if you want to create a whiteboard animation video to drive sales, for example, or hire people, you want to make it look good.Using free software to create whiteboard animations will give you a generic-looking video. These applications rely on widely available art assets \u2013 and you\u2019re not the only one using them! So unless your goal is to create the most forgettable visuals in the world, you want to steer clear.How much is your time worth? You have a business to run \u2013 so we\u2019re guessing quite a lot! So even if you manage to create a stunning whiteboard animation video for $0, it will come with a hefty, if invisible, price tag. You\u2019d neglect all the other critical tasks, like creating a marketing strategy, hiring people, formulating profitable ideas, you name it.Now, you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have to do it myself! I\u2019ve got people working for me. We can just do it in-house!\u201d Indeed, you can. And that brings us to Option B\u2026 Brands like Twitter, Uber, Hubspot, and others are already using whiteboard video to attract more customers. Discover exactly how they do it, along with 9 more business-boosting tips \u2013 like how to increase your conversion rates by 20%! Click here to download your copy of \u201cTop 10 Ways to Use a Whiteboard Video\u201d Option B: Do it in-house Money cost: your team\u2019s billable hours, audio and video equipment. Other costs: other important projects and everyone\u2019s sanity. You have invested all this time and effort hiring an amazing team. Surely, they can handle a small video project! That way, you won\u2019t have to do it yourself \u2013 and you\u2019ll save a bunch of money on whiteboard animation costs. As with Option A, the reality is a bit more complicated than that. Here\u2019s what you want to keep in mind when you\u2019re trying to produce a whiteboard video in-house: Talent. We don\u2019t mean it in some vague, nebulous sense. You will need a minimum of five people with distinctive skill-sets:A copywriter or marketer to write a persuasive scriptA narrator to do an engaging, high-quality voiceoverA whiteboard artist to draw all the visualsA videographer to combine the visuals and voiceoverA project manager to coordinate the processManagement. It helps if your company has a tight video production loop already. If you don\u2019t, that means you\u2019re in for delays, setbacks, failures of communication, and all sorts of other snags \u2013 at least until you figure out a workable process!Resources. Filming equipment, sound equipment, studio space to record audio and visuals, editing software, even art supplies\u2026 all these things cost money. Plus, procuring and maintaining them costs time and energy.If you don\u2019t specialize in video production already, you may find that you can\u2019t meet all the requirements on this list. Which means you might want to outsource at least some of the tasks involved. So why not take Option C, and simply outsource all of it? Let\u2019s examine how that might work, and if it\u2019s a good fit for your video marketing needs. Option C: Outsource it Money cost: from a few hundred bucks to $1,500 and more \u2013 depending on quality. Other costs: wasted time and resources if you get unlucky with the contractors. Finally, the simplest solution would be to hire a contractor or a full-service agency to produce your whiteboard animation video. That way, you and your team will just have to communicate your project goals and requirement, and give feedback at different stages of production. Naturally, this option has a few downsides, too. For one, your entire project lives and dies by how competent your chosen contractor or agency is. If they are, you\u2019ll get exactly the video you wanted, on time and on budget. If not, you\u2019ll pay thousands of dollars for the privilege of getting a shoddy piece of work several weeks \u2013 or months! \u2013 after the deadline. And then there\u2019s the money part. Outsourcing your video, while convenient and effective, is not the most affordable option. If you get lucky with a great agency, you can expect to pay upwards of $1,500 per minute of whiteboard animation. For this, you\u2019ll get a high-quality whiteboard animation video within a reasonable time frame. How reasonable? Well, we can\u2019t speak for other companies, but The Draw Shop video standard production cycle is just 4 weeks \u2013 officially the shortest turnaround time in the industry! But of course, none of this means anything unless your video can get you closer to fulfilling your business goals. So the real question you should be asking isn\u2019t \u201chow much\u201d \u2013 but this\u2026 Is it going to be worth the money? When you\u2019re asking, \u201cHow much does a whiteboard animation explainer video cost?\u201d \u2013 you\u2019re only solving half of the equation. You also want to ask, \u201cHow much is having a whiteboard video worth to my business? What kind of ROI can I generate?\u201d And, just as with whiteboard animation costs, the answer will vary. As much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t whip out a crystal ball and estimate your future ROI from a hypothetical whiteboard animation video. There are way too many moving parts. But here are some examples of how our clients used whiteboard video to grow their businesses: Mimic Technologies put a whiteboard explainer video on their homepage \u2013 and within 45 days, their revenue for the year exploded by $250,000!Harvard Services group leveraged their video to win the prestigious 2012 BSCAI Image Award for \u201cBest Company Website\u201d \u2013 handily beating 50,000 competitors.Bestselling author Andy Andrews used his video to generate buzz about his new book. The whiteboard animation trailer broke 100,000 views in one week\u2026 while his old trailer barely got past 10,000 views in 10 months!Source: How Much Does A Whiteboard Animation Cost?

            "answer_text": "Whiteboard animation, one of the most preferred explainer video formats for businesses, is also one of the most cost-effective ways to reach out to the audience. Whiteboard animation videos cost much lesser than live-action videos or VFX-enhanced videos. While some studios offer a flat rate on animated whiteboard explainer video production services, others work on a project-to-project basis. This means that the variables are taken into consideration \u2013 such as the length, complexity of animation, etc. \u2013 before they quote a price for the video. There are several online tools that allow users to create their own whiteboard animation videos for free, the quality takes a major hit in such cases. It is best to outsource whiteboard explainer video making work to an experienced company, since their output will be far better and superior in quality. ",
