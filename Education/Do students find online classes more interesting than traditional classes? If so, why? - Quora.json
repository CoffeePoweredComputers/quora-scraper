            "answer_text": "Online classes are those in which a student studies by the help of internet and we all know internet is a vast ocean of knowledge. The trend of online classes has shown a \u2018J curve\u2019 especially during lockdown due to COVID19. Students have become more and more inclined towards the online mode of education, one possible reason for this inclination could be availability of time to explore different courses and classes while sitting at home but the other majorly important reason for this shift is \u2018interest\u2019. The concept of online classes, though already existed in Indian education system but still the majorly accepted mode of teaching was traditional classroom teaching. Now when students have interacted enough and experienced the perks of online classes they surely would have found online classes more interesting than traditional classes. A recent study has shown 77% of educators believe that online classes are just as good as traditional classes, if not better and nearly 70% of all students claim online instruction to be as good as or better than in a traditional classroom setting. Definitely online classes may be new for some of the students but considering the recent scenario in covid19 pandemic when all schools,colleges and other educational institutions are shut. Students are left with only one option to educate themselves, that is through online classes. The so far response of both students and teaches about online classes have proved to be a good news for the Indian education system. Gradually with time, by the help of online classes the loss of students will get compensated also it is believed, by that time students will not only become educated but also become technologically advanced.

Most important thing \ud83d\ude1dand then we are left with 3 hours and we all know that after coming from whether tution or school. We all will take 1 hour rest and then 2 hours with phone and for that too we are scolded for holding phone.

I hope that i answered you question well\u2026.THANK YOU for reading\u2026. ",

This is the case especially in the case of Children under 13. On the other hand, for the High school, with a creative and attractive content with animated content, quizzes and polls created online, learning becomes less laborious with lesser writing, new ways of learning and easing the effort. For aspiring learners like the ones preparing for competitive exams like Olympiads, NTSE, JEE/NEET , instant doubt clarification with young tutors who are not available in front of them gives them the comfort zone of asking all their doubts without hesitation and getting them clarified. So, it is the students who have the self motivation and aspiration who are enjoying these online classes otherwise it should be a really appealing and interesting content to keep them captivated else online classes aren't that interesting to them at all.

Some students like the traditional classes because it makes the environment for themselves to learn, understand and they can\u2019t focus while learning at their home. Also, they feels more comfortable and experiences well due to the real face-to-face interaction with the teachers and can ask question directly from the teacher (although, this can be done online but they don\u2019t feel that much comfortable while learning online). On the other hand, some students may like the new online classes initiative more interesting as they are at their home feeling more comfortable (which they can\u2019t feel in classes due to various reasons for ex: bullying) to learn and interact with the teacher and class, virtually. Also, the student may tend to gain more from the teacher due to its comfortableness and easiness at home environment. . . So it depends from student to student. . . . PS! ",

            "answer_text": "One of the important reasons behind more interest in online classes is that they are convenient. Children like to relax and what is better than to study in their comfort zone? Moreover, with so many digital tools like whiteboard learning, animated videos, and communication options, children find online learning fun and interactive. Online classes keep the students engaged. The teacher interacts with everyone and has an eye on everybody. This provides undivided attention to each student, along with answers to every student\u2019s doubts. In a traditional classroom set up, students encounter more distractions. A teacher cannot focus on all the children separately, but online learning removes such restrictions. Even if a student was unable to learn well in his online class, he can discuss it with the teacher and arrange for another class. If the teacher is available for more extended hours, it becomes easier for the student to clarify his doubts as and when he faces them.  ",

With the technological revolution and innovative methods of E-learning, education is made available to the doorstep of children, eliminating the need for commuting from one place to another or following a rigid schedule, and providing a comfortable environment where learning is possible in pyjamas. Most importantly, online learning is a greener option, offering diverse material such as videos, photos, e-books and online quizzes, plummeting the need of physical textbooks. In a space as vast and wide as the internet, there are infinite skills and subjects to teach and learn. Some of the renowned ed-techs like BYJU\u2019S, Unacademy, Udemy, edX, Khan Academy, Coursera etc. are offering some selective free courses (in collaboration with various universities and colleges) which proved to be very qualitative in the lockdown. Needless to say, traditional learning will always remain our first preference. However, with the unique advantage of serving varied interests of students on a single dashboard, online learning is stoking as well.  Image Source: Google Team Learnweel. ",

As far as online classes being interesting or not, I think when the entire teaching community comes together to make sure that the learners receive proper education or at least make the best out of this constricting times, it's beyond being a subject of interest but reverence. We need to understand that the infrastructure of our country, sadly is not something remarkable hence issues regarding the connectivity arise more often than not. However with engaging classes, online materials made available and doubt clearing sessions, at the comfort of their homes, students to a certain extent should find these gratefully intriguing , I personally appreciate it too.

Like some students would learn easily from a lecture , some would learn from interaction with teachers, some would learn from a YouTube video and so on. So , some students might like online study and other might not like. Online study like other methods of studying is interesting only to some students. So it depends on student to student the they want to study. And why they like to study that also varies from student to student. Like some students might find online study interesting because they can move back to the point they don't understand. Some might just can study that way . Some might find it easier to understand. So the reasons also vary. \u2026 \u2026 Hope I satisfied you with my answer and you liked it . Have a good day , bye. ",

Teachers are just taking classes like robots without any interaction between students. They are teaching hardly 10 minutes and playing youtube videos rest of the time. Online classes is very ineffective and we can't able to focus on little screens. As far I only have smartphone, I can't able to focus on 6inch screen more than 40\u201360minutes. I got eye strains and headache because of that. Even online classes are worthless, yes online classes is the only option now, but without effectiveness, it totally disappointment. Teachers won't even care for students, they just want to show proof to higher officials that they have taken classes, so hardly 10 min class and rest of time is for youtube. Thankyou\u2026 Thankyou\u2026. ",

Though there is less requirement of communication skills which is quite a part of offline teaching, still online classes are more beneficial to the students. During online classes, communication skills are tested through chats. besides that, there are ample scope of audio-visual learning which is not quite there in the offline classes. It is a well-known fact that Audio-visual learning is the most beneficial for any student. The only hurdle there is, in India, there is not much use of it or there is lack of facilities especially in the semi-urban and the rural parts of the country. Students who can\u2019t afford this has to rely on the offline education system, which is nowadays is quite boring. In the online system, students can clear their doubts on any subject they want, can watch laboratory experiments, which is quite a hassle in the schools during the offline study. they can also take online coaching through various websites at a reasonable price. I have written about the websites they can opt for in QUORA earlier. Please follow me to know about my other writings in Quora. ",
