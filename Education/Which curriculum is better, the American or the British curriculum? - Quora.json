            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure, because I am a product of only the \u201cAmerican curriculum\u201d. I assume you mean K-12 education. It is my belief that the American educational system is both our greatest strength and also our greatest weakness.Strength: The American system operates as if anyone can become anything. We study a bit of everything and don\u2019t limit student access to any subject (i.e. someone who loves science can still take art and vice versa). And when it comes to higher education, the same applies. Any student who meets fairly minimal qualifications can go to college, and almost any student can go on for graduate study\u2026meaning a student with mediocre high school grades has the chance to improve in college and still get a PhD, for instance.It is my understanding that the \u201cBritish system\u201d (in use in a lot of the world) limits access to all subjects at a fairly early age (~13) and uses exams to screen students. So someone may be tracked into science as a teenager and no longer be able to take art courses because the curriculum is more rigid. Exams will limit who can go on to graduate or professional school (only the very top scorers will go on).Weakness: The US system is \u201call over the place\u201d. Students don\u2019t get the depth of knowledge that a focused rigid program allows for and, as Sara Matthews points out, there\u2019s well-documented state-to-state variation in curriculum (and a socioeconomic effect on quality). Our college is 4 years rather than the British 3 years (and I\u2019m also an advocate of the liberal arts education, where a science major takes some art to become a \u201cwell rounded\u201d individual). And it costs to go to college/university/graduate/professional school in the US (and that limits access).So for some American students, \u201cthe sky is the limit\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter who your parents are or where you\u2019re from, you can study whatever you want and become whatever you want. That\u2019s wonderful. But it doesn\u2019t work for everyone. EDIT (I can't figure out how to reply to the comments): Emma Smith, thank you for the comments and corrections. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. Mostly in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, you are forced to specialise quite early, that is, know what GCSEs you want to take at 16 by the age of 14 to start the courses. In that way you could quite easily drop all Humanities, Music and Arts by 14 (for example) and many would say that it is overly limiting. (Some schools have a rule that you must do, for example, one language or one Humanity, so check.) In general in the USA, you learn a wider variety of subjects for longer to a less high level of specialism. So if you aren\u2019t sure what you want to do and need to keep your options wide open, you\u2019ll want to go for the USA every time. NB returning to the UK, there are differences in Scotland; if you are interested in these, take a detailed look. Basically what is called \u201cA Level\u201d (Advanced Level) in England is \u201cHigher\u201d in Scotland, and the system allows a slightly wider range of subjects. A University course typically lasting 3 years in England is often 4 in Scotland. There is one cultural thing about the UK that you might want to consider in all this. For reasons almost entirely connected with snobbery, people specialising in science have historically not achieved as much social respect as those doing law, political studies, history, psychology, English literature etc. Indeed a lot of folks who ended up running the UK or its colonies did PPE or similar at Oxbridge. This snobbery has diminished now, but for example in Germany anyone with a science PhD is regularly described as Dr Schmidt (etc) and in Italy anyone with an engineering degree is L\u2019Ingeniere - still not so in the UK. Good luck with your choices. ",
