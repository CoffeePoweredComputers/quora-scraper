However, I find it unlikely that the IB will be postponing the May 2020 exams; it doesn\u2019t really help, because different places are being affected at different rates at different times. A postponement might allow students in one location to take the exams, while preventing students in another place from taking it. They will also not be creating an additional exam session - they \u201c[do] not have sufficient time to create new papers\u201d.[1] Personally, I find it more likely that the May 2020 exams will run as scheduled. Those who are unable to take them may instead be able to join the November 2020 exam session. Footnotes[1] COVID-19 (novel Coronavirus) updates",
