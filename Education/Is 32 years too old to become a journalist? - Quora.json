            "answer_text": "Whew! That\u2019s a tough question with no easy answer. Let me start with the positives first. My initial answer would be no, it\u2019s not too old\u2026 if you have the passion for the profession and the drive needed to succeed. However, without a journalism/ writing background and experience, it will be challenging. Here are some things you may consider doing in order to do this. First, hone your writing. There are several online writing courses available. (I\u2019m about to create one myself \u2014 but, no, I\u2019m not selling the course \u2014 yet.) Write, write and write. Consider such sites as Medium where you can publish your own work. Also write for free for the various news sites looking for material. Second, become an expert in a specific field and you have a better chance of selling yourself. For example, health news is a critical concern for journalism operations around the world. If you have a background in this area, such as being a nurse, that would help your \u201csales pitch.\u201d Or pick other areas in which you have interest and experience. Third, be willing to start low. You will have to build up a resume. Look at small news operations that need help, doing research, providing information, fact checking, etc. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends whether you want to make a living out of it and why. I left the military, where I had been increasingly working with the media, when I was 50 and became a journalist full time. To be fair I was running my own media company which made it easier. What I would say from a UK perspective is that there are far too many journalists (or people who think they are journalists) coming out of university. As a result of these and other industry pressures pay rates are going down steadily. The other issue in the UK is that our universities are now completely penetrated by left wing lecturers who indoctrinate inexperienced students. My company traditionally provided work placements for student journalists, but we had to stop because the people joining us proved to be of such poor quality and unable to report neutrally. I put that down to two things. People who are unsuited to the job being encouraged to spend money on degree courses and poor teaching combined with the aforementioned political indoctrination. That is a fundamental problem for journalism as the first duty of a good journalist is to throw away all their personal prejudices and write from a neutral prospective. Brexit in the UK has thrown these issues into stark relief, and shown how biased many of our journalists now are, resulting in increasing mistrust of news outlets by the public. The BBC has damaged its reputation quite badly, Sky News has sunk in most peoples estimation and Channel 4 News is now so biased in its reporting, that politicians won\u2019t give its journalists interviews anymore. That is all before you get to the print media. Journalists with anything other than left wing liberal views keeps very quiet. Particularly if they are a freelance as they fear being shunned by their biased colleagues and unable to work. Left wing bias in our media succeeded quite well until the issues of Brexit and the arrival of social media focussed a spotlight on the issue. Not sure how we solve this in future as we need serious reform of our universities (and increasingly our schools) to remove political bias, and fundamental reform of our media. If we do not achieve this we will see increasing damage to pubic trust. ",
