            "answer_text": "It sounds like you care to learn computer science, without needing a university degree or certification. Sequence: Figure out what you want to accomplish with your knowledge. (teach, play, work developing OS, middleware, development tools, analytics, packaged applications, custom development) in what domains (data, processing, systems management, communications, end user, business user, corporate application) and maybe what industry (media, games, chemicals, education, government, biology/health, electronics, hospitality, \u2026), and maybe what platforms (embedded, mobile, desktop/notebook, server, combined)Find and ask people who do Computer Science in those domains what CS topics and non-CS topics are important there.Use university course catalogs to work backwards from those topics to their prerequisites.Learn those topics, whether at a university, online courses, or books.Learn existing open source examples in your domains of interest. Install, use, customize, then enhance, and contribute back to them.Further apply what you have learned and discovered along the way.Fill in gaps, based on what you see as required in job postings. Repeat steps 3..4b for these additional topics.",
