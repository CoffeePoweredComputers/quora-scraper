            "answer_text": "VITEEE is more of a speed test just like the BITSAT examination. The level of VITEEE is equivalent to BITSAT examination and most of the paper consists of 12th topics. Around 65-70 percentof the questions asked are from class 12th syllabus. Being a Physics teacher I can guide you for Physics preparation. Important Physics topics from 11th include work, power and energy, momentum conservation, friction, rotational dynamics, waves and KTG. Complete 12th is important for this exam along with chapters like Semiconductors, logic gates and communication systems. The best thing to do right now would be to buy past year question papers of a trusted publisher. Give as many as online tests as you can right now. Buy a test series for the same. If you start now, a good score may be be easily scored with proper practice and analysis of tests. Good Luck. ",
