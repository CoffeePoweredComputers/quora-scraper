            "answer_text": "College mascots are an outgrowth of the college team names. In the early 1900s, schools did not have team names. As football developed a following, sportswriters began covering it. These early sportswriters made no effort to be objective; they openly supported the local team. They often would refer to the local team as, \u201cOur boys,\u201d or \u201cOur eleven.\u201d The challenge was what to call the opponent. There is a limit to the number of times you can use a pronoun like, \u201cthem.\u201dHence, began insults. Sportswriters would make fun of the opponent. Purdue, a school famous for engineering, required mechanical engineering students to actually build a steam boiler during one of their labs. The school became the Boilermakers. The University of Nebraska, an agricultural school in the middle of the corn-belt, became the Cornhuskers. Other schools, especially the flagship state schools, were referenced as their state nickname; hence the Ohio State Buckeyes, Michigan Wolverines, Wisconsin Badgers and Minnesota Golden Gophers. Over time these insults became a point of pride and schools recognized them as their team name.As it became popular for a school to have an identity, all schools adopted nicknames. Penn State, a school without a nickname, was scheduled to play the Princeton Tigers. Not to be outdone, a student group went to the game in New Jersey and cheered their team as the \u201cLions.\u201d (Apparently, they felt lions were stronger than tigers.) When they returned to campus, controversy arose that lions are not indigenous to the Americas. However, nearby Mount Nittany did have mountain lions. Nittany lions became their moniker.From this, some schools started bringing live animals to games. Bevo at Univ of Texas, Uga the bulldog at Georgia and Ralphie the buffalo at Colorado are examples. However, given the diversity of nicknames, it was more common to see a cheerleader dress in costume.Why do colleges have mascots? Simple\u2026 it\u2019s fun. For me, the greater question is, \u201cWhy do pro sports teams have mascots that look like monsters and have nothing to do with the team name?\u201d For example, the Cleveland Indians (team colors: navy blue and red) have a giant purple \u201cthing\u201d with yellow spots. He's named \"Slider\" after the type of baseball pitch, but other than that he has nothing to do with anything. ",

            "answer_text": "This is very interesting a due to its origin. It is a known fact that colleges and universities have been around for many years but, the mascot has been not. The clemsons tigers have been a predominant college for many years both academically and athletically. Circa the 1920\u2019s their football stadiums were not being filled up. They were struggling and needed a new boost in order to increase attendance. In order to combat this low, the university heads decided to bring a live tiger the the following game. This seemed to be a solid plan and did boost the tickets sales. Unfortunately, the tiger mauled an innocent person in the crowd ending the reign of a live tiger mascot. In order to keep the attendance up, a young college professor decided to dress up as a tiger and go to the game. This kept the sales up and the crowd remained safe. That is why we have mascots at our universities today! ",
