            "answer_text": "Yes it's decent college for those who want to go for sales and marketing jobs. In these fields you will get a hell lot of companies of every field with decent package. And if you want to go for finance, operations and HR profile you will get a very few companies. There are some other benefits joining this college. There is less number of students so every faculty will know you personally. College admin is quite helpful for any kind of problem you are facing like classes, attendance, exams, and internals etc. You need not to worry about these things if you are really facing some problems. Learnings really happens here becoz there are less number of students and faculty is really helpful. Hostel food is really good and campus is very nice in Pune campus. Far from city quite environment, but sometimes you can face problems if you want to go to Pune. ",
