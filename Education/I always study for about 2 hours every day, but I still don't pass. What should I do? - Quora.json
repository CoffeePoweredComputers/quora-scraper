            "answer_text": "What matters is not the number of hours that you devote for studying per day but the the quantity that you can remember from what you study. If you retain about 90% you are super efficient. So the question would be how efficiently are you studying or how much you are trying to retain. You have to choose the right method. If it is maths you must be very conversant with the fundamentals. If it is science you must be thorough with the principles of the subject. Next you must develop yourself the habit of calling to memory from time to time what you have studied earlier. This practice will enhance your power of retention. When I had been studying, i used to read the book or a note two or three times and thereafter I closed the book and wrote the same thing on a rough paper from memory. At the end I compared the book with my writing. If it is not satisfactory, I re-read the book and repeated the activity once again. This is a very very effective method of retention of what you have studied. On the exam day wake up early and take a past paper and answer it like a mock up thing. Then compare your answers with the correct answers. This will give you much confidence to face the exam on that day. Keep a goal and fully concentrate on attaining that. Good luck! ",
