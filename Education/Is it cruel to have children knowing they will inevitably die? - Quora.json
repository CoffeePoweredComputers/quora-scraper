            "answer_text": "We live, we die. Because of the big brain that we have, we realize this. Apparently our brain is still not big enough to accept this fact. As a result, we spend the life worrying about death and imagining the \u2018life after death\u2019 and \u2018reincarnation\u2019 stories instead of making the best of this one life that we have here and now. As a happy side effect of this morbid interest, many big thinkers have left us the traces of own thoughts about death. Most of such quotes tend to be are about afterlife or ressurection, but Francis Bacon is your man (from Death - Wikiquote): What then remains, but that we still should cry. Not to be born, or being born to die. Ascribed to Francis Bacon; paraphrase of a Greek epigram, as reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations(1922)I subscribe to the same school as Ray Bradbury: Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there. It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so as long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 (1953)Except that burning books is a valid raison d\u2019etre according to this definition. So let\u2019s say that I subscribe to this opinion for some definitions of \u2018leave something behind\u2019. Leaving sane, tolerant, educated and reasonably happy children behind is a pretty good \u2018something\u2019 in my book. I\u2019ve set two in the world and neither of them has reproached me for this so far(+). This said, I can think of some valid reason against having children. Powerty. Famine. Nasty, genetically transmitted diseases. Or simply not wanting children. I can think of many other reasons, but \u201cbecause they will die eventually\u201d is definitely not among these. For, to quote Francis Bacon again: I have often thought upon death, and I find it the least of all evils. Francis Bacon, An Essay on DeathAnd Pompa mortis magis terret quam mors ipsa. (The pomp of death alarms us more than death itself). Quoted by Francis Bacon as from Seneca, as reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922)(+) they do complain a lot, just not about them being born. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you\u2019re making the case that atheism/secularism mentally tortures kids more Christianity ever could. I think atheism tortures adults too. Dawkins says this: In a universe of blind physical forces and genetic replication some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference. Why get up in the morning? Why go on living? Its a deterministic world, which means you have no free will. Without free will, there is no love, only stimulus and response. Without free will, there is only robots and brain chemistry, no human dignity. According to this myth, you\u2019re just physics, biology, and chemistry. Whatever you call it: Secularism, naturalism, or atheism, at the end of the day it sells out every thing we value about being human. It undermines the core principle of human dignity which gives rise to our Constitution and our natural rights. (none of the above is consistent with natural rights). Atheism may be appealing on the surface, but at the bottom and at its core it fundamentally disrespects humans\u2014dehumanizing them and turning from them from thinking, feeling, loving beings into stimulus-response robots. Its a dire picture of humanity that looks more like Brave New World or the Borg on Star Trek than anything approaching the richness and fullness, and complexity, and meaning, and purpose of the world we actually inhabit. Not to mention if there is no telos in the world (no purpose), the notion of ethics entirely explodes or implodes. Nice job, Dawkins, for all your biological knowledge you\u2019ve undermined any hope of an ethics for atheism, meaning that all that is left is a weak ethical anarchy or relativism. And thats a prescription for a downward spiral of domination and dehumanization of the weak. Humans exist in tension. Noticing those tensions is important\u2014its important to understand the human choice involved. The tugs between ethics on the one hand and its opposite, which causes character and civilization to rot and even implode. Our future deserves better\u2026..our humanity deserves better.  Open your eyes to the madness or live on your knees as a robot\u2026..in a world of free people. ",
