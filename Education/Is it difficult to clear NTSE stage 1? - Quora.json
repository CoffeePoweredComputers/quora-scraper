            "answer_text": "That's a difficult question! Well it requires some (a hell lot of :p) dedication on your part, which all of us are not prepared for in Xth, which makes it difficult. But given that we follow the right strategy, it certainly isn't an insanely difficult target. So let's go step by step. You may note that for some states or regions, NTSE stage 1 is more difficult than stage 2, for eg. chandigarh. There the cutoff this year was about 142+(I don't know exactly) out of 150, which is very high, so such places excluded, NTSE is not an unscalable mountain. You first and most importantly be well acquainted with your state board syllabus and difficulty level, it may be higher or lower than CBSE and NCERT. Buy the state board books and study them, to see what part coincides with your school syllabus and what part doesn't. The part which is not in your school curriculum must be done on your own and can be done. For stage one, its a fierce battle of score, for eg in my state, the cutoff was 124, and there were 13 students, including me, who got in by just that much. So you must understand the value of each and every mark. For that you NEED to be very strong in Social Science. Its the part where marks are directly proportional to the hours put in memorising countless facts and figures. It must be done from your state board as well and NCERT books, the importance of both varies from state to state. Science and maths are easy to score subjects provided you don't have any problem with them at the school level. Questions are a little application based though are easy if your concepts are clear. Maths for stage 1 is generally nothing to be afraid of, it may be time consuming, if anything. Then comes Mental Ability. It is quite easy and can be scoring if done quickly. Its goddamn important to not get stuck on a question whose solution doesn't strike your mind. Just move on, solve the other subjects, and if time permits, come back, only if you think it CAN be done quickly, don't go forming DEEP logics, because remember that each question counts, which is better to realize now than to realize when you miss by a mark or two. Coming to the last part, English, its the part which must be handled intelligently, in the sense that you MUST NOT waste time on this. Since we get all the papers together in stage one, try to do English in the least possible time, but don't do all the questions yet, first you must only do the questions which you can do as quick as hell (but please don't do silly mistakes for God's sake). Do only as much questions which you think will be sufficient to get you about 25 marks (5 for margin). Then attempt the rest of the paper once, then come back to english, attempt it completely then do the questions in the rest papers which you left. But the most important time is the preparation, which must be done diligently, and in an orderly manner. Attempt previous year papers as it was your final exam, tally with that year's cutoff, and see your chances of success. Practice more and then do so again, and try to increase your success rate. But try only recent papers which have the same format as of now, because the 2014 and before ones are obsolete now. Give mock tests and keep checking and evaluating yourself. In the end, keep a cool mind, and \t\t\t\t\t\tCrack NTSE! ALL THE BEST. ",

            "answer_text": "I cracked NTSE stage 1(2017).And I strongly believe that it's not at all difficult to crack ntse. All you need is dedication and consistent hardwork of about 5\u20136 months.That's it. Tips to crack NTSE: First of all, you have to be thorough with NCERT for both science and sst.You can also prefer state board books for social science.For mathematics,I used to solve RD Sharma.One should go for TATA MCGRAW HILL(according to me, the best series for ntse), Arihant for both mat and sat.Practise mat everyday. It gonna save your time in the paper.Learn to manage your time properly.I chose english for the language section and the questions asked were too easy that even a class 7th student can do those questions. So you need not to worry about the language section.Try to solve sample papers as much as possible.All the things that I have mentioned are more than enough for stage 1. ALL THE BEST.\ud83d\ude0a ",
