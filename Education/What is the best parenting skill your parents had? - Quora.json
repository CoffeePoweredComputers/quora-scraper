They stuck together on disciplining us kids. They were respectful of each other. We did everything. We were a family of 3 girls. We cooked and cleaned. We mowed the lawn, and built things with Dad. We went camping, built fires, fished and picked berries. There wasn\u2019t a male/female division of work. If it needed to be done, someone did it. ",

They also never raised me to believe that girls were less than boys and never suggested I would be incapable of something due to my gender. They pushed me very hard, scholastically, which resulted in my being able to overcome what turned out to be a rather severe learning disability (unbeknownst to any of us). ",
