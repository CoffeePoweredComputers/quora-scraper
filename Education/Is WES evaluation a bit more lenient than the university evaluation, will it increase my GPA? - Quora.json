            "answer_text": "I do not know whether to consider WES evaluation lenient or not but I can surely tell you it's mechanism as to how it evaluates. It also depends as to what kind of evaluation you have ordered for your transcript. If it's course by course, then it works in the following way - In the Indian system, we get evaluated on a scale of 10. Suppose you score 9 out of 10. In US system, these marks get converted on a scale of 4. So naturally, the margin is reduced. So your score is 9/10 * 4 = 3.6 on a scale of 4. So, likewise for all your subjects your scores are calculated on a scale of 4 and the average is taken out in the end. This definitely looks like you have scored fairly well on a scale of 4. Now, you may calculate your own score likewise and have an idea. ",
