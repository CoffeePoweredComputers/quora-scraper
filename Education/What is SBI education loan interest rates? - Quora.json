            "answer_text": "SBI runs three major education loan schemes, and the rate of interest varies according to the scheme. (i) SBI Global Ed-Vantage Scheme This scheme is designed specially for education outside of India, and caters to only secured education loans (i.e. loans against a collateral). The loan amount can be between Rs 20L to Rs 1.5Cr based on the expected expenditure and collateral value. The rate of interest starts from 10% (for girls) and 10.5% (for boys). A further reduction in the ROI is possible if you choose to go for Rinn Raksha Insurance, wherein case of death, the pending amount of loan is covered by the insurance. While the insurance premium starts from 0.7% of the loan amount, the ROI gets reduced to 9.5% (for girls) and 10% (for boys). (ii) SBI Scholars Loan Scheme Under this scheme, some premier institutions of India are categorized into four categories, each having its own specifications. Do note that this scheme is applicable only to the colleges mentioned in this list. List AA (up to Rs 30L without tangible collateral security) : includes IIM-A/B/C/I/K, XLRI-J, ISB-Hyderabad and ISB-Mohali List A (up to Rs 20L without tangible collateral security, up to Rs 30L with tangible collateral security) : includes the IIMs not covered under List AA, SJMSOM, IIFT, MDI, SPJIMR, SIBM etc. List B (up to Rs 20L without tangible collateral security) : includes FMS, JBIMS, NMIMS, MICA, XIM etc. List C (up to Rs 7.5L without tangible collateral security, up to Rs 30L with tangible collateral security) : includes NIFTEM, LIBA, CEPT, IIFM etc. Concession 1% concession for full tenure of the loan, if interest is serviced promptly as and when applied during the moratorium period, including course duration (iii) SBI Student Loan Scheme Under this scheme, up to Rs 10L is provided for education in India and up to Rs 20L for education outside of India. Also, if the loan amount exceeds Rs 7.5L, then the provision of collateral security becomes a necessity. For loans up to Rs 7.5L, the interest rate is 10% for boys and 9.5% for girls. For loans exceeding Rs 7.5L, the interest rate is 10.75% for boys and 10.25% for girls. If you plan on obtaining an education loan, I would recommend you to approach GyanDhan, which is an education loan startup by IIT alumni. They have collaborated with various banks (including SBI) in order to help students secure loans without unnecessary hassles. They work closely with senior managers of SBI to make sure that the loan process is quick and convenient to the student. You can check your loan eligibility here, and someone from GyanDhan team would contact you soon to evaluate your profile and discuss the loan option that would be the most suitable for you. You will also be happy to know GyanDhan doesn\u2019t charge the student any fee for its services. (The interest rates mentioned are as on the date of the answer, and vary periodically as per the MCLR regime set by the RBI. You can read this article for further info on interest rates\u2019 variation) Hope this helps. Best of luck! PS: For more such questions on State Bank of India refer to this video:  ",
