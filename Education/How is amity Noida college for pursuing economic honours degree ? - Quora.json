Pros Fantastic exposureGreat score of subject plan in three yearsWider than that of Delhi universityIt's always fun to be in amityCons Attendance issues ( won't be able to devote time for any preparations for competition exams or even your economic major)You may find yourself quite normal while sitting with those of other universities of your subject. Economics is about being extraordinary ( Amity may make you lack in this)Placement is never an issue here but don't this for placements you are joining this place!",

Im sorry cannot be more helpful, hope this helps you a little bit and sorry for the late response. ",
