            "answer_text": "Hello, Here are 10 best ways. 1) Study planner A goal oriented study plan is necessary to keep you focused and motivated through the long journey of completing the syllabus and excelling in the concepts. Devise a monthly plan and a weekly target for each subject. The planner should also include a daily target to help you achieve the weekly goal. Keeping a tab on the daily study schedule will be a pushing factor to do more. The study planner has to be followed diligently because it allows you to put sustained effort and not get exhausted right in the beginning. This strategy demands utmost sincerity and discipline on the part of candidate. Self motivation is the prerequisite to begin the preparation for the country\u2019s biggest medical entrance exam. Adequate time should be allotted to each section regardless of the fondness for a particular subject. Physics is most commonly considered as the most difficult subject of all and candidates tend to avoid it. However, it is necessary to understand that with due practice and clear understanding of basic concepts, a subject like Physics can be triumphed upon. 2) Clarity of Concept Most common mistake that an aspirant makes in the preparation strategy is to mug up all the concepts without having a clear understanding of the subject. Cramming up the concepts seems like an easy way through a vast syllabus such as one for NEET 2020, therefore instead going through the basics, aspirants resort to rot learning. This memorization technique might sound useful but it is not fruitful in the long run. It is essential to go through the basic concepts and have clarity of crucial topics in order to build a strong foundation on which the entire syllabus rests upon. If the basics are strong, the whole syllabus can be memorised easily. If the syllabus is completed through rot learning, there is a higher probability of forgetting it at the hour of examination. It is advisable to have a better understanding of the syllabus and basic concept in order to retain it for a longer time. 3) Clearing Doubts It goes without saying that there will be numerous doubts that will need clarification while studying for NEET. If a candidate has doubts in the syllabus then it is not a matter of worry but rather is an indication that the candidate is putting adequate effort in learning. At times doubts arising while learning might break the flow of the study. In such a case, it is advisable to seek help at the earliest to carry on with the studies. Keeping the teacher or the mentor in constant touch helps as they are instrumental in not just clearing doubts but also boosting the morale of the NEET aspirant. It is essential to discuss all the doubts and not leave it for guesswork as it can cost you marks. To crack NEET 2020 aspirants must have clarity of the concepts and resolving the doubts is imperative for that. 4) Practice makes you perfect Along with preparing for the syllabus, aspirants must try to incorporate practice session in the stud schedule. Solving previous years\u2019 question and mock test papers are the best way to test your preparation as well as add value to the prep. Solving the question papers expands the horizon of knowledge of the type of questions that can be asked. Candidates must spend at least one hour of time-bound practice to get accustomed to the sit and solve the question paper without a break. This strategy will allow the candidates to acclimatize themselves to the exam like condition and exam day pressure. Since NEET is a pen and paper based mode examination, the candidates will be required to fill OMR answer sheets. Candidates tend to lose marks even when they know the right answer because of filling the wrong bubbles in the OMR sheet. To crack NEET with maximum marks, one should build a strategy to fill the bubbles with precision and solve the questions faster. 5) Exhaustive Revision In all the tips to crack NEET 2020, revision stands out as the main one as it helps in retaining the topics that has been learnt. Examination tries to check your ability to retain the subject knowledge in the best possible manner. Only extensive revision can ensure maximum level of retention of the subject matter learnt. Candidates can try revising by writing down the summary of concepts in their own words so as to assess the degree to which they have grasped the topic. Subjects like Physics and Chemistry have formulae and equation that has to be memorised, for such things, one can make a formulae copy that has to be revised on daily basis so that is instilled in the memory. Not just memorization, aspirants need to learn the application of all the formulae. 6) Make you own notes Studies can be made easier with making your own personalised notes of each subject and topic. The notes should be strategically arranged so that you can visit those pages again for a quick revision. Making notes is also helpful in memorising of concepts in the best possible way. Writing along with reading adds to the understanding of a particular concept. Diagrams, flowcharts, figures and tables in the NCERT text books are directly taken up by the examiner which candidate can practice in writing. This way there are greater chances of understanding and retaining the components of a diagram or a flowchart. 7) Balancing self studies and coaching A lot of aspirants take the help of coaching centres to realise their dream of becoming a doctor. The study schedule as provided in coaching centres might seem like a formidable task but it is essential to understand that the self-study is also an important component to crack NEET 2020. Aspirants must strive to balance the coaching study schedule with self study. The coaching institute might overlook your minute mistakes which you are aware of, thus it is highly recommended to identify such mistakes and work on your weak subjects and aspects of preparation to achieve maximum number of marks. Overlooking silly mistakes may cost you a MBBS seat. 8) Study space Preparation for NEET requires you to refer to various books therefore having a comfortable space where you have enough space to spread your textbooks and notes out can be beneficial. Choose a comfortable area which is far from all the distractions. A well lit corner and a comfortable chair that helps the posture should be chosen because sitting in dim light in wrong posture for long hours can affect your health and eyesight. Create an environment that works the best for you that would motivate you to sit for long hours of preparation. 9) Exam day strategy To be able to bring your A-game to the exam centre aspirants must make sure that you get everything ready well in advance of the exam. According to the rules and requirements make a checklist for the documents and items that you need to carry along with you. Plan your route and journey time a day before so that there are no surprises on the day of examination. Being late on the exam day adds to the stress and hence its best avoided. NEET has a strict dress code and rigorous frisking takes place at the exam centre. Try and reach an hour before the time of examination so as to make it easy for the exam administration to conduct the exam smoothly without any hassle. Make plans for the question paper of how you will solve the question paper and how much time should be devoted to each section to keep the focus on. 10) Break time The overwhelming pressure of board exams and NEET can be daunting which could bring down an aspirant\u2019s spirit in such situation, it is necessary to realise that panicking and overworking will not be reap results in the long run. It is very crucial to take ample amount of rest and plan the study schedule such that there is break time at regular intervals. Break time is when one should pursue their hobbies and put a pause on the regular mugging up of concepts. Going out in the open is most advisable as it helps to rejuvenate the exhausted brain and bring fresh energy. To crack NEET, one needs to maintain their health as well. Sleeping on time, waking up early and eating a balanced diet is very instrumental in keeping you right on the path to success.

            "answer_text": "Hello Students, Festive season is going on and we already have the pandemic on our head. Many of the students have either dropped this year due to the pandemic and many were unable to attend the exam since they are stuck in containment zones or were unable to travel from native place to examination centers. It has been a devastating year for many where in some students have excelled the exam by scoring 720/720. I was a student with Altus Knowledge few years back and even I dropped one year to prepare with them. I started preparing from 11 th class with a different coaching center and my results were just below okay but not satisfactory to what I really wanted. I had my believes and got to study with a great venture and was able to crack the exam attaining more than what I was even expecting. Coming to how you should start preparing for the exam in October 2020 for NEET 2021 or any examination, lets divide the entire thing by SWOT analysis (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats) Strengths: Strengths in particular to examinations are your internal factors and capabilities which you can further enhance and utilize towards your examination goals. To simplify, let\u2019s say I have the following Strengths: \u00b7 Quick learner \u00b7 Topic oriented learning \u00b7 Theory to Practical/Numerical propagation \u00b7 Ability to study for long periods \u00b7 Focus It can vary from student to student or person to person. The whole idea of listing out such attributes is to self-realize what you can do and what potential lies in you. Many students learn differently, some learn each topic in sequence as per the syllabus, some learn as per what topics have been in the examination and have been asked most of the times. The difference in both the students is that one is spending almost same amount of time on each topic and the other one has prioritize his/her time as per the number of times each topic has been asked. Both has their pros and cons and going in detail will make this a debatable topic here. The whole idea of me discussing the entire thing is just to highlight how you and your strengths can give you that extra push by which you will be able to score more. Likewise, ability to Study for long periods will also vary, some students like to refresh themselves after every interval of time and some like to study and maintain the rhythm for at-least 4-5 hours in one go. The moment you utilize what your strengths are, you will be able to plan your day and weeks how you will have to study. Here the coaching institution\u2019s role also come into existence where-in they can help you make the most of it, dealing with more experienced faculties on day to day basis and making your time productive. Altus knowledge helped me to do so, the study material they provided and the facility of offline classes and lectures helped me to study as per my schedule not in the time what coaching institute operates. Weaknesses: This is the most critical factor in any planning and most likely people always fail in realizing what their weaknesses are and what affect them the most. Listing out the weaknesses can help you overcome some and avoid the remaining in order to excel in the examination. Listing out some of the common weaknesses here: \u00b7 Social/Personal life \u00b7 Addiction to Smart phones or Internet \u00b7 Health issues \u00b7 Lack of focus on studies \u00b7 No proper day planning The first two weaknesses lie in everyone and the motive is to realize and eliminate those factors which can ultimately affect your studies. Eliminating does not meaning completely removing or getting off from social media or cutting your personal/friend circle, is only to limit to an extent that it is not affecting the time you study. Like if I am studying for my examination, I clear my mind and do not think anything else rather than my dreams of attaining a good score. Health issues is also a critical factor which cannot be ignored at any cost. Stress and inner health should be taken care of as it can easily make or ruin your entire career. Mental peace and health is also needed because it doesn\u2019t matter if you study for 9 hours a day and you have lost your focus and your health is deteriorating, you will not be able to gasp any of it moreover your time will be lost. Many of the students do not realize it and are mostly affected by it. Studying in with Altus was a great experience for me, their guidance and structure is planned in a way and is flexible as per your day planning and preferences as well. This is the best thing about an offline/online coaching institute which is also the future now after the pandemic came into existence. But they have been doing it since many years. Going out for studies bring in 100\u2019s of factors which can easily divert your mind and the level of focus will never be there on each day. Opportunities: This is the most interesting part of any analysis. Opportunities are something which has to be grabbed as soon as possible because they have a time frame and limited availability, just like a shopping sale \u2013 limited stocks and limited time. Comparing it with the examination and how you should be planning your day and time \u2013 opportunities for a student would be: \u00b7 Time Utilization \u00b7 Taking Mock examinations \u00b7 Studying in a planned module \u00b7 Studying the right thing and in a right way at the right time Time is the most precious thing we have in any preparation, wasting 1 hour may not sound a big thing but wasting 1 hour each day in 365 days can make a huge difference. Similarly studying for 1 extra hour or that 10 extra numericals each day may not sound like a big thing in a small period but you will witness the change on the long go. Getting hold of your 24 hours of every day is the most crucial thing in life and the one who does can achieve anything. Mock examinations or test series or a complete set of examination is the best thing to grab later in your preparation. Such exams can make you realize where you have been lacking and where you are good. Such realizations will help you work on your weakness and strengthen your strengths. Altus knowledge offers a great collection of test series questionnaires and full length examination papers conducted throughout the year and are available at a reasonable price as well. Not sure about the current prices but at my time they were very decent. Planned module and studying the right thing in a right way at the right time may sound catchy but I will simplify it for you. Let\u2019s say you have a great understanding on Organic Chemistry and you enjoy studying it. Many of us what do is, we underestimate it and take questions based on Organic Chemistry lightly and ultimate what happens in the examination is that we know what the topic is and even from which book it has been asked, but since we did not practice and revise it, you are unable to re-collect and solve the question during the exam. Neglecting any topic whether you are weak at it or strong, can lower your score by at least 10 marks and this make a hell lot of change during selections of colleges. Altus offers a rank booster program which has such sets of questions which are most likely to be asked in the examination, they do it by probability of each question to be repeated and they are able to crack it by at least 70% which is a great thing to do. Studying those questions, a month before examination can make huge changes and raise your entire score by at least 30-50 marks. Which actually did happen for me two years back. Threats: Many of us will get confuse between threats and weaknesses as they may sound similar but they are different. Weaknesses are your personal traits and threats are most likely those external factors which can affect your preparation planning. Some of them are: \u00b7 Extra-ordinary questions or question asked in an examination which you may not find in any text book \u00b7 A complex numerical which can take long time to solve \u00b7 A very basic questions which we mostly ignore to give attention There could be different other factors as well such as any mishap or loss which can affect the student mentally. Complex calculations and the time you spend on each questions to solve is the key to attain more marks and attempt more number of questions. Altus helped me a lot with this and I will be always thankful to their faculty for making such tricks and tips in which you can solve a 5-minute question in less than a minute. Obviously it is not a hack or cheat, it is done by practicing more and more, and by using a different approach and method to a question which is an un-conventional way which you will not find anywhere. They have also showed some examples on their YouTube channel. Moreover, we all are humans and are tend to make mistakes, what is best we can do is make the most of it and try to avoid such factors. I hope this analysis will help you and can also be used to make and analyze any plan in the future. Good Luck for NEET 2021. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are a medical aspirant then NEET is undoubtedly the most important exam for you. Beginning the preparation for NEET 2021 right now gives you sufficient time to be ready for the exam. With this amount of time left, you can start from the very basics and cover each and every topic in detail. All you need to do is follow the right strategy for preparation. Complete Preparation Guide for NEET 2021 If you are anxious to prepare for NEET 2021 and want to clear it with a good score, you can follow the strategy given below. 1. Know your syllabus and exam pattern First of all, you must know all about the NEET 2021 exam pattern and its syllabus. An insight of the syllabus and pattern can help you plan your preparation in a better manner. Exam pattern \u00b7 Duration of exam: 3 hours \u00b7 Number of questions: 180 \u00b7 Type of questions: Objective type \u00b7 Total marks: 720 \u00b7 Marking scheme: 4 marks will be given for each correct answer \u00b7 Negative marking: 1 mark will be deducted for each incorrect answer Syllabus The syllabus for NEET will comprise of the topics from the subject of Physics, Chemistry and Biology of standard 11th and 12th. Some of the important topics from these subjects that must not be ignored under any condition are mentioned below: \u00b7 Physics: Optics, Thermodynamics, Electronic Devices, Current Electricity, Electromagnetic Induction, Dual Nature of Matter and Radiation, Magnetic Effect of Current & Magnetism, Motion of System of Particles and Rigid Body etc \u00b7 Chemistry: Coordination Compounds, Thermodynamics, Equilibrium, Solutions, Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers, Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids, etc \u00b7 Biology: Human Physiology, Genetics and Evolution, Diversity of Living Organisms, Cell: Structure and Function, Biology and Human Welfare, Reproduction, Plant Physiology, etc 2. Study material After you are well familiarized with the exam syllabus and pattern, you need to collect study material. Collecting study material not means gathering more and more books, but choosing a few selective books that are completely reliable. NCERT books of class 11th and 12th are the most important source of study and must be included in your study material without fail. Some of the best books that you can refer for NEET preparation are listed below: \u00b7 Physics: Objective Physics by DC Pandey and Physics by HC Verma \u00b7 Chemistry: Organic Chemistry by Morrison, Inorganic Chemistry by JD Lee and Physical Chemistry by KL Chugh \u00b7 Biology: Dinesh Objective Biology and Trueman Elementary Biology 3. Make a timetable A timetable is considered quite important to manage your time and maintain a consistency in your studies. Before you start preparing for the exam, it is better if you make a timetable. It is not a compulsory thing to do but is certainly a good thing. It will also help you in checking if you are distracting from your studies. If you are not able to follow the timetable that clearly means that you are wasting your time somewhere else. In this way, you can keep a check on yourself, that\u2019 it. 4. Start your preparation Know that you have collected the study material, the only thing left to do is start studying. You must begin your preparation by covering the basic and then forwarding towards the complex topics. If your basics are clear, you can tackle any kind of problems you face in the exam. Direct jumping to the complex topics can confuse you as all the complex topics are only the advanced form of the basics that you study. And since you are not in a hurry to appear for the exam, it is better if you climb the ladder step by step, without skipping. 5. Preparing notes Make sure that you prepare notes of every topic that you study. Highlight the important topics in your notes. Preparing notes can help you in getting a better grasp on what you study. It\u2019s also better to create notes as you can go through the important points as many times you want without turning the whole book. Notes come in real handy at the time of revision. 6. Start practicing After you clear all your basics and start with the advanced topics, you can also start practicing side by side. If you have a timetable, you might need to revise that including a certain amount of time for practice. For practice, you can solve the previous years\u2019 sample papers available online or otherwise. Practice can help you in finding your strong and weak points, the field that needs more focus and those which you have mastered completely. 7. Revise regularly Study, practice and revise- You can consider these three as an effective preparation mantra. Revision is as equally important as studying and practicing. The syllabus is vast and when you start proceeding towards your study, there are fair chances that you might start forgetting the topics you have studied in the past. By proper revision, you can save yourself from completely forgetting those topics. Therefore, revision on a regular basis is strongly recommended to keep everything fresh and new in your mind. 8. Others important points \u00b7 Keep distractions away from you as far as possible. TV, phone and social media are the biggest enemy of a person who is preparing for an exam as competitive as NEET. \u00b7 Self-study and group study both are equally important. While from self-study you can completely be honest with yourself, what you know and what you don\u2019t know, group study is very helpful in clearing any doubts you have in your mind. Try to do both if possible. \u00b7 Taking care of your health is very important. Without a healthy body, you cannot have a healthy mind. So do not skip your meals for the sake of study and do not deprive yourself of proper sleep. ",

            "answer_text": "The strategy need not to be very tough. You just have to compete your daily studies regularly. Means if you have joined any coaching you must finish your reading, understanding ,notes taking and question solving of what is taught in coaching before your next day class. That's the only key to suceess. Pre reading of topics taught is also very necessary to understand the teaching more precisely. Neet exam requires a consistent efforts. Dont get distracted with social media.Keep definite time for it. Offer it as a reward after completing your studies to yourself. This will boost your interest in studies. Make a schedule for your studies for each day.... From waking up to sleeping... Wake up at 6am ,fininish your daily rituals and get to your studies by 6.30am.. Make small shifts. Many of you feel sleepy in morning, but this is the Time when our brain is empty(no useless thoughts) so we can memorize easily. Give preference to physics in morning which is a tough subject and requires more concentration. (6.30\u20138.00am) both theory and problem solving. Take a healthy and light breakfast (8.00\u20138.20am) Then move to bio learning and understanding theory (8.20\u201310.00).During bio reading try highlighting Imp points, or note down Imp points this will help in your revisions. Then chemistry(10\u201311.45 am) revise class notes or solve question. Learn inorganic portion. Then get ready for coaching and have a Lunch. Don't waste your time in coaching in gossiping with your friends during small breaks between two lectures. Try to revise your old topic using your notes. Get involved in the class by asking your doubts to your teacher, doubt clearing is very important to solve different mcqs. Try to secure good rank in class test. This will boost your confidence. After coaching, you can take small break or a nap to energize yourself.Then again go back to your studies. Complete your class work in shifts as I said earlier. Take dinner around 8.30pm Go to bed by 11.45pm,as you require complete sleep of 6hours. So that's it...... All the best !! Edit 1: u can follow me here for Neet study material Neet ug Notes ",

NEET 2021 will certainly will more tough in the coming future, many students might have to not applied this year considering the current situation where it can be a task for them to prepare sitting at home. However, there is a lot you can do now and begin with your preparation for next year. Things to plan inhand before starting: 1. Aim high and succeed : In order to get 600+ in NEET exam, aim for atleast 650-700 and prepare accordingly. In order to compete with 5% of population of India who applies for NEET every year, you need to be a step ahead of them. 2. Stay Updated: Get in touch with faculties who follow the examination trend and are deeply examining the changes. They are certainly the best guiders for who you can help you to aim at the bull\u2019s eye. 3. Working Hard pays off: This is very obvious that you will be required to study at least 10-12 hours a day. This doesn\u2019t mean that you have to stick yourself to your study table or room. Plan your day and maintain a good regime as well. A good healthy mind is a key to success. 4. Offline or Online Coaching: You cannot succeed on your own, some do but not everyone. This comes at a price but if you are aware, you will be investing in a positive way. Look for the best of best, take reviews from past student\u2019s who have already cleared with these coaching like Aakash, Allen, Resonance or Altus Knowledge if you have heard about them. Many coaching institutes are there but everyone has their own perks and dis-advantages. 5. Test Series: Self assessment is critical to realize where you stand and how you have to improve or maintain. Take assessments on a regular basis even if you have excelled in a particular subject doesn\u2019t mean that you can neglect it. Try to score evenly in each assessment you take and accordingly you will realize if scoring 600 and above is possible for you with your current preparation methods. 6. Rank Boosters: Not sure if everyone is aware of these, Altus knowledge is offering such a thing as per my knowledge. They release it late in January usually and have a set of critical questions which you might expect in the coming exam. They do this by probability- questions which are most likely to appear in the exam in the respective year. Only an expert faculty can predict this and you can look for reviews for them. 7. Internet: Online study can be time taking but if you are not wasting your time on useless links and only reading which is required, it can benefit you. Never restrict yourself to books, they are the best source but study pattern needs to change with time and helps in eliminating boredom as well. Being a faculty, I am open to discuss such things, would love to hear and talk more- feel free to comment or reach me if required. ",

            "answer_text": "Welcome 11thies to this preparatory phase which will act as an entry point to one of the most elite and noble profession on this planet. The reason why I am writing this answer for 11th standard only is because in my preparatory phase I realised that these students are the one\u2019s with a potential to be at top most position in NEET exam or any other entrance exam due to their energetic attitude, absence of fear of failure and most important fresh minds in which our traditional education system is filling up data like a complete mess without any logics or interconnections. So young minds let\u2019s begin\u2026!! 1st is Serious Mindset I know everyone says that 11th is a rest year in which you can make time for hobbies or roaming with friends showing effects of hormones in short instant gratification things which make you think that wow my life is so cool. I didn\u2019t say that you should not enjoy your life but not at the cost of your future and if you really want to know then let me clearly tell you yearly fees of AIIMS Delhi is 2500 rupees whereas of DY Patil is 25 lacs so you could imagine of a difference and competition is getting fierce year by year every year almost there is increase of 2 lacs of student appearing for exams this year 13 lac student gave the exam for 70k seat out of which only top 10k are of relatively good college and congrats we are in India so reservation also has its crucial role in it so young man this is not as easy as it appears to be even there is competition for that 25 lacs per annum college if you don't have score even they would not take you and Kota factory is the name I think every one might have heard where more than 1 lac students are preparing for the same exam with all their life. Relax..!! I am not scaring you I am just telling you gravity of things that it really matters a lot because I know in 11th students don\u2019t realise things even I also didn\u2019t but later when I have to pay for it then time had already escaped. No one expects you to become nerd and only study for this exam and leave everything else obviously other things are also equally important because somewhere it is also shaping your personality The only thing expected from you is just give some time on regular basis (concept of ALD-IASD a long discipline in a single direction) with a new and correct way of studying which I am going to mention later in this answer 2nd is Strategy Which consist of planning and working on it. Without action no plan works and the biggest problem which we all face is we plan a lot but when it comes to action for initial few days we do work but then we start procrastinating (power of entropy) so what I mean to say is that plan your tasks which are practical not hypothetical that I will complete these chapters in these days and then ending up at same level so always plan task weekly and then do a little daily some day you can study more and some day less so ultimately it can get managed. 3rd is Sources See concepts are same only thing on which things depend is how it is presented to you some teachers make easy things complex while some do opposite so try to decode concepts on your own and then take help from teachers or online sources. For physics conceptually HC Verma is the only book one can get. People misunderstood this book due to its high level questions but its theory is really good and concepts become crystal clear. For chemistry NCERT is conceptually good but Allen modules or any other comprehensive source would be good. For biology everyone regard NCERT as bible even I do but it also requires extension which is best provided in McGraw Hill book of biology or if you follow any module just see it\u2019s authenticity. See I know you guys are in school and reading standard books at school level is something that would not be possible for you.best option would be of good teachers who are knowledge oriented not marks follow them. 4th is Methodologies For which I guess a separate answer is needed if enough request comes I will try to elaborate it. Still few basic principles i would like to mention- 1st Go for 5K for any topic you are going to study that is kya, kyu, kaha, kab, kaise the most important one is kyu because it will tell you about significance of what you are studying in real world. 2nd be honest with your studies see i will not hesitate to say that we Indians are corrupt at all individual levels and so are at studying level too we just mug up things and follow the traditional marks culture only few want to question \u201cwhy\u201d only few have enough curiosity to figure out things simply well that is separate part i will discuss afterwards. Don\u2019t move forward in your study till the concept enters your brain. 5th is Prioritisation I know due to perceived benefits you might be stuck in belief that fun is top most priority roaming with friends, parties, girls everything seems to be damn attractive i am not saying that you don\u2019t enjoy school life but in a balanced way where you are self aware that your career and life is the most important thing. you can also plan your stuff according to Eisenhower box  6th is Self assessment If you don\u2019t test yourself you won\u2019t be able to realise whether you are growing or not so plan you tests on regular intervals may be after fixed time of 2-3 weeks or after completion of any portion of your syllabus. Take help from your parents if alone you are not able to follow it. Also remember that while being in school you are going through subjective pattern of your academics whereas NEET is purely objective, conceptually you are not going to face any problem but speed with accuracy is the demand of objective pattern so seperate work need to be done for that purpose also. And the last one is LEARNING ATTITUDE which is not only for preparatory phase but also for life. I know maximum people will follow it for few days or weeks but those who enjoy learning and knows the vastness of science would never feel he is doing something under burden so try to enjoy science because everything has a logic and almost everything is interconnected all you need is to work on it. The answer is not completed it\u2019s a journey if some serious students come along I would love to be a part of this beautiful journey and hope so this little soul could be a part of a good cause.

            "answer_text": "How to prepare for NEET 2020 and 2021? Tip 1: The major mistake that most students make is they think they will study everything in tuition or coaching. Instead, their first priority should be paying attention in class, you need to understand everything, and then leave extra learning to self-studies /tuition/coaching. Syllabus of class 11 and 12 is a huge jump for many students from class 10. So every bit of knowledge you gain from various places is valuable. Tip 2: The most important thing to cover in the NEET syllabus is NCERT books of class 11 and 12 physics, chemistry, biology. These are the most ideal textbooks in most boards. However, if NCERT is not in your board, then you can refer to board prescribed books for board exams and but NCERT is must for NEET preparation. Tip 3: You have to create a preparation strategy and should follow it sincerely. If you will follow the strategies sincerely, nobody can stop you from achieving success. These strategies are: Strategies To Prepare for NEET Create a timetable that should be followed daily: Your time table that you follow every day is dependent on your activities of the day and your sleeping habits.If you have the ability to wake up early, then you can wake up around 4:30 in the morning and can study for at least one hour before going to school.Then you might be coming back from school around 2 PM.After that, you would eat and take rest until around 4 PM.After that anyhow you have to take out time to study for two hours.Since physical activity is also very essential, you can go out and carry out some physical activities that would help you in maintaining your health.After you come back, start studying again for another three hours at least.If you have the habit of waking up late and sleeping late, then you can shift your morning\u2019s one hour study time to night.With this time table, you can easily study for at least 6 hours every day yourself.Later on, when your school ends, it is very obvious that you can put in more hours of self-studies. If you choose to go to coaching/tuition then it will become more hectic to take out time for self studies. Choose the option of such a coaching which is not too far from your home so that travel time is eliminated. Figure out your monthly goals: To start with, you should study all the things that have been taught in school. Whenever you complete a topic, practice its important questions and MCQs. There are around 59 topics in NEET syllabus. So, the best method to cover all the topics is by dividing the number of chapters by the number of days you have left with for the preparation. It should not matter to you if it comes out to be 2 chapters in a day, then please make sure that you actually cover 2 chapters a day. This way you can set your monthly goals. Self-assessment is essential: \u201cTaking a shot in light is better than a shot in the dark\u201d. By self assessment you will get to know about your strengths and weaknesses. The best way to know about your strengths and weaknesses are by solving MCQs and taking mock tests. After completing every chapter, solve its important questions and MCQs. After completing syllabus take several mock tests and solve past year papers. These are the most important key to strengthen yourself. Try to convert your weaknesses into strengths: Once you know all about your weaknesses, immediately seek the help of a teacher or a mentor or any who is expert in that particular topic. Usually the problem lies in grabbing the concepts. Once that is clear, you can solve the questions in a better way. Continuous practice is the major key NEET 2020-21 Exam Pattern Candidates must check below NEET 2020-21 Exam Pattern before starting the exam preparation: Exam Mode: NEET 2020-21 exam will be conducted through offline (pen-paper based) mode.Questions Type: Question paper will contain objective type of questions.Medium: The question paper will be available in English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Telugu, Tamil, Urdu and Kannada Languages.No of questions: There will be total 180 questions in the paper.Total Marks: The paper will be total of 720 marks.Duration: The exam will be conducted for 3 hours.Marking Scheme: Each correct answer will award 4 marks.Negative Marking: 1 mark will be deducted for every wrong answer.Marks distribution: Subjects No. of Questions Marks Physics 45 180 Chemistry 45 180 Biology (Botany or Zoology) 90 (45 each) 360 Total 180 720 Syllabus for NEET 2020-21: The syllabus os an important aspect as it tells about what are the topics that the candidates have to follow to prepare for the exam.

            "answer_text": "If you are preparing for NEET 2021, you have plenty of time for preparation so, start your preparation now. First of all you should start from the physics basics , like introduction portion and basic mathematics. After completing the calculus and vectors you should start kinematics and then you move slowly in physics. For neet preparation according to my experience H.C. Verma is an excellent book for physics and it helps to make the theoritical base . While you are reading or studying make some notes simultaneously and clear all your concepts by practicing and learning .For practicing you can do from D.C. Pandey but, don\u2019t forget the NCERT. You can also solve solve OBJECTIVE NCERT PHYSICS GEAR UP this is your physics strategy. Finally, you can also practice from 32 years of NEET PHYSICS. Follow it thoroughly. For chemistry you should start from NCERT from some basic concepts of chemistry. And then move to another chapter structure of atom .It\u2019s Important to makes notes side by side. There are lots of formulae in chemistry write and learn them thoroughly. Concepts of every chapter should be properly understood. For organic chemistry, practice from SELECTED PROBLEMS FROM ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, For Inorganic Chemistry, NCERT is enough, N. AVASTHI for physical chemistry. Then, solve the previous years questions papers and do monthly and weekly revision. For Biology, only NCERT is enough, read NCERT numbers of times and make your base stronger because many questions comes from ncert. So that, you read the ncert line by line. Many questions are interlinked to the other concepts of the ncert therefore you read ncert 25\u201330 times. Don\u2019t forget to make notes. Watch online videos and lectures, it become more helpful for NEET 2020 examination, Read Theory of NCERT, Do Previous Year Question papers and practice a lot. ALL THE BEST :) ",

            "answer_text": "National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) is a national medical entrance exam conducted every year for the admission to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, BVSc, and AH degree programmes. NEET is an exam with not only a difficult academic curriculum but also involves rigorous verification of students\u2019 diligence, hard work and passion towards medicine. Candidates who wish to pursue a medical career in the country are required to sit for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA). With a limited number of seats and fierce competition, it becomes essential for candidates to come up with the best preparation strategy for NEET 2021. To help students prepare for NEET 2021, here is a short guide that tells you how to prepare for NEET 2021. This article will help students to understand the exam and have a crisp strategy to ace NEET 2021. The preparation tips for NEET 2021 discussed here are clear, concise, tried, and tested. To begin your preparation of NEET 2021, divide your NEET 2021 preparation strategy as per the below given four mantras: UnderstandStudyPractiseRevise NEET 2021 preparation tip 1: Understanding the syllabus, and exam pattern Before beginning the NEET 2021 preparation, it is important to have a comprehensive knowledge of the syllabus, exam pattern, and weightage. Some pointers here are: Syllabus of NEET includes 180 questions in total which are segregated into three parts as Biology, Chemistry, and PhysicsBiology section consists of 90 questions in total, whereas Chemistry and Physics consist of 45 questions each respectively. The maximum marks awarded are 720 which are further divided into three parts as 360 in Biology, 180 in Chemistry, and 180 in Physics.4 marks are awarded for every correct answer and 1 mark is deducted for wrong answers.Set a target score of at least 650. After getting through with the exam pattern, start understanding the syllabus.Check the topics in all three subjects and mark your strongest area with a green pencil and weak area with a red pencil. This will help you segregate the syllabus into two parts and you will be able to know how far you are from your target score.Also, make a list of topics proceeding from highest weightage to the lowest weightage followed by biology, then chemistry and physics. By this, you will be able to cover more syllabus in less time.You are done with the first level. Knowledge of the syllabus, exam pattern and weightage will help you formulate a strategy for NEET 2021 preparation tips.NEET 2021 preparation tip 2: Start studying Making a plan is easy but its execution is what requires strength. Know your most effective hours and start your NEET 2021 preparation in those hours. In order to prepare for NEET 2021, it is important to study for at least 12 hours per day. Having a 650+ in your NEET 2021 requires you to devote 50 per cent of your time in a day to study. Begin with Biology and one other subject simultaneously. Start studying your strongest topics with the most weightage. This way you will cover more topics in less time.Read NCERT line by line. Mark important facts with a highlighter and make notes simultaneously. After completing NCERT, start reading extra study material available in the form of books, and preparation websites. Also, make notes from these references.For Biology, learn diagrams by heart to understand a topic. Pictures help you retain the information more effectively. Diagrams are an important factor for NEET 2021 preparation.For physics, solve as many questions as you can. Additionally, create a chapter-wise formula sheet that comprises all formulas and laws discussed in the chapter.For chemistry, learn diagrams and chemical equations by heart. After completing every chapter, create a sheet for chemical equations and formulas to be used in solving the questions.NEET 2021 preparation tip 3: Practise questions No emphasis is enough to showcase how important practising questions is for your NEET 2021 preparation. Some guidelines for this are Practise as many questions as possible for all three subjects. This will help you understand the type of questions asked from each topic and you will know how far you stand from your target score.Practising vaguely won\u2019t be much effective. Make timed sessions and try to solve a certain amount of questions in a fixed time. This will help you overcome the time constraint.Also, make a test log and note down all the questions that were attempted wrong. This way, you will know your weak points and working on them will be easy.Take as many tests as possible. It is not necessary for the test to be full-length. You can take chapter-wise tests within a limited amount of time.Try to solve previous years question papers within a certain period of time. Solving previous years papers is a good way of practising chapters/topics.NEET 2021 preparation tip 4: Revision is important All the study and hard work would be of no use if there is no revision. Revising chapters you have already covered will not only help you retain the information but also find new points that remained unnoticed previously. Also, during a few days before the exam, it would not be possible for you to study all the chapters from scratch. Hence, the practise of revision will help you cover all the topics in time. Start revising way before NEET 2021. Include revision slots in your time table beforehand. Make revision your habit from the beginning of the NEET 2021 preparation. Some important preparation tips for NEET 2021 Divide you study time into small portions of 1 to 2 hours each. Take small breaks. This will help you in concentrating effectively.While making notes, don\u2019t make long sentences. Keep them short. This way, you would be able to memorise them fast. Use abbreviations while making notes.NEET examines your basics. Keep your basics strong. Solving complex problems requires you to have strong fundamentals. Do not skip a topic because it seems hard. Read it as many times as required.Cover every part of NCERT thoroughly. Most of the questions asked in the exam can be found in NCERT.Don\u2019t neglect eleventh class topics. Keep revising them with the same intensity as twelfth class topics.Coaching classes and school classes will help in studying the topics. But self-study holds the ultimate power. Always remember, nothing can replace self-study. Having a complete grasp of topics is only possible through self-study.Invest your break time into something productive such as music, art, or any sports activities. This will increase your productivity and concentration.Take tests regularly. Your test scores will work as a constant reminder for your target score.Maintain test logs. These logs not only help you supervise your scores but also point out the areas you need to work on.Revise the questions from your test logs every time before appearing for the next practice test.Take proper sleep of 7-8 hours. Compromising with sleep will result in lack of concentration and will affect your retaining power.Stay healthy. Health is important in times of preparation. Stay hydrated and take nutritious food. Don\u2019t take the stress.All the best! ",

Avoid using multiple reference books and material in your preparation.While studying, try to grasp the main concept very clearly. Objective questions (MCQs) test your concept thoroughly. You need consistent practice to improve speed and accuracy.Make notes of important terms, formulas, reactions, mistakes while solving problems, etc. Include your own shortcuts and tricks.Keep revising what you learn during the preparation.See the trend of NEET past year papers. While solving questions, apply the tricks (mostly taught by your coaching teachers).Prepare an exam strategy and stick to it during mock tests and NEET exam.Always analyse your test and find out mistakes that are happening, correct those mistakes and don\u2019t repeat them in the upcoming tests.On the exam day, pick up the questions based on your strengths. Do not let any question eat up your time. Skip the question as soon as you are nowhere close to the answer. Come back to these questions after you finished the whole paper once.Stay positive. There will be times when you would find it difficult to understand and manage things. Do not give up.Hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I'm glad you're beginning early. Actually, it's better to begin early as it leaves you with ample amount of time to practice in the later stages. Also, I would suggest you to go for smart learning as beginning early has it one big drawback that is loss of motivation midway. You need interactive learning sessions thus. Not going for any coaching class is absolutely fine as these days they just manage to eat up your time, money and energy. Although preparation for NEET is no easy task. And it's always easier said than done. So I hope you pay attention to the extreme details. Just remember and make sure you follow a specific pattern for studying throughout. To avoid the loss of motivation midway, continue studying in interactive ways for small small stretches. I would highly recommend the video lectures by M-learning India. If you inspect the current situation closely, I firmly opine that those are one of the finest videos for NEET. You can just watch those videos for about 5/6 hours daily according to your convenience. They are designed specifically by keeping NEET in mind and are conducted by extremely dedicated and experienced professionals. With an experience of more than 20 years, the video lectures will definitely benefit you to the most. You can easily access them through your internet. You can also download the app for the access to the offline content. It is available on the Google play store under the name M-learning India video streaming app. There are many test series out there to provide the students with a good hand at practice. It makes sure to cover up all the necessary topics that need to be covered in order to ace up the examination. Also, the doubts you posses are soon rectified under the doubt solving sessions. This definitely gives you an upper edge over your counterparts. I honestly suggest you to download their app now, they won't disappoint you. Thank you! ",

Firstly analyse Previous Year Question papers and get to know in what chapters you need detailed study and which chapters you can study just formulae specially for Physics. Biology : Full NCERT line by line make notes in short learn all Examples. Chemistry: Physical - Equilibrium and Electro from NCERT only. Rest tricks and techniques from any Good teacher notes. If you are at kanpur get KK Sir Notes ( i will try to make it available soon) Organic- Only NCERT Inorganic - NCERT is sufficient. Physics: Akash Module (Repeaters) is sufficient. You can go for other Notes by any Good teacher who teaches in short and is conceptual. Remember a thing you need not to do PhD on any topic but you are expected to have learning and understanding of basic concepts that are prescribed in Syllabus (Download it from NTA website and keep it with you and keep watching what you are learning). If you want to follow something online follow Khan Academy English lectures only, on Youtube and app. Keep your resources confined. One book has enough power to get you selected in any Exam but u have to complete it thoroughly and revise as many times as possible to polish yourself. Dont change books in this coarse of preparation. Dont follow too many books. Read only that stuff that you are sure you would be able to cover during revision. ",

Build you basis integration, differentiation, algorithms and graphs concept as almost all students who are in medical stream with maths as not an additional subject founds Physics as the most challenging subject and it is only due to lack of basic maths concept. Secondly I want to suggest that start to focus on NCERT especially Biology, focus on each detail and memorise all the diagrams in NCERT and practice a lot. Try practice paper or take any institute test series to check your preparation. For chemistry (Organic and Inorganic) focus only on NCERT. Revise and practice all the named reactions in NCERT. For physical you can try problems from another books, I will suggest Balaji publications books. For physics your concepts matter a lot if your concepts are crystal clear then you can easily solve the problems of NEET paper as they don't ask you a typical problems they just want to check your basic understanding. For practice you can refer to some good publications book like HC Verma and DC Pandey. At last be patient and continuously practice and revise things. Best of luck for your exam !

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A If you really want to be a doctor then you will need to work hard. It is not a easy exam lakhs of people give the exam every year and very few of them get selected. You should assume that you don't have any reservation quota and have to do everything on your own. And put as much efforts in achieving your goal as you can . Then as you are in 11 start preparing as soon as possible. Make very small notes as you study the chapter and keep them with you . Practice makes a man perfect so practice as many MCQ as you can . Revise the topics time to time . Ask doubts from your teachers, make your concepts crystal clear and learn from your teachers the application of concept in physics and chemistry . Practice more and more problems . Learn the facts of inorganic chemistry the exception etc organic reactions and formula . As you have your board exams in 12 then prepare well beforehand as soon as you finish your 11 class revise every topic before the onset of 12 class and in 12 revise and practice the mcq and concepts side by side. After your boards start revising 11 again and then followed by 12 class syllabus . Then the previous year question papers are only left which you should practice in the limited time of 3 hours. Some books which i recommend for the preparation are Physics - Dc pandey , Hc verma , Ncert and Ncert exemplarChemistry- Ncert & Ncert Exemplar , mtg ncert at your fingertipsBiology - Ncert and Ncert exemplar, Mtg Ncert at your fingertipsMake sure you spend some time with friends and family daily for refreshing your mind. You can listen to some music or play outdoor sports but please avoid usage of social media and games like PUBG . Decide if you want a chicken dinner or a government seat . :P ",

            "answer_text": "There is a lot of time for NEET 2021. Utilise it effectively and study hard. You have the liberty of moving slow with the syllabus. Follow either school syllabus or coaching. Do not be confused between both od them. Prioritise and study effectively.Class 11th physics and entire organic chemistry forms the basics for 12th. Under no circumstances should these topics be left weak. Study them alongside class and practice a lot of questions. Chapters like mechanics and oscillations will be used in integrated HOTS as well.In biology special emphasis is to be given to plant and human physiology. These are high weightage chapters and require concept building. Learn the cycles and revise them periodically.While solving questions, mark questions which you got wrong with one colour and, questions which made you think and analyse multiple concepts at once with another. Before NEET, revise these questions alone. This will save time and get all the important questions done.Needless to say NCERT is to be read as many times as you can! You should be able to quote lines in your sleep. :PThere is no need to rush to class 12th syllabus. Finish 11th first as syllabus is more. Do not rush\u2026 take your time and build concepts.Good luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hello You should start preparing from basics. Clearing of basic concepts is very important to ace this national level exam and come out with flying colors. As the competition level is increasing every year, you should start your preparation with a strategic approach. Firstly, check the detailed syllabus and pattern of the exam. Start preparing from NCERT textbooks. NCERTs are the best books for building the fundamentals. You can also refer to other important books for in depth knowledge of the subject. Make a time table and plan your studies so that you can complete your syllabus well before in time and you have last months for revision, solving previous year papers and attempting mock tests. Mock tests and previous year papers help you to know about your preparation level and improve accordingly after knowing your weaknesses and strengths. Make short notes and you can make a small notebook for formulas. Preparing using online study material is always useful and an additional support to enhance your speed and accuracy. I would suggest you to refer to NEET Knockout by Careers360. It is a highly effective preparation package which helps student to prepare well and master all the important concepts. The package helps students by providing the following features: Adaptive time tableVideo E-LecturesSmart Study MaterialUnlimited Mock Test SeriesPerformance AnalysisPerformance AnalysisPrepmeterFaculty SupportChat and QnAYou will get to know the most asked concepts, most difficult concepts, topics carrying the maximum weightage.

Chemistry - Physical - keep your fundamentals clear. Solve every type of numerical again and again. Inorganic - Again go through ncert multiple times. If youre joining a coaching then keep revising your notes. These chapters are really easy to learn dont even try to mug up because you cant, there is just too much content first understand periodic table then go for every elements properties then their compounds. And you have to have your Bonding chaps really clear. Organic - reaction's mechanisms must be really clear to you. Dont leave any name reaction. Make a separate copy for just name reactions and important reactions to remember. NCERT is the key again. Physics - firstly dont think of it as a nightmare, again just go for the basics first and then apply formulas. This really needs a LOT of practice. Keep revising. Make a separate copy for formulas it helps a lot. For 2021 NEET you have lot of time. Make sure you get your basics really clear and keep revising bio chem and phy formulas and dont leave anything in NCERT untouched. NCERT's bio should be on your tips. Keep practicing phy numericals and physical chemistry. And last give mocks every week. Take Allen's test series they help a lot. Thanks :) ",

But your main concentration or focus should be in ncert.For questions you can use any objective book but Dinesh would be better for you and also do chapter wise solution book. Chemistry , for inorganic portion only do NCERT and make your own short notes for rapid revision.For physical read ncert that clears your concepts and use objective books for question practicing.you can use universal that is a good book covers all the previous entrance exam questions.After completing that you can use other book. Now comes organic portion for that your organic understanding must be good. For that read ncert and do practice of organic from universal and you can also use other books for it. Now physics practice as much as you can do.you can use universal for practice and also arihant for standard questions. Also do NCERT exempler questions. But your physics concept must clear for good hold in it. And make your physics good because it is weak potion of almost every student. Be confident and fully dedicate your self to towards your dream.

He should have his aim in mind always.As parents, keep him motivate and assure him that he can do it because the trust you offer him as parents will boost his confidence level.Be consistent in the scores of his mock tests.Taking care of health is very important too. I would suggest mediation with a soothing track and a little exercise to be fit.DO NOT PROCRASTINATE!!!Most of the students answering NEET are extremely good in biology, but when it comes to physics and chemistry, many are weak. So being strong in physics and chemistry helps to improve the rank and score.Regularly practicing and revising the difficult concepts.SPEED is very important too as in NEET students should attempt more questions in 3 hours.Solve the past year NEET papers by timing yourself.Your son has 2 years to go. Ask him to stay focused on his aim.",

            "answer_text": "Initially when you start your preparation you must start reading NCERT textbook for Physics,chemistry and biology. You must understand everything you are studying and must remember important definition and important examples and should revisit them regularly so that you must not forget and you must work out the examples at the back of NCERT on your own and if you have any doubt you must be able to clear your doubts with good teachers that can clear your doubt and improve your understanding of the subject. All this will help you to get a decent but not a very good score in NEET. If you are aiming for a good score in NEET and get admissioned in your dream college you must work harder than this and follow some more steps. The best medium of preparation in that case according to me would be video lectures . In recent days a lot of video lectures are available, so which one should you choose? I believe that Kaysons provide the best video lectures for NEET preparation. Kaysons provide students with both online and offline video lectures on different chapters and topics that are required for NEET preparation. They have an excellent set of faculty that lay out videos beautifully. The videos are informative and easy to understand . They also provide students with an excellent study material. They also provide students with an efficient study planner and regular doubt removal sessions where students can have one to one interaction with the teachers and clear their doubts from the faculty. Kaysons also conduct mock tests . They also provide students with a portal with over 300000 practice problems on different topics that helps in strengthening the NEET preparation ",

In neet exams, physics questions which are asked belongs to the basic level .If you could have all those formulas summarised and can solve the very basics,you will surely get good marks. One thing you should never skip is your test series ,I would recommend akash or allen test series because you will be able to measure where you stand among other aspirants.Apart from this,the number of students in enrollment into these institute is high. So your performance measurement will be more precise.Test yourself regularly,and never ever leave ncert books. If you want to do something extra,just go through the packages once and try to solve exercise.The questions are related so many times that you will start seeing the answers through it.solve 5 years neet question which will help you further. It will be more than enough for you to gain good marks in neet.wishing you all the best. Thankyou! ",

The exam is out of 720 marks which is mainly divided into Three main subjects i.e. Biology( which is further divided into Botany and Zoology ),Physics and Chemistry. If you are looking for the best way to start preparation for NEET I would suggest that you should enroll in an online course that prepares students for NEET examination. The popular online courses available are Etoos, byju\u2019s, Kaysons. Speaking from my experience I believe that Kaysons is one of the best online course for NEET preparation because: Kaysons boast of one of the best faculties that facilitate good learning. They explain everything beautifully in their videos. Kaysons provide you with Doubt removal sessions where students can have one to one interaction with the faculty to remove their doubts.They can also ask the faculty to explain whatever concept they have not understood . Kaysons provides students with the study material that is very easy to understand and which is very good for revision as well if you read it well there also practice problems which will help you in your concept building and applications. They also conduct mock tests where students can check their preparation locally and also all over the nation among various students preparing for the same exam. Apart from all this I believe that student preparation also matters a lot. Therefore along with a good online course a student must work hard, complete his/her portions and have through revision to get a very good score in NEET exam. ",

To study you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems. The more you practice answering problems, the better. 2. Review Errors When you\u2019re practising with these problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. 3. Master the Key Concepts Do not try to memorise the processes. This is counter-productive. It is much better and rewarding in the long-run to focus on understanding the process and logic that is involved. 4.

Take guidance of linkage between various chapters(for interdependence because though you will study according to the marks distribution among various chapters but you will have to study all\u2026except few chapters ) and study from basic level chapter to higher level chapter . Read NCERT after reading modules . Similarly for physics and chemistry too. Your target initially must be to cover Syllabus and not leave any stone unturned until January. And then move to Just revision and test. Forget about studying any new chapter and just revision and study , chapter wise , segment wise, module wise, subject wise\u2026 then finally complete syllabus.

Analyse PYQs ant try to figure out the patternReference: Use these books only for Extra knowledge and solving questions because the question provided in NCERTS are not sufficient.If your are not able to buy just download those books for some NEET preparation websites. But after completing NCERTS you must do revisions of topics related to theory's and reactions ,these are lit bit different from problematic solutions. And My personal experience Don't waste time and keep a separeate time for you board studies , you are regular you have a lot of stress to perform well in boards also I hope this answer will help you All the best \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know if this will help, but as physics had been my favourite during neet prep, I'll tell you a few things which I did- Try completing a chapter in one go, you mustn't go like doing one or two formulas and then solving questions on them. Variations help. As you are going for 2021, you have plenty of time to try and make mistakes. So pick up different question banks and give *time. If you have problems on how to approach new questions type, do 2 things: go for basic formulas and practice alot*. (Ps: basic formulas are F=ma\ud83d\ude09) Every chapter has some basic formulas nd then the derived ones, atleast go through *how* they are derived. When you r stuck they help. Practice on your speed as well, (ps: I was able to finish bio and chem so fast tht i had plenty of tym for physics, to the level tht I derived some formulas during final xam) Be strategic, even if you don't understand any category of questions till your xam time, see to it that you have copied some formulas in your mind.

It\u2019s all in you that whether you can do it or not. If you are totally positive now then also think twice because you might lose the spirit in the race. So think and act. If you are a fresher then all the very best you give your best and go for it. You can do it. ",

Even if someone study for pmts in 9th 10th, I don't think it's easy to retain the syllabus for 3\u20134 long years and personally I would advise against handling such pressure at 13-14 years of age, enjoy your childhood and wait for 11th.

            "answer_text": "Great to see you being so sincere and focused about your studies. Since you are in class 10, then you may start by studying physics of higher classes. Medical aspirants mainly find difficulty in the physics portion. You may buy any reference book such as of Pradeep publication. This would help you in keeping your basics right. If you find time, then study periodic table chapter from ncert class 11- this would be helpful both in your board exams as well as in NEET preparation. Similarly, finish one chapter of class 10 and move on to the related chapter of class 11 or 12. The same strategy should be followed for biology as well. Preparing early would definitely provide you and edge over others. Hope it helps!!! ",

            "answer_text": "The most important thing before starting preparing for this exam is to be absolutely clear about the exam syllabus, it\u2019s paper structure, and what exactly are the topics the paper touches most frequently. All of this we will give a fair idea about your level of preparation before actually even starting preparing for this. This will also give a fair direction to start with. Since most of the questions asked in this paper are from NCERT Textbooks of classes 11 & 12, you must start with them. I understand that sometimes NCERT Books are not sufficient to get a clear understanding of concepts, for that you may refer some reference books. After getting the concept right, it is now time to put them into practice. This moment calls for some rigorous practice of questions of varying difficulty levels. For this, I would recommend you to go for Oswaal NEET Question Banks. They have a very good compilation of question of AIPMT & NEET from last the 33 years. Moreover, they have 2020 NEET paper fully solved attached in the book. Solving this book will introduce you to various types of questions that the NEET has been asking since so many years. I think the amalgamation of strong concepts and sufficient practice will help you ace the exam. Hope this helps! ",

I use their Qbank too and I think you\u2019ll find it useful as well, because those questions have clinical correlations and if you\u2019re able to answer them well, you\u2019re basically gonna thrive on NEET!

Primarily you need to be thorough with your 12th standard Physics, Chemistry and Biology concepts. Apart from this there are textbooks that comes with MCQs that are asked in actual NEET exam.

NEET challenges in this App are timed NEET exams, which are taken by many Students on the same day and at the same time. So, you will be getting the feel of a real NEET exam when you take these NEET challenges. You will come to know your score within a short period of time after you submit your NEET challenge. NEET being a competitive exam, it is very important for you to know where you stand in the competition. ",
