            "answer_text": "Schools and their results are a reflection of the families and communities from which the students come. The most successful schools are selective public schools (schools that you have to test into), public schools in wealthy cities or wealthy neighborhoods of large cities (they\u2019re de facto selective based upon the income required to live within the school district\u2019s borders), and private schools (selective based upon parent\u2019s ability to pay tuition). Every single one of those types of schools will have an above-average amount of students who: have two parents who take an active role in their child\u2019s life.have at least one parent with a successful career.have at least one parent with a college degree.have at least one parent who can help them with their homework, or at least encourage them to do it.do not qualify for free/reduced school lunch.live in neighborhoods where most of the other families have similar structures.The worst public schools are schools whose students are more likely to come from the opposite types of families and communities. Teachers in these schools can do little to help the students overcome the problems that exist for the student outside of the school. In other words, a student\u2019s chance at success has little to do with how good a teacher is, but it has a lot to do with how successful the other dozens of adults in that student\u2019s life are.

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that the premise of this question is wrong. Public schools in well off places perform as well or better than most private schools. Public schools vary in quality to a degree that is almost inconceivable in a country that says it wants better educated children. The elite public schools in NYC, such as the Bronx High School of Science cannot be beat in their specialties. The worst performing schools in the same city are a joke. ",
