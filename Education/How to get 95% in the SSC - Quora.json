            "answer_text": "Why 95%? Why not 100%? Scoring good marks in class 10 is really very easy. Even 2 hours daily study is enough if you are attending your classes daily and paying attention in the class. Maths: Go through NCERT 2-3 times. Practice last year question papers as well as Evergreen sample papers. If you have more time, you can practice R.D. Sharma too!! But Ncert and sample papers are enough to score a perfect 100. Science: Again NCERT is the key.. Chemical equations are only from Ncert. so u need not to mug up all the reactions. The ones available in ncert are enough.. again last year question papers must be practised. Studying sample papers of different publications is waste of time.. if u dont have enough time Social science: History and geography from NCERT and economics and civics from candid. Questions always repeats ..so it is good to learn last year questions\u2026 English: Just practice writing part as much as u can\u2026 go through the text.. and dont forget to read whole drama portion as it can fetch u very good marks. Hindi: I would suggest All in one . it is a complete package and can help u a lot to understand the type of questions. Hope it helps.. Ask if u have any other query\u2026ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR EXAMS\u2026 ",
