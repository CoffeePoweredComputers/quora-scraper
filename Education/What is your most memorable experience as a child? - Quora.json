            "answer_text": "There were two incidents that occurred to me as as a child that I can never forget.They were related The first occurred In 1940 when I was eight and living in London. The Luftwaffe attack on England had started and the Government issued the first of its National Campaigns for the public to contribute items for the war effort to reduce the dependency on the importation of raw materials by ships from America. This Appeal was for the public to donate any unwanted items made of Aluminum to be used to build Fighters for the RAF. The items had to be delivered to local collection points. Of course we were all anxious to help in the Appeal but families owned few items made of aluminum in those days. By chance I had a favorite Toy which we assumed was made of aluminum. It was a large four wheeled Motor Car with a steering wheel made to be pedal driven by a young boy. I had owned it for a number years and it still looked as new but it must be admitted that at the age of 8 I had grown too big to fit easily inside Car and easily work the foot pedals. I was persuaded by the family to donate my Motor Car but the day after we delivered the Car to be used ito make a Spitfire.we were astonished to find that the main evening Newspaper \u201cthe Evening Standard\u201d carried a front page photograph of a heap of metal items and sitting on top was my large Pedal Car in all its glory. The Headline was that some young bioy had given his toy for the War Effort. Of course they did not know my name but that did not lessen the great pride I felt because my desire to help had been recognized anonymously but in such a public fashion. There was also the point that such a valuable item had not been stolen en route to the Ministry of Production and the Standard publicity had ensured it would not be stolen before being used in building building a Fighter My related story occurred in 1943 some 3 years later when I was learning to ride a small size two wheeler bicycle I had inherited from a sibling. I was teaching myself how to keep my balance and pedal and and operate the hand lever to apply the brakes. All this was happening on the same pavement outside our house where I had previously operated my Pedal Motor Car with ease. There were few pedestrians on the Pavement but disaster I braked too late to avoid a young woman on the Pavement ahed of me. and the front wheel of the bicycle touched her leg and tore a hole in her stockings The woman flew into a rage and was not calmed by my apolo.y She kept insisting that she was just starting out for a trip to the West End and her day was ruined. She insisted I showed her where I lived and she stormed you thefront steps and knocked with fury on the Front door. I feared for the worst because I was wholly in the wrong. But I failed to take into Account that the door was opened by my Nanny Maude who was more a member of the family than Nanny and I loved my Maudie like a second Mother and she loved me as her own child. However that was not the mistake this unsuspecting young woman made. I was standing at the bottom of the front steps and overheard the whole conversation In the course of that conversation the young lady made several mistakes.although I did not realize what had happened till I Had thought things through. The young woman revealed that she worked in one the local houses as a maid and this was her afternoon \u201coff\u201d and she was on her way to the West End to spend the afternoon and evening but my tearing her stocking had ruined her day and then she made her final mistake. In order to get Maudie\u2019s sympathy she said the stockings I had ruined were her only pair of Nylon Stockings she owned. I later realized she could not have said anything worse. The only Nylon Stockings in Egland were being given by the newly arrived American Servicemen to English woman in return for sexual favors. In no time Maudie was attacking the woman as a virtual prostitute or Tart by her having sex with American Servicemen who would replace the damaged Nylon Stockings with other pairs of Nylon stockings in rerun for sexual favors with them..Maudie was not the type of English Woman who would show any sympathy with this type of Woman who was satisfying the over-sexed Americans arriving in the country. In no time Maudie had defended me by virtually accusing the woman of being a Prostitute or Common Tart who was on her way to have sex with her American Clients who should not have been on the Pavement getting in the way of a boy on his bicycle. I marvelled that by basic woman talk Maudie had countered the attack on her Lionel by shaming the Woman for her conduct with American Servicemen in order to receive gifts like Nylon stockings that respectable English woman could not own. Maudie called me inside the house and there the incident ended. We never spoke of the incident again although I would have loved to have Maudie explain to me exactly what words she used to protect me from that woman. I remembered the outline but I would love to have learned from Maudie exactly how she had blunted the attack upon me. But that was not for her Lionel\u2019s ears. ",

            "answer_text": "Back when I was 11- I was riding my bike down the street one Sunday afternoon. Then a car shows up behind me and an older girl on her bike all of a sudden is in front of me. So I try to ride through a neighbor's yard to get out of her way- but I end up going into a curb and fall off of my bike. I fell into a wooden fence built around the neighbor's mailbox. My head went right into it and my skin above my left eye got cut. It opened right up and blood started leaking out. The girl then gets off her bike and says she is really sorry. My parents were outside in our front yard right next door and came running over. The girl's dad passes by on his bike and gets off to help. Then the neighbors come out as they heard me screaming. They said they were terribly sorry I got hurt and wanted to know if they could do anything. My mom said she was going in our house and coming back with a wet washcloth to put over my cut. The girl's dad was holding me upward and telling me to NOT lower my head until my mom is back with that washcloth to put on it. That girl was saying she felt really bad and knew it was her fault because I could have kept going forward if she had NOT been there. My mom did come back with the wet washcloth and finally got it over that cut. The washcloth became 'completely red' in less than two minutes. Then my parents thanked that girl's dad for helping and helped me walk to the mini-van we had back then. They said I was being taken to the local clinic where a doctor could give me stitches. My twin brother was told to go get my bike from the neighbor's yard and bring it into the garage where it always is. So we went riding over to the clinic and came in with lots of people already there. We were told that the doctor had to see a lot of other patients before helping us- but he would give me the stitches I needed before the end of the day. A few hours passed with us sitting on a couch looking at the TV in the waiting room. Some nurse did provide me with a bandaged cloth to hold over my cut as the washcloth had gotten yucky. The bleeding eventually stopped and the cut itself just had to be sewn back up. I finally was taken into the doctor's room and we were told he would be with us. My dad took me back there while my mom stayed with my brother in the waiting room. The man eventually walked in and said what he would be doing. He explains that he will be giving me shots in the cut area so I will NOT be able to feel the pain from 'the stitching'. Then he warns me that is going to hurt a little and I need to hold very still as he does it. So he sticks the needles there and it was only as bad as somebody pinching you. After giving me the shots- he then sews up the cut and says the stitches in there will have to stay for up to five days. He tells my dad that I need to be given medicine for it every night and a new band-aid must be put on over the stitches before I go to bed. We finally left after that and I had to go to school the next day. I remember having to give my P.E. teacher a note from the clinic telling her to excuse me from participating in all activities. So I got to just sit down while everyone else was doing the exercises and physical activities. When Friday finally came- my mom picked me up from the school and drove me back to the clinic. We went into the doctor's room and a nurse cut the stitches off. My cut was in the process of healing and I still have a scar in that area from it over 25 years later. ",
