            "answer_text": "Wow. I could write a whole book to answer this question. Here\u2019s my quick take: Education challenges every belief you have, and oddly enough, makes you more confident as a person because you know your beliefs can withstand scrutiny. \u201cChallenges\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201cquestion\u201d, in fact it could mean \u201cexplain\u201d, and more often than not, question and explain give you the same result. It questions you to prove what you once blatantly accepted as fact and forces you to provide validity to your own self. It contorts your thinking until you\u2019re unsure of yourself, which only propels you to work harder to provide reasoning and evidence for the simplest truths in life. You find it necessary to stand on the solid ground of reason because it bothers you to submit to everything said by a teacher or written in a textbook without first understanding it yourself. And then you realize you are a changed person. If you have succeeded in proving to yourself that the oceans tides are caused by the relationship between the earth and the moon and that there was indeed a highly intelligent and advanced civilization in modern day America in the pre-Columbian era then you feel that rush of being apart of the body of knowledge. You know that knowledge doesn\u2019t accept bias or blindly follow the musings of others. You can think for yourself. Your conjectures are meaningful because you are confident in your assertions and can provide ample evidence behind them. As a person, you are transformed into an insightful, inquisitive, and emboldened human being, fully aware of the power of your knowledge. Truly, the armor of an educated mind is one to be reckoned with. ",
