            "answer_text": "Yes. The technical term is \"mental retardation,\" although that term could be considered offensive and can be replaced by \"intellectuall disability\" or \"cognitive impairment\" (Fun fact: Offensive terms like \"idiot\" and \"moron\" were once also technical terms defining severity of retardation, but they gradually became insults and fell out of favor with the medical community). Like intelligence, stupidity is relative. A person who cannot read or speak or dress themselves or clean themselves is stupid if they are 25 years old, but not at 2 months old. Retardation is based on comparing one's intelligence to the average for that age (ex: a 40 year old with the IQ of a 5 year old could rightfully be called stupid). It also is based less on academic and cultural knowledge than \"adaptive functioning.\" That is, an adult who cannot quote Shakespeare or derive equations is not necessarily stupid or smart, but if a person lacks daily living skills (eating and using the bathroom), communication skills, and social skills, then that person has a problem. We must not let political correctness interfere with real medical issues. Cognitive impairment is a real problem: denying that retardation exists or sanitizing it with new words doesn't change the fact that some people struggle to do basic activities. It also denies the reality that intelligence can vanish in healthy people: a severe brain injury or conditions like Alzheimer's can turn someone \"stupid\" quickly, and we won't be able to treat these conditions if people are afraid to use the words associated with them.  Now, can a person who's not retarded be stupid? It might be better to say they are ignorant of certain things or have cultural mores that differ from yours and interfere with their ability to analyze data as you do, but calling them stupid is not medically correct. I'm looking at you, politician-from-party-I-don't-vote-for! ",

            "answer_text": "Merriam-Webster defines the word STUPID as follows:stupid: an adjective definition of stupid (Entry 1 of 2)1a : slow of mind : obtuse b : given to unintelligent decisions or acts : acting in an unintelligent or careless manner c : lacking intelligence or reason : brutish 2 : dulled in feeling or sensation : torpid //still stupid from the sedative3 : marked by or resulting from unreasoned thinking or acting : senseless //a stupid decision4a : lacking interest or point //a stupid eventb : vexatious, exasperating //the stupid car won't start Stupid comes from a French origin meaning to stun or amaze; as in \"Stupify\". As American's we have taken it to mean that some one is intellectually not terribly bright, but of ordinary cognitive function. By all of those definitions, yes, I guess a person could really be \"stupid\", but that is a broad category of definition. If you mean in the American sense--I think that stupid is more of an insult to a person, rather than an actual state.

They could not fathom that idea no matter how basic I have tried to explain it to them.

            "answer_text": "Stupidity or irrational mistakes are not limited to intellectual disability (formerly mental retardation) stupidity is the result of corrupt decisions, caused by the relative intellectual deficit, ignorance, cognitive biases, and others. These prevent or distort the collection and storage of information and its intellectual processing, producing unthinking, biased, false, irrational, stupid decisions. Stupidity is part of the human condition; all humans make irrational (stupid) mistakes but at different levels and frequency. The terms, stupid, imbecile, dump, foolish, dull, incoherent, mousy, mum, mute, dense, dim-witted, feebleminded, moronic, thick, etc. are pejorative, insulting terms. To answer your question: \u201cThe human being, in my concept, is not stupid, he only does stupid things\u201d Istv\u00e1n R\u00e1th-V\u00e9gh.
