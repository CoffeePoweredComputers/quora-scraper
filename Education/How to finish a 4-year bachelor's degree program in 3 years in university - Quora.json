            "answer_text": "The other answers offer good advice, but let me add that universities do not offer a full selection of courses during the summer. Mostly general ed courses are offered during the summer, so if you follow the usual schedule of taking all the the GE courses in your first 4 semesters, you will find it extremely difficult to find courses in the second summer. My solution was to put off as many of my GE courses as possible, but early on I still had to take those that were prerequisites for major courses. And some majors have a strict sequence of upper-level courses and few electives. My university was on the quarter system, and I had to sit out one quarter to sync with the sequence in my major. it is easier to finish in 3 years with the semester system, but I had to do it the hard way by transferring from a community college. There was no financial aid 50 years ago, so I had to work to earn enough money to pay my way including my living expenses. Liberal Art majors, like Psychology, usually allow more electives so it is much easier to schedule courses with liberal arts majors. The primary problem with finishing in 3 years is what next? Going on to graduate school usually works well \u2014 I finished one summer and started graduate school the next fall. But if you are seeking employment, you will miss out on work experience in the summers and probably an internship. Financial aid is also a consideration. Summer semesters are generally not covered by Pell Grants or other financial aid, so you probably would have to load yourself down with student loans. Also taking full loads (18 hours) or perhaps overloads, will make it difficult to maintain a high GPA. I graduated after 3 years with a 3.0, but I could have done much better if I hadn\u2019t been taking heavy loads every period as well as working full-time. It\u2019s better to finish with a high GPA and a full college experience (such as summer internships) than to get through more quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "Note: although I took four years to graduate from Brown, I could easily have done so in three if that had been my goal (although it\u2019s not clear that I would still have been able to double major). If you\u2019re able to handle a heavy course load, or take classes over the summer, the academic side of this is unlikely to pose a major problem: depending on the specifics of your degree, you\u2019ll probably need to take on average one more course each semester than you would as part of an \u201caverage\u201d schedule. You may need to cut back on your involvement with extracurriculars or student life, but if getting your degree as quickly as possible is already your goal, you\u2019re probably aware that you\u2019ll be spending more time studying than other students. The issues you are going to run into are scheduling, and any bureaucratic hurdles your university puts in your way. Depending on exactly what you want to study and how many other students are in your major, you may have trouble putting together an acceptable schedule each semester that will allow you to graduate in three years. In a popular major in which you have a lot of freedom to choose classes and a lot of different classes to choose from, this probably won\u2019t be an issue, but if you are required to complete a long, predefined list of specific classes that are usually offered only once per year (or even less frequently), you may end up with scheduling conflicts that make it impossible to complete them all in three years. Additionally, as I understand it, some universities may expect you to pay tuition for four years, even if you\u2019ve completed your degree in less time \u2014 although this will probably be less of a problem if you carefully screen the universities you apply to to make sure you can graduate after three years and only have to pay three years\u2019 tuition. There may also be other bureaucratic hurdles that I\u2019m not thinking of. To be on the safe side, if you\u2019re currently applying to colleges with the goal of completing your bachelor\u2019s in three years, I would strongly encourage you to get in touch with a student who has graduated early from your university of choice in the major that you intend to declare. - Finally: if you know what you want to major in, and are willing to put up with the hassle of being an international student, you might want to consider getting you\u2019re bachelor\u2019s at a European university, where a typical bachelor\u2019s program only takes three years. However, this decision definitely isn\u2019t for everyone, which is why I only mention it at the end. ",

            "answer_text": "Ar\u00e9 you at university now or waiting to apply? If you already on a course you will be able to ask your tutors if this is possible. If you are waiting to apply ,presumably you will have researched your course thoroughly to see if what you propose is an option. It may be just a question of working really hard which might mean you can progress faster through it and condense it into three years or maybe some components are optional so you can omit them. If you have a university in mind I would email them with the name and details of the courses you would like to do towards your degree and get them to tell you what is possible. Good luck. ",

The easiest to graduate in three years is to attend a university that is on the quarter system where there is a summer quarter. You can complete a degree in three years by taking four quarters a year. Note: I do not recommend that you take only 6 semester or 9 quarters to graduate unless you have a lot of previously college credit earned while in high school. ",
