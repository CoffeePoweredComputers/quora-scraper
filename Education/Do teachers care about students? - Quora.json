            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I got into teaching because I enjoy recognizing the potential in people. I think that the world tomorrow can be better than the world today, if people are given the tools needed to make it so. I realize that I can\u2019t help every student, but even the students who are tough might just need one adult to care about them. One of the biggest problems that exists today is that people lack empathy. They see the way that the world is and know how it should be, but aren\u2019t willing to lift a finger to change it. If a student dies, that is one less light that could have made the world a better place. If that student dies because of a stupid, pointless reason, it personally affects me. I\u2019ve seen people lose siblings, parents, children, you name it. But one of the worst breakdowns I\u2019ve ever experienced was with a former coworker of mine. He was a teacher in a small bush village in Alaska. Because of the conditions of the area, (rampant poverty, alcoholism, etc), depression was extremely common, particularly among the teenagers. The situation was worse because, like many of the bush villages, there are no roads in or out, so professional help is very hard to come by. One day I was working with this guy at our summer job in California when he received a phone call that one of his students had committed suicide. Words can\u2019t express the pain that this guy went through that day. Even worse was his statement after. \u201cThis happens a few times a year.\u201d He understandably quit the profession shortly after that. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is a mistake to put teachers into one generic block as if they would all be the same. There are thousands of teachers in the UK alone, and far more throughout the world, so I do not think it is helpful to create a \u2018teachers\u2019 class of beings and assume that all members will react in the same way to, well anything really. At the same time I think that the majority of teachers think it sad when potential gets cut so tragically short. I have been teaching now for many years and can remember all the six students I taught who died while they were still school children. I recall walking off by myself to cry when I heard that the test results for one student showed that they had a genetic mitochondrial disease for which there was no cure and that they were certain to die shortly. Having done that I dried my eyes and carried on because all the other students were still there and needing to be taught. So arguably I \u2018get over\u2019 the fact that some of my students die, but I still feel sad when I remember it. I also get very angry inside when I see some of the truly shitty things that happen to some students, which are totally outside their control. Things like being physically or sexually abused by parents or - perhaps more often even step parents, having one or both parents die and being left to fend for themselves in a not very caring \u2018care system\u2019 having parents who are drug abusers or alcoholics, it all very sad. I have given up extra time to try to help some of these when it has been in my power. Students who are struggling to keep up and who require extra help and assistance, I regularly give up my free time and even holiday time to help these students, I also feel very happy when they make it into Universities of their choice or find apprenticeships for things that interest them, and I write many recommendations to help this to happen. Overall I supposed it is fair to say that I care about my students. I think that the majority of teachers probably do to various extents, but we are all different, so no one size fits all. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I think so. I\u2019m not a teacher, nor do I desire to be a teacher, but let me tell you three stories of my own experiences. When I was in the eighth grade, during my P.E. period, my class was playing table tennis. I went to retrieve the ball, which had accidentally gotten hit clear across the room. I bent down to get it, and another student didn\u2019t see me, and she accidentally whacked me in the head with her paddle (and oh boy, did that hurt!) My teacher immediately came to me, and took me down to the nurse\u2019s office, no questions asked. I was okay, though, just a bump on the head. I was okay enough to go to my last period of the day, and my math teacher saw me with the ice pack the nurse gave me, and asked what happened. I told him I got whacked in the head with a ping pong paddle, and he grimaced upon hearing it, and asked if I was all right (the funny thing is the girl that whacked me in the head was also in my math class, and she just couldn\u2019t stop apologizing to me). When I was in high school (not sure what year), I had missed my bus to go home. Both my parents worked, as did my grandmother, so I didn\u2019t have a ride home. A gym teacher I had in the 9th grade saw this, and she offered to take me home (she was NOT a creepy teacher, just so you know). When I was in 11th grade, I was on my period, and I was a complete wreck. I was in excrutiating pain, and I felt sick to my stomach. I think my history teacher noticed this, and he came up and asked if I was okay. I don\u2019t remember what I said, but I think it was no, and he asked if I wanted to go to the nurse, and I said yes. He had another student go with me, probably to make sure I got there safely. Also in 11th grade, I threw up in the middle of my English class, and without another word, my teacher escorted me to the nurse\u2019s office. I was in tears because I was so embarrassed, and she kept telling me \u201cit\u2019s okay.\u201d If a teacher didn\u2019t care about their students, they probably wouldn\u2019t bother making sure their students were okay after mishaps like these.

            "answer_text": "Every teacher cares about his/her students. Period. Even though we have all been through childhood/school/college experiences that make us feel that teachers/professors might not have cared about us, the truth is- in their own way they have cared about us (their students). The very act of teaching comes from a place of care that one shows to the person who is learning. To effectively teach anyone, one must come down/rise up to their level and explain stuff in a way that they would understand. Even in the worst attempt of teaching you may have experienced, the teacher is attempting to teach, and in that act he/she is figuring out what might be the best way to explain something to you. By virtue of that attempt, he/she is showing some degree of care towards the student. As for the question: If a student would pass away how much pain would a teacher feel? That depends from person to person. Some people are more resilient whereas others more sensitive. To paint an entire cadre of people- teachers, with the same brush wouldn\u2019t be fair. ",

            "answer_text": "From my experience, most teachers care about their students in at least a limited degree. If a student dies while in their class or while still in school, they are probably going to grieve. Many teachers will be genuinely concerned if a student is grieving because of their own loss such as a parent or grandparent or dog. And the best teachers care about and will reach out to students who begin struggling in the class. But as students move on with their lives, and teachers go through more students, the connections weaken, unless a student actually stays in touch. Like Mary Poppins says; \u201cwhat would happen to me if I were to love every child I had to leave behind?\u201d They can only stay so attached to former students without that impacting their current students.

Thus, it is often best to keep teacher-student interactions highly professional, with little emotion. I have had students who died. It is sad.

            "answer_text": "I am still saddened when I think about students who have died, even if it is twenty or thirty years ago. This is so, whether they were still at school when they died or they died later. It is true whether I heard about their death at the time, or whether I found out afterwards that they had died. I am not constantly thinking of those students every day. I am not unable to continue functioning in my day to day life. So, if you like, I have \u2018got ever it\u2019. But your question is making me remember them and I still have feelings of sadness after all this time. ",
