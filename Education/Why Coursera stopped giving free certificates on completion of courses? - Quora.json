            "answer_text": "First of all, nothing in this world is free. Emotional Point-of-view:- They have servers, programmers, some teachers, and collaboration with some institutions. If they have to give everything for free then Coursera might not have existed in the first place. Also, Employee and Founders have their family to feed. Since nothing in this world is free as stated earlier. They are not going to let them starve or abandon them. Logical point of view:- Put yourself in their position. You started a company which provides online education and you have collaboration with around 100+ universities all over the world. Are you going to give every course material on your website for free? Even if you are giving it for free, after all, Certificates is what matters the most after completion of a particular course. It is the proof that you've completed this course successfully fulfilling every requirement for passing the course. Since the content is provided by universities and those universities don't want to provide materials or courses and certificates for free. So, Coursera can't give it for free. Although, Coursera don't want to give certificates for free. I hope this will help. PEACE!!\u270c ",
