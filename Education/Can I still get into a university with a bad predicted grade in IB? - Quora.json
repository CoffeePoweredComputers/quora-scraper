            "answer_text": "What's your definition of bad? Is it a \u201cless than 40\u201d bad or \u201cI'm not getting a diploma\u201d sort of bad? I guess if they're not as high as you would like them to, you just won't get into the university of your dreams. If you have enough money, you'll always get into university of some sort, regardless of how well you score. If you're in the class of 2018 and you applied with your predicted grades, chances are you've already heard back from them. Thus, I'll assume that you're in the class of 2019. In that case, do study hard. The IB is more of a test of rigour other than raw aptitude (there are exceptions, but that holds true for most people). If you work hard enough, your results will get better. Instead of thinking about your future given low grades, think about hoe you can improve your results during the next school year. Try taking online courses/learning course content during summer, that might help. Good luck! ",

That will give you an idea on the expectations. Actually, you need to aim for more than that, aiming for average score, will not help, to improve the odds of admission. Generally 40+ is highly recommended for premier institutions. ",
