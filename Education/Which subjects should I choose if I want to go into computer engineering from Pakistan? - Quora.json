            "answer_text": "Well, If you want to study Computer and love Computer then my suggestion is to choose a computer from the 9th-Grade and don\u2019t waste time in 10th-Grade by saying that this is basic but you know what our book is great you should learn those skill and Practice as much as you can. Do ICS in first-year, we have Database study those try to make simple database got stuck somewhere ask for help from teachers and from the internet first. This will give a taste of how Computer scientists think. Now in the second- year, you will meet C or C++ or Visual Basic it depends on Board or you can say you will meet High-level Programming Language. You will see again variables, loops, if-else statements, and compound statements. But Practice those again on this Language and try to make something bigger here Like once you learned File handling use this Knowledge and Create the whole Database like keeping track of what have you done so far like GIT. Make changes in the Database by Your Program. So, here we are at the University my friend now choose whatever you want but computer science is my Recommendation. Good Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are referring to subjects to select in Intermediate, I would say you should opt a combination of Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. You can also make a choice between Chemistry and Computer Science. However, Computer Science taught in Intermediate is basic and it would offer little to no help in future if you are selected in Computer Engineering. ",
