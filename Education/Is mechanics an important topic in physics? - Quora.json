            "answer_text": "FYI there are further two parts Classical Mechanics[1]Quantum mechanics[2]I don't know which one you actually mean but both the fields are damn interesting and an extremely important part of physics. I remember in class XI when I fell in love with this topic. Let us breakdown the topics Now what classical mechanics deals with KinematicsApplication and effect of forceWork, Energy powerRotational mechanicsSolid and fluid mechanicsMotion and behaviour of mechanical wavesThese are the topics that have vast importance in our everyday life! Right from banking roads to deciding material for making a specific structure these concepts are an absolute \u201cmust know\u201d sort of things. Moreover think about a sense of satisfaction that you have when you can actually explain an everyday phenomenon scientifically!! You can open your mind to some of the wierdest possibilities ( I thought of what if our earth is reduced to about 1/10 th of its size then how long will a day be, weird enough) and try to use the concepts you learnt. You can explain the swing in cricket ball[3] You can explain the shape of aeroplane[4] The spectacular fouette move in ballet.[5] Think about this what will the escape velocity of a ball be if it's launched from the centre of earth (class 11 concepts)!! While classical mechanics deals with macroworld, the quantum mechanics deals with the microworld, basically the subatomic particles. Remember E=hfHeisenberg's principle[6]Schrodinger's cat[7]Those all were extremely good examples of application of quantum mechanics. So yeah!! Basically mechanics is an important part of physics, really very very important! So keep calm and study mechanics!!! |The chubby boy| Footnotes[1] Classical mechanics - Wikipedia[2] Quantum mechanics - Wikipedia[3] Funda Curry | How to Swing a Cricket Ball ?[4] How Do Airplanes Fly?[5] The physics of the \"hardest move\" in ballet - Arleen Sugano[6] Uncertainty principle - Wikipedia[7] Schr\u00f6dinger's cat: A thought experiment in quantum mechanics - Chad Orzel",

            "answer_text": "Yes absolutely. In Grads its may feel like a topic but its actually one of the main foundation pillars of physics. Mechanics furthur divides itself to classical and quantum. Both again most important sharing the same stage with Electrodynamics and Nuclear Physics. Without studying mechanics you ll be blind to almost 75% of physics since to explain theories or phenomemon belonging to other genre you need the basic building blocks from mechanics. Force, energy, work done, you name it almost all comes from mechanics. So yes its very very important and dont skip it at any cost ",
