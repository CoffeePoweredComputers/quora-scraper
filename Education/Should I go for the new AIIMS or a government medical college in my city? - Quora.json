            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A! Depends on what college you are getting in your city. If it's a new college then going to a new AIIMS would be better . Because central institution develops faster than state college . And moreover most of state college ask you to fill a bond that you would serve the college for some years after you complete UG. The amount you have to pay if you violate it ,duration of bond differ from state to state. There is not any bond in AIIMS . The fees of AIIMS is also so minimum like just around 5000 for the whole course(you save your parents a hefty amount) and you even get some of it refunded after passing from here. \ud83d\ude03The stipend in AIIMS while you do your internship is more than state colleges. The name tag of an AIIMSONIAN is worth it despite of ongoing dilution in medical field\ud83d\ude01!!! All AIIMS look upto AIIMS delhi as a bench mark. The faculty recruitment takes place in AIIMS DELHI. New college\u2026I accept has some downsides . But again it's upto you to weigh the pros and cons. If the city college you are getting is very well established and has a Good reputation and you want to be in comfort of your city then you may choose your city college. Suppose , you speak only hindi and English then a college in South may be a problem for you cause it may be too far off and you would face language issues . Because during OPD visits you would meet patients speaking local languages. I have even heard people saying that language problem wasn't such a issue they learnt it in sometime . I would advice to research beforehand and set your preference accordingly. \ud83d\ude07 This is all according to research I did to select my college . I don't know if they change some rules seeing ,The common exam in NEET UG and also the upcoming NEXT FOR PG \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f!! \ud83d\ude2c Edit ; Sorry for misconception, there is not any internal reservation in AIIMS !

In due course of time when you will actually be dealing with the patients I mean OPD and IPD that's in your final year and internship this particular NEW AIIMS will grow up at least 10 times than the college you have in your city . This is the actual time when you become a perfect DOCTOR not ONLY by the theoretical knowledge from the books with the best professors only . AIIMS is a name in the Medical Industry in the World supported by the Government of INDIA. ",
