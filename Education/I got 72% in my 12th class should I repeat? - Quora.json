            "answer_text": "Well.. That completely depends on what you want to pursue in life and what your career goal is. You first need to check if a score of 72% gets you into the college you want. Sometimes, it\u2019s just a simple PCB or PCM average that can get you your desired college. (the subjects averaged may vary from stream to stream though) As far as repeat is concerned, It\u2019s no more an uncommon decision. But one thing you need to know about repeating is, it requires hell lotta patience. You think the year will pass and you wouldn\u2019t notice but that\u2019s completely a misunderstanding. You get irritated after reading the same stuff again. Plus, 72% in boards is not a bad score if you ask me! And the score won\u2019t even matter after you get all settled in your career. So think wise. ",

            "answer_text": "If u will Repeat It will be the solid waste of one year, Percentage never matters now, moreover You have got 65 + which is quite better. If u will look at major universities and Entrance exams they require only 60\u201365 %. So it will be better go for preparing some big Exam rather than repating. As at some point of time you will feel frustrated. And suppose You have 80+ next time , What will U get. Nothing will happen special. These are early days , Be strong , Keep patience , Life is more tough Ahead. You have good percentage, Save a year, Yup if u are from delhi then u may have some problem in getting admission in DU as you will find no place in Good colleges. but remember nothing happens from a good college , Its You which make your own destiny. Good Luck. ",
