            "answer_text": "Based on my personal experience\u2026 Well, it surely is but only when you\u2019ve managed to give yourself an ample amount of rest on the night preceding. I\u2019ve experienced it in my lifetime that each day that had begun with a sufficient rest to your mind body and soul has always multiplied the impact on productivity and notably during the sunrise. Perks of sunrise activities: I\u2019ve observed at a very personal level that every sunrise brings with it a natural refreshment that serves as a substitute to the \u2018Need for tiny break-time relaxations, coffee/tea cravings, munching habits\u2019 to gain better brain productivity. Research based personal believes: I\u2019ve attended in person, many webinars and live classes on meditation and breathing techniques inherited from Yoga for the purpose self development. And I strongly believe with my guts that the freshness of morning air has an impact on your body language and functioning, especially on the five senses of vision, listen, touch, taste and smell. Research has it that when the information generated of these senses travel to the subconscious mind which is the permanent store house of the brain, it can never be faded. Hence the activities during sunrise aided with a better functioning of senses leads to grasping more information and on a reliable basis hence better performance. Any information collected by brain during the day or after the day has begun in a wider space i.e beyond the personal bubble usually reaches the conscious memory unless it has a very deep connection to yourself at a personal level. And information in the conscious memory cannot last long. That probably could be reason why many young stars(even me till a certain period in past) usually choose mid nights with a belief that peace of mind improves focus. But the fact still remains that Focus teamed with efficiency to sustain knowledge can only up lift your productivity in area of activity. Other side of the coin: Studying at night has been best known to improve the recall ability of a person but tbh my experiences prove better for mornings in comparison to a schedule packed night where my brain has already gone through a day long activity. Conditions apply\u2026 All of it is in place only and only when you have given your mind, body and soul its personal space to relax and refresh to rejuvenate and recharge them for your support. A GOOD SLEEP ALL NIGHT IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED\u2026 Disclaimer: Every thing mentioned here is true unto MY PERSONAL OBSERVATION, EXPERIENCE AND BELIEF and HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RESEARCH OR SCIENCE\u2026!

            "answer_text": "Let me explain this by \u201c art of comparing\u201d !! Imagine for a while that ur brain is like a two way road of a huge city having moderate traffic congestion all day around , and u need to cross the road and get to the other side of the road \u2026.for this case two situations can arise, 1.) If there are no vehicles running on the road , without much friction u can easily cross the road. (This condition will occur mainly during morning Times eg- 4:00am)  Now the game begins, similarly ur brain can capture and retrieve information faster during the morning time , the only condition is u have relaxed well during the night. The information can easily cross through ur brain, hence better learning. 2.) When vehicles are there on the road, so it's going to be very hard . U need to try again and again to reach the other side of the road. ( Mainly during the evening times )  This happens to those who are indulged in many stuffs during thier day time, these stuff keeps recycling as distractions in similar to the traffic , hence learning requires more time. I think , it satisfies you ! Learn with ease!! Thank you\u263a\ufe0f\u2026 ",
