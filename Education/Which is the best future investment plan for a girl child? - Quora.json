Now coming to the Q; you have recd. various answers and I necessarily do not agree with most of them. Best Future investment for a girl child (or even a boy): Mutual Funds! Consider this: you have (in case the child is 1\u20133 years) About 2\u20133 years for schooling to begin:15 odd years for the Undergraduate studies18\u201319 years for PG studies24\u201325 years for marriage (in case you want to save up for that)The different options available are: Gold: Annual increase is <5\u20136%Land: Annual increase (in normal course) about 3\u20134%.Apartment: Annual increase : 5\u20136% tapering off over a period of time (not to mention money blocked)Stocks: Fact check! < 1% of Retail investors make moneyFD: Rate of interest is < Inflation rateSukanya Smariddhi Yojana and NSC etc: Rate of interest is < Inflation rate although you get reduction in Income tax.Mutual Funds: Rate of interest > Inflation rate (especially since India is a growing economy)A combination of Equity and Debt will give you a bouquet of MF that will yield money for you in the long term and short term. Remember you need assets that are: Returning money at > rate than inflation %Should be able to sell immediately and get money without hasslesIdeally, I would recommend that you go in for Financial Planning and do a comprehensive goal based plan that will give you the right advice and the MFs to invest in!

            "answer_text": "There are lots of investment were you can generate high returns. Currently we are living in the world were once baby girl is born in our family we start to prepare for her marriage, start saving for purchasing gold etc. This is unfortunate, we must focus on developing our child, give best education and let her stand firmly on her feet. That's should be our priority as well as responsibility. Coming to point you have not informed your age or your daughter age nor you have informed your risk appetite. So I am assuming you are 30 years old and your daughter is 2 years old. Firstly don't go for life insurance treating it will fulfill all your daughters need in future. Investment in ULIP and traditional plans will give you very less return. So rather than going for investment plan, invest in term plan for your own sack and family.Term plan are available at a cheap rates. For ex Rs 50L cover you need to pay around Rs 6300/- yearly premium, this will take care of your family in unforeseen events. Also You can opt mediclaim plan. You can start investing in Mutual funds which have given handsome returns till date. ICICI Pru value discovery fund has given a return around 22% CAGR. So you can start investing in below mentioned Mutual Funds. Scheme Name/3 Year Returns (%)/5 Year Returns (%) SBI BlueChip Fund-Reg(G)/ 26.25 /20.24 Birla SL Frontline Equity Fund(G)/ 23.15/ 18.16 Franklin India Prima Plus Fund(G)/ 27.17/ 18.56 Mirae Asset India Opportunities Fund-Reg(G)/ 27.45/ 19.44 BNP Paribas Mid Cap Fund(G)/ 33.82/ 24.58 If you are safe investor and wants steady returns you can opt for SUKANYA SAMRIDDHI YOJANA  Interest rate: 8.3%  Tenure: 14 years  If you have a daughter below 10 years, the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is a better option than the PPF because it offers a higher interest rate. Like the PPF, the interest earned is tax free and there is an annual cap of Rs 1.5 lakh on the investment. Accounts can be opened in any post office or designated banks with a minimum investment of Rs 1,000. A parent can open an account for a maximum two daughters.
