            "answer_text": "For Indian applicants, If WES has rejected your request for evaluation, I would recommend going for IQAS, because it appears most liberal. ICAS: applicable only if you studied at an University or Technical Education Board ICES: applicable only if you studied at State Board of Technical Education or at an University IQAS: applicable for institutions recognised by MHRD, NIOS, UGC, and AICTE University of Toronto CES: applicable only if you studied at State Board of Technical Education, at an University or at State Board of General Nursing and Midwifery. EDIT: IQAS rejected one of my credentials because it was not recognized by UGC or AICTE. This is not mentioned on IQAS website, but was mentioned in the letter I received from IQAS stating why they have rejected a credential. ",

            "answer_text": "I am writing with respect to ECA (Educational Credential Assessment) for immigration purposes. There are some more organizations authorised to issue ECA reports other than WES (World Education Services). Comparitive Education Services (CES) - University of TorontoInternational Credential Assessment Service of Canada (ICAS)International Qualifications Assessment Service (IQAS)International Credential Evaluation Service (ICES)Medical Council of Canada (for Doctors - specialist physician, general practitioner, family physician)Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (for Pharmacists)As per IRCC website IQAS will not offer ECA services between November 19,2019 and May 19,2020. As an alternative to WES, in my personal experience, IQAS and CES are good. However processing time is more compared to WES. IQAS takes about 6 month's time to provide ECA once documents are received by them while CES takes around 4 months. Hope the answer will help you. Thank You. ",
