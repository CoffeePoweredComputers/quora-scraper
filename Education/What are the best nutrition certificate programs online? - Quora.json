            "answer_text": "Today everyone has realised the value of health and nutrition. People want to prevent disease before it occurs and for this they go to nutrition counsellors. Lets see some of the best online classes for Nutrition Courses: 1. ALLIED HEALTHCARE ACADEMY \u2013 if you want to study Nutrition and want to be in the field of Nutrition and Allied Healthcare then this is the best Online Institute for you. They have classes totally online and a year round admission. With lifelong membership, you can study within 2 week, 2 months or 2 years, based on your routine. They have beginners to advanced level courses. Once completed you can download your certificate and start your practice. If you are just starting, this is the academy for you. If you are planning to go into the feild of nutrition as a professional, I suggest you enroll into their Diploma Courses. 2. COURSERA- if you are already a nutritionist and looking for high level Professional Development courses, they have some courses that will help build your knowledge. The classes are online but can be difficult for beginners. These are only ideal for you if you are already a trained Nutritionist and have done basic level courses. 3. UDEMY/SKILLSHARE \u2013 perhaps you are looking for a hobby course and not interested in working in this field. You can do a course from these for $5-10 and get some useful knowledge. They have short bite-sized courses for those interested in the topic. Disclaimer- they are not professional courses and do not give the knowledge to be a nutritionist or a nutrition coach. Trying to get a job or coach a client with these certificates may backfire and you\u2019ll face unnecessary problems before even starting your career. In todays age everyone prefers to study online and work from home for some of the most practical reasons: 1. Studying online means you avoid traffic and commute and can focus all your time on studying 2. Online courses have a laser focus so you don\u2019t have to take unnecessary extra curricular activities or supplement courses. 3. Working from home means you don\u2019t have to pay atrocious amounts for office rental and running costs 4. Online education is flexible enough that if you want to study once a week or everyday, it is your choice 5. Since the overheads like classroom are not there, the courses are much less expensive than full-time education 6. You can work full time while studying online or you can study full time while working online. You can also study full time and work full time if both are online. This is not a flexibility given by regular classes or work culture. ",
