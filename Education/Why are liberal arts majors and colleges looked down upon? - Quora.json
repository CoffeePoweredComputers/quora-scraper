            "answer_text": "There are many reasons for this, some good, some bad. A Good Reason: Freeloading. If you were independently wealthy or supported yourself with an ordinary job and studied this stuff, nobody would care. When liberal arts students (and worse, academics) scoff and use the phrase \u201canti-intellectual\u201d, they seem to ignore the fact that somebody has to pay for this crap, and a lot of that money comes out of federal endowments (meaning it\u2019s tax money) and the tuition fees of students who couldn\u2019t care less. That kind of condescending attitude from someone who lives off of other people\u2019s money without their consent is more than a little irritating.A Bad Reason: STEM chauvinism. Occasionally you run into undergraduates (and worse, academics) who honest-to-God do not understand the point of doing things besides science, or of reading books with words and no equations, which is like complaining that a book has no pictures. When someone in the humanities gives you disdainful elitist guff for daring to ask them why your tax money should pay their salary, it is quite reasonable to be a little rankled. On the other hand, when STEM people dismiss history or philosophy or literature in toto (that is, not just the academic departments, but the disciplines themselves), they end up looking like overgrown sci-fi nerds arguing that computer games are better than books.(If any STEM types would like a justification for participating in such disciplines, I will answer, but first I want to ask why they\u2019re on Quora and not in a lab somewhere. Zing!)A Good Reason: Far-Left Lunacy. Okay, I\u2019m gonna catch some flak for this, but a cursory Googling of the phrase \u201cNewton\u2019s Rape Manual\u201d shows one reason why a lot of people can\u2019t stand the liberal arts. A great deal of \u201cscholarship\u201d (using that word loosely) in the liberal arts is done in rigid adherence to, and in service of, a political orthodoxy that simply isn\u2019t shared by the wider society. Even humanist academics admit this: Martha Nussbaum, a feminist philosopher, referred to one instance of this phenomenon as a \u201cfeminist assault on reason.\u201d The people who are most obnoxious about this are exactly the ones who refuse to admit that it happens.A Bad Reason: Economic Snobbery. I work in a low-paying, low-stress job that only takes 40 hours of my time every week. Why? Because I want time to pursue things I actually care about. No, I didn\u2019t get an engineering degree, I don\u2019t drive a Lexus, and I don\u2019t have a Rolex. I don\u2019t need those things, and don\u2019t particularly want them. I\u2019d rather pursue philosophy. There is a section of our society that fetishizes \u201csuccess\u201d (which means making money) and are not fond of the liberal arts, or anything else that isn\u2019t \u201cproductive,\u201d meaning anything else that does not make money.",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not really absolutely sure but in the USA people seem to put a lot of emphasis on big pay checks . I was an art major in college. I was an older student that always wanted an art degree . I knew in high school if I could navigate my way to college I would. It was a lot cheaper if I could of gone right out of high school but I didn\u2019t mainly because I had a baby and was unwed . I wound up going and it just took longer . I always thought everyone got a degree in what they love not for big money . I could always tell the people volunteering at the science research facility I volunteered at wanted to get in to a medical school . It just appeared kind of sad they didn\u2019t look happy about having to volunteer and it was their way of attempting to give back for a letter and reference. I did it for love of animals. All the degrees that had to do with math and science were extremely hard at the University of California . I took chemistry and art classes. I would of loved to be a restoration specialist of paintings but it took too much chemistry. I had little algebra skills . It would of helped me more if I would of had some excellent math skills but I had so little. Unfortunately our high schools let out kids down they must have high math and science even when they major in liberal studies. My daughter got out of high school . She was terrible at that school she could barely finish with her high school diploma. The schools thought if the parents don\u2019t come and talk to the teacher the kid has no good plans none . We told our kid she should major in music. She was great at singing but she refused . She said no money for average singers or flute players. So we said ok what are your plans ? Liberal studies and she had no real plans. The high school didn\u2019t graduate her . My husband and I signed her into the USMC . She threatened to go early not graduate even though she didn\u2019t pass algebra the 2nd time. She wanted in the Marines. 17 kids at her high school joined she was the only girl . Remember we tried to get her to be a singer so we said be in the band or play the flute in the Marines . You can play at events ! No she wouldn\u2019t do that . All her friends parents had money all her friends went to Stanford or Very expensive schools straight out of high school ! So it\u2019s what you do with your life that changes the world . She went on to get a MBA just as fast as her friends 8 years later for 0 dollars. She has a high paying career in what she learned in the Marines . I was wrong to push music school . The kid knew I was not right ! Oh and she works with high end math skills at her job . Something her high school couldn\u2019t teach her . The school was wrong , we were wrong to push a liberal studies degree. It wouldn\u2019t have worked . She stayed in 10 years in the US Marines . Longer than anyone else . Only reason she got out she sells and makes More money now than before . Liberal studies degrees are great but not for everyone ! ",
