            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what you mean. Are you asking if community college students who earn their associates\u2019 degrees have a commencement ceremony? If so, the answer is yes. I went to a community college for my first two years, earning my associate\u2019s degree. The community college I attended holds commencement exercises every year, either in late May or early June, for those who are graduating. Or do you mean are community college students as likely to graduate as students who go to four year schools? The answer to that is more complex. In my area, many community college students are older, working full time, working part time, are married/have families. Many can only attend as part time students due to their other commitments. Some do graduate, although it takes them longer, and many do not, for a variety of reasons. Community colleges in my state (Massachusetts) are required to admit anyone who applies, so long as s/he has a high school diploma or a GED. Many of these students need to take remedial/development courses (junior high and high school level) before they can take the college level courses. This slows them down. I\u2019ve seen community college students who are at the picture book reading level, and require significant remedial courses before they\u2019re ready for college courses. Then there are the students who are just taking courses without any plan or goal, and sometimes they drop out for a while, then return. The other factor to consider is that many/most community college students don\u2019t come from wealthy or even upper middle class families. Many are immigrants, many are poor or working class. Many are the first in their families to go to college. They often lack the support (academic, financial, emotional, etc.) that their wealthier peers at the four year schools take for granted, and they struggle in ways that their wealthier peers do not.

            "answer_text": "Are you asking if community colleges have graduation (or commencement) ceremonies? Absolutely. If you are asking if students who pursue associate\u2019s degrees are likely to graduate, that\u2019s more complex. Community college student completion rates are measured by the Department of Education at four years. The rates are abysmal\u2026 sort of. They are misleading. Who is counted as \u201centering a degree program\u201d is not simple; many people who start at a community college have no plan to finish a degree, and some have no need, so the school counts as best it can, but the rules are dictated by needs other than the eventual numbers they will produce. In addition, students who transfer to other schools, even four-year schools, aren\u2019t counted. Finally, students might be on very slow tracks; if you are not ready for college-level work and pursue an associate\u2019s degree part-time, it may take 5 years or more to complete. I think community colleges are successful in giving people an introductory-level college education. If you look at other answers I\u2019ve given, though, you\u2019ll note that many students need additional years to graduate and they would be served well by either starting at a four-year school or transferring as quickly as possible. 2+2 can easily turn into 3+3. Some depends on the specific community college, and some on the state community college system. Of course, some depends on the individual student, the advising they receive, and how they respond to that advising. ",

Moreover, many go on to a four year college or university to obtain their bachelor's degree, I did this also. I have met several people who have followed the above path. I hope that answers your question:) ",
