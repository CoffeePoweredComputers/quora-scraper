            "answer_text": "In-universe, not likely. Wizard Blood Purity was around before Hitler came on the scene (as shown in CoG) and Voldemort doesn't deviate too much from what other Blood Purists want except that he also wants personal power for himself In a meta sense, to a degree, but honestly they were pretty different. Rowling seems to have a rough idea of what Hitler and Nazism were about, but they aren't really the same as what Voldemort and the Death Eaters stand for except in the general \u201cAuthoritarian bigot\" kind of way. Nazi race theories were convoluted, bunk and based on pseudoscience\u2026but even so, at least they aren't telling you to have babies with your cousins. The Nazi's at least understood the dangers of inbreeding in a way that seems to have flown over the head of certain Wizarding folk. Nazism (in theory) aimed for a broad class consensus and Hitler himself came from a very humble background, which Nazi propaganda made part of his image (\u201cI've been through what you all have been through\u201d). Voldemort claims a noble lineage and his appeal is primarily to a disgruntled Wizarding aristocracy. Hitler wanted to unify the German ethnic group into one huge German state through annexation, and conquer new \u201cliving space\" in the East for a growing German population. Death Eaters don't really have anything like that and if anything their policies would have reduced the Wizarding population considerably. Voldemort strikes me as more of an Ultraconservative tyrant in the vein of someone like Sulla or Franco. He doesn't want any radical changes to the Wizarding world apart from getting rid of the bits of it he doesn't like. Hitler, meanwhile, wanted a radical overhaul of art, music, architecture, religion, economics, morality, eugenics and more. He wanted to create a whole new culture and to breed a Master Race into it. Hitler and Voldemort also had quite different upbringings (both dysfunctional), experiences at school (Voldemort excelled, Hitler failed twice), experiences after school (Voldemort got a steady job while working on his plans, Hitler lived off the money of others then was forced to live on the street before making a living as a street artist, then signing up for a war) and personalities (Voldemort was private and knew how to hide his thoughts, and had a sense of smug superiority; Hitler hated being alone and wanted everyone to know his opinions when he wasn't trying to manipulate you, and was insecure about his failures in life). So, Voldemort was \u201cinfluenced\u201d by Hitler, but they don't actually have that much in common beyond the superficialities. Voldemort being a half-Blood is probably inspired by the rumours that Hitler had a Jewish grandparent, but though Hitler was unable to prove that definitively, most historians agree there isn't much chance of it being true based on the limited evidence.

            "answer_text": "Do you mean the author was influenced by Hitler when creating Voldemort or Tom Riddle as a person (as he was young while Hitler was still powerful)? Yes, J.K. Rowlling was inspired by Hitler. You can see a lot of connections between them (the ideology, the blood connections with people that belong to the category they condamed, persuasion skills). Though, I think Grindelwald was more like Hitler. But Tom Riddle is very hard to believe to have looked upon a Muggle (unless Hitler was a wizard in disguise). Anyway, contrary to Hitler, Riddle had no interest in conquering Russia. ",
