            "answer_text": "It would probably be good for the world if more English speakers, especially Americans, learned a second language and learned more about other countries and cultures. It would be good for children everywhere to grow up bilingual or trilingual (as many do now). Having greater understanding, appreciation, and compassion for other peoples would be a step toward peace. But we humans are very good at fighting with our brothers and our neighbors, so no single step is a cure-all. Learning Esperanto is a choice that any individual can make, if they want to increase their connections with people living in other countries. But the leaders of the world are not yet ready to make many coordinated and cooperative steps, especially on language questions. Would it be good for society if children would learn Esperanto in school all over the world to help them understand each other? Would that help facilitate world peace eventually? ",

            "answer_text": "Esperanto was introduced in the 60\u2019s & 70\u2019s as a new international language, but very few people learned to speak it because as it turned out it was to difficult to learn so it was quickly abandoned. However, with people today learning to speak Vulcan, Klingon and Elfish maybe we should try again. Although, I think most people are quite happy to have English as the International language. ",
