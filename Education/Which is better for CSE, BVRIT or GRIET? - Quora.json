            "answer_text": "May be I am fit to answer this question! I am now in 3\u20131, pursuing IT program. Don't know about how the teaching at GRIET is but will suggest you a thing that there isn't much difference between CSE and IT programs in Engineering colleges across the 2 Telugu states. Coming to BVRIT,CSE has 5 sections compared to IT's 2 and heard from my CSE friends that the faculty who come to them are top class. In case of my department, barring a few the rest of the faculty are kinda orthodox with no stimulus to changing industry needs. So the common USP is in which ever college you opt for, self learning and a good internet is all that is required to excel in CSE/IT course. Hope this answers your query. ",

CSE in BVRIT is quite good but you need to take the decision regarding the factors like transport. If transport is nt a big problem fr U.. Then don't at all hesitate to Join BVRIT. ",
