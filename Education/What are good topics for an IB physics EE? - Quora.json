            "answer_text": "This is poorly worded but I hope it helps. A good topic would be an investigation of the Doppler Effect. You could try setting up a sound source (e.g. a buzzer) on a rotating arm like apparatus. Find the rpm, and then use that value to find the period and then the velocity that the buzzer is travelling at (remember to factor in the distance/radius the buzzer is away from the centre of the circle). Set up a microphone close to a tangent on the \u201ccircle or rotation\u201d and connect that to an oscilloscope. Then, you can measure the wavelength change as the buzzer approaches and travels away from the microphone and verify using the Doppler Effect Equation for a moving source (remember the relationship between wavelength and frequency):  Uncertainties will be huge and results will probably be relatively inaccurate, but that gives you a lot to talk about in your error analysis. Good luck! ",
