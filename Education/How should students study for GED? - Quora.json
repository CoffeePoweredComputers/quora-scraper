            "answer_text": "Hi, Many students who take the GED split it up into different sections rather than taking it all at once. For example, you can take the math section separately from the social studies section, etc\u2026 Most students start with the math section because it tends to be the hardest and thus is best to get out of the way as soon as possible. The hard truth is that practice problems are your bread and butter for acing the math section of the GED test! You need to practice a lot to do well! As far as products go, I've seen students come to tutoring sessions with literally 8 prep books, each dedicated just to one single topic (one book just for fractions, one for decimals, one for exponents, etc\u2026). I'm not against using this many books, it's just that in my opinion it can be overwhelming for students. I much prefer books that condense everything you need to know into one work, so you have it all in one place. This is one of the main things I tried to do when I wrote The Champions' Guide To Winning on the 2017 GED\u00ae Test Math Section, which I\u2019ll talk about more below. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend for products: GED Test 2017 Strategies by Kaplan. I really like this guide because it covers just about everything you need to know and comes with 2 extra practice tests! Mcgraw-Hill and Barron's guides are also pretty good, but Kaplan is the best in my opinion.The Champions' Guide To Winning on the 2017 GED\u00ae Test Math Section From Test Prep Champions (my book). You can get it for under $10 here: http://www.testprepchampions.com/p/products_1.html. We also have a lot of high-quality free problems at this same link, so you\u2019ll at least want to check those out if nothing else!Practice tests. The only place, and I repeat, THE ONLY PLACE I would trust to get practice tests from is http://www.gedmarketplace.com, as they're the official GED testing service.Youtube and google! Youtube honestly has tons of math videos that are extremely helpful and also free! You can also learn a lot just by googling things or asking questions on websites like quora.Basically, you want to break your math test prep into 3 phases: 1. Content learning and review 2. Practice, practice, practice! 3. Ace the test! This is a rough breakdown of how the content is split up on the test: Number operations & number sense = 20-30% Measurement & geometry = 20-30% Data analysis, statistics, & probability = 20-30% Algebra, functions, & patterns = 20-30% The math section has 46 questions total. The first 5 questions must be done without a calculator, but you will be able to use a calculator for the remaining 41 questions! You'll have 115 minutes to do this section. Here's a list of some things you should know for your phase 1 preparation! Please note that this list does NOT cover everything you need to know to pass, but it does cover most of the topics that frequently appear on the test, so it's a great starting point: -Be able to recognize less than, greater than, equal to, and not equal to signs -Addition and subtraction with fractions -Multiplication and division with fractions -Addition/subtraction/multiplication/division with negative numbers -Exponent rules -Factoring/Using the quadratic equation -Using the F.O.I.L. Method -Calculations with percents -How to calculate slope and find the equation of a line -How to find the mean, median, and mode -How to read and solve problems with bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and other graphs -How to solve algebraic equations (in other words, how to \"get x by itself on one side\") -How to read and use number lines -How to find greatest common factors -Be able to identify the ones, tens, and hundreds places in numbers -Be able to identify the tenths, hundredths, and thousandths places in numbers -Rounding and estimation -Simple interest calculations using the simple interest formula: p = irt ***The geometry section can be intimidating, as many don't know where to begin! Here's where to start if you aren't sure: -Know the difference between the radius and diameter of circles -Be able to calculate the area and circumference of circles -Know how to find the area and perimeter of squares -Know how to find the area and perimeter of rectangles -Know how to find the perimeter of triangles -Know how to determine the area of a triangle -Make sure you understand the pythagorean theorem and how to use it to find missing triangle side! -Be able to use formulas to find the area and volumes of other shapes like spheres -You'll probably get some geometry word problems, so make sure to practice them! The key is to understand the geometry basics I just outlined above, and you should be okay! **Note that you'll be given the formulas on test day, so don't worry about memorizing them! If you can master all of this, you'll be in great shape! I'd recommend to use your GED prep books, youtube, and google to review all of these topics. You can simply copy and paste a topic into google or youtube to make it easy to find resources to use! Make sure to take good notes! Once you feel you've got this stuff down, go ahead and take some practice tests! When you review your tests, the trick is to pay close attention to your mistakes! For every question you got wrong or were confused on, go straight to your notes and review the topic! If the topic is not in your notes, go back to your prep books, or do a google or youtube search on the topic. If you use my topic list to review, you'll know all of the basics well, but will likely still come across some stuff you don't know on your practice tests. That's why it's so important to review the whole topic of the question you got wrong! The more you do this, the more you'll be filling in your gaps! Once you can consistently break the passing score for your state on your practices tests, you should be good to go! Currently, you are permitted to bring a Texas Instruments TI-30X3 to use on the test (please check and make sure this is the EXACT model you need to use! I'm 99% sure it is, but it may differ depending on your state). You should be able to get one at either Walmart or Target, or online for under $20.00. However, you'll be given a calculator on the computer at the test center to use for free, so if you don't wanna pay for one it won't hurt you! If you're using the onscreen calculator at the testing center, check and see if you can use the computer keypad to enter numbers on the calculator. This will be much faster than having to click each button on the onscreen calculator! Definitely use the calculator as much as you can on the test!!! Remember, you'll be racing against the clock! As long as you input everything into the calculator correctly, you'll usually get the answers much faster than you would working them out by hand! If you aren't planning to buy the calculator, I'd recommend using the default calculator that came with your computer found in your applications, as this will be similar to the one you'll get on the test. When you start taking practice tests, DON'T WORRY about your score at first! In fact, don't even worry about the time! ***The main way to get better at math FAST is by practicing reasoning your way through as many problems as you can, getting stuck, and then figuring out how to get unstuck! As I said, when you get stuck, go back to your prep materials and try to figure out the correct answer using them. That way you'll remember it better for future problems! Another VERY IMPORTANT test taking tip I can give you is to UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE MARK FEATURE!!! I put this in all caps to hopefully really drive this home! Basically, the way the test is setup is that you can mark questions you aren't sure how to answer to return to them later. A lot of students don't utilize the mark feature because they either don't notice it, or don't know what it means. An excellent strategy is to answer the questions in waves! Your score can literally SKY ROCKET if you apply this method! The first time you go through the questions, whenever you come to a question that you're not sure how to do within 30 seconds, guess, mark it, and move on! You don't want to waste valuable minutes away on any one question until you've secured all the points you can on the easier ones! Get all the points you can on the easier questions first! NEVER EVER leave any questions blank! Always guess and mark it when you come to a question you need to skip, that way if you run out of time and can't go back to review them, at least you put something down. After you've secured all the easier points, it's now time to go back through for the second wave. In other words, you will now go back over all the questions you marked in the first wave. This time, go after every single last point you can, and only leave the questions you have no idea how to do! For the third and final wave, you will work on any of the questions that stumped you in the first 2 waves, while also checking your work. You probably won't have much time left at this point, so the important thing is that you got all the points you could and have your best guess down for the ones you don't know. There will probably be a lot of word problems on your test, so don't be thrown off by this! The best advice I have for word problem strategies is to BE AWARE OF THE KEYWORDS within the questions! Recognizing keywords alone will often cue you in as to how to answer the question! Here are some common ones to know: Addition: Plus, sum, total, combined, etc... Subtraction: Difference, take way, lost, change, decrease, how many are left, etc... Multiplication: Product, times, etc... Division: quotient, goes into, per, etc... Additionally, watch for words like area, volume, perimeter, circle, square, etc... Whenever these come up, 9 times out of 10 you'll need to find a formula to use and then plug some numbers in!

            "answer_text": "First figure out how to best manage your time.  If you're the alarm-clock sort, set your alarm and make a schedule. I'm not an alarm person (I sleep right through them), so I just plan from when I wake. But the idea is to have a schedule flexible enough to allow for mental states, but not to allow for playing 37 games of backgammon. I'm a slow waker; two cups of coffee takes two hours. Answer all emails, check to see whether any bills are due, check my calendar and phone messages. Next, shower and do outside chores -- bank, post office, groceries. Or if I'm really alert, work on taxes and leave those chores for later. But both have to get done sometime today. I used to waste a lot of time playing YouTube pinball waiting to get the energy. Now I ask myself what chores I can get done with this level of energy: do some laundry and cleaning? Go do some physical exercise? Web-surf for useful things: I'm moving this month, I wonder if anyone's giving away free boxes? Head for Craigslist instead of Facebook. So make a routine that allows for physical and mental energy, high and low energy, indoor and outdoor. But if you're not ready for the next item on the list, don't get sucked into playing computer games while you wait. Just shuffle the list a bit and keep moving. Next prioritize the content. This is how I prepared for my Bar Exam: Every day, I read through my materials. If I was certain I knew a piece, I nodded my head and kept reading. When I didn't know something, I wrote it out in my \"new\" outline.\"  The next day I did the same thing with the new, shorter outline. Seeing the outline get shorter every day was a great motivation for continuing too. ",
