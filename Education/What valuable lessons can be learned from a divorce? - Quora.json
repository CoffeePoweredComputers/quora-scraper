            "answer_text": "I think a lot of divorce is too personal and specific to the couple to really be of much general use; that said, I think there's one element that seems to come up a lot, and it's this idea that it's easy to lose perspective on how broken a situation is when you're in the middle of it. You think it's about to get better or it's just a phase or it's really not that bad, when sometimes it's best to just pull the plug and move on, even if that's scary and causes complications in the short term. My ex-wife and I were married 11 years, have kids together, and got divorced last year (separated last year, finalized in Feburary). Somewhere along the line, we just stopped getting along -- didn't speak to each other much, didn't spend time together, other than tending to family business, we pretty much lived separate lives under the same roof. And yet we lived that way for... two... three years, maybe? And that's the thing... for a while, I found ways to live with it and so did she. \"Things will be better when she finishes school. Things will be better when our daughter leaves for college. I'm just tense about work.\" And I'm sure she had her versions of those same sentiments. You can always find a way to pin it on something else, especially when the alternative is throwing your life into upheaval and uncertainty and embracing scary huge changes vs. hoping some incremental tweak will be the one that works. So if I'm being honest, the general stress and tension of a relationship that had quietly stopped working had been weighing on me, and I didn't really understand what that meant until I stopped feeling it on a daily basis. I don't want to make my ex out as this horrible person or that this is something she inflicted on me -- she's not and she didn't -- but I've absolutely felt better with the weight of that lifted. It's not that I don't still have problems or that the divorce hasn't created new challenges, but there is a degree to which a weight I never fully acknowledged was there was removed. I'm not saying one should lawyer up at the first argument that goes sour or that couples shouldn't try to work things out. But there is a point at which you have to be honest about what's not working and deal with the short-term pain rather than just exist in limbo where you just stay unhappily married because you don't have a better idea. I had grandparents who \"celebrated\" their 50th anniversary without ever speaking to each other because you stayed married regardless of whether you're happy or not. Life's too short for that. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a huge opportunity for personal growth. The lessons, like Jason mentioned, will be personal, but the opportunity is universal.  You will have some difficult issues to personally face up to, because part of the reason the marriage failed was you and your behaviour.  If you have the courage to face up to your faults and think of new ways to behave in future, then you will make some real progress with your personal development.  I'll give you some personal examples to illustrate my point; Arguments. I used to have shouting matches with my ex-wife, they got quite nasty towards the end, lots of swearing and insults etc.  I actually learnt this lesson before I got divorced, but it was part of the process.Shouting and screaming and being rude to somebody you once loved, or perhaps still do, is never useful or acceptable. It creates pain, anguish and bitterness; it achieves nothing.  Communication.Keeping things to yourself breeds resentment and it's unfair on the other party as they have no chance of affecting any change in their behaviour if they don't know what is wrong.  They also have no idea how to comfort or soothe you because they have no idea what is going on in your head. Effective communication is hard to achieve, especially if like me, you are an introvert, but it needs to happen, so set up situations you feel comfortable with and do it.  Empathy.If you can't learn to feel empathy for your wife or husband, then the marriage is going to struggle because you will always be imposing your motivations onto their behaviour, which will be frustrating and upsetting, because you will be wrong most of the time.
