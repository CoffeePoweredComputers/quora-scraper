So this year I decided to take it upon myself to finally go all in on becoming MY BEST SELF\u2026 For years I knew I wanted more\u2026 I knew I had untapped potential and it was finally time to set it free. And after researching some of the best success coaches on the planet I came across this guy Dean Graziosi. I started following him and I LOVED his stuff! So just recently I decided to join his monthly Inner Circle and all I can say is WOW!  It has been a complete needle mover in my personal and business life like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen. And on our last LIVE hangout, Dean talked about the importance of being surrounded by like-minded individuals all hungry for that next level of life. And I knew I had to share the message! So for anyone out there that feels like they have more gas in the tank\u2026 like they have untapped potential waiting to explode\u2026 then I want to invite you to come on over and join our amazing Inner Circle. If you want to hear Dean explain all of the benefits and bonuses you get when you join (better than my quick post lol) then you can watch a quick video at the link below! (if using Instagram we recommend pushing them to the link in your bio) Dean Graziosi's Inner Circle I would love, love, love to have more of my friends and family members on this journey towards our better lives. I sure have loved mine so far! So come check it out! I can\u2019t wait for next month\u2019s hangout :) Dean Graziosi's Inner Circle ",

While most of us seek to improve ourselves in various ways each day, a conscientious personal development plan is the key to accelerating that growth, because personal development allows you to push yourself further and faster. According to Coaching Positive Performance, there are 6 benefits of Personal Development:  It helps you become more self-aware \u2013 you get to know who you are \u2013 your values, beliefs and the purpose you wish to pursue. This is the first key step in the personal development process. When you are chasing your own goals, there is as much pleasure to be derived from the journey as there is to be derived from reaching your destination.It gives you a sense of direction and makes you more clear on what you want to achieve and it also makes the decision making process easier. You can focus on doing the things that take you towards achieving your objectives.Personal development brings clarity. Even with an improved sense of direction, there will always be multiple tasks looking for your attention. As your personal development improves, prioritisation becomes much easier. You are clearer on your objectives and you can quickly identify which task will give you the best result with the resources available to you at that moment.You will become more motivated. When you know what you want to achieve, it is easier for you to see the benefits of taking action. Even when the task ahead is not enjoyable; if you can see a clear benefit, you are more motivated to take the necessary action.It gives you greater resilience. There will be tough times ahead but the personal development process gives you the confidence and resilience to deal with these better.More fulfilling relationships. You will be able to see which relationships are worth investing time in and you will develop the skills to make the most of these relationships thereby making a more positive impact on your life.",
