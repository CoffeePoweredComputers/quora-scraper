            "answer_text": "This may be a bit long, bear with me!! Well not everyone does say that all their preparation \u201chard work\u201d went all in vain at exam time, but yes their is some truth in every scenario The JEE exam is based on knowledge, presence of mind, hard work and intelligence (which if you have then the above three would work exponentially, else just intelligence is not enough). But their is a certain factor called luck or chance that people sometimes put too much attention on, or tend to ignore totally. That's where the problem lies. Neither luck would just pass you JEE, without the above characteristics nor luck would be responsible for failure. It has a very small part, and can be overcome with increasing effort on the above traits. But sometimes even after doing everything right, on the exam day things go wrong, sometimes it's health or your confidence level somewhat hinders your judgement at that crucial stage. I have myself experienced this 'chance' factor that despite having done everything right, it didn't result as expected or deserved. I have a friend who joined a reputed coaching in 11th for 2013 IIT JEE. He is excellent in studies, among the top in class, pretty much into science thus perfect for the examination. He was amongst the top 100 and top 10 sometimes in the all India exams and test series conducted by the institute. So his classmates, teachers and me everyone was sure this guy could get below 3000 for sure. But reverse happened, he got just below 6k. And students who were mostly below him in coaching exams scored higher than him. So one time unlucky. He tried again. Dropped the whole year, same studies, almost same and even better results in AITS. He got approx 900 rank in JEE mains, that was expected. But again in Advanced, his rank stayed near 4000. So he had to take a college much less than a boy of his knowledge deserves. So the reason of why this happened.. was it bad luck? I believe not\u2026. The next and most crucial component of success at such stages is CONFIDENCE.. The act of keeping your cool and focus. Sometimes even the most deserving students just because of disbelief in their capabilities or maybe due to losing confidence in face of some difficult questions, are unable to perform upto their full extent. That is the quality which can be decisive in face of tough competition and problems. That along with all the traits I mentioned above. Only luck can't take you anywhere. But trust in yourself and hard work can. Sometimes when people don't get what they desire, even if they are fully able for that, the best option is to move on. To lament or make excuses such as \u2018 the study and hard work went in vain' is of no use as KNOWLEDGE AND HARD WORK NEVER GOES IN VAIN, NEVER GETS WASTE. You may not get the result at desired time, but you will in some form that's certain. And this is the 'luck' or 'fate' I believe in. Knowledge and hard work will pay off, just never lose hope. Go on. \u2018Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever ends' -Shawshank Redemption P.S. and about my friend.. he is just excelling in his branch and college, along with extra curriculars and his studies and dedication of all those years, are bearing fruits now. And that is the example of what I just explained. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Studying for the esteemed exam in India requires smart work along with hardwork.Students need to practice a lot. For eg,if you start your coaching for these exams ,it starts in april i suppose. Students take time to settle in new place( the place where they are taking their coaching) so the chapters done early are not understood by majority of students. So, to have an edge make sure you\u2019ve studied the early chapters of +1 and last chapters with full concentration. This can be one of the smart work you need to do along with hard work. You need to know which sitting position suits you the most while attempting the exam(it matters a lot,think about it). These things will fetch you additional 5\u20136 questions for sure and that will make alot of difference. Do hard work but with some intelligence. If you were honest with your work ,if it didn't pay off now,it surely will . Life doesn\u2019t depends ALL on that 3 hour exam.JEE not only tests your skills, it demands attention and honesty. Majority of students get panic in due course of exam either due to lack of confidence or lack of practice and eventually the quote comes out as\u201dIt all went into vain\u201d. So be strong and practice honestly. You will surely win the contest with flying colours. All the best. ",
