            "answer_text": "If I\u2019m in the 8th grade and I fail one class, will I have to repeat? That question is all over Quora, asked and answered over and over. I understand the stress and anxiety, but the answer remains the same\u2014- It is highly unlikely that failing one class in eight grade will lead to your being required to repeat the grade. Middle schoolers are simply not held back for one class in hardly any school district. Once you go to high school, it doesn\u2019t matter how many classes you fail, you do not repeat an entire grade\u2014BUT you must repeat any failed class before you graduate; if you haven\u2019t passed all the required classes and elective credits by the time you are a senior, you become a fifth year senion. The only condition in which i it is likely that you would have to repeat a failed 8th grade class is if it is a class that is a pre-requisite for a high school class\u2014-Algebra 1 as the pre-req for geometry, for example. In that instance, if you failed such a class, you would almost certainly have to repeat the class\u2014-but at the high school, not at the middle school. What you really, really must do is remember that your counselor is your friend and ask these questions of the people in your individual school, because every school has different policies (and, yes, they can legally all have different policies) and nobody on social media can give you a firm answer. All we can do is what I just did\u2014-tell you what is the norm in most schools, and I am limited to information from the ten to fifteen schools in ten districts and five states in which I have taught.\\ Good luck! But talk to that counselor, and the teacher, via email if necessary! ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a concerning question without much information. As a general rule, the overall picture must be considered. Are your other grades all A\u2019\u2019s & B\u2019s? Or are the others Cs - D\u2019s? If you are not grasping the 8th- grade work level overall, a conference is usually set up between, yourself, your parents, the teachers and an administrator to determine if you are academically prepared for High School or if there is an emotional or maturity issue affecting your progress. High Shcool is not a do-over of Middle School. You would be starting fresh, however, your class placement is determining by the grades and classes that you took in Middle School. Perhaps its time for an honest conversation with your parents and your school counselor to express your desire to move forward and ask what it will take to get you there. Good luck. ",
