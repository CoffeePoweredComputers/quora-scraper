            "answer_text": "In general, and here\u2019s the rub, it depends on how you get to free. If you have a system with tuition and a generous system of need based aid it can make more space as there\u2019s new capacity created based on increased enrollments. A university has an incentive to add more seats. If you get to free through eliminating tuition you create a certain degree of instability as your budget comes purely through one source that\u2019s generally tied a a given enrollment capacity. For this reason the formerly free and open admissions City College of New York instituted admissions standards in response to the Great Depression when enrollment surged. This led it to be harder to get into City College than NYU for a few decades until 1975 when tuition was imposed and a more generous admissions policy was put in place. In schools like the University of Puerto Rico it had a similar effect, as well as in France where a free system of the Grandes Ecoles led to the development of a tuition based system primarily for the upper classes who couldn\u2019t get in but that also led to a general collapse of funding for the universities. Free sounds good, and it can work, but it requires a certain social compact to properly fund it. The GI Bill is a good example of a setup that provided what was for all practical purposes a free education with high enrollment and growth. The veterans got a \u201cfree\u201d education, the universities got increased enrollment and the rest of the public got a reasonable tuition bill. Of course it wasn\u2019t \u201cfree\u2019 as the veterans did consider it an earned benefit but the thing to keep in mind it didn\u2019t matter if you spent your service as a supply clerk at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne or were slogging through the surf at Omaha Beach. You go where Uncle Sam tells you when you enlist or get drafted and there should be no distinction in the benefit but in the context of this question generous aid and tuition is probably preferable to simply free if you have the goal to also increase capacity. Another aspect of the GI Bill is that it was somewhat agnostic when it came to what school the student attended. The benefit worked the same pretty much at a private school as a public school so it didn't lead to other inequities. Free should be the practical goal so students don't graduate with debt, but that\u2019s a different consideration and again that gets to how you actually get to free, not what the stated charges are. Scholarships are fine. So is generous need based aid and so is offloading half of the credits for a bachelors degree to relatively inexpensive community colleges and regional state colleges that have a relatively open admissions policy and that can in fact be for all intents and purposes free. Minimizing debt while increasing the number of people getting educated has a very real, practical outcome. The GI Bill created the best educated workforce in our history that went on to build the best economy in history where the typical GI, a first generation college student, went on to buy a house, multiple automobiles and take regular vacations. Today their grandchildren, saddled with debt, are well educated but have to defer making decisions that contribute to the real economy. No house, car or vacation. Getting to what can be considered an expansive, open and high capacity system of higher education that is as inexpensive as possible to the student is a good thing for everyone. How we get there isn\u2019t going to be simply by making it free but rather by finding a way to get to that by other means. Market bases solutions don\u2019t work all that well as we can see from student loans as well as the arms race you have when colleges compete for enrollment. It just makes the whole system more expensive and doesn\u2019t focus on actual outcomes. If you want to know why our educational system is the most expensive in the world with rather mediocre undergraduate outcomes blame U.S. News and World Report. Current proposals to make community college free might be a good start to getting there but we can look to France, Italy, Puerto Rico and California as well as our postwar experience for hints on how to get to an optimal system.

            "answer_text": "This is one of the big flaws in the thinking of former president Obama in pushing his free community college idea while trying to kill off the for-profit schools. For-profit schools became very appealing to the public for a number of reasons including overcrowding at community colleges. Students in many community colleges found it difficult to impossible to complete their studies on time or possibly ever if the courses they needed were filled or not offered at a time that worked for them. Now if you make those courses free to all comers, you get a flood of additional people, many of whom aren\u2019t very committed to their studies because\u2026 it\u2019s free. So what happens if something like nursing courses have lots of students in them who say \u201cI have no intention of becoming a nurse, I just thought it would be fun to take some courses?\u201d Well, for one thing, students who actually want to be nurses are kept out of the class once it\u2019s filled.

            "answer_text": "A2A. Does free education make more space in colleges available? Tuition and fees paid by taxpayers does not make more space in universities/colleges. The public universities are subsidized by taxpayers, and to this day, there is a limited of student openings in them. You have a supply and demand problem, and politically when the GI Bill paid universities and not students, the private universities/colleges lobbied Congress to change payments to be made directly to the veterans.
