            "answer_text": "Well, you are asking a question which can be answered in several ways. you have to be specific about what you have, what you want and what you need in IT. I am assuming jobs in IT. Let me give you a basic - very high level example. IT - > 1. Hardware (HW) 2. Software (SW) Under 1. HW (a big ocean) a. Intel platform (Desktops/laptops/Servers etc) - these are CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) based computing b. Others - Apple Mac, IBM mainframe (Apple Desktops / servers/ IBM Servers) etc - These are RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) based computing & c. there is the other which is called Non-Stop Servers which are in between these two computing (RISC & CISC) for high availability. these are used in Banks / ATM\u2019s etc. Then comes Storage/Datacenter/Networking and the list goes on\u2026 you have design, sales, pre-sales, support opportunities in each and every line above. 2. SW this is another big ocean under this you have Operating system (OS) /Applications (Front end and back end) under OS you have Windows/iOS/Unix/Linux/AIX/and lot of free-wares like Ubuntu CentOS etc. Under Apps you have DB\u2019s (Oracle/SQL/DB2 etc), Web based (Dot net/Java etc, mobile apps, email (exchange & Lotus Domino major players), middle-ware and more.. you have design, sales, pre-sales, support opportunities in each and every line above same as HW And then you have BPO/call-centers (Voice and Non-Voice) PS: The above points are very very high level, and I can talk about this for a full day :-) And for all the above you need minimum one or two years of experience & good communication skills - based on your experience and background you can jump into any of the fields mentioned above. Now if you can ask more specifically on what you need and where you stand I will try to help. :-) hope this also helps.. Cheers!!! ",
