Suppose you want to purchase something to give your friend as a gift it means you will purchase something and will have to pay the price (cost + profit) to the shopkeeper but you will give it to your friend without taking anything in return\u2026. So simply the shopkeeper will charge you the cost but you will not charge anything to your friend\u2026. It means the right word for \u0928\u093f\u0936\u0941\u0932\u094d\u0915 is \u201cFREE OF CHARGE\u201d\u2026. Everything has a cost but charging for it or giving it free is totally depends on the owner\u2026. Hope it will help you\u2026. ",
