            "answer_text": "I recommend starting with Microeconomics. If you read the book \u201cIndustry Organisation\u201d by Jean Tirole, you will look at industry analysis in a different way. Basically, the book will teach you about how companies in different industries compete with each other. One of the key insights that is very applicable to real life is about two-sided markets. Two-sided markets explain how Google, Facebook, and eBay do businesses. It also shed light on how they compete with each other. Follow me for more answers on investing and economics. ",
