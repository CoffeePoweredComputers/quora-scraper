In our batch 60 students were enrolled from our NIOS study center but only 6 students passed in all subjects in NIOS and out of those only 3 students manage to get first division and scored 70% + marks \u2026 so you have to write fully correct answers in nios to get marks if you try to fool your teachers by writing anything not related to that question then they will give you direct 0 in that answer\u2026 Try to write precisely and point wise answers\u2026. for any other doubt and query related to nios inbox me either in quora or in my hangout id(rocksadityakumar@gmail.com) HAPPY QUORAing\u2026.
