            "answer_text": "I teach writing. When I taught high school, grading was easy. It didn\u2019t take long. That\u2019s because I usually had all the students in at least two classes. We went slowly, doing a little of an essay per day. I was able to get almost all the grading done during my prep period. For a writing teacher, teaching college is hard. I have taught at the university level for 36 years. Back in the day, when I went to college, a professor scribbled a sentence or two on the paper and slapped on the grade. Now, we go through it line by line. In fact, I make a video as I go. It takes 30 to 75 minutes per paper. Incredibly time-consuming. Moreover, universities have changed. Most schools have gone to a business model from an education model. It means that almost anyone can walk through the door, regardless of how underprepared they are. To make matters even more difficult, I need to go political for a moment. AOC has said that this is the most educated generation. It shows how poorly she is educated. Almost none of my students know even the most basic geography. I am not being hyperbolic here: I have students who think the continent south of Europe is South America. I am currently teaching at an American university in Germany, so all the students live here, but they do not know where Switzerland or Spain is. They do not know when WWII was fought, even though some of the most terrible battles took place where they live. One student could not subtract 10 from 12. A third of the freshmen in my composition course could not multiply 7 X 7. No, I am not kidding. Nor is the problem just here. In the States, I taught at the U of Alaska, U of Montana, U of Oregon, and at an excellent college in Iowa. I became so frustrated with the lack of knowledge that, with my dean\u2019s blessing, we ran a test of basic knowledge. I made up a test that was so easy that I figured no one would get more than 2\u20133 incorrect. It was supposed to be a fun test. I asked questions like Who came first, Jesus or Neanderthal Man? Martin Luther or Martin Luther King Jr.? When was WWI fought (followed by dates from different centuries). What state is Denver in? When was the Declaration of Independence signed? And so on. There were 78 questions. One student missed 70. I didn\u2019t even think that was possible. The LEAST amount missed was 27. And over a third of the students were their school\u2019s valedictorians or salutatorians. An educated populace, not oil or coal or natural gas or technology, is our number one natural resource. And yet young people with this kind of knowledge base are on the streets screaming \u201cFascist!\u201d They seem to have zero idea what it means. I doubt any of them can name the major people of WWII. It\u2019s scary. I fear for America\u2019s future. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I'm an 8th grade math teacher but teach high school credit Algebra 1 also.  How long it takes to grade papers depends on many things: the subject, the assignment (or assessment), the teacher and the teacher's purpose of the assignment, specific time in the school year that is more busy, etc. So, you may want to edit your question to specify. And even then, an average time will most likely be an arbitrary figure. However, I'll give you an example from my perspective. With quizzes and tests that I give to my high school Algebra kids, it is an assessment. Therefore, I'm assessing what they know and have retained from my teaching and the quicker the turnaround from my grading, the better for everyone. I get a gauge of who is learning, who is not, and whether I need to reteach certain concepts, then re-test if necessary. If students get quick feedback (grades) I feel they learn more and are also more motivated to do better if necessary. Some teachers wait 2-3 weeks before grading tests and that is crazy to me, but different subjects do call for different measures. If my students take a test and I haven't given it back to them before a week, I'm slipping.  For a class of 20-30, it will take me an hour or more to grade Algebra tests, maybe longer because I do not give multiple choice tests and I painstakingly look over every question and also give partial credit. I grade based on their ability to do, not guess. ",

            "answer_text": "Just grading usually doesn't take that long. Multiple choice questions and short answer questions take little time at all - maybe 20 questions per minute for multiple choice, and about half that for short answer questions. Essays and other open-ended questions take a bit longer, but even they can be accurately graded at about 2-3 minutes per page, assuming the teacher uses a rubric which has 3-5 criteria (which most teachers do). However, (good) teachers tend to take much longer than this, as they also spend time identifying areas which students struggled both individually and collectively, providing specific and constructive written feedback, and thinking of ways to adapt their own teaching going forward based on how their students performed. I would say that these tasks take at least twice as long, if not longer. (Which they should! Grading itself does little at all to actually help students learn, but effective feedback is one of the hallmarks of a great teacher). So how long does it take to grade? It depends on the task being graded and number of students, but generally not too long. It's the other aspects which take the lion's share of the time teachers spend looking at student work. ",
