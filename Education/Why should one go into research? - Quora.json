            "answer_text": "Anyone who envisions research as groundbreaking work that will change the world, and wants to be a part of it, should strongly reconsider pursuing this path. Doing research is a job, just like any other. Most of the times it is frustrating, leads nowhere and fails miserably. You have to deal with bureaucracy and with people who are not even close to understanding why your work is relevant (sometimes not even you will know), but still you have to tolerate them because you need money for funding. On the other hand, it is extremely gratifying when things work out, but that's hardly an Eureka! moment, it's more like \"finally you motherf*cker son of a b****\". The right reason to do research, in my opinion, is an excrutiating hunger for challenges (even the most boring ones) and the unavoidable failures that come with them. Anyone who considers doing research should understand that results do not come as fast as products in companies, and that the road is arduous. The person should enjoy thinking about and solving problems even when they are not (officially) working, and in the most unconventional times. Anyone who does research is constantly thinking about her/his work, even unwillingly.  The good part is that you are always learning something new, you are always in touch with people who are much smarter than you are, and sometimes you produce something relevant that is used by others, which is actually pretty cool.

            "answer_text": "Do you have a subject you want to spend more time on? Digging deeper into the why or how of something?  Exploring new approaches or directions? Bringing forward new ideas/applications?   That is what research is about. Do you have professors inviting you to work with them or suggesting you should work further on a subject?  Those are some ways to make the decision.   One challenge can be finding funding for your work, and what happens if the results are what was not expected?  Or you hit a dead end,  or someone else comes up with a solution you were working towards?  All of these can happen, but the trade-off is the opportunity to pursue an area of interest. Question you need to answer is what do you want to do. ",
