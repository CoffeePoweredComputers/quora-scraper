            "answer_text": "I completed my graduation from AIIMS RAIPUR,so naturally my inclination will be towards Raipur AIIMS,but as a person who has been to AIIMS Rishikesh as well,I can definitely assure you AIIMS Raipur is far better. 1.Faculty wise both institutes have almost the most elite Professors,so there is no need of comparisons of any sort in these premier institutes. 2. Department wise I think more established is AIIMS Rishikesh since more number of PG seats (even though some have been revoked) 3.Campus:AIIMS Raipur is having a bigger campus compared to Rishikesh 4.Neighbourhood: AIIMS RAIPUR is a part of the capital Raipur which is one of the fastest industrially growing cities. You name a thing ,you will get it here. From Marriot to Nukkad,has 5 malls in the city ,which is also an integral part of the academics because part of your life will be outside the college as well. But Raipur is one of the most polluted cities in the country. Traffic is a big hindrace. Rishikesh is bestowed with nature and natural beauty but lacks a proper town planning,you are in an outskirt place,I couldn't even find a medical store opposite to a college of national importance .But it is just 1 hour from Dehra Dun the capital city and 5 hrs from Delhi NCR. 5.FREEDOM: Before joining a college one should be aware of the amount of freedom a college owes to you. Raipur:Strict, yet considerate. Rishikesh:Students were standing infront of the Director\u2019s Bungalow for basic human rights like not cutting electric supply to hostel during college hours. If you are a party loving, non vegetarian who loves the hustle of traffic and vibes of a city then Raipur it is. If your home is close to Uttarakhand,mainly from HIMACHAL,PUNJAB,HARYANA or DELHI NCR who is cold tolerant,nature loving, peaceful guy- its Rishikesh. ",

            "answer_text": "As I am in aiims rishikesh. So, I can tell u about my institution. If someone is eating gulabjamun how could he or she tell about other sweets. But,yeah there r many students here who have left aiims Patna even they r from bihar itself and choosed aiims rishikesh. 1.So,the most important thing is that pg seats are maximum here(116)while in other new aiims it is not more than 40. 2. Secondly, the environment here is awesome. Hathnikund bairaz is here in front of aiims and mountains the view is really soothing. The location matters because u have to spend ur 5and half year after all. 3.And don't worry about the academics. All professors are fab in their work. Faculty is really supportive. I feel myself blessed to be here. 4.I would suggest u to choose the one which is closer to ur home. Anyways, it's all upto u. Make a decision that suits u. And thanks for bearing my answer. ",
