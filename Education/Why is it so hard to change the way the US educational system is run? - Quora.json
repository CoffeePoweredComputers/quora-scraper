            "answer_text": "The elites recognize programs over personnel as the route to success. This has been going on for decades now. Just read any literature by Carol Tomlinson, or other researchers, who have been touted to us teachers for decades as the standard-bearer for all things quality in teaching children. While many of their techniques do have merit (in controlled laboratory-esque settings), it\u2019s about the numbers, folks. There are at least 25 children per teacher in any primary or intermediate classroom, and more likely, the number reaches above 30. At a minimum, teachers are expected to do the following in order to get a favorable review:differentiate instruction and assessment for every pupil;work individually with students, based on how formative assessment dictates the need;document everything in the school\u2019s official online system.(Since it is not possible to do all of the above, a and b are often fabricated in the process of performing c, which is the only one of these three items that actually matters to a teacher\u2019s performance evaluation. See #2.) 2. The current teacher evaluation system does not reward quality teaching; it rewards documentation and the appearance of quality teaching. Getting rid of this phony system within the framework of how public school districts actually operate is nigh-on impossible. That means that how education occurs in our country also cannot be seriously addressed. The elites don\u2019t want things to change, because then, the money that follows these ineffective programs and phony evaluation systems would disappear or be reallocated. And, if you don\u2019t need a program or a convoluted evaluation system, you also don\u2019t need someone to administer it. This was the short answer. If you want the less abridged version that includes a solution to our failing public education system, read on:  As in any situation in need of a solution, analyzing reality is the key. If you want to know what really happens in our schools, visit the classrooms without an appointment. What you\u2019ll notice is that there are too many children and too many needs for one adult to successfully handle. Those students who are already proficient or even close to proficient work independently while the teacher struggles with the few or many who need help. What this means is that the intellectually-abled are hardly ever challenged. Here\u2019s a solution that combats the numbers game: Limit class sizes to 20.Hire three adults per classroom, ideally one master teacher, one beginning or intermediate teacher, and one aide. The three people will keep each other informed and on the right track as they work together for the good of their students. This ratio should be implemented kindergarten through middle school.The master teacher is the one in charge, but the others act as a sort of checks-and-balances system. True collaboration is the key, not the masquerade called collaboration seen now in many educational venues. These three teachers will meet daily to discuss planning and achievement, and exchange who works with whom periodically, so that all children receive the benefit of all adults.Grading will be better addressed, meaning that each piece of work completed by a student gets a thorough going-over, rather than the seconds worth of eye-balling that happens now. And even more preferable, rather than grading papers after school only, many can be reviewed with the student during the actual teaching day.Make the teacher/aide workday 8 1/2 hours. A workday that starts at 8:00 can end at 4:30 under this system. Make it possible to get everything done during this time so that teachers do not take work home with them. The first half hour is devoted to planning; students begin at 8:30 and leave at 3:00. Teachers then meet about how their students did that day and who needs remediation, grade papers together, and do long-term planning with the time remaining on their own school day. Morale improves because home time truly becomes family time. This increase in morale will transfer back to the students in the classroom. (This option will not be popular with some, possibly many, teachers, or their unions, but, given that there are now three adults sharing the load, building in collaboration time is key to their success.Reduce pointless meetings and professional development. Eliminating highly-paid trainers for teacher improvement puts millions back into the district\u2019s budget. There are lots of resources available online, and teachers who wish to improve their techniques will seek out PD as a team. While this may seem counter-intuitive to those outside the profession, professional development imposed on teachers without their invitation is doomed to failure. Just ask any teacher in an anonymous survey. While they may sit respectfully through the enterprise, they are often resentful at the intrusion on their professional time and participate in a going-though-the-motions way only. It becomes a wasted hour, and can destroy morale. Try to imagine being told in your job that you need to improve something that appears not to need improvement. How likely are you to take it seriously?But as Matthew Bates asserted, no one in authority actually wants change. They just want the dollars that promising change nets them. In the interest of full transparency and honesty, I must point out that it is not only the elites who balk at change, however. Most teachers intuitively KNOW that things cannot continue as they have in public education. Not if we want to actually educate our children. But they aren\u2019t willing to change how they view the classroom setting. Teachers do not want to give up the sacro-sanctity of their private realms. Sharing their classrooms as a triumvirate will not appeal to most of them, but that bias is to their detriment. Non-teaching requirements will only get more onerous in the future, as politicians continue their knee-jerk reaction to abysmal test scores. That knee-jerk reaction has led to our current teacher evaluation system, in which it has become more important to document teaching tasks and their supposed outcomes than to actually perform those tasks. * Let that sink in for awhile. * Official test scores have become almost an aside: if one has documented that one worked with a kid three times a week on such-and-such with superb results, that is the bottom line. There is no arguing with documentation. The elites have made that clear, and they reward teachers handsomely for their compliance with a favorable evaluation. For more on this evaluation system that promotes fraud among teachers, read my book, an expose written under the guise of a novel. The fact that effective teaching has become so difficult under current circumstances is exactly why we need a monumental shift in the way we view education. It will take a huge public outcry to make that happen. Those without school-age children are not exempt from this. An educated populace is an essential element of a republic based on democratic principals, after all.  Edit, 11/11/2019: In response to the comment objecting to my use of the term \u201celites\u201d as a way to absolve the taxpaying and voting public of their responsibility in this mess we call public education, I\u2019d like to clarify: My final paragraph states that I do believe we, the public, have the ultimate power and responsibility to make changes. That is what I meant by a \u201chuge public outcry\u201d. The problem is that most people not in the business of education apparently do not understand what the underlying issues are, so they don\u2019t know how to vote or what to insist on. That is why I wrote my book and am working on a nonfiction follow-up to it, and why I wrote this post as an answer to a very good question. I used the term \u201celites\u201d to refer to those who make the rules that the rest of us must follow, i.e., the bureaucrats at the district and state levels, the researchers who come up with \u201cBest Practices\u201d, and the politicians who make education policy without considering unintended consequences (or knowing much about the realities in the trenches). Elite seems like a pretty good way to describe people who live outside the horrible system they have created for others. ",

            "answer_text": "Two words \u201cincentives\u201d and \u201centrenchment\u201d. If you examine the \u201cprices\u201d of goods and services over the years, you will see that where there is competition in the market place, there are incentives to become more efficient at delivering a product or a service. Where there is cronyism (protection by political and bureaucratic forces) prices keep rising and faster than inflation (education costs have risen far faster than inflation along with a lowering of quality). K-12 level in the US is mostly \u201cfree\u201d (paid through local and state taxes, real estate taxes) so it is a bit more difficult to evaluate \u201ccosts\u201d - though what you find is that many systems are jobs programs for many people with fewer and fewer resources going to those that can actually teach and know the subject matter (OK, a bit of an exaggeration, but true nevertheless, IMO). At the college level, institutions know that students can get loans - so they keep raising costs even as most of the expenditure goes to most everything other than education - hence the depreciation on the value of a degree even as salaries/benefits/bonuses for administration keeps rising every year, faster than inflation. So to change things, one has to change the incentives and open up the system to competitions - and yes, let me add one more word \u201caccreditation\u201d that prevents new ideas from taking ground. There is nothing magical or wonderful about being \u201caccredited\u201d really - but sure there are diploma mills we need to worry about - and there are lots of ways to do that instead of simply looking for \u201caccredited\u201d.
