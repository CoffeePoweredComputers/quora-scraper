            "answer_text": "It truly depends on the country. For Korea, a standard opening offer for a brand new teacher is 2.1 million won ($1,770 USD) a month, with housing, insurance, and one-way flight reimbursement as part of the contract. Cost of living can vary depending on the city/area you\u2019re in, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s comparable to living in a mid-tier city in the US, but with much better public transportation. However, if you\u2019re experienced you can easily negotiate up. I\u2019ve heard (and seen on job listings) that you can make much more in China, as there\u2019s more demand and less teachers. Other countries (like Vietnam or Thailand) may appear to offer much less, but the cost of living is significantly lower so there isn\u2019t that much of a difference. Also, if you are a certified teacher then you could land a job in an international school, which will give you the most benefits, vacation time, and the most comfortable wage. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I am considering going to teach English in January 2020. Here is my background: Canadian 7 years of post-secondary (college and university) B.A in Communication Studies. Certificate- TESOL 20 years- experience in management, entertainment, media production, festival/events. Ideally would love to teach in Shenzen, as it\u2019s closer to Hong Kong and I am assuming less expensive than Beijing? Questions: 1- What are some reputable companies to apply to that pay well there, or here? 2- I have been offered the following to teach in Beijing, what are your thoughts? The following has been offered from English First: CNY 12,350 Paid on a 12 month/year basis. Regular, on-going performance appraisals will determine a monthly performance payment of up to CNY 1,800 (paid from the 7th month onwards). Annual flight allowance of CNY 8,000 is paid monthly at CNY 667 per month. This allowance will be paid with monthly salary and is subject to income tax. Please answer the aforementioned. I will be forever grateful. ",
