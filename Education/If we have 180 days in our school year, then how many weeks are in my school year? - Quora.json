            "answer_text": "The typical school year is 36 weeks for the students. This will usually be spread over about 39\u201340 weeks, because of days teachers have that are the non-instructional days and not every week is a straight Monday -Friday arrangements. There are holidays, and other reasons why school is out, such as usually Christmas break will be two weeks, but will start and stop based on what day Christmas and New Years Day are on the calendar that year. Spring break, and fall break, in schools that have these will be about a week or at least three days. Then, there are days that teacher work, prior to the opening and closing of the school year. I have worked in systems where there was a day or at least a half day that is at the at the end of each quarter, which is usually a day for entering grades, closing the quarter and preparing for the next quarter. Some places in the state where I live have days off at the time of State Teacher\u2019s Convention. ",
