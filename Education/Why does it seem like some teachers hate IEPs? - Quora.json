            "answer_text": "When I was teaching, I wouldn't say I hated IEP's exactly. But, like other paperwork, what was supposed to be a tool in providing for the educational goals of a special needs student became this monumental task of bureaucracy. Each year, we'd have a special training inservice on how to complete the form accurately because there were always changes, many if which seemed absolutely non-sensical. It was impossible to complete the form and be in compliance with the process required in creating it. Those who made the rules weren't the ones having to implement them. For instance, any given year I had maybe 18 students and a few might have been due for 3 year evaluations. If the psychologist wasn't on top of her caseload, mine might be delayed, so I'd have to conduct an IEP meeting just to keep up to date. Another would be held then once the evaluation was finally completed by the psychologist. Most of my students received some sort of auxillary services like social work, physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech therapy. Usually that staff served multiple schools. It would be my responsibility to coordinate those staff, plus the gym or art teacher, any other teachers involved in mainstreaming, a member of administration and the parents. Sometimes foster care agencies were involved as well. There were no times set aside to hold these meetings and they could be held anytime throughout the year. There was no coverage available for staff to be at these meetings. I could use my planning periods, but it was impossible to accomodate the schedules of every person that was supposed to be involved. At one point years before, there was an IEP day set aside in April to complete this process. A lawsuit by a group of parents determined that special education students were losing educational time and that it was a violation of their rights. So the meetings were held throughout the year, as they came due. If a new student came into my class from another district, I had 30 days to hold an IEP. If a student's IEP was done incorrectly from another teacher, I had to reconvene it to make the appropriate corrections. (There was one colleague of mine in particular from a nearby school, that if I got one of her kids transferred in, I knew I'd have to reconvene a meeting before I even read the paperwork because I knew something would be wrong --drove me crazy). Additionally, in holding a meeting, none of the paperwork was supposed to be filled out beforehand, except for basic demographics. An hour was supposed to be allotted for this process. Eventually the district caught up with technology and the ieps were on a computer program. Most of us didn't have the appropriate equipment, so meetings were held huddled around one screen. At my last school I had to be sure that my next door neighbor didn't use her fan, because if I tried to print out copies of the iep for parents, we'd blow a fuse. On more than one occassion, I'd have meetings scheduled and the whole system was down for whatever reason. Basically, IEPs were a colossal pain in the ass. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever read an IEP? I've rarely seen the intelligible IEP - the point of an IEP is to put into writing the longest list of accommodations possible - so that parents will sign it believing all the bases are covered - IEPS are essentially subterfuge. In the ideal world they would not be but in the real world IEPs ask the impossible. An IEP essentially asks that teachers give individual instruction to one student while teaching a group of students - it requires a teacher to be in two places at the same time but that a class of 25 students might have 8-10 IEPS so that the teacher is asked to be in 8-10 places at the same time they are to teach the rest of the class. And middle school and high school teachers can easily teach upwards of 100 students a day - and have 20-30 IEPed students in that 100. Here's a sample - - and if you hesitate to engage the length of this list - you'll have a sense of why teachers can shudder at IEPs - Charles will receive the following accommodations \u2022Listen to audio recordings instead of reading text (when? in class? at home? who provides the audio recordings? Are all the texts available in recordings?)\u2022Learn content from audiobooks, movies, videos and digital media instead of reading print versions (where do these alternatives come from and how they are to be provided to the student(s))?\u2022Work with fewer items per page or line and/or materials in a larger print size (if they work with fewer items per page when do they cover the rest of the material?)\u2022Have a designated reader (who is the reader to read aloud to this child?)\u2022Hear instructions orally\u2022Record a lesson, instead of taking notes\u2022Have another student share class notes with him - (which parents want their child sharing notes? Which children will work well with the IEP student?)\u2022Be given an outline of a lesson - which will then be crumpled up and shoved in the desk or placed in a notebook? \u2022Use visual presentations of verbal material, such as word webs and visual organizers (does the teacher provide this?)\u2022Be given a written list of instructions - provided by the teacher - Organization is a challenge for many students - the accommodations are not written with that in mind. Extra papers, written outlines, written lists only help when the student is able to organize the papers, place them in a binder and then refers to them later. Response accommodations allow a student to:\u2022Give responses in a form (oral or written) that\u2019s easier for him - (what does the rest of the class do while Charles answers his test questions orally?) \u2022Dictate answers to a scribe (who?) Setting accommodations allow a student to:\u2022Work or take a test in a different setting, such as a quiet room with few distractions\u2022Sit where he learns best (for example, near the teacher)\u2022Use special lighting or acoustics\u2022Take a test in small group setting\u2022Use sensory tools such as an exercise band that can be looped around a chair\u2019s legs (so fidgety kids can kick it and quietly get their energy out) Timing accommodations allow a student to:\u2022Take more time to complete a task or a test\u2022Have extra time to process oral information and directions\u2022Take frequent breaks, such as after completing a task Scheduling accommodations allow a student to:\u2022Take more time to complete a project\u2022Take a test in several timed sessions or over several days\u2022Take sections of a test in a different order\u2022Take a test at a specific time of day Organization skills accommodations allow a student to:\u2022Use an alarm to help with time management\u2022Mark texts with a highlighter\u2022Have help coordinating assignments in a book or planner\u2022Receive study skills instruction ....
