            "answer_text": "Greetings, Individual Educational Plans are not magic bullets. One of the frustrating parts of Special Education and Americans With Disabilities Act is that even though accommodations are required by law, they cannot give eyesight to the blind. Parents of special needs students are desperate for their children to given every opportunity to be like the \u201cnormal kids.\u201d In my career, my impression of special education staff was always positive. Not only were these colleagues talented instructors, they were well-versed in the relevant law, and were remarkably resourceful in devising effective strategies that resulted in striking achievement on the part of their students. In a sense, it is a good thing that any parent is dissatisfied with their child\u2019s progress regardless of their academic skills. Probably the best approach to dissatisfaction is to acknowledge that none of our students is progressing as well as we would wish, but that we are not about to give up, and will be willing to employ any reasonable strategy for every student to succeed. I always got a great deal of mileage by asking parents what works well for them on the home front. Over time, and our special needs students stayed with all of their teachers for three middle school years, we saw gratifying academic growth. In fact, real dissatisfaction appeared with the practices in high school. Parents wondered why the middle school had such success. I always responded that everyone enjoyed a secure sense of belonging, and that the special education students were enrolled with peers in general education classes whenever possible. Special education students were never segregated in a \u201cresource room.\u201d Students and teachers were not characterized as \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cregular,\u201d and that attitude was appreciated by all but a few whose prejudice was unattractively reflected. Late in my career, I went on record by declaring that I had a de-facto IEP for every student, because they all deserved one. Some of my colleagues thought I had taken leave of my senses, but parents and administrators really appreciated the concept. Regards, AJG ",
