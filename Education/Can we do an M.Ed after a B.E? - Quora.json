            "answer_text": "Hi No, you can\u2019t directly go for M. Ed after your B.E as eligibility for M. Ed in most of the top universities is pass with 50% aggregate marks in B. Ed. So you have to go for B. Ed first and then you can go for m. Ed. Eligibility for B.ed in most of the top universities is Pass with 55% aggregate marks in B.Tech. or B.E. with specialization in Science and Mathematics, rest it may vary with the university you choose. Benefits of doing B.ed are that you can work as: Secondary school teachers, Educational Counsellors, Educational Entrepreneurs, School Administrators, Free lancers, Free Lance Trainers, Instructional Designers etc. You must go for top universities such as: Lovely Professional university- Punjab, Lady Shriram College for Women (LSR) - Delhi, Hansraj College - Delhi, Loyola College - Chennai, St. Joseph's College of Commerce - Bangalore etc. I hope it helps.

Though the pay increase in the districts I have worked in is negligible for the amount of money and time required in this pursuit, as an educator, it is great to have the knowledge acquired through this degree. And it will make you much more marketable when looking for a job. ",
