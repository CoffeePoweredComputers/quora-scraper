University , its degree holding more value . The exposure you will get is outstanding , u are aware of the alumini of DU ? If not then search for it .

Wherein Amity is also Ok but it will cost you a bomb as compared to any other university. If you can get admission in DU that's awesome else you can go for Amity. ",
