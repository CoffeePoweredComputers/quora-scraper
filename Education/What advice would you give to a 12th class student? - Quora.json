            "answer_text": "You are a student of class 12th. Congratulation! You are a lucky person as you have the opportunity to earn knowledge, and not everyone is fortunate enough to have this opportunity. There are many young souls just like you who never seen themselves in school uniform in the mirror, they are totally unaware with the environment of temple of learning, they never enjoyed the experience of covering the academic books. So you always keep this in your mind that you are a lucky person.  Reader- Okay, Okay, enough philosophy. I already know all this, please answer the real question and give some advices for a class 12th student. Let's first see some reality. I am sure you don't need any introduction on importance of class 12th because nobody knows the value of class 12th better than you.You are aware that score of class 12th & respective entrance tests\u200b will decides\u200b your college and role of good college is huge in deciding your career.You know that everyone is waiting for your class 12th result and few have lots of expections from you.It is true that studing in the morning helps you. But I will advise you to practice atleast 5 minutes meditation, 15 minutes Yoga, 10 minutes exercise, 30 minutes rest, after wakeing up just before the sunrise and then open your book. I am not a big fan of studying just after wakeing up.Don't study continuously for more than 1 hour. And study not for your entrance test, study so that you can educate others.Play outdoor games in the evening atleast for 30 minutes or you can silently watch sunset.Smart Study is more important than hard work in current\u200b generation\u200b, so use Internet cleverly. Watch tutorials, Read interesting things. Share your knowledge and those so called FB friends and followers of Instagram will not help you in kissing the success. But social media can be very helpful if you use them perfectly.Eat healthy because health play a big role in motivating you and you know that motivation is vital in achieving something which you want.It is impossible to remember everything which you find in your Book or Internet so try to challenge yourself and you can do this by asking questions from your own self.Avoid sleeping in day time and spend handsome amount of time behind your hobby.Select friend wisely, and always keep this in your mind that there is no harm in not having any friends and if you have any friend then he/she is no one.Don't get addicted to Study or anything else.Sleep early if you want to follow the first point.(Note - These points will aid you only if you love your subjects which you have selected in class 12th and if you are studying something which you don't like and selected your stream due to family pressure or anything else then don't feel down because your\u200b life doens't end after 12th. New morning is waiting for you) And yes result of class 12th is not everything but this doesn't mean you should not Study. I accept that these points are not compulsory to score 120% in class 12th but I am sure that they will\u200b help you in keeping you happy till your last day. And if you want advice to score 120% in class 12th then I am sorry you requested this question to a poor man. Best of luck & Thank-you for A2A User-10426610282866700141 (User-12043543280645752578). Keep Smiling :) ",

            "answer_text": "1.DEFEAT YOURSELF  Keep defeating your previous percentage,your present has to be perfect than your past,in this way,you can achieve a good percentage in 12th exam. 2. Stick with NCERT books  Reference books are important but not more than NCERT books as they are base of any topic. So according to me you should not only read reference books,because you are preparing for class 12th,not to get selected in NASA. 3. Understand the concepts while studying:  Some students mug up theories without understanding the concepts. In this way, they are unable to answer a question asked in a different format. Therefore, it is essential to understand the concepts related to reasoning, mechanism, application, etc., to perform better in the exam. 4. Plan your schedule  Now, as you know your weak areas, your agenda should be to give extra time to tackle those difficult lessons and transform them to strong ones. Prepare a timetable to prioritise and take care of the important and weaker sections first. It helps you procrastinate less and gives you the freedom to plan your schedule the way you want. While you have allotted additional time to master those tricky subjects, do not ignore the other lessons. 5. Solve sample papers  Practice makes a man perfect. Keep Solving CBSE Sample papers each day. Pick a different subject for each day. After solving mark yourself according to the CBSE Marking Scheme. 6. Delete your all social accounts  I delete my social accounts one month before 12th board exam .Yes it has effects on our life specially on our concentration when we cut our social network. I did the same. After deleting my FB account I have much time for myself and can evaluate my strength and weakness to ensure better results but you can use clear your doubts or problem with your friends and teachers on WhatsApp. So let you control your mind rather a technology stuff does. 7. Avoid Exam Stress  The feel of nervousness and tension is very natural before and during the examinations. A little bit of tension is quite helpful as it propels us to put in the very best effort. For taking the mind off it, the best way is to indulge yourself in your hobbies. It is a stress free therapy. 8. Group Study  It is always good to study in a group, say once a week. It will help you get your doubts cleared by your friends who might know how to solve a particular question you find it hard to solve. Studying in a group also helps you validate your exam preparation and efforts.Say, you have left out some portion of the syllabus purposefully; your study group can tell you if it's a good idea to do so. Spending time with your friends will also help you feel refreshed. 9. Take care of your health  A lot of students end up feeling sick due to pressure, sleep deprivation and improper diet.Ensure that you have at least 7 hours of sound sleep everyday and have 4 healthy meals every day. Drink a glass of milk before going to bed in case you are facing trouble getting sound sleep. 10. Avoid discussing the exam with others  This will only increase your anxiety if you think that you did something wrong. Remember that the exam is over, you cannot do anything about it anymore, and no other student knows the marking memo. When I came out of Exam hall in 12th,the first thing I do is to tear my paper and tear the paper of person who said, Bhai is question ka Kya answer hai? Konsa article attempt kiya? After this,no friend came to me to discuss question paper.  Hope this will help you. ",
