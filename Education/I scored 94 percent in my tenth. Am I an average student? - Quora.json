            "answer_text": "It depends upon how you look at yourself. For many people getting 98% would be a far less than their expectations and it would make them consider themselves below average whereas there are people for whom getting over 60% marks would take them into \u2018genius\u2019 league among their friends. It depends on many aspects of life of an individual. If your teachers, relatives and friends circle have a notion that 94% would be an average marks, then what can I say to those thousands of government schools where getting over 70% has become a dream for millions of government school children. Isn't there getting 70% is the benchmark of being best for lakhs of those high school kids? Hence, it's only a matter of perception and generalisation of the people you are living with. Instead of getting affected by their unnecessary criticisms and comparisons, rather your emphasis should be on your satisfaction in studying and also your satisfaction in giving exams. Good luck Thank you for A2A ",

Look, nobody holds the right to rate you as average or topper or below average. It's you who define yourself and make you a better person. Gear up. You have scored almost 10% more than me, so you can make it to top colleges better. Peace, and never underestimate yourself. ",

I come across many students who struggle during 11\u201312th class despite scoring very good in 10th while there is no dearth of students who pick up like anything in class 11th. There is yet another very important aspect noticed among many students where some perform extraordinarily in competitive exams while others are very good in their boards. ",
