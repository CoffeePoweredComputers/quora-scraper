            "answer_text": "Different countries and languages use the terms differently. In the US, a college is an institution of higher education that only offers undergraduate degrees. A university offers graduate degrees. There is no \u201cfirst\u201d in the US because you can go to a university as an undergraduate. However, it\u2019s possible you might start out at a two or four-year college and then move on to graduate school at a university. In Spanish, all institutions of higher education are usually called universities and the word colegio, if used, refers to elementary school. In Arabic, all institutions of higher education are usually called universities and the word college refers to subunits in them such as the college of economics, or medicine. I\u2019m sure similar situations exist in other languages too. ",
