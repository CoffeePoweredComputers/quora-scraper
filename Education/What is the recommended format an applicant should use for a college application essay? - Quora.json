You don\u2019t have much choice about how it looks. It will automatically change your format to the one they accept.  Here is what CA says about formatting on their site:  Currently, paragraph breaks for your Common App personal essay will appear in the text box or the print preview of your application. Bold, underline, and italics will always carry over to Print Preview. Extra spaces will be removed automatically when you click continue. This means that you will not be able to indent your paragraphs. Colleges are aware of this formatting and take it into consideration when viewing your essay ",
