            "answer_text": "1. Know what actually matters. Be honest with yourself about the actions that truly move the needle in your business and your life. An 80/20 analysis is a great place to start. If you\u2019re stuck, just think of the tasks you fear the most\u2013that give you anxiety just to think about. Those are likely the most important.2. Pick your top 2-3 core tasks each day. These are the things that must happen no matter what. If you get these done your day is a success. Stick to no more than three, or better yet one. They must move you closer to your big goals. Checking email does not count.3. Do them first thing. For me writing is one of my core actions, so I write for an hour or so as soon as I roll out of bed or after my morning workout. The longer you wait, the more distractions will intrude. Nothing happens before these get done.4. Do not connect to anything until your core tasks are done. Don\u2019t convince yourself you need the internet or email to do your most important tasks. 95% of the time you don\u2019t. Leave the internet off and phone on airplane mode until you crush through the important.5. Kill multitasking. Stop thinking it\u2019s more efficient. It\u2019s not. No surfing during phone calls, reading during meals, chatting while writing. Do one thing at a time. Simple. Not only is multitasking terribly inefficient but it stresses you out and it\u2019s rude to anyone around you.6. Turn off email and notifications (and anything else that interrupts you). When you sit down to do something, nothing else gets attention. Just because someone decidesto email, chat or call you, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s more important. Those things can wait. But if you know they are waiting there, you\u2019ll be too tempted. Avoid temptation at all cost. We are too weak. I don\u2019t trust myself with email on my iPhone so I totally removed it.7. Don\u2019t check email in the morning. This is the most effective (and difficult) single practice I\u2019ve found. I know every one of you have heard this one. So why doesn\u2019t anyone actually do it? It will change your life. It feels terrible to know we\u2019ve spent a couple hours refreshing and going in and out of email without really getting anything done. I assure you that if you check it, you won\u2019t be able to help yourself, and you\u2019ll stumble face first into the worm hole. So don\u2019t even open it until you have a few hours of focused action under your belt (this is at least 11am for most).8. Batch your emailing to two times a day MAX. Maybe 30 min before lunch and 30 min late afternoon. If you need an email for your core task, do not go to your inbox. Go straight to the search feature and find it. If you need to write an email as a core task (which should very rarely be the case), write it offline in a simple program like notepad. Save reactionary items for after you get the important done.9. Try to get less done in a day\u2013practice Slow Working. Don\u2019t fill every moment of your calendar with tasks (this is a huge one I\u2019m working on). You\u2019ll be stressed and rushed the whole day. Slow down and move through your core tasks calmly. Then maybe you do a few more things with the remaining time but don\u2019t cram them in. If you do, you\u2019ll always feel behind.10. Plan more time for each task. This is the easiest way to alleviate the schedule. And things always tend to take longer than we think. If your core task will take you 45 minutes, then block out 90. Actually schedule it on your calendar. If it only takes you 40 minutes then suddenly you have free time\u2013how awesome (and rare) is that!11. Take breaks and reward yourself. Most of us can only intensely focus on something for an hour at best. Take at least a few-minute break every 30 or 60 minutes to clear your head. I love going up to my rooftop for a couple deep breaths. Find a fun way to get you free and clear. Take a walk, meditate, breathe, get a snack or some water or listen to an inspiring song you pick.

            "answer_text": "Our attention and our time are the most valuable things we have. Whatever we focus on, we give power to. To know what to focus on it is helpful to have an intention as to what you would like to achieve. If it\u2019s general life satisfaction you are after, focus should be placed in the following areas: Mindfulness- that is to be focused on our environment in the present moment through our senses. We miss our lives while being peoccupied with our inner dialogue.Generosity and kindness- The best satisfaction we feel is to be of service to others. Focus on finding opportunities to help and lift the spirits of your friends and family or even the community and in turn, yourself.Gratitude- It is illogical to waste our time thinking over all the bad things in life, especially when we feel powerless to change it. Focusing on things to be grateful for over feeling badly for things we are lacking is an essential part to building the foundations of a wholesome life.Awareness- That is to watch or to focus on how we percieve ourselves, the world around us and our relationship to it which gradually evolves as our understanding deepens. This perception of ourselves in relation to our environment helps us to mature emotionally. As its such a deep subject it would be futile for me to attempt to explain it in a paragraph so I encourage you to research this topic further.Learning or cultivating a craft- Focus on finding whatever it is that brings you joy which gives benefit to the world and dive into it.Focus on the journey over the destination- life is a beautiful dance once you know how.",

            "answer_text": "You think about others. When did you realize about it and why? If you twist your thinking in these small questions there is a chance to know the root cause to the query and if any good / bad effect resultant you have experienced. There are so many thoughts roaming in your mind which emerge from the discussion you hear even if those talks don\u2019t relate to you. Later your mind keeps searching on what they said and what you could have spoken. You think your speaking could have made a difference or why such a simple thing others can\u2019t understand. Just imagine if not exactly these words how simple thought is leading in self in a no end zone. Think it over. It is not only waste of energy but polluting mind that can sprout exactly right words when needed if we would have conserved energy and kept mind under control. We can never change others but certainly can change our self which you are missing the opportunity. What should be done? If you are introvert there could be desire to speak so remove inhibition and start speaking. May be very soon you would be aware that speaking doesn\u2019t really help and only adds pollution if we are unable to distinguish the right place to act. This could fulfill your desire and take you to the next step which you are preventing by your own choice. If you are extrovert then you could be feeling even after guiding so much others don\u2019t change. You think that you are only right but no one is ever right or wrong but the statement has specific meaning in particular moment which is best to suit. An intelligent mind knows it and person who wastes energy more in unwanted places keeps him deprived to rise to such state. Thus in either situation you need to rethink about yourself and try to control your mind for your own health and that can be done by understanding its effect on self when it degrades self in many ways. If we enjoying caring others we have to be in best of physical and mental health and in unwanted thinking we are restraining the opportunity useful in future someway for self or others and damaging our own ability.

            "answer_text": "When we lived during the epoch known as the Stone Age and life conditions were relentlessly harsh and dangerous, we focused on the immediacy of survival, and every sensory impression was a potential signal of life and death opportunities and threats to our existence. Now that we are living in life conditions of relative safety and great comfort, we have the ability to indulge in the luxury of choosing what to focus on, mainly for entertainment purposes because along with safety and comfort comes great boredom, an excruciatingly discomforting state of mind. We are safe, comfortable and miserable. If you want to experience the original state of mind that our minds were evolved to undergo 24/7, but only briefly of course because it is a mental state of great stress, just go hiking in some forested area populated with major, apex predators - unarmed, ok you can have a spear - and you will experience our primordial state of mind. You will not ask this question, what to focus on. Every sound, sight and smell will be of paramount importance to you. You will step more carefully because a twisted ankle means you cannot run from a predator. Now, sitting safely and comfortably in front of your computer screen reading these words, you can only conjure an imaginative version of such a real life experience. You are focused on reading these words; do you have a sense of choice in this matter? Your question implies there may be a choice, what to focus on. We focus on those signals which seem important; thus your question appears to be asking, what determines what seems important for us to focus (our attention) on. Context. What is the context in which you are experiencing your existence right now, for example? Your context is the relative safety and great comfort of your current life conditions, a context which allows you to come up with clever questions about focus and how to know what to focus (the attention) on.

There comes a time in our life when we find ourselves stuck in the middle losing ourselves. Throughout our lives we try to focus on many things like studies, relationship etc which obliviates our inner selves. It's going to be looooong so be prepared:-) Do not over-think. You already have your focus on yourself. What all you have to do is time your pleasures.Reward yourself a bit along with work like for example have chocolate while you are studying or buy yourselves some flowers, go out on a vacation, strip off and just dance( you can totally do that).Be grateful to the little graces of life, at the end of the day be thankful to whatever positive you are. Whatever you have created. Let me just tell you about my day, today I did not went straight to my coaching today I did something different I kissed my mother on her forehead though it was just a kiss but when I think about it, it is blue ribbon for me, just priceless and it became more amusing when she kissed me back. You can be grateful to the most beautiful smell you sniffed today or the most beautiful flower you saw today or the person you love in your live the most.Sorrow fears work, work work work so that you can be happy lately so that you grow each day so that sorrow can run away from your life.Laws of attraction, affirmations \u201cIt is the combination of thoughts and love which forms the irresistible force of laws of attraction.\u201d That quote in the picture is also a part of laws of attraction . https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.law-of-attraction-guide.com/daily-affirmation.html&ved=0ahUKEwjG4bW5uvXRAhUMpY8KHRASC0sQFggwMAI&usg=AFQjCNGd0zZ9yAdCYb-L66Frxgqd7Kc_5Q&sig2=kJR8ojp6ypwCgUgsv3NrTA . You can search in Pinterest too( a real good stuff is available there).Self-care wear your favourite dress today, the best colour, read a new book, take a walk, lay in the sunshine, hop over dew ladens, converse with little kids, notice their smiles.Adhere to positive people they will let you know a lot about life and if they start loving you trust me that's the best. Stay around with those you think love you, love every part of you love your good thoughts, love your humour, your flaws and adorn what you don't have.It was really important for me to write this. I am so thankful for this question. Never forget to smile and I give you support to sustain your life like many others who love you so dearly, just open your eyes and see how beautiful this world is and how it awaits for you to come and clutch its gems.

            "answer_text": "This is the most intersting and useful question i found today, There are many reasons for us to stop focusing on ourselves, and one the important reason is when we care too much about others and stop concentrating on ourselves, let\u2019s discuss about that\u2026. When we are way too much into others, sometimes we don\u2019t bother about ourselves. This is because our subconcious and concious mind will think about the particular person/incident for hours and it will make us awake all the night\u2026.. So even though we care about the person a lot we should follow certain things to keep focussed on oneself, it also keep us fit physically and mentally. We have to stop stalking the other person when they don\u2019t give importance to us, we shouldn\u2019t check their last seen, their updates in social media and stuffs, this will really keep us in distress.We have to concentrate on new things which we wish to pursue, it might be even very small thing but do it whatever your heart desires.Go on a short trip, it is the best way to get rid stress.Running/jogging/ Meditaion - universal way of approach.Stop bothering about other persons unless they love and care for us in the same way we do.Spend time with the people who are important to us, that will make us peaceful.We can focus on ourself when we realise \u201cWE CAN\u2019T CONTROL EVERYTHING\u201dGo on a random date.Be grateful and help others a lot, that will give us inner peace.WORKOUT - believe me, this is the best way to keep oneself focussed and engaged.So, stop worrying about others and spend time for yourself, you can help others and keep others happy and satisfied, importantly you have to keep yourself focussed and happy. Focussed and happy life :) ",

I say others not to bother about others. But I used to think a lot about others. About almost each and everything. I had a friend and we are not talking anymore. And I dwelled in a variety of thoughts. What I did wrong? Why is he not talking? What is going in his mind? I was worrying a lot that I was unable to sleep properly. I had irrational talks with myself. Lots of assumptions and all possible ifs and buts. And I needed the reminder\u2014 thinking a lot is ineffective. I could not control each and everything the way I want. The way I expect. I can only witness the happening and control how I respond to the happening. But this is not instant. It is not a magic. It is real. It is not easy. To work on it, I always needed to start with a small step. A small step like \u2014 Taking deep breaths. Reminders of priorities. Meditate. Gratitude practice. Sometimes you need to realize that you did it in past. And you can do it again. Isn\u2019t it Rahul? We can do this again. When you came up this far, you can keep moving and focus to accomplish your goals. You can do this again. Because you have a great company. A company of You. ",

            "answer_text": "It'll always be tough if you want to change yourself overnight , and by tough I meant impossible . Patience is the key :) At first when I began reading it seemed boring and didn't interest me at all . Writing a journal felt confusing as I was never used to pen down my feelings and thoughts . I had to force myself to eat healthy food . Exercising seemed tough due to aches and pain I got when I began . Tossing , turning , and changing sides on my bed every night when I hit the bed at 10pm as I was a night owl who slept at 2am. I wasn't habituated to be this productive in a single day at all . Changes seem awkward, dreary , unusual , forceful , unsettling , unfocused . I was able to pull up my motivation for 3 days and then I came back to 0 with my fractured motivation and focus . The remedy to focus on yourself is to learn a new habit per week , don't burden yourself with your own over expectations . So , I began reading and I read around 2 books in a week , by that time I didn't had to gather my focus or attention as it came naturally to me , and I read around 10 pages each day . Next to the prior week I limited junk food . Next scheduled my sleep . Next exercising . When you are busy with your own life , you won't have to search for motivation . You'll find motivation within you . Your focus will be you , you are your best motivator always . ",

            "answer_text": "Often, there are many demands on our time, and time is the limiting factor. In order to focus on yourself you must first carve out some time for yourself. The right amount of time to have for yourself varies from individual to individual and circumstance to circumstance. By being proactive, taking control of your calendar and making appointments with yourself to carve out the time to focus is the first step. Start with 15 minutes a day, and if that isn't enough, go to 30 minutes a day, and so on until you hit the balance that is right for you. After you've carved out the time, the next step is to decide what you want to spend it on. Is it to exercise? Is it to make a meal plan? Is it to develop a professional development plan?  Is it to take time to read or work on a hobby? Is it time to make phone calls or social media posts to friends and family?  Is it to look for a new job or figure out ways to do the current job better? Only you can answer the question of how you are going to spend that time. My challenge to you is that you spend it wisely.  If you don't know how, get some advice from someone you deeply respect. No matter what, get started and be disciplined in making sure you have enough time for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do you want to focus on others? Stop comparing your Life and start living It. I have learnt this from my past experience that comparing yourself to anybody is just a waste of time! Instead concentrate on yourself, how can you be better than what you were before. I remember i used to be so insecure so jealous of others. I did nothing but follow others, copy them! In this process i realized that i lost my own identity\u2026 Then i decided to be on my own. I would say that comparing yourself with others won\u2019t do any good to you. They are going to do what they are going to do, but the important thing is what are you going to do\u2026Right? So how you going to focus on yourself instead of others is by staying positive and making yourself better than what you were yesterday. All you need to do is stay positive. When you do what you think is the right thing then your self esteem goes up. Do ok stuff and feel ok about yourself. Never take yourself for granted , Always appreciate the things you do even when you go wrong. Everybody has flaws.. there is nothing wrong with it. Ask yourself: Why am I doing this? Is it because\u2026. Everybody is doing it?You want others to think you are a nice person?You want to feel accepted?You don\u2019t feel good enough about yourself to do what is really right for you?You will feel guilty if you don\u2019t?All that matters is you are changing how you think about yourself and what you have a tendency to focus on\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "That's a good question let me know when you have an answer. I care about other people a lot. I am on Quora answering questions and trying to lead people to find hope that I've never met before. It's just hope I've always been I hate seeing someone sad or an injustice being done and I try to fix the problem when I can or to comfort the other person. I suppose that the most important thing you can do is to not just stop showing kindness and compassion towards people. Instead remember that you have to survive in this world as well. You can be as giving as you want but make sure that you are taking care of yourself in the process. Give when you have abundance but not when you have barely enough and learn to be selfish. Do the things you want to do and make sure all your expenses are covered before lending money or time to other people. It might interest you to know that I could be helping a lot more people if I devoted more of the time I had each day but there are things that I want to do myself. I may sound awful to value an episode of anime over someone else's problem; especially if they are suicidal. However I recognize that I can't be there for everyone all the time and instead just do what I can when I can. The only thing that I'd gain from trying to do more then that is to become really stressed and constently worrying about other people won't allow me to help out any more and may even mean that I don't give as good advice. To summarize take care of yourself as your highest priority then take care of the needs of other individuals when you have the time and resources to do so. ",

I don't know exactly what is the remedy for this...but I can definitely share my experience of getting rid of this as much as possible... First of all i don't know the exact sense that you wanted to express by the word \"others\" ...whether in the sense of people around you or things around you... In both the options you just need to stop worrying.. it generally happens with most of the people ...you are not alone ..actually let me tell you one thing that you know the answer of this question.. you just need someone to ensure you more and more ..you want someone to tell you that its not a big deal and its never too late to do things that matters to you in this life .. so just give your best shot to be the one ..being focused in everything that matters is the main thing of our life because it leads to a life which you may dreamed for and we all know without the determination ,focus we can't get the things right where we desire..so you know the necessity of being focused in life..now about others if you meant people around you like friends ,relatives,family or class topper and even neighbours... we all tend to look on others' matters,others' problems ,even sometimes we forget about our own life ... it may happen because of the care that we have for them or curiosity about them, sometimes others trust us the most ,that they share their problems with a hope to see a solution from us and all these things divert our focus from our own life to others... we often can't say no to them in any matter, thus we all have this moment .. and if you mean unimportant things on ur life by the word others then also its the same situation...and whatever the situation is the main thing that you desire is just to focus on your own life,your work,your dreams...etc So you just need to accept all the odds coming in your life and think for a moment to prioritize your life according to the situation.. if your work is the most important thing right then you have to focus on it only...always remember one thing 'time and tide wait for none' ... if you really want your life to be focused or in any other way then you need to understand the importance of the time right now..take responsibility on everything that is happening in your life...instead of finding the reasons or thinking that others influences ,diverts your focus ,think that its something within you that prevents you every time when you need to be focused..when you do this you will realize where you stand right now and only then you can set where you want to be next day ..hence find a way to be better than that u r today.. I know its very hard to be persistent in this as it takes time to show the results still i will suggest that Little bit of yoga,meditation helps to reduce the stress of this things,..scheduling day to day work by prioritising them ,and facing all the situation with a positive manner like instead of thinking about the problem more,just find the way to solve it and if you are unable to do that just then stop thinking about it more and more...thinking more will just lead you to tensions that don't deserve to come into your time of life.. and just leave it on time or may be discuss with someone who can help you out..sometimes make a list of the things where you really need to focus or want to focus.see the list everyday, i know at first you may not try to focus on them but reading that list everyday will give a thought to try at least once and rest you need to give your best to keep that hope to try again and again.even if you fail to focus 30 times.i hope my words help you to be more focused..all the best..

            "answer_text": "I cannot tell you divert yourself but here is what you could do to stay focused:-  AVOID DOING MULTIPLE THINGS AT ONCE In a study of a sample of 100 people, half described themselves as \"multitasking\", while the other half did not. The study focused on attention, memory and the ability to move from one task to another. The multitasking people had the worst performance on each test. MEDITATE Another study also showed that students who meditate 20 minutes a day for 4 days perform better on some cognitive tests. EXERCISE REGULARLY Scientists believe that regular exercise can help stimulate the release of neurotrophic factor derived from the brain, which helps to animate memory circuits to improve their functioning. ESTABLISH A \"TO-DO LIST\" A computer science teacher says that reporting everything you need to do will help you focus on upcoming tasks. Get in the habit of working with \"to do\": write down everything you need to do in your day or during your week and check what you have already done! LEAVE WORK AT WORK It is recommended that you completely separate from your job after leaving your workplace and until you return to work. A study shows that the less focus you have on a problem, the more successful you will be in solving it, rather than remaining fixated on how to solve it. SURROUNDINGS:- What will boost your productivity is your environment: your ecosystem .If you want to take control of your life, you must create an ecosystem that stimulates you .There is too much temptation today: watch TV, go out, chat, radio, youporn, facebook ... If you do not create an environment conducive to healthy activities, do what you need to do, then you will not be able to achieve what you are looking for. It's just the way it works. We are creatures very sensitive to distractions, always looking for a distraction .  So unless you set up your environment so you do not get bothered, you will always be interrupted. MAKE A DEADLINE Have you not received a deadline from your client and do you notice that you lack the motivation to really work driven?Then you can set a deadline for yourself. Agree with yourself that you have to complete that one assignment at 6 pm that day and reward yourself if this indeed works. If you perform better under pressure and your client does not have that pressure, you simply put yourself under pressure to be able to work in a focused way. ",

If someone in the tribe does something wrong, he is taken to the centre of the village, and everyone gathers around him.

This is one of the best way to get your confidence up. If no one can do it for you, stand in front of the mirror and go ahead with this. It is 100% natural to lose your self confidence, but it is unnatural to succumb to that. Concentrate on your body. Workout. Go for a run, do body weight training.

            "answer_text": "Focus means the center of interest or activity, so there is interest and activity both involved. You have to be interested and not only interested, but act to remain focused on something. Interest on something is shaped by motivation which is inspired by incentives. So the first question is what are your incentives? and why and how badly you want something and remain focused on it? Why most people lose focus in whatever they want do? It is because they cannot tell the reason why they want focus on something or what is the reason for their pursuit. Though they may seem excited at first, this interest doesn\u2019t last long. They don\u2019t remain focused, and lose track of their goal. Some people subconsciously know what they want, what their interest is and why they should remain focused. Only those people succeed in doing what they want. Under any circumstances, these people never lose focus and continue despite all odds. So the second question is \u201c Are you that kind of person who know what he wants?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Well well ! Focusing on others isn\u2019t a bad thing. It often has the power to motivate you and determine you to chase dreams which you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. The problem lies when you focus on the wrong people, the ones you know aren\u2019t worth spending time on, but you do it anyway. My advice goes as follows If you are the kind of person who is habituated with understanding and knowing what others are into, then identify the right people.Once identified make sure that focusing on them, directly reflects on focusing on yourself. Now this is the tough part, yea ! So don\u2019t worry. Ask others what it is that they feel you need to focus the most on. Is it your health, career, emotional issues or whatever it may be. Then ask yourself, are you focusing on it sufficiently that you wouldn\u2019t be in a phase to ask this question 5 years later.Once you are aware of what you want, you can emulate the ways others have achieved it. Or rather more interestingly understand what they have done, learn from their mistakes and do better. Cause you have anyway spent all that time bothering about them, might as well make it useful.Sincerely hoping this answers your dilemma ! :) ",

Select tasks according to their importance. Break large tasks into small sections. Sometimes small actions make a big difference.Tell/Train your brain to stay focus on the task for a particular time. For Example, per day 15 minutes, half an hour or 45 minutes. Continue it every day for a month.once You decide to do study/work, clear all distractions.choose a (noiseless) place to sit, keep a water bottle near and make sure of light and wind. Switch off the mobile phone(at least internet), turn off the tv, tell people not to distract you.Eat good healthy food, get enough sleep and Give yourself time to adjust to a routine.

I need to shift away my focus from what others are doing or what they have. I have no control and it is pointless to see others\u2019 faults or compare what they have with what I have.Secondly, I cannot control all that happens in my life as a result of this life\u2019s Karma or past or (anything by chance). I have to pull my attention sooner or later from what\u2019s in my destiny to what I can do in my current capacity. I can respond to it in my own way but reversing or changing what has already happened is not possible. Any amount of attention lingering on this area of \u201chappening department\u201d is a total waste and often negativity inducing. I don\u2019t have a choice. If I accept and interpret positive then I thank and remain joyous or else I crib, struggle against the infinite forces and feel frustrated.After safeguarding attention from these 2 broad categories, firstly focus on eliminating easy, clear and negative things that we are doing and we should not be doing in current life. Unless we stop on bad how the space for good will be created. We may argue about what\u2019s good or bad, but here point is whatever bad in individual\u2019s view should be removed or at least attempted endlessly, zealously. Then eternal forces help us anyway. After these valuable wins, we will have positivity, energy and wisdom to do whatever we find worthy and useful for self and surroundings. ~ Prakash ",

Comparing yourself to others\u2019 accomplishments is like losing a battle.That\u2019s because there will always be someone who has done something that you wished you could also accomplish. POINT IS THAT its not really a bad idea to focus on others till you feel positive energy and inspiration from them and their achievements but what required is: the first person on your mind should always be you youself.

Don't worry about what others are up to or appear to be \"getting ahead.\"  Maintain focus to take care of yourself first in order to achieve your own personal goals. At the end of the day, your family and friends will thank you for it.  Contrary to popular belief that it is selfish to think about yourself first was created by those insecure people who saw themselves as helpless beings. A person's own personality is their priority and then everybody else comes second.  In reality, a person needs to take care of themselves first.  Otherwise, how will you know about your true wants and needs in life. How will you set your expectations out of life if you are involved in everybody else's needs instead of yours.  Your self-consideration is the absolute first priority because if you can't take care of yourself how in the world can you think about to take care of others. ",

Work on one thing for 90 minutes without allowing anyone disturb you or opening any window for any kind of disturbance. You can also train yourself to always have one key aim. One main goal, One thing to keep looking and waiting. Most often, We lose focus because we want to do ten things at a go. We want to visit a friend, read, chat, listen to music, watch a movie, cook and so on. You have to force yourself to do one thing at a time for at least 90 minutes. This way, you will end up being productive and more self focused. Before you start focusing on something, pause, close your eyes, feel and focus on your breathing for two minutes. Any time your mind seem to shift to something, force it back. Do this for 3 minutes. Its a good way to train the mind to focus. ",

So, basically, you wish to learn how to be focused at whatever you are doing, avoid unnecessary diversions and stay on the task. This is easier said than done, for it depends not only on your individual behaviour but also on the environment around you. If the environment is conducive, you will be able to concentrate better, and if it is not, nothing you do will allow you to stick to your task. You can practice yogic techniques for concentrating better, and these will help to some extent. But most of all, what will enable your better commitment are the following three things: a) you find what you are doing to be an interesting thing to do.b) you are sufficiently organised in your mind not to be diverted by the thought of your other incomplete tasks and c) you are within a conducive environment.

Therefore try keeping a journal or meditate. You can even try drawing. When you get yourself to actions like this, you become more aware of your mind and thoughts and you automatically focus on yourself. The second thing you do is asking yourself what you want in life.

I'm sure that the person can feel it as well. Now, think about that you are someone\u2019s crush (of whom you have no interest in), how would you feel if they focus on you a lot. Perhaps uncomfortable, feels that the person is needy, a lot of work to be friends with, and pressured to take care of them? I also believe that this example works for friendship. I agreed with the idea of self-love that many have mentioned. If you love yourself, would you like to feel pressured when someone focus their attention on you? Would you like to feel observed all the time. If the idea of this is making you feel uncomfortable, then you still love yourself. And if you like/love your friends or crush, would you like them to feel uncomfortable or pressured while you're in their vicinity? Of course not. Thus, I'm sure that people like you would appreciate a lot if your feelings are being respected of not feeling pressured or uncomfortable by someone else's presence. I suppose that this is also called empathetic self-love : ) ",

Life Changing Experience Life Changing Program It is a systematic path set out by Paramhansa Yogananda ji, which if followed should lead you to Self-Realization. The teachings are sent by mail in a weekly curriculum. Every week, you receive a chapter of spiritual study with some facts and usually a story to support the example, and some practices to go along with it. It is a soft start and grows slowly in depth and difficulty of understanding.Paramhansa Yogananda ji insisted that meditation was the ultimate path to a connection with God, so much of the focus of the earlier teachings is on Meditation.Read More : Paramhansa Yogananda ji \u2013 Self Realization Fellowship program. - Jasrin Singh ",
