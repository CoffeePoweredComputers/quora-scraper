            "answer_text": "My main answer would be like the others. Professional teachers record the grade the student earns. The clearer the instructions and the criteria for points are up front, the easier it is to see this. But, the grade is supposed to be earned by the student, not given by the teacher. Jerry Conrath did some important work years ago on the difference between students who realize they are in charge of working for the results they want vs those who think others just do things to you. All that said, I have known teachers who \u201cgave\u201d grades. I knew a PE teacher who simply gave \u201cA\u2019s\u201d to whoever they liked, \u201cB\u2019s\u201d to the kids they didn\u2019t, and \u201cC\u2019s\u201d to all SE students. Indefensible. I have known teachers who lowered grades as punishment for undesirable behavior rather than the quality of work. My high school Spanish teacher gave me a \u201cB\u201d with the highest marks on every assignment because he thought it would motivate me to even better work. And, I know some who gave undeserved high marks in order to avoid unpleasant parent calls. That backfired on one teaching gifted students because the parents couldn\u2019t brag on their child being superior if everyone had top marks. Some teachers \u201cgive\u201d grades without realizing it. To the extent we are allowed to design the assignments and exams, we set the bar for the grades. Theoretically, it\u2019s possible for whoever works hard enough to earn the grade they desire. But, I have known some who intentionally make first quizzes hard enough to get people to withdraw from their college courses. I have met some whose ego was in their own knowledge rather than their teaching ability. They took pride in saying things like, \u201cBy the end of this course half of you will still fail to understand the content!\u201d I never agreed with \u201cgiving\u201d grades and I never understood that last group. When the course is finished, lack of student success reflects our failure to find a way to teach them successfully. ",

            "answer_text": "I 'll tell you a true story. I'd set a maths assignment with a due date. Most handed it in a day or two early. One student when I asked if I could have there's at 9am on the Friday morning, said they couldn't hand it in on time because they watched a particular TV program on the Thursday night. We had already discussed the invention of a recording machine so you didn't have to be controlled by the TV timetable. Nine came on the Friday with no work from that student. I had to give what you call a \u201cbad grade\u201d because I had nothing to give anything else to. Four years later I saw the same student in a coffee shop. They saw me and asked if I remembered them. I said \u201cyes\u201d. They replied \u201cI wish I was back at school, I messed up badly didn't I?\u201d. They did. Many students earn the bad grades all by themselves, the teacher has nothing to do with it. ",
