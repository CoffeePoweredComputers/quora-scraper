            "answer_text": "I did my M Com from IGNOU. I\u2019m also working and I wanted to keep continuing my education. For this IGNOU was the best option to me. I couldn\u2019t study much due to the schedule and other reasons. But I gave the curriculum a good reading and I found out that my work and the curriculum somehow inter linked with each other. And my work helped me understand the curriculum and clear the exams. The only sad part was that, I wanted to do specialization in Finance and Taxation because they were specifically designed for CA Students and they need to clear their CA. If that requirement was not there it would have been great. Otherwise love the course and the institute. ",
