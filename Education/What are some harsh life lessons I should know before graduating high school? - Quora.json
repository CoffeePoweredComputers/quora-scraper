            "answer_text": "Wow. As a former high school teacher I can say that question rarely comes from someone your age. There are several harsh realities most adults can agree on: The world owes you nothing.Life is not fair. (Oh, how I wish it were.)There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cfree lunch\u201d. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.Plan to avoid consumer debt like a poison. We all have to use it but it\u2019s very addictive and soon we\u2019re making payment on lots of stuff we really don\u2019t need.Pay cash for as much as possible. Pay off car loans as fast as possible.Three-year old used cars are a better deal than new cars. Buy a used car and drive it a long time. I bought a very nice sports car three years old, paid it off and still driving it ten years later.Don\u2019t go overboard buying birthday and Christmas gifts for people. It\u2019s a habit that\u2019s hard to get out of.There\u2019s nothing wrong with being proud of your country. Work for positive change but in the end, it\u2019s still your country.Everyone should vote when eligible.This life is not about you. It\u2019s about the God who created you for a purpose. Until you understand this, life will never, ever make sense. Get to know God. (Romans 10:9\u201313)You sound like an intelligent and sensible kid. Best wishes to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Some very good advice given so far; allow me to add a few of my lessons. If you think you're \u201cdone with school and learning,\u201d you're going to have a difficult time finding a good- paying job and career. I'm not saying you must attend college or university, but you'll need some additional training of some kind, in order to get a job that pays more than minimum wage.Whatever social status you had in high school--none of it matters following your graduation ceremony. That's true whether you were the most or least popular student in your class.Whatever academic status you had in school, that too, disappears. Once you're admitted to college or whatever you're doing following school, that's it. No one cares what your GPA was, or how many AP classes you did or did not take.The people with whom you associate will play a large part in your success in life. Hang around and associate with people who lift you up, who challenge you to be better. The corollary is, if you hang around with losers, you too, will become a loser. Choose your friends wisely.Do not let the opinions of others\u2014 especially people who don't matter--impact your ability to make good choices. You don't have to prove yourself to anyone but yourself.Those cool cliques of kids you knew in high school? They may stay together for a year or two, but then they will dissolve. Sure, some will remain \u201cfriends\u201d for a little while, but most will go in different directions: school, work, the military--they\u2019ll meet new people and make new friends. They may meet up later at a 10-year reunion and have some laughs, but they'll have all moved on with their lives.Depending upon your family's financial situation, life may throw a bucket of cold water in your face, and fast. If your family is middle class or better, you may have a few years\u2019 worth of time to pursue a college degree or find something to do with your life. If your family struggles financially, you might have to find a job and make your own way much sooner.You will learn very quickly, the real cost of \u201chidden things.\u201d Up to now, it's likely your parents have paid their mortgage or rent, insurance for cars, healthcare, groceries, cell phone service, utilities, WiFi, etc. You benefited from all of that, and when you go out on your own, YOU will have to pay for those things. If you are not prepared financially, this will come at you hard.You will make mistakes in life, and its OK if you learn from them and don't make them again. Some mistakes are almost impossible to recover from, and you should avoid them at all costs: felony crime that can incarcerate you; hard drugs like meth, heroin, and opioids; having children out of wedlock, or raising them and having no plans to marry. All of these \u201cmistakes\u201d will set your life back years, and you may never recover from them.Whom you marry (assuming you do, eventually), will determine about 80% of your financial success. I don't mean this in a gold-digging way, either.Most of these lessons you may read and nod your head in agreement, but you won't follow through with them. In life, execution is critically important. If you don't have the initiative or discipline to do things required of you, you will not be successful.",
