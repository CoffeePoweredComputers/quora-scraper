            "answer_text": "First of all, i can say likes and dislikes mostly provided by the student . And student likes your answer only if they satisfied fully with your answers, mostly students wants clear and stepwise solution with proper handwriting and if it is not follow then only they disliked the answer. Sometimes they ask more than 2 or 3 questions but if we answer the questions as per the chegg guidelines then sometimes some student dislikes the answer. And for the payment of likes and dislikes answers doesn\u2019t matter. Chegg is paying for all valid answer that means if your answer is correct then definitely you will get your payment. But one thing you should keep in mind that more number of dislikes decrease your C.F. score which leads to chegg account revocation. So maintain at least 80% C.F. score to reduce the chance of account revocation. ",
