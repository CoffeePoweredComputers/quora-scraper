            "answer_text": "Very. And I don\u2019t mean to stress you out about it, but the short answer is YES. And for a number of reasons. It\u2019s harder to get motivated. If you\u2019re actually physically at school, you\u2019ll be more energized and you\u2019ll feel more encouraged to work. But if you\u2019re at your own house, things get more difficult. It\u2019s harder to find the motivation to do any online work, due to being in a familiar, comfortable environment that you\u2019ve created habits with.It\u2019s difficult to keep up. In school, teachers will typically assign work one assignment at a time, but in online school, it\u2019s multiple assignments given by multiple teachers. They forget that we\u2019re not used to this and that all this work is to stressful for us. It\u2019s extremely difficult to get several assignments done at the right due dates if we\u2019re already struggling on one. This causes us to fall behind and our grades drop.It isn\u2019t the same learning experience. This connects to the first reason. Doing work and learning from home just isn\u2019t the same as going to an actual class. During my time dealing with online school, I haven\u2019t really \u201clearned\u201d anything. I just do the work (or at least try to) assigned. Being at home causes several distractions, making it more difficult to focus and work.It\u2019s excruciatingly boring. Simply way they talk, the whole aura of the room, is just boring and awkward. Again, making it difficult to feel focused and motivated. 90% of the time the students are silent while the teacher attempts to present something with their slow internet. When the teacher asks a question to the class, there\u2019s like 10 seconds of awkward silence before someone finally answers (if anyone answers at all).I\u2019d go on, but you know. I don\u2019t want to so, \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Point is online classes suck, and are in no way shape or form equal to real school at all. Remember! Reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy gold! Bye! Reply ",

            "answer_text": "Online classes are relatively new to India, but it is a strong component of today\u2019s learning. Virtual classes are very much enjoyable as well as visual clarity is also established during the classes. From School children to job seekers it is a platform of never-ending opportunities. In this platform, you have an enormous storage of knowledge, waiting to be explored. Any subject, theoretical or practical can be easily available. There are many affordable channels[1] [2] which can supply you various audio-visual lectures as well as doubt clearing classes. Now, come to the point. Our children are not familiarized with computers and I beg your pardon, most of our parent is not either. As a result in this Covid-19 situation, most of them are at sea when online classes are introduced in India. I can guarantee you that the online class will remain even after the COVID situation is over, as it is the future of learning. Yes, there is stress, but should you and your children follow the safety guidelines, it can be minimized. There should be a minimum gap of 15 minutes between each session and eyes should be washed with water during this break. In this smartphone oriented world, both the parent and the children have already exposed to radiation, moreover, their time is wasted for nothing. Now you have to reduce that wastage by channelizing their time into this vast virtual world of learning. Yes, it is a stress for the children, who can not afford the luxury of being part of internet learning. In such cases, their teacher, their schools, NGOs, social workers, and the Government should help them to conquer their thrust of knowledge. Lastly, stress is now part and parcel of our life, then why not familiarize the children at the beginning ?? At least we can prepare them in such a way so that they can tackle this stress more efficiently than us. Footnotes[1] http://www.unacadamy.com[2] Get Your Personal Teacher Online from Vedantu",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Sometimes I feel online classes are stressful from my experience. I am a student of Computer Applications always. I would feel stress and discomfort if i continuously use my laptop for 5 to 6 hours for executing the lab programs or to complete my project, then i would not use it for next few days because i would be having headache and eye pain. But as of now i should attend the online classes due to the pandemic regularly for 3 hours and there would be a 3lab per 3 days in a week hence i have to extend my times to give attention towards the class and note down the notes and execute the programs to get output.If there is any error you have to go through it till you get the perfect output. If there are any computer students who are reading these they understand my effort of time we put into the problem solution And not only attending classes after the scheduled time of classes also, i have to complete our assignments,classworks or do some hands on work. For these completion of tasks i have to be referring to the notebooks/pdfs/ppts which are available digitally on google classrooms,we have to go through the video lectures virtually or get the answer from google or most simple way is to copy it from the friends assignment.But still for these i should go through my phone and copy it which leads me for my continuous eye pain, water moisture from eyes and soreness . This is because people are sensitive towards the rays or brightness which we have been exposed to on a continuous basis.Sometimes i would get lots of stress which results in my headache. Home scenario:\u00a0Me: I get a headache and to get relief I apply the balm may be iodex or amrutanjan to reduce it.(Amma caught me applying) Mother : Don't use much phone,it is all because of it and you will use it 24/7 hours (my mind : i used only for 7 hours) But she thinks it is 24 hours that I would be holding the phone and chatting as  I know if I don't use the phone I could not complete my daily assignments.\u00a0Because of this I would skip my online classes for two or three days in a week or I would just login and don't give any concentration to the class. For the people who are very sensitive to the brightness of a computer/phone and also too many tasks along with the work of personal activity leads to stress . Small tips give your eyes a rest as much as possible and take a cloth roll it with ice cubes and give an massage to your eyes. I would prefer not to be stressed. Be a learner but dont impose it on value of your health. Thank you for the question Shashi Kumar ",

            "answer_text": "This answer varies from person to person .Some students they do like offline classes because they do love physical interaction. Some are opposite .Basically those are introvert they do like online classes ,they feel very comfortable to ask question and to give answer . During class you have to put ear phone which sometimes give us headache .While attending classes background noise makes you very irritate.Very important issues are electricity and network ,sometimes student from rural area they don\u2019t get strong and stable network so they faces problem . Most of the Rural area student they don\u2019t have gadgets ,sometime they do take phone from their neighbour or from their parents ,sometime it makes them irritate because they have also some work on their mobile .What are the things that makes student comfortable for attending online classes :- While attending Physical classes you are completely depending on college administration\u2019s rules and regulation.But in the case of online you can take time in-between classes .Some are very glutton they can keep some snacks while attending class . Forget about attending classes for hours, sitting in an uncomfortable chair, and suffering from back pain by the end of the day. All lectures and needed materials are provided via online platforms, so you\u2019ll easily access them from the comfort of your home.Best part is that you will be habituate with technology.NOTE : Make your online classes effective and enjoyable .

            "answer_text": "There are two kinds of online classes. One is online teaching and another is online self-paced classes/courses. And it depends on person to person, because something which might be stressful to me maybe not be for you. I\u2019ll be talking about me in here! For online teaching, it can be stressful yes! Online books, pdfs and tests can seem a lot as compared to hard copies, reason being in online books you cannot mark generally (even though new technologies are coming up, but India is still much behind in building awareness about such things) and there\u2019s a lot of scrolling and so you need to be a tech savvy and also have a good internet connection in case your books are stored on apps like google drive etc. They can be boring as well, as there\u2019s no physical human contact, you might take them lightly and not take it as seriously as offline classes. I love the online self-paced classes, but again, you have to be very picky as not all educators have nice, understandable content. Sites like Udemy, Edx, Coursera, Netacad and so many more have made online self paced courses easier for me. And you might think why I am on so many e-learning platforms? Because as I mentioned earlier, you got to be picky and that\u2019s what I am! I like some content of Udemy and other of edx and some other of coursera and so on. But I got to know what I like (what I understand, what content is for me) by trial and error! Online self paced courses are amazing to invest in during holidays, free time and especially now. All you need to do is choose good courses. Even youtube courses a.k.a youtube playlists are amazing! Some subjects which are related to business do not need to be viewed and so the audio lessons in such cases are so handy while walking and travelling! Instead of listening to interviews and even music, you can choose to learn a whole new topic. Hope this helps! ",

So let\u2019s discuss how online learning can positively impact a student\u2019s mind: Online classes can provide a student enough time on hands by saving the commuting time.The studies are interactive helping them understand concepts easily with all the resources on their hand.The stress of exams can also be reduced online due to the available amount of test practices and quizzes.Students can work in an environment that they feel comfortable in and thus, reducing anxiety and stress triggers.Students can schedule online classes and studies according to a time they feel comfortable.With online studies, many LMS these days inculcate help for dealing with mental stress in students.Students who don\u2019t feel comfortable asking for doubts can anonymously ask in the online classes messaging column.These are some of the ways online learning can help students dealing with stress.

On any of their holidays , they don\u2019t have a holiday, they are now trained this way. As their socialisation is concerned with kids of their age , their earlier school friends have a night over etc. Even in US my Sister-in-law & bro have put their kids online where not many opt. But today it\u2019s a way of life. Moreover they have opted for the best academic school . So can you. So bottomline: Routinise yourself to this kind of online academics. ",

Lecturer aspect There are a variety of online classes to start with. Full length courses recorded / live - These courses are somewhat interactive and they are less stressful. You will see the students asking doubts, making witty comments etc. For instance - Mr. Eddie Woo / Prof Leonard Math lectures on Youtube are great examples for this. The professors are very humorous.On the other side of the spectrum MOOCs by online course behemoths like NPTEL, edX etc will have a hyper-focused course videos which doesn\u2019t help with pause and ponder, which are somewhat stressful as it demands complete attention.Self-paced courses / Instructor-paced courses.Self-paced courses are courses which have free schedules, which helps in our study plans. They are very flexible, hence more power. And have a word of warning - More power, corrupts more. It will be entirely your self-discipline to ensure you do learn it strategically.Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, Lynda (Now LinkedIn Learning) and some edX courses fall in this category.Instructor-paced courses are courses which have a specific time scheduled for passing through every course checkpoint. From what I saw from edX, it helps the TAs to answer only to a specific week\u2019s queries by learners. These types of courses had to be made sure timely efforts are given to study the material.Most edX and NPTEL courses fall in this category.",
