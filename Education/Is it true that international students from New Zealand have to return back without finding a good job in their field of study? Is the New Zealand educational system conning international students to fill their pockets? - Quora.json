            "answer_text": "At the very beginning of the answer I must make it clear that Universities are not employment agencies and cannot guarantee any student a job. That is not their core business. Their core business is to educate you in the best way possible to gain a qualification to find that dream job yourself. If that much is clear you will soon discover you must pick the right career, the right level of qualifications the market needs and do your best to stay at the top and complete your course successfully. Your success depends on which university you enrol in and what course or degree you do. If you go for a low level \u2018business\u2019 degree or certificate then your own selection has an ulterior motive. This motive is usually to find a job that will lead you to Permanent Residence. Things don't work so easily when you make bad choices. You cannot blame the University or Private Training Establishment if your course has no value! You blame yourself for being stupid. You dont blame the University. Every student pays the same fee. Almost all students eventually find employment. Now where does \u2018conning\u201d come into this? It comes in when you make a silly choice and try shortcuts to go around the immigration system. At the very start you knew that your selection was poor and yet you conned yourself in thinking you can get in \u2018somehow\u2019 and find your way. When you get caught the first thing you do is sully the names of the world\u2019s best Universities in New Zealand! Perhaps you should have gone to Harvard or Stanford. Maybe that is where you belong. Who knows? The real facts are you cannot con yourself and blame others. Wake up and think well before you make choices. Try Harvard. They are probably waiting for your application! Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some schools in New Zealand that exploit their students. The government is working to shut them down, but sometimes as they do that, they will hurt students currently at the school. As a New Zealander I'm ashamed all this goes on and I think the New Zealand education system has failed many people. That said, there are some tips you can follow to get a better pathway in New Zealand. As other commenters have said, there is no guarantee of a job in most courses. It's your responsibility to pick a school and course that will give you the skills you need for the job you want. This will take some research. But a few things to keep in mind: The name \u201cuniversity\u201d is legally protected in New Zealand, and only institutions strong enough to do genuine high level academic research can use the name. There's no guarantee but you can be more confident of a rigorous education at institutions in new Zealand with \u201cuniversity\u201d in the name.If you are career focused, and hope to settle in new Zealand after you graduate, look at new Zealand's \u201cskills shortage list\u201d and do a course that gives you a qualification for those skills. Healthcare (nursing, MDs) and IT are almost always in demand. Ask about what percentage of their graduates go on to get jobs within the field in New Zealand. Make sure you pick something you like doing, too.Doing a \u201cbusiness diploma\u201d at a lower tier college like a polytechnic or a private training institute is probably one of the least recommended pathways. If you want to take the qualification back to your home country, I can't say, but in New Zealand, this won't really qualify you for much. If you have solid entrepreneurial spirit and good ideas and are good with people and can adapt quickly to New Zealand culture you might be able to make it work in your favour but it's not for someone looking for a straightforward path to a good job.",
