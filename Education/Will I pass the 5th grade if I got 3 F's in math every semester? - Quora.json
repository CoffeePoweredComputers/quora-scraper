Would you be happy if you passed?I know what you are going through but if you are struggling with math don't be afraid to ask for help theres always someone around if it's not a teacher ask a classmate or an adult in your family I am sure you can find someone to help you. You can also ask your teacher if theres anything extra you can do to bring your grade up extra credit do anything you can to show you are trying. Try your hardest always and ask for help. Is ok to fail if you don't fail you wont succeed. ",
