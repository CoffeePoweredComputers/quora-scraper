            "answer_text": "Short answer: No, not really. Long answer: sort of, it depends. They matter in terms of tiers, and the further from #1 you get, the larger the tiers get. It doesn\u2019t really matter within: #1 through #3 #4\u201310 #11\u201325 #26\u201350 #51\u201385 #86\u2013130. It does matter somewhat between them. Beyond #100 or so no one cares & probably never heard of them outside their regions unless they have a disproportionately good football team (ie: Boise State), produced some gold-medal Olympic athletes or whatever. There are also different classes of colleges & universities that are not comparable. Liberal arts colleges with small enrollment are really NOT comparable to the \u201cNational universities,\u201d no matter where they rank within their groupings. Is University of Virginia (#24) THAT much better than University of Michigan (#27)? No, not really. But if you have a choice between University of Michigan and University of California-Santa Cruz (#74), all things being equal, the former is a better a choice than the latter. Of course, not all things are equal. There are other factors to consider such as: Cost, meaning payment owed after scholarships & non-loan financial aid are awarded. If you can get a full ride at a lower tier, it might be worth it even though you\u2019re taking a minor or even moderate reputation hit. If you can\u2019t get a full ride anywhere, it might be in your best interest to go to whatever college or university is the most affordable. Location preference, meaning both lifestyle while in college and the college\u2019s reputation cache. Do you want to spend 4 years in a place like Ann Arbor that\u2019s going to get a lot of snow & ice? Or someplace like Miami U. where you can go to the beach a lot? Also, what locations do you want to target for jobs? After the top 15 or so, their reputational strength for jobs begins to diminish at a national level and they have more \u201cpower\u201d in their particular regions. In some cases certain universities are especially strong regionally and might be better choices if you really want to live in a particular area. Lifestyle preference, meaning do you want large lecture halls to be part of the experience or only small classes of 25\u201330 or less? Do you want to be in a protoypical college town where the college\u2019s footprint is significant, a rural area, or a city where the college\u2019s footprint is less significant? Does your family want in loco parentis at all? Some of the small liberal arts colleges still offer arrangements like same-sex dorms with curfews, etc\u2026 Religious preference, meaning do you want religion (in general or a particular denomination) to play a role in your education? Lastly, do you REALLY need to be in college immediately after high school to accomplish your life goals? Just think about that for a bit, if for no other reason than to just consider your life goals. My personal thoughts? All college ranking schemes are pretty much bullcrap & most colleges, if you put in effort, will reward you. I went to an Big State University that no one outside that state can distinguish from the others they\u2019ve heard of unless they\u2019ve actually been to the area. It worked out fine for me. Here\u2019s a trick - when you get into the real world and anyone asks where you went to college, just say the state it was in. \u201cSo where did you go to college?\u201d \u201cNorth Carolina.\u201d I guarantee that 8 out of 10 people will never offer a follow up question to that whether you went to University of North Carolina, Duke, Coastal Carolina, or NC-State. Once I left my state, no one I ever met could distinguish my alma mater from the \u201cbig\u201d schools in the state, so I just stopped explaining and only corrected them if they specifically asked. I\u2019ll even wear the T-shirt sometimes, which has the mascot\u2019s name on it below the university name\u2026 and people will say \u201cOh, the Longhorns, right?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026 nevermind.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, most learning is done by yourself, so colleges don\u2019t really teach you much. It\u2019s more of a piece of paper to certify you aren\u2019t \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cknow book stuff\u201d. If you don\u2019t need that piece of paper, then just skip college. In terms of salary and getting your foot in the door, it depends. This depends on the type of education you are receiving and the geography. If you go to another country, it might matter more. Regional rankings could also matter a lot. Another problem is how are you determining that you\u2019ll enjoy one over the other? If you are in Engineering, rankings only matter to a certain extent but it will help getting your foot in the door. If you are in Law, Academia, Business, it matters A LOT, especially if you want to work for a big company. The premium for brand names are high in Law and Business. In medicine, as long as it is LCME accredited and MD, the school matters very little and the salary is about the same (within 5% difference or less). Also, you can always get a MBA at a top 20 school, once you get there, nobody cares where you went to undergraduate. Most employers see rankings and branding more of an \u201cavoidance of hiring the wrong person\u201d tactic. It\u2019s simply a first-order filter. For example, I chose only Texas schools because tuition was one of the lowest (if you are a Texas resident) and it was \u201creputable enough\u201d regionally state-wide. I turned down an Ivy League acceptance from Stanford, because it was too expensive (especially living costs) and I wasn\u2019t poor enough to receive aid. Medical school was the same, and Texas has no state income tax and favorable tort laws. I instantly saved 200k in student loans total (not including accrued interest), will save on malpractice insurance by at least 30%, and would make an extra 5-10% from not needing state income tax. Not to mention my cost of living was very low and I\u2019m basically guaranteed a job. If I went to Harvard Medical School and ended up a pediatrician, I would be broke and in debt for 20 years. Not that being a Harvard educated pediatrician is bad or anything, but the pay is on one of the lowest end relative to the price of education. Of course, this probably doesn\u2019t matter if money is not a problem, and you can afford to pay tuition without taking out loans. Choose the one that makes the most sense financially that still fits your interests. The easiest way to evaluate is to look at ROI of different majors in different colleges by third party evaluators. The absolute ROI number is a good reference for one of the various factors that should be included in your consideration, once you\u2019ve filtered out what area you want to work in. Don\u2019t fall in love with the name, without looking at it rationally. The reputation can help, but it\u2019s dependent on a lot of factors. Undergraduate degrees are relatively diluted these days though so keep that in mind. Who doesn\u2019t have one for the jobs you are seeking? And generally, avoid new for-profit schools that nobody has heard about. You might as well use the \u201cdiploma\u201d as toilet paper. ",

            "answer_text": "Google Search rankings, IMDB ratings, \u201cTop 10 best \u2018Friends\u2019 episodes you can binge upon\u201d, and so on.. we have become really accustomed to rankings and ratings these days. And it\u2019s fine to do so in a lot of cases, such as when buying a vacuum cleaner or a television set or even watching movies. Why? Because these ratings come out of consumer reports which are synthesized through surveys, testing labs, etc. In such a case, college rankings also makes sense to us as we think that like consumer reports they simplify the complicated confusing information. So what\u2019s wrong with the college rankings?: A college, however, is not a vacuum cleaner. Choosing a school is a far more personal, subjective, and ultimately expensive decision. Yet despite the greater importance and complexity of selecting a college, college rankings systems all take a far less thorough and scientific approach than Consumer Reports do when testing vacuum cleaners.A former Yale admission officer shared a story: Each year, she helps students who have just completed their junior year create a list of colleges that are a good fit with their interests, personalities, and achievements. Each summer, the students visit those schools with their families to get a first-hand look. When they return to high school in the fall, despite what they have seen on their visits and what they know about their prospects, many of the students have created new lists of their college preferences. These new lists always seem to correlate with the rankings in U.S. News. Students tend to discard excellent and appropriate colleges ranked lower in U.S. News and to add \u201cstretch\u201d schools that are unlikely to offer them admission.Most importantly, rankings promote the notion that the college you attend signals something about your place in the world. The signal translates as something like this: \u201cPeople will think better of me if I attend a more highly-ranked school.\u201d Rankings encourage students (and parents) to internalize the myth that where you go to college defines your value and determines your future success in life.Rankings have also turned out to be bad for colleges. They encourage schools to expend resources on things that move their ranking positions rather than things that serve their students. They diminish the appeal of colleges that serve many students extremely well but do not fit the performance parameters that the rankings measure.A far prolific method would be to look at which college is going to provide you with a great college experience and exposure. As an example, I chose Carnegie Mellon University \u201cQatar\u201d because of far personal reasons than its ranking. Hell I did not even know that CMU was a top university in CS until I came here and they showed us a video about it. My reasons were great financial aid, lower teacher to student ratio (hence higher one-to-one relations), closer-to-home campus, amazing food (in Qatar), etc. Hence I urge you to give some time to yourself to really decide where you want to apply and why. My dream school was Yale - not because of its rating but because I saw one of their videos of the residential life at Yale and I was in love with it. I agree with what Tom said and I\u2019ll extend it by saying that let rankings only guide you, and not limit you. There are many reasons to join a particular college, and its ranking need not to be the one or at least the only one. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-PS. Most of the above points are directly taken and summarized from Yale\u2019s article on \u201cBeyond College Rankings\u201d that I read when I was applying to colleges. I highly recommend you read the full article. ",

            "answer_text": "Understanding college rankings at the undergraduate level is a tricky business. Rankings seem like a neat and tidy thing - listing schools from number 1 to number 200 in order of how \u201cgood\u201d they are is beneficial because it is easy to comprehend. But what\u2019s really behind the numbers? The US News rankings methodology is problematic for a number of reasons. First, its formula for the ways that schools are ranked doesn\u2019t include a number of factors (such as job prospects and salary upon graduation) that most students care greatly about while going through the admissions process. Instead, other factors, such as selectivity, are included. This is an issue because schools can manipulate these factors. For example, UChicago has climbed the rankings in recent years. But it also has grown to become one of the schools with the highest SAT score averages. What this means, is that UChicago has increased its selectivity, helping it rise in the rankings. What this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean is that UChicago is objectively a better school than something like Stanford, which is ranked lower and also has a lower SAT score average. Another issue, that you bring up in your question, is that different schools have strong programs in different areas. If I wanted to study engineering, I might want to attend Carnegie Mellon over Yale - even though Yale, as a whole, is ranked above Carnegie Mellon. In general, you should never choose a school based off of its ranking alone. What is more important is individual fit, which requires a good amount of personal research on the part of you, as the student. Rankings help in understanding generalities, but in terms of choosing a school that is a good individual fit, they really shouldn\u2019t be a deciding factor. ",

Though I'm wondering does it really matter which school I got to for computer science or are college rankings for subjects like CS/Engineering is pointless?They matter, but they are neither completely accurate measurements not the only thing you should consider. If all things were equal (they never are) wouldn\u2019t you prefer the school ranked #10 to the one ranked #99 in your chosen subject? They give you are rough idea of how the schools compare using the measures describe in the particular ranking or opinions. Many rankings are based on OBJECTIVE criteria like student/teacher ratios, or funding etc. Others are more opinion based. (e.g., Top 10 schools for partying.) Hint: Look into what they ACTUALLY TEACH that you might enjoy or prefer not to study \u2014 look also into the GRADUATE courses because the graduate programs will give you more of a hint of what the professors think is important WITHIN each subject. Any CS department is going to teach the basics, so to find out the flavor of their curriculum look at what the grads are doing. Or you can look at what languages they use for each course. MIT for instance changed their programming Intro course from Lisp/Scheme based to Python based. (I think that was an unfortunate mistake but others might be delighted.) If you are wondering, the language you learn for your into isn\u2019t important in and of itself (Like getting a job), it\u2019s important because of the way it shapes your thinking. Were I 45 years younger, I would be looking for a school that used Scheme or Haskell or both \u2014 if all other things were equal. But that\u2019s just MY example \u2014 not yours. ",

            "answer_text": "Rankings by themselves do not matter very much, but they often are correlated with things that do matter. Also, for better or for worse, employers sometimes use the ranking of a department as a quick filter.  You can still get an education more or less just as good, you just have to put a bit more effort into securing it. Basically, it just means you will have to put a bit more effort into standing out. Do something interesting! You might not be able to coast just on graduating from your department, but people aren't going to pass you by if you go beyond just doing well in classes. For example, one concrete problem is that companies tend to recruit less heavily at lower-ranked departments. This just means that you will have to go to them rather than vice-versa! So put a bit more effort into reaching out and applying to places that might not come to your career fair. Another potential problem is that the faculty may not be as uniformly strong. While all departments have some very strong researchers, the higher ranked ones stand out for having only strong researchers. This just means that, before working on undergraduate research, you should check to see what sorts of things different professors publish and how successful their past projects have been. A bit more effort up-front, but after that the actual experience of doing research won't be much worse. I really wouldn't worry about classes at all: in my experience, most core CS classes cover very similar material at most schools. You could compare a class's syllabus to one at another school, but I doubt there's a real difference. Perhaps your homework will be less difficult, but I think the advantages of difficult homework are woefully overstated. So yeah: don't worry about it except for \"meta\" activities like choosing whom to do research with or actively applying to different companies. ",

To get one of the top 10% of the jobs out there, go to one of the top 1% of the universities out there (at least for your highest degree). Suppose you live in San Bernardino and would be content with a career as a teacher or social worker or nurse living in the \u201cInland Empire.\u201d Go to San Bernardino Valley College then transfer to Cal State San Bernardino and get your BSW or teaching credential or BSN there and you will probably make out alright. You could argue that Loma Linda or Redlands have higher ratings, but you may not need those private institutions. But suppose you want to be a Wall Street investor. Do your undergrad work at Claremont McKenna and get your MBA at Wharton. Even though Cal State has an excellent program in business, CMC and Wharton will open more doors. This is especially true if you want to be a professor. You might be content to teach at UC Riverside, Cal State San Bernardino or University of Redlands (good schools), but where do they get their faculty? (Berkeley, Harvard, Chicago). Remember one more thing: don\u2019t go by fame (determined by longevity and athletics) but by rankings in specific fields. For example, Chicago may be the best business school, but Stanford will be better in Technology and Wharton in Finance. Stanford may be the best psychology program, but in clinical it\u2019s UCLA. ",

[As an upperclassman I decided I wanted a chance to get into the most prestigious graduate department in my field so I gave up my extracurriculars.] Thus the typical day was reading or discussing academic questions about 12 hours per day. It was so wonderful.I did get into the graduate department which was (in a sense) my only (really desired) choice. But I had a warning before I accepted: a national news magazine had a cover story on faculty \u201cwars\u201d in that department. I ignored it because it had no connection to my academic experience. And actually there was another such story before I started but it was beyond my ken. After being a student there for only a little while I realized what an unhealthy (psychologically, morally, intellectual) place it was. I got my MA from there and transferred to a much less prestigious department (on the advice of 2 college friends who were already there). It was a sane and pretty good department.I got a job offer from a department in a university which had (merely) regional prestigious. It turned out the faculty was great, the students (half of them) were great, my career there on the whole was very good. And it was an excellent place to raise a family.Ergo: don\u2019t calculate your choice in money. (Sometimes that still voice in the head gives good guidance.) But also: As fate would have it, someone who became an in-law of mine graduated from the university where I was on the faculty [Our paths there never crossed.]. He started his career in one of the most prestigious marketing firms on Madison Ave\u2014later moved to Redmond WA early-ish in the internet revolution in a very prestigious position. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s how I would view it. Colleges with great reputation have earned it for some reason. They offer the best course curriculum, top-notch faculty, modern amenities, infrastructure, and flexibility to choose courses and projects. Naturally, good colleges that are proactive, progressive and boast of a vibrant environment attract the best students from around the world. The students who study here add a new dimension to the school\u2019s quality of education, i.e, peer interaction. You get to study among world\u2019s talented, brilliant and exceptionally creative people coming from different parts of the globe. Any student who applies to a college that offers the best educational climate and curriculum will gain tremendously from high-quality education. Not just that, your education parameters will set the gold standard for your future, whether you choose to do a Master\u2019s program or take up employment. So in short, yes, the reputation or the fame of the college will play an important role in your future education or career decisions. Having said that, I would like you to understand that the reputation of your undergraduate college will not discount the need for your personal achievement and hard work. Irrespective of where you pursue your undergraduate program, your academic and extra-curricular activities will set the tone for your next level growth. If you have not focused much on your academics or extracurricular work, you will find it difficult to crack admissions to a top-tier Master\u2019s program. Colleges are looking for people with a winning attitude, and the potential to become future leaders. Even if you have not studied at any top-ranked undergraduate school, you still have a chance to get into top-ranked schools, provided you have performed exceptionally well in your academic and extracurricular work. During my days, when I had to choose my undergraduate college, given that I had a limited understanding of colleges back then, I chose Carnegie Mellon University on the basis of its ranking. In hindsight, I feel that though the decision worked in my favour, it was not the wisest way to make that decision. Today, I am much more informed and knowledgeable about how admissions work, and what makes people build successful careers. Now, when I have to counsel students or help them navigate to the right colleges, I look at other factors in making the decision. However, when it came to applying for an MBA, I knew I wanted to do proper research and crack a top school. So even while I was studying at CMU, I made sure that the steps I took aligned with my goals. I worked at BlackRock, an asset management firm, and with my family business. When I applied for my MBA, while I did limit my college selection list to top-ranked schools, I also ensured that I looked for the \u2018right fit\u2019. To do so, I analyzed various factors and then reached the conclusion that Harvard Business School would be the right choice for me. Do bear in mind that when you apply for a postgraduate degree program such as an MBA or Masters, the colleges will most definitely assess where you did your undergrad from. Having gone to CMU for undergrad definitely bolstered my chances of success to get into Harvard. Two of my other classmates from CMU also made it to Harvard. ",

            "answer_text": "Somewhat. There is name recognition for the really good schools. Actually the quality of the department (and the minimum required to get a degree from that department) matters more. The thing about highly ranked schools is they tend to raise the minimum education you need to get a degree much more than the maximum that you can learn at other schools. They also put you in classes with similarly intelligent/driven people. The name recognition means quite a bit in getting a job (although the field of study is important too). My sons went to MIT majoring in CS/EE and received a job offer from each and every company to which they gave a resume at a job fair. A local (non-flagship) state college in my area had their number one CS graduate receive zero job offers. Certainly you can get an undergraduate degree from a lesser ranked school and do very well there and then get a graduate degree from a more prestigious school. ",

            "answer_text": "Joseph is correct: rankings do matter but only in few circumstances, and are almost never a main factor upon graduation and advancement to career. There are certain universities, by merely stating on your resume, will typically advance you to an in-person interview so long as you're not a complete Muppet (such as Tech, CalTech, Chicago, and a few others). Outside of a select cohort, an employer will be more concerned with what you've learned, how well you did in school, and what relevant experience you bring to the table. And after your first \u201creal\u201d job, your GPA won't matter at all: Your work product will speak for you. So, if you have the opportunity to attend a truly elite school, then see if you like the students and the professors, and proceed with eyes wide open. But if an elite school is not an option, then you're better served by just going somewhere you would enjoy being for several years, that has the best connections and internships in the field and region you want to wind up. (N. B.: My advice is a little different if pursuing grad school straight out of undergrad is likely.) ",

            "answer_text": "They matter a lot to parents, prospective students, and others who think that a degree is magic fairy dust that coats every graduate and will bestow them with marketability and access to jobs and higher socioeconomic strata.  Which they are a weak proxy for, sure - especially when we're talking about the top 25 which have massive name recognition independent of their US News rank. But I'd say that there is massive variability in quality within an institution: one program might be a world leader, while others are pathetic afterthoughts.  One department may be very strong in its graduate program (upon which its reputation is built) but because of that, neglects its undergraduates (by throwing underprepared grad TAs into teaching, having faculty unengaged in their undergraduate courses...) I'd also say that degree rep gets you in the door (who turns down a job applicant from Yale?) but having actually grown in college gets you the contract renewal or promotion.  So: pick a college with name recognition, but in areas that matter to you.  Theatre majors should pick a program that is known in theatre circles, etc.  Pick a well-regarded liberal arts college, if you don't know what you want to do, even if it's only \"well-regarded\" amongst the experts and not the public.  You might have to convince people it's good (\"what, you've never heard of Swarthmore?  OK, here's why it's great...\") but the things you learn there will show them (eventually.) ",

            "answer_text": "Whether it matters or not largely depends on what you are considering. If you are just asking whether the education is much different, I would argue no. Certainly, you would think that a higher ranked class would have harder problem sets or whatever, but from people I've talked to, if there is a correlation it is a rather weak one. However, I think that it will definitely affect your job prospects to a certain degree, because it affects whether you will get an interview or not. I imagine this won't be such a big difference between say a #10 vs #12 college, but between #1 and #10 I think you would start to see a difference. Also, I think the biggest thing you get out of going to a university is the people, and by that I mean both your classmates and your professors. There's no question that having a strong alumni network is very beneficial to one's career, and having great professors is very useful for obvious reasons. Of course, both of these things are really only what you make of them, and I am sure that at any school there are going to be strong students, and those are the kinds of people you are going to want to become familiar with. Finally, the environment definitely matters as well, since it will affect how motivated you are. Of course, I think that with self determination this is less of a big deal, but having to motivate yourself is tiring in itself. Also, having people you can discuss things with on equal footing is both helpful and encouraging. Anyway good luck =] ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, no. Undergraduate curricula are virtually the same everywhere. Faculty are all from excellent schools, given the extreme competition in the academic job market. The major difference comes in upper level classes. So, many students can start at an excellent two year school like St. Paul College or DeAn's College and transfer to a four year school and get superb undergraduate educations. Larger universities have more possible majors and a wider variety of specialized classes. But undergraduate education is more about learning how to learn than about stuffing your head full of information. This can often be better achieved at a smaller school, where the faculty have the time and desire to be more attentive to students. In the end, what a student does in school is infinitely more important than the name of the school from which they graduate. So, pick a school that is the best fit in terms of size, location, and special programs, That will always be the best choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: almost not at all The rankings that you\u2019re probably reading are generated from statistics that will likely be mostly meaningless to you once you\u2019re actual attending the university. The most important thing to take away from your college studies is how you fuel your desire to learn and develop the ability to think critically. Doing the same major at two different universities usually means you\u2019re learning about 85\u201390% of the same material anyway, just with potentially more notable faculty at one (which does not make them better teachers). Rather than fixating on the ranking of your university, try to picture how the university itself will shape your college experience: where you\u2019ll live, what kind of peers you\u2019ll possibly have, what other experiences are available at the school besides the academic programs. As for employment, no employer cares about which school is \u201cbetter.\u201d A prestigious name on your resume might be a slight bonus to your chances, but having a meaningful internship that you can receive regardless of where you attend is much more beneficial in that regard. Employers are looking for proven skill, and a sheet of paper from an arbitrarily higher ranked institution doesn\u2019t convince them of that. ",

A final thought regarding the \u201cHappiness\u201d argument: College is an investment decision\u2014about time and money.

I was not the same student at each of these schools (although I was happy at both of them. At a higher ranked university, more things are handed to you. Top ranked institutions naturally have better professional networking opportunities. You don\u2019t really have to dig to figure out how to excel \u2014 you can follow someone else\u2019s example. At a lower tier institution, if you take initiative, you can be at the top of your class - a true standout. You\u2019ll be able to work closely with professors without as much competition. So, if your performance were somehow the exact same at both of these schools, the top school would provide you with better outcomes.

You can go to college and get nothing out of it. Are you studying to learn of are you studying for a test? The truth is top tier universities expect more out of their students, the pace is faster, and they cover more material. But the second truth, that no one ever mentions, is that you can learn just as much at any other college if you are willing to put in over time. Anything taught in the college classroom can be found online or in a book. The problem with a majority people in our education system today is they go to school purely to obtain a degree, not to further their understanding of a topic and build off of that after college. College gives you a foundation of knowledge for a career, it is your choice whether you take that knowledge, retain it , and build off it, or you just study to get passing grades and eventually obtain a degree. You can get a Harvard education sitting at your laptop at the local library. All the knowledge in the world is sitting right in front of you, it\u2019s your choice what you do with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot more to consider when deciding to go to college than just programs and rankings. But that\u2019s not even the real problem. Let me tell you right now that your degree will NOT dictate your salary or your opportunities. What will affect the salary you command and the opportunities available to you is your ability to provide value. What can you do to create value for a company? How will you show that so as to land a job? Thinking that an accreditation from an outdated institution will hand you your livelihood after 5 years and thousands of dollars is flawed logic. Why do you think you have to choose between any college or university? What other opportunities could you create yourself that will allow you to do the things you want to do? Do you even realize what else you could be doing with 5 years and $100,000? A degree only puts you in with the rest of the conveyor belt drones. Break free. Create the life you want to live yourself. No one dressed in robes is going to hand it to you. ",

Because in university the faculty and classmates may not help you very much on studying if you are not motivated yourself due to sub-par campus experience. Yet you have to decide based on abundant information. I encourage you to talk to professors in the CS department of both schools, and pay some visits to the other school. Even attend a summer session at the other school if you feel so. Pay attention to the classroom flow, the weather, the student community, and so on. You can then decide which one suits you best. Don't hesitate because of cost since it would be well worth it if you can have four happy college years.  Finally, I welcome you into the CS family on behalf of all programmers ( if they permit ) . Have fun coding. ",

            "answer_text": " Yes and no \u2026 yes, because the world measures learning mostly in this manner, whether we like it or not. No, because there are better ways to learn if you have the discipline. Let me elaborate on some of these ways. I have defined these ways from my research on learning. Let\u2019s discuss each of these: Learn by doing Most of what we know, we didn\u2019t learn in school. We learned it in the real world, actually doing, not reading or listening to about doing. Confucius once said: I hear, I forget. I see I remember. I do, I understand. He appreciated that being a creator was the best way to learn. Make your learning be active learning and be creators as often as possible. We believe this the most critical of the 10 ways to improve your learning. Create curiosity If we have the guts to think about what we don\u2019t know, confuse our learners, perplex them, and evoke real questions, we can create curiosity. This curiosity can be used to tailor robust methods of blended learning. Curiosity must come first. Questions can be fantastic windows to great learning, but not the other way around. Build your skill of curiosity \u2026 it is a necessity for good learning. Practice imagination Albert Einstein once said: Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you anywhere. He understood the complexities of the world today required imagination for the discovery of new ideas and solutions. Imagination requires lots of practice; it doesn\u2019t just happen on its own. So start working on this skill to add it to improve your learning. Observe and reflect By observing life\u2019s experiences around us and careful reflection of what we observe, we can gather facts and information to learn new solutions and methods. Increase your ability to \u2018connect the dots\u2019 around you. Take notes and revisit them often. Embrace the mess of complex learning. In this new world of continuous learning, we are all teachers as well as learners. We realize learning is often an ugly task. Accept that the process of trial and error is an acceptable learning process. Employ novelty Our brains pay more attention to things in the environment that are new to our experience. So, seek out as many new experiences to try as you can handle and become an explorer. Accept failure We need to be learners that ask hard questions and explore what might work and what won\u2019t. As a learner, we need to accept failure so we can use often times messy trial and error. Make failures and mistakes as learning sources (and the mistakes and failures need not be yours). More on failure: Learning from Failure ... How Much Have You Learned? Use emotion We as learners respond to things around ourselves that elicit emotion. Put emotional stories to work to create a stimulus-response learning process. Listen for inspirational and emotional stories and use them as experiential learning for yourself and those around you. Connect and collaborate Connecting with others in the internet world is a great way to share ideas and solicit feedback, new views, and ideas. Once you have found some interesting connections who share like goals, try a collaboration project or two. Collaboration is an excellent way to expand learning in a sharing environment.

The big thing is for you to visit the colleges and see which one you fit in better. Also a lot of the rankings are based on things like networking opportunities. The standard computer science curriculum are pretty standard, so the thing that makes once college \u201cbetter\u201d than another are things like the ability for them to get you a job. OTOH, if the college happens to be in a high tech center, then this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Also, there might be a huge difference between #1 and #200, but differences between #2 and #3 or #50 and #60 are pretty much irrelevant. ",

You can go very far down the rankings and get a great education. But managers often have neither the time nor the expertise to evaluate your education. So the name of the school is an excellent shorthand. It leads to a lot of industry groupthink, so I think it's problematic. But if you want to work in those businesses, you probably need the school name. ",

So choose happiness, and you will be choosing the more successful path, both in your professional and personal life. Besides, most college-educated people went to universities that aren't in the top 50. Most of them are doing just fine. ",

If the costs of attendance that are the same, you can use relative ranking surveys as a tie breaker to choose one over the other. However, it is not clear which ranking survey you would use. For example, does it make sense to use graduate computer science ranking to choose an undergraduate program? Or should you use the undergraduate ranking? When you have acceptances where you know the cost of attendance and if you want my opinion, contact me again. ",
