            "answer_text": "It might theoretically be possible, but it\u2019s certainly not probable. The vast majority of educational institutions focus their merit-based financial aid on students entering as freshman. In addition, public schools hardly ever use their limited financial aid budgets to help international students, even those who enter as freshmen. Instead, international students are expected to pay full tuition and expenses as a way of stabilizing the university\u2019s bottom line. Finally, for both public and private schools, any financial aid that is reserved for transfer students often goes to those students who (for financial or other personal reasons) have completed their first two years at a community college. In summary, it\u2019s possible that some college or university somewhere has a full merit aid scholarship available for an international student entering as a transfer, but the likelihood is vanishingly small.
