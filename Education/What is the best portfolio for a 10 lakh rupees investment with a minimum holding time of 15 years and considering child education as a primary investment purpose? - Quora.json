            "answer_text": "Since it is a one time investment, a combination of equity/debt/gold mutual funds will be ideal. Since the period of investment is long, a major part of this corpus can be in equity mutual funds, about 30 % in debt, and 5\u201310 % in gold. Equity mutual funds - it is better to stagger the investments rather than one time. It is also important to re-balance this portfolio regularly, to maximize the risk adjusted returns.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, please consider investing in mutual funds. Yes, investing in mutual funds are subjected to market risk but if stayed invested for more than 10 years then there are good chances of getting better returns though key here is selection and tracking of funds. Say if you invest Rs. 10 lakh and if the fund gives a return of 10% in 15 years then your returns would be close to Rs. 41.77 lakhs. Consider investing in health and term insurance to, if planning to invest in mutual funds. For further discussion, please message me in Quora or through email, id in my profile. Arun ",
