            "answer_text": "Student test scores should never be used to evaluate teachers\u2014ever. They shouldn\u2019t be used in isolation to determine a student\u2019s fate, either. You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want accountability.\u201d That\u2019s not the reason. Here are the reasons: We do not know who or what affected the test scores and what those scores mean without doing further layer sof analysis\u2014especially in upper grades where kids have multiple teachers.Most educators aren\u2019t data trained.You can\u2019t look at a score and attribute it to a single teacher or circumstance. That\u2019s not how data works. Unfortunately, that\u2019s how education is misusing data. It\u2019s causing kids and teachers undue stress, and often gives the (untrained) educators using the data incorrect information. Most educators dealing with the new age of data are not data scientists, not even data trained. Heck, I never even took a stat class in school, because \u201ccollege\u201d tracked kids had to take calculus, not stat or data analysis. If you\u2019re lucky in grad school\u2014as a scientist, social scientist, or mathematician\u2014you\u2019ll get some quantitative data analysis, bell curves, standard deviations, and petri dish numbers that make big data accessible to you. That\u2019s not the norm for most people dealing with high-stakes data in schools today. To correctly use all the data we\u2019re now collecting, you have to know how data works. We have to ask a million more questions, and get those answers, too. Did the kid eat that day?What happened before the test?What teachers did these high/low-score students have LAST year?Is there a bias we can\u2019t spot on this test?Is there a regional or micro-difference in response to a test or question?How does School A/State A handle this type of curriculum?Where and how was the test delivered?What\u2019s the test used for in this space? Do students know?I would love to say I\u2019m responsible for every successful kid I\u2019ve ever taught, but the truth is this\u2014most would\u2019ve done well with or without me. Heck, maybe they all had YOU last year, and you\u2019re the hero, but you just got a bad eval because the guy before you was out half the year. It\u2019s hard to know. More importantly, it\u2019s impossible to know with the legal certainty you need to fire people over this data. Test data can\u2019t tell us why a student is doing well or poorly this year. It can only give us the next questions to ask to get to the information we want. Here are some of the many reasons test data may not indicate student knowledge: Many students fear tests, and no matter what I do, they freeze.Test environments aren\u2019t realistic\u2014When do we ever say, \u201cBe quiet, don\u2019t check your phone, no food, one tab open only, no music or conversation,\u201d in our own work or class? We\u2019re doing old-school testing for a collaborative generation.There are studies that show historically-low performing subgroups of kids do not have achievement gaps on tests if you don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s The Test. If you say, \u201cactivity\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re testing out some questions\u2026\u201d they achieve at the same level as their peers.Adults write the questions. Sometimes adults miss the mark, but kids can\u2019t ask for clarification. In class, they can.There are, in fact, bad questions. I\u2019ve seen many in my research areas on practice tests that were outright wrong.Tests are designed to see what kids know and don\u2019t know. When students start seeing the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d problems, especially in math, they often shut down. In real life, we wouldn\u2019t put those questions on a test.These are all arguments why standardized tests may or may not accurately measure students. Your question was about teacher evaluation. When tests are used as part of evals, teachers become fearful. Many teach to the test. Some even cheat. Teaching to the test gives kids a bad classroom experience. It kills creativity over time. It\u2019s boring. Students ask, \u201cIs it going to be on the test?\u201d and \u201cWhat do I have to put for the test?\u201d This is lower-level learning. I want school to be something kids look forward to\u2014where they go to learn passions. Right now, increasing numbers are not engaged. Another reason not to use either standardized test scores for teacher evaluations: kids are improperly empowered. I\u2019ve personally experienced and seen students try to influence teacher evaluations in both directions. They know the elements of teacher evaluation. I\u2019ve heard kids say, \u201cWe got Mr. So and So fired!\u201d with pride. They misbehaved during observations or did poorly on purpose on the teacher-designed evaluation data because they didn\u2019t like a teacher. Unacceptable. They tried harder for the teachers they liked. They were very open about this. You can\u2019t use uncertain, non-scientific measures for high-stakes purposes. This includes using test data to determine student graduation, too. Here\u2019s how you can use the data: You can use the data as a \u201cformative assessment,\u201d to help you spot trends. You can then look at data and trends, and make some initial predictions about the \u201cwhys\u201d and then do a lot of further investigation to look for causality. In mainstream tech, there are companies and PhD data scientists who deal exclusively with data, because identifying correct underlying causes and effects can cost a company millions. Yet in education, we\u2019re use The Test along with some circumstantial background info to say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d Doing this is about as accurate as playing drunk darts in a bar, blindfolded. Not every evaluator needs to be high-level data trained. Evaluating teachers is a relationship art. You have to be in their classrooms every day, so you feel like part of the fabric. You have to know teachers, students, and the minute-to-minute front line challenges. If you do, you\u2019ll get a much better picture of where your pockets of success truly lie. You won\u2019t get the real answer using test scores. ",

            "answer_text": "It would be if all things were equal in the classroom. If every teacher had exactly the same as every other teacher in terms of the ability and motivation of their students it would work. This is not possible and can easily be manipulated to make sure the opposite is true. Let us say there are three teachers teaching the same subject. One is good friends with the principal. He gets the gifted and talented students due to this connection. The other two are split between one teacher the principal is o.k. with and the other he would like to see retire so he can hire another friend of his. The first gets students of random and average ability. The one he would like to see retire now gets the students with IEP\u2019s and learning disabilities. The first gets awards for teaching based on test scores and the third is forced to retire. This type of thing happens in schools more commonly than you think. Evaluating teachers based on test scores is like evaluating dentists based on their patients annual checkup. Too many cavities in a year among their patients and they lose their license. Do you think as professionals dentists would accept this plan? Why are teachers treated any less as professionals? ",
