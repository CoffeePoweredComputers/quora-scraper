            "answer_text": "First, I am biased having been a public school teacher, then a school founder and leader.  However, I feel that the data and information I present will speak for itself.  Public schools are far better for the students at the poles - very high and low achieving - for various important reasons. Only in states and localities that tend to have weak school systems do private schools work as viable options, but even in these cases, this is not because they are better, rather they are less bad than already unacceptable schools. There are three major reasons that private schools fail to do the best for our children, however none of them can make up for population bias and local public school failure in certain contexts. Three Reasons Teachers: Public school teachers are far more likely to be certified and have degrees in their chosen fields, and they are better paid and supported. The median income of a public school teacher is now and has been for over a decade roughly 13 thousand dollars more on average than that of a private school teacher.  Further, private school teachers tend to have far shorter terms, as many do not see teaching as a profession, but rather an interim job. Many independent schools counter that this allows them to have, for example, smaller class sizes.  It does - but only negligibly - the average class size in a public elementary school is 20.3, while in a private school that is 18.1. And, because of teacher certification renewal requirements, the average public school teacher is roughly 90% more likely to be continuing their education while teaching. This means that private schools attract less committed, less qualified, and less educated teachers on the whole - hardly a great way to nurture a particularly bright child. Standards: While private schools often reflect rigorous goals through custom curricula, their implementation is unaccountable.  That's because private schools are exempt from many state tests. This means that many students go through private schools with major gaps in their learning because that particular school didn't focus on that core unit of study. This might seem arbitrary, especially for advanced students, but in fact, lt has to do with overall structure. Regardless of your position on the teaching of X before Y, when you have advanced students who you want to push to Z, you have to have a decent roadmap.  Finally, many private schools - again, run by under qualified educators - make misguided choices that are developmentally inappropriate and not educationally sound. Schools for example that introduce Latin at early ages, but whose pupils never gain traction in the language, or schools that focus on \"core\" or \"fundamental\" math and science skills, but eschew what are now common practices of tangible, creative learning. Sometimes, a class that looks good on the brochure is not necessarily good for the kids. Resources: The most damning argument against private schools for the pole kids is that they are too small to handle them appropriately. The numbers are striking. There are 120,000 elementary schools in the US, 28,220 of those are private or independent. This is not  small number, but it's a hint of what's below. Every one of those schools, being independent, has exactly as many resources as it has. If a student is particularly bright in the fifth grade, you can push them to the sixth - but you can't push infinitely. In contrast, public school systems are large enough to support Gifted and Talented programs, magnet and charter schools, and will expose a talented child to more varied and more diverse experiences. And, since reciprocity and school choice laws exist in most states, even if a school system can't provide those services, a student has the right to attend another school with more adequate supports.  In fact, the gifted and talented stream or trajectory is both more formalized and more robust in even the more mediocre public schools than any private one. The private schools will point to numbers like higher mean test scores and higher admission rates, but these are based on population-biased data. Public schools serve our poor, our immigrants, and our children with special learning needs. Take those away and put children of the same socio-economic backgrounds together and public schools are far stronger.  Then, look at how the schools add up. The average private school is half the size of the average public one - this means fewer resources and fewer options - for example, what do you do when you have only one teacher and... you don't like that teacher. The one, and you can argue whether this is a good or a bad thing - differentiator between public and private schools is self-selection bias. That is, the kids in the private school have parents who chose to send them there - and those kids tend to be more focused, better off, and come from more educated parents. A bias, we'll note, that is canceled out in any upscale neighborhood or suburb where well-heeled parents choose to send their kids to great public schools.  There are many factors that determine how well your intelligent child will do in life, and the most important ones are you and your education. This followed by your salary, your neighborhood, the region of the country in which they live, and finally, school choices. In a public school, your child can thrive and if he doesn't, there are various transparent options by which you can change the system.  At a private school, you will pay for the pleasure of having less say and less transparency.  If you live in a town or locality with terrible schools, you could consider private schools - or you could move. Either way, your child will surely be successful if you are already this engaged in their learning journey. ",

            "answer_text": "YThe Private and public schools are different beasts with different politics and are beholden to different constituents. Your brand name private schools like Dalton or Riverdale are extremely expensive and by virtue of that expense filter out a large body of students. Low income children, unless they are extremely gifted, will not be attending. Neither will special needs students and neither will students for whom English is a second language unless they are very wealthy and English just happens to be a fluent second language. Private school students, by virtue of the economic filtering mechanism, will be an overall much more homogenous bunch then public school students.   Private schools also reserve the right to expel students if the student performs poorly or causes trouble. Public school rarely has the ability to do this unless the student is violent. This means that teaching private school will be very different than teaching public school. To some extent teaching private school requires significantly less classroom management skill because students can be self motivated. Private schools are catering to a wealthy, usually well educated group that views education in terms of a customer/employee relationship. As such parents can hold a lot of sway over educational policy.  Because private school has an image to uphold pedigree is exceedingly important; many private school teachers at top schools hold PhDs and most of the teachers have graduated from top schools.  A teacher has to be very careful about making sure he/she grades very clearly and there is no room for doubt because this can lead to serious ramifications.  It's not unheard of for parents to complain about grades because of expectations that their child will attend an a Ivy League university. Public school, with rare exception,  does not have \"customers\". The focus for teachers is on classroom management and ensuring that students pass and do well on state exams. This is the main metric of success for a public school teacher. There is a reason teaching private school pays less; it tends to be a lot easier in many respects! To answer your question... Private schools tend to filter out the \"difficult\" students and allow private school teachers to focus on conveying information to their students. The students also tend to come from a world that values good grades and the opportunity to go to big name colleges. This doesn't mean that they are smarter as individuals but I would be comfortable in presuming that the median intellectual level (due to economic realities as opposed to IQ) at a private school is higher than the median intellectual level at your typical public school of comparable size.

Generally I think you may be better off spending the cash on additional educational and tangentially educational activities than directly on traditional schooling. Hire a tutor if they need one, take them to museums and foreign countries, build a proper home library (i really find it weird how few books some people own) ect Lets say tuition is $10000 a year and they're studying the Romans, is it better to A: pay for private school, or B: take them on holiday to Europe to see the Hadrian's wall, Trier, Rome ect and grab hold of a documentary or period drama on DVD? Personally I'd go for the second option. ",
