            "answer_text": "Talking about NTSE Stage 2, I had prepared hard, day-night to crack NTSE. I had started my preparations when I was in class IX. Initially, I had started preparing for the MAT section during summer vacations. I aimed to get the title \u2018NTSE Scholar\u2019 as it is one of the prestigious examinations of the country. This aim was stuck in my mind when I saw the prestige of one of my senior in the school who has cracked NTSE recently that year. When I thought to crack NTSE at that moment, I do not actually know about the scholarship details I was just attracted towards the prestige one gets after becoming an NTSE scholar J. Later on when I had researched about NTSE, I came to know about the details of NTSE and also realised that scholarship is one of the most important reasons why students wanted to crack NTSE. I have prepared for NTSE with proper planning. I divided the whole syllabus into the parts and distributed the time I have to devote to each topic. I wanted to prepare for the MAT and SATequally, so I managed to give proper time to each one. I had taken a subscription of NTSEGuru as it is a leading online platform for NTSE. I prepared day by day by studying through NTSE Guru video lectures for Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology & Social Science. I also solved the entire practice sheets available on the portal for all the subjects. For thorough preparations, I have gone through All India test-series by NTSEGuru. It is one of the best features of NTSEGuru since it allows you to know your status by comparing yourself with all India NTSE aspirants. When my NTSE stage 1 was near, I was confident to crack the exam. Finally, after the NTSE Stage-1 result declared I was a bit relaxed as I scored 184/200, but I was expecting around 190. One hurdle got cleared now it is time for second hurdle i.e. NTSE Stage 2. I wanted to score better than NTSE Stage I this time. So, I had doubled my studying speed with accuracy. This time I have solved more previous year question papers as suggested by NTSEGuru expert Prof. Vipin Joshi Sir in his videos. Also, solved n number of practice papers and sample papers. At last, my NTSE Stage 2 examination went well. All these happen because of NTSEGuru, it provided track to my NTSE preparations and gave me the confidence in cracking NTSE Stage 2. On the whole, I can say it depends upon your efforts and hard work to get the result you have expected but the right platform plays a very important role in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Even after a year now, I cannot forget the experience of last year\u2019s NTSE Stage 2 Examination. So, I am from Kolkata and in the Stage 1 Exam, I suffered a lot because of the difficulty of the WBBSE Social Science (I am a student of CBSE Board). I just managed to squeeze in on the 152 cut-off for general (in-fact i got 152 sharp :-D) . Next came the stage 2 exam. Many of the toppers of stage 1 from my FIITJEE North Kolkata Centre also had the exam there. I felt nervous seeing them. I thought \u201cI have to be 1 in 4 to become an NTSE Scholar (Extremely unlikely)\u201d . So without thinking of anything else I got into the exam hall. The First Paper was MAT (Mental Ability Test). It was expected to be a lenghty paper and around 75 score was possible. However to the WORST of my FEARS the paper was just the OPPOSITE. God damn it was so hard. And like the previous person mentioned, past years\u2019 papers seemed exceedingly easy. Nonetheless I attempted as many questions as i could and guess marked the ones i couldn\u2019t since there was NO NEGATIVE MARKING. I attempted around 75 questions. I came out of the hall and to my dismay on matching answers with my topper friends it was quite evident that i screwed up a LOT. I predicted my score to be around 60\u201365 out of 100. Next came the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test). I was the worst SAT paper i had attempted in my life. The Standard of Questions was very hard (For those who think SAT is easy I would say that doing Phy,Chem,Maths,Bio,SST especially SST of CBSE of 9 and 10 is EXTREMELY HARD). Past papers seemed like a joke. I thought \u201cWas I so unprepared?\u201d. Even SST questions which was meant to be scoring included tricky questions and even included Calculations (YES YOU READ IT RIGHT). Chemistry, Physics and Biology were scoring but were lengthy. Overall I had a nightmare experience throughout the exam. I came out of the exam hall but couldn\u2019t tell my parents my experience. I was simply shattered that after making it this far i would fail. Such a shame. My expectation in this paper was around 65\u201367. A month before the exam I had attended the ALLEN NTSE Workshop. The faculties were very good (Even our FIITJEE teachers were also very good). There every teacher told that the cut off expected would be around 170 for 2019. I couldn\u2019t believe myself what a mess I had made. Even my maximum possible marks were around 132. Then came 6th September\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Finally the NTSE result was declared. AND THE CUTOFF WAS 134. And I got 136 (Yayyyyyy). I was overjoyed beyond words. But how did this really happen???? INFACT ON A GREATER ANALYSIS OF THE ANSWER KEY, I found out that infact it was SST that had saved the day. Out of 40 marks SST i got 31. In my MAT paper I got 69, which was a good score on a tough paper. I got 67 in SAT. So for all NTSE Stage 2 candidates i would recommend one thing: Please study SST and practise MAT seriously\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. These are the backbone of your Score. Other subjects are like Force Multipliers which enhance your score.And do not lose focus during the exam. In order to ace an exam you need to manage it properly. Hope this helps. Cheers!!!!
