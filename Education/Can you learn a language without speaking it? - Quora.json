            "answer_text": "Yes, the entire subcontinent is a living breathing example of people who learn English without speaking it. Most people of subcontinent who think they can speak English are in for a big surprise when they step into an actual English-speaking country. I have seen people from South Asia with masters degrees in English, people who used to teach English not being able to articulate a single sentence in the language when it comes to convey a simple verbal communication about something as simple as giving directions. Written English is a completely different animal from what people of English-speaking countries use in their daily lives. They problem is that many South Asians do not even try to shed the bad lingual habits that they picked up while learning English in school. These habits are forced upon the students because this is how their teachers were taught. The more they think they know English less flexible they are in their conversation-style or improve their language. The ones who think they know how to speak English speak the worst type of the language. Heck, I\u2019ve had similar experience with Arabic too. Back in the day, when learned Arabic was still fresh in my mind, I tried using it in Saudi Arabia. Big mistake. After two such failed attempts, I started to learn the language anew from the locals, and tried forgetting what I had read in books. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not the same question than the one I received by email: How is it possible to understand a language without speaking it? This happens frequently when parents communicate in a language but don\u2019t use it when talking to their offsprings. The children will generally have a good to excellent understanding of this language without being able to speak it. This is encountered very frequently in many countries where immigrants think they must speak to their children in the local language, a language their master very poorly/with a strong accent. The children will generally continue speaking the local language of the country they were born in with all the defects the parents have taught them while being unable to revert to the parental language. Their own children will loose also the understanding, unless they live also with the grand-parents. This is how languages are lost in a family, in two steps. The speech is lost first, the understanding in the next generation. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you could learn to read and write in a foreign language, but wouldn't you want at least to listen to it even if you never had the opportunity to speak it? To watch the TV and listen to the radio? To sing songs and say \u2018good morning\u2019 to people? To maybe take a little holiday where you could use the language? You will be missing a great deal if you don't learn to speak or understand the spoken language. Most languages sound very different from your language - and if you don't hear it, you won't know how the words are pronounced. Language is about communication, remember that. ",

If you do not know how to speak a language, how are you going to communicate with people who know that language? For instance, if an arm is missing from the body of a person, that person is disable. If the speaking is missing, that means the person has a language disability. His or her language is not complete. When a student wants to learn a new language, he or she must learn how to write, read, listen and speak that language. If one component is missing, your language is disable. ",

I think the answer is \u2018No\u2019. Now I see the question is \u2018can you learn a language without speaking it\u2019, and the answer is \u2018Yes\u2019. Many people learn Latin, Greek, Aramaic, Sanskrit, and other languages in just such a way. It takes many years of dedicated work to get good, however. It also helps if you work on acquiring an active knowledge of the language so that you could speak it, if given the opportunity. ",

Obvious examples include Latin, ancient Greek, and Sanskrit, where opportunities to use them in conversation are rare. But it's probably even more common for living languages that provide plenty of texts to study. For research, I can adequately read documents in Italian and Spanish but I couldn't really put a sentence together. ",

I have studied Japanese independently for several years, and still have a few more to go before I\u2019ll be fluent, or near-fluent in reading and writing it. My original motive in taking up Japanese was to read the language--literature, news, magazines, etc.\u2014because I am interested in the mindset of the Japanese people. I\u2019m getting better. I think I could pass JLPT3, or whatever its current name is, and on a good day I think I could pass JLPT2. Several years, plus a few more to go\u2014a long time because I seldom study spoken Japanese. So, with that in mind, in my opinion maybe one\u2019s progress is slower if one studies only written Japanese, but I believe one can become fluent in written Japanese, given enough time and effort.
