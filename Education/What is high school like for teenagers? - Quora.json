            "answer_text": "It has its problems, but it\u2019s way better than middle school by a long shot. Middle school is a pretty horrid place. Everyone judges you, ridicules you, you feel confused and angry and scared because you\u2019re now not considered a child anymore, but many are not mature enough to accept that. There\u2019s more teasing, harassment, and pressure to conform. Middle schoolers feel like they have to be popular or have a boy/girlfriend to be happy. Most focus on their looks. The teachers are hard on you, your parents are hard on you, it\u2019s probably going to be the worst years of your life. High school is not all roses either, but now that all your peers are more mature, it\u2019s easier to handle. You\u2019ve begun to sort through all these new, confusing emotions and physical changes and you know how to handle the adult world better. Be prepared to have more freedom and independence, but also more responsibility. A big downside is that the stress levels skyrocket due to trying to keep up good grades, a good social life, family life, going to classes, building your resume, applying to jobs and colleges, and maybe even keeping up in a relationship. A lot more\u2019s expected of you and you\u2019ll suddenly have a lot of things on your plate at once. You will cry. If you don\u2019t cry in high school at least four times every year, then either you\u2019re not challenging yourself enough or you have a serious medical condition that renders tear ducts useless. Just make sure not to drown under all that work and don\u2019t don\u2019t don\u2019t procrastinate. ",

            "answer_text": "High school is like\u2026 well\u2026 ummm\u2026. I can only explain through simile\u2026 Soooooooo Imagine a world filled with candy. The trees are cotton candy, and the trunks are candy canes. The water is liquid chocolate and the buildings are gingerbread. Nothing ever goes wrong in this candy world, and you are loved by all of it\u2019s sourpatch kids, and eat imported swedish fish. It\u2019s life in luxury! This is high school for some. Now, imagine this: everywhere you look there is fire. The trees are scorched lumps of carbon, and the water is lava. You are endlessly told to do painful, long work by the cruel devilish overlords. You have no friends, as everyone around you is just as spiteful as you are and won\u2019t accept one another. Also, the food is terrible, chunks of charred bagels and pickled liverwurst. The literal embodiment of Hell. This is how high school seems many teenagers. Everyone\u2019s high school experience is different, some have better experiences, others have worse. Everybody falls on this spectrum, from absolute hell, to paradise. If you were to ask me, I\u2019s say that I\u2019m deffinetly on the paradise side of the spectrum. I love my teachers and my classes, and I have excellent grades. I also have great food (mostly because I pack my lunch\u2026) and enjoy my time with other students. I love high school, but I can see how it can SUCK for others. High school, as I have said, is very subjective, and is all depends on the particular person. ",
