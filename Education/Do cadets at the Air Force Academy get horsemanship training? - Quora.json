            "answer_text": "When I was at the Academy in 1977\u201378, there was no mandatory horsemanship training, and I don\u2019t believe they have introduced it since that time. There were stables available for recreational riding, and I would be willing to bet that there were excellent instructors available. We did have quite a number of mandatory sports instruction classes, including swimming and water survival, boxing, wrestling, gymnastics, judo, golf, tennis, etc. ",
