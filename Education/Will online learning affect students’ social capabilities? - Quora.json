I\u2019m never afraid of public speaking (I like the attention), but whenever I need to talk on zoom I close up! Sometimes, I don\u2019t like to turn on my camera because I feel it invades my privacy. 4TH AMENDMENT, PEOPLE! Anyways, distance learning is destroying and ruining our lives, piece by piece, bit by bit. Soon we will be mindless robots glued to our devices. -Pablo 12 year old ",
