            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been a very rough start, but I\u2019m getting situated slowly. Transitioning from a public high school to a private college, is a radical one. I\u2019m going fo Fordham University (LC Campus), and I\u2019m not forming there. So obviously fist off, it was very difficult to adapt commuting all the way from my house to there by train, it takes around 45 min- 1 hour to get there, and on top of that I have morning classes (I came late to course registration and I got fucked with 8:30 AM and three hour long classes). In high school, I took just a bus and it took like 20 mins to get there, now combine that with the monstrosity that is the 1 Train to South Ferry (and everybody loves that commute on a weekday morning in the rain.) Getting used to the schedule was difficult too, on Tuesdays and Fridays I have a 3 hour break between classes, and the first 2 weeks it was the most boring and soul crushing thing ever, I just sat in the lounge or took a walk at Central Park but the time still didn\u2019t pass. And I don't have classes on Mondays and Thursdays and I just sat at home all alone with all this time on my hands. But now that the work is slowly coming in, all the free time and breaks I have is now a blessing for me to get assignments done and get ahead on some reading. Then there are the classes itself, I am taking 5 courses this semester, and anyone who went to Fordham knows of our intense core curriculum, I\u2019m taking intro French II, Modern Euro History, a theology class called Faith and reasoning (which is the 3 hour lecture), Basic Macroeconomics, and English Composition I. All my classes are fine, interesting, and have great professors, except for the dreaded macro class, the professor is an 81 year old guy who just puts up slides with complex economics terms and graphs and doesn't explain them in simple details leaving the class confused most of the time (thank god he gives open textbook tests). And my French teacher forced us to buy the textbook from the college bookstore, and when I went to get it, it 270 fucking dollars FOR AN INTRODUCTORY FRENCH COURSE!!! Luckily my other teachers are lenient on books. Oh and the 100+ pages of reading I have to face on a weekly basis has been a nightmare for me, the language is old and complicated and within two minutes there all just letters with no meaning to me. That gets in financials, no more free metro-cards, free lunch or textbooks. It\u2019s all on me now, and I\u2019ve already spent hundreds within a month. So thats a big challenge I\u2019ve had to face and will face in my next four years (and I\u2019ve already had a lot of trouble with Fordham\u2019s Financial Aid department). Sorry for the rant, doesn\u2019t answer the question much, just had to get it out there. Besides all the negative things, the people here are super friendly. I\u2019ve always been given the impression that Fordham is mostly stereotypical rich white kids who get all the perks of being residents, which is true, but the LC campus is has a diverse body students from all racial and economics backgrounds. And there are tons of Bengalis here in contrast to my high school so it\u2019s great to be surrounded more by those of my background. I\u2019ve already made tons of friends and joined many clubs and organizations. Also here at Fordham we have someone called a \u201cfreshman mentor\u201d who is an upper class men who is kind of like your counselor who helps you around and takes you and your group out on outings and those have been fun so far. And almost every other week there are some kind of after school activities like game nights and other social events. Here and there you can get free food and snacks so thats cool. So the campus is very active and engaged you to socialize and make connections. As for the situation of money, there are tons of on campus jobs to go around, I applied to a few this week so hopefully I can get something good, and of course it\u2019s prime location in NYC definitely opens to lots of oppurnities. There are lots of obstacles ahead and I need more time to adjust, but I\u2019m liking it so far. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been a pretty amazing experience. I\u2019ve met a fair share of people from orientation, classes, and club recruitment. I\u2019ve met so many passionate and hard working people which has been a stark difference from my high school peers. It felt kind of intimidating at first to be surrounded by so many smart people but now it feels amazing to have deep conversations with so many people. Moreover, I feel pretty darn lucky to have 2 amazing and fun roommates considering I chose to randomly be paired with roommates. I\u2019ve also joined an amazing club called The Berkeley Group which provides pro bono services for Bay Area non-profits. So far, I\u2019ve been amazed at how down-to-earth and welcoming all the members are. When I had to miss one of the meetings, the Internal Vice President offered to take time out of her day to recap all the content I missed out on. Moreover, we had a retreat recently where we spent a weekend in Truckee, CA near Lake Tahoe. Overall, it was a really great experience visiting Lake Tahoe, partying, and chilling with other members. The only downside is that the coursework is pretty heavy. We are expected to read quite a lot of readings every day (sometimes 100+ pages). Another downside is that it\u2019s pretty hard to balance everything I want to do from work, academics, exercise, and clubs. To be honest, I\u2019ve been pretty stressed from midterms and balancing that with my other commitments. Nevertheless, it\u2019s always helpful to be surrounded by really supportive friends who are there to listen to you rant. So, overall, it\u2019s been a overwhelmingly positive experience with the only downside of a heavy workload. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, it\u2019s going pretty great. At first, I was extremely nervous about meeting new people and actually making friends, but RPI is apparently entirely aware of the fact that about 80% of its students are at least a little bit awkward. This means that they plan what is about a week (if you go on the overnight trip) of icebreakers for incoming freshman. I ended up meeting a few good friends in that time and I also have some very chill people who hang out in my dorm lounge and sometimes watch movies at 3 AM. So, that turned out much better than expected. I also love living more or less on my own. I\u2019ve always be a bit more independent, so it feels really good to have almost complete control over my schedule. There are just tons of things to do and I feel like I can pretty much do anything I want to if I try hard enough to fit it in my schedule. Other than that, the campus is much prettier than I expected (for some reason they show you all the ugly buildings plus empac when you go on your tour).  Also, the classes are intense but in a good way and most of the professors and faculty seem genuinely nice. There are tons of great resources at RPI and the faculty are not shy to let you know how to use them. The upperclassmen are also really nice for the most part and don\u2019t tend to talk down to you too much just because you\u2019re a freshman, so it\u2019s definitely a much different atmosphere from high school. Honestly, the only problems I\u2019ve run into with classes are communication problems. Some professors/TAs are somewhat ironically not great with technology or are just hard to understand because of accents and it can be a bit of barrier. I haven\u2019t into any major problems, though. The only real problem I\u2019ve been facing is a bit more personal and has less to do with school so I have a bit more stress than I might normally, but it really has mostly been good news. I feel slightly bad for being so cynical before I got to campus. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite frankly, I\u2019m loving it. Yeah there are pros and cons like with everything. But all in all, I\u2019m really happy now. I\u2019ve been in college for a few weeks now and everything (well almost everything) has been great. In my high school, despite having \u201cfriends\u201d I felt very alone and going to school every day was torture to me. The first day moving into my dorms was quite scary. I\u2019m a very imaginative person so I always imagined College being my place to make great friends and have just have a jolly good old time. Yet, I also hate getting disappointed, so when I realize that I\u2019m putting my hopes too high, I tend to try to bring down my imagination. But even still, I made friends within the first few days, and I am way more content than I ever was at my old school. Of course, the differences are still jarring. I went to a very preppy high school where I was drowning in work and felt pressure everywhere I went. Now in college, I feel like I have enough time to get my work done and have fun too. There are some things I hate. I live really close to home, but decided on the dorm life because 1. I don\u2019t drive and 2. I wanted to enjoy life on campus. I go home every weekend which is a blessing since I love and miss my family every week. But coming back on campus every Sunday is such a hassle and getting back into bed is annoying. I have 5 other roommates so having to ensure that I\u2019m not annoying or disturbing each of them is a difficult task. (Of course, some of the roommates are my friends actually). I have also experienced more drama, but that is because I have thrown myself out there more. I talk to more people, hang out at the campus ministry in my office, so there\u2019s bound to be more people coming up to me and asking for my number. Since I used to go to an all girl school and was usually very quiet there, I didn\u2019t experience that. It is a very new experience with so many differences from my old school. There are times that I actually miss my old school and the tranquility. But then I remember how sad I was every day to go to school and walk around lunch alone. And then I remember that now, I always have someone to talk to, no matter who. I have engaging classes and lots of time in between and a beautiful campus to walk around. And just when I start missing home, I come right back and spend a few days with my family. I really can\u2019t believe how happy I actually am, that I get to complain about how easy my classes are and get to stress out about someone asking me out. Yes there are times where I just want to leave. Last week in particular was hard for me on so many different levels. But all in all, everyday has a new adventure to bring. There are so many things I have yet to do, and I can\u2019t wait what the next few years hold. I am finally content despite the obstacles that cause me anger and sadness sometimes. But I am mostly happy, which is what matters. I just hope it stays that way. ",

            "answer_text": "I love a good ol\u2019 reflection. Hopkins 2022 here.  High school wasn't the best time of my life, so I was more than ready to move across the country to start my life as a college student. Move-in and orientation (August 24\u201329) I said good-bye to my parents and hello to my new Hopkins family. The first few days were definitely a little awkward as most people didn\u2019t know anyone or were just meeting their friends that they had connected with via social media over the past few months. Orientation was filled with activities to help us get to know our peers, the campus, and Baltimore. I had a decent time but was ready for classes and clubs to begin. August 30-today We are about a month in, and the grind has officially started. I have a neuroscience midterm tomorrow (which I should be studying for but I haven\u2019t posted in the past two days) and a chemistry midterm Friday. Yes, some people are stress messes; they are freaking out because they are taking on too much. However, my classes are challenging yet manageable. I feel that if you stay up on your schoolwork and prioritize it, there\u2019s no need to be overly stressed and pull all-nighters. That\u2019s why I\u2019m on Quora right now and not cramming: I\u2019ve already put in all of the work I believe is necessary to succeed tomorrow. Right now, I have one solid go-to friend. In addition, I have a few groups that I usually study or hang out with. Friendships take time to develop, so I\u2019m sure my relationships will deepen with time. Exciting news As of today, I am an official Hopkins admissions volunteer. This means that I will be able to lead campus tours and have coffee with and interview prospective students. I\u2019m hoping to be a featured writer on Hopkins Insider, which is a website where current students write about their experiences as Hopkins students. If you\u2019re interested in Hopkins, I encourage you to check out the website. Here\u2019s the cute little envelope that had my acceptance letter for Blue Key (admissions volunteers). I\u2019m beginning research soon. Some of my long-time followers know that a vital reason I chose Hopkins was because my doctor practices and conducts research at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. I finally had a chance to meet with him today for a doctors appointment and to discuss research. When I asked when I could start, he said to email him and let him know whenever I\u2019m ready. He\u2019s such a stud! I\u2019m going to wait and see how my midterms go, and if I perform well, I will contact him and hopefully start within the next few weeks! I\u2019m so pumped.Concluding thoughts I love it here. I wasn\u2019t sure if I made the right choice in the beginning, but now that I am here, have so many opportunities, and have already met great people, I couldn\u2019t be happier. \u2014KH Tbh, I hate chem lab with a passion, though, but that\u2019s a story for a different day.

            "answer_text": " I literally just started university last Sunday which means that the past week has been freshers week - essentially a week of partying and exploring the university (providing that's your thing, it wasn\u2019t mine). To start off, the University of Surrey itself has been amazing, the campus is beautiful, the buildings are mostly modern and up to date and my accommodation has been excellent.  The University of Surrey - the campus itself is really nice My room, although basic, is a good size and very clean so overall I\u2019m happy. Luckily for me, I live directly on campus meaning everything is less than 10 minutes away from me so that\u2019s a huge plus to my accommodation.  It was clean until I moved in that is :) Throughout freshers week, we had many talks and seminars about services and departments at our disposal during our time at the University, which were fairly interesting as I knew very little about what the University had to offer (Should have researched a bit harder probably). Unfortunately, these talks were rather few and far between which meant that I had a lot of down time which, I am ashamed to admit, was spent mostly in my flat, in my room. Despite my flatmates being nice people who included me during the first few nights in playing cards, Mario Kart etc, they inevitably left to go to clubs and to party which is, for me, the antithesis of fun. I may have sat in my room watching the Office during these evenings. I have a horrible feeling I may have to socialise at University. Anyway, I begin my course properly this coming Monday which is both a relief, as I will be occupied most days, and yet it is terrifying too as my confidence in my abilities isn\u2019t very strong despite my A-level grades. I guess it doesn\u2019t help that I struggled to use a microscope during my lab induction, especially since I\u2019m doing microbiology. During the induction, I was paired with a girl who had come to the UK from Cyprus, making things quite interesting. The lab itself was massive, spotless and blew everything my secondary school had to offer out of the water, making me more excited for my course.  The lab itself It also was around this time we received our lab gear which we bought online a week before we joined the university. Now, I wasn\u2019t officially allowed to open it from its packaging due to concerns of contamination but I couldn't resist trying the lab coat on (We have to thoroughly wash them after use anyway). Basically the same lab coat that I was issued with  This will all go into action next week so yeah, I\u2019m mostly excited to be honest. However, my Monday begins at 10am with a three hour lecture so not a great start:P I will update this once classes start and the real fun begins >:) Well, its been two weeks since I first wrote this answer and I have had a LOT of stuff going on between then and now. My course at the moment is full of lectures mostly, with a few workshops and lab sessions thrown in for good measure. I\u2019m still getting used to the lecture style of teaching as each class holds up to 450 people while my sixth form biology class had 12 - Its a bit different to say the least. What I wasn\u2019t prepared for however was the sheer variety of topics my modules would cover, as alongside Microbiology I have to do Biochemistry, Cell Biology and current topics in Biosciences - I didn\u2019t sign up for this sh*t (Completely down to my ignorance though - I still love you Surrey :P) Even Microbiology is being a bitch, with organisms either having unpronounceable names or just being incomprehensible entirely. I\u2019m gonna need to upgrade my name remembering skills if i\u2019m going to succeed on this course. As a consequence of the module\u2026\u2026 variety, I required an equal variety of books which cost almost as much as the degree these days.  3 of the books were given to me by my cousin when she graduated from Bristol three years earlier - The one I bought was \u00a355 alone :( Overall I am having a great experience here despite some trip ups along the way. Like the time I failed a two hour lab practical because I left a tiny bit of liquid at the bottom of my pipette. That was not great, I\u2019m not gonna lie. Despite that, I\u2019m enjoying all other practicals and I\u2019m getting used to the weird monotony of lectures - I guess we\u2019ll see how long I can take Biochemistry though, that shit is tough :)  Nice picture of the campus that I took while walking to a lecture :) ",

            "answer_text": "If i\u2019m going to be honest, i\u2019m in shambles.  The universe has been testing me a lot lately. And I mean, a lot. It all started with me being That One\u2122\ufe0f lost freshman at orientation (thanks universe) this summer. For some odd reason (but I think we all know why), I missed the registration assembly that went over everything you need to know about registering for classes and what advisor you should go to based on your interests. When I finally realized that I was supposed to be somewhere ~important~ (due to the eerie silence around me), I booked it to the room where the assembly was held only to see it empty.  I later found out (by frantically asking those around me, being that Annoying Lost Freshman\u2122\ufe0f) that everyone went to separate lecture rooms with advisors to help them build their schedules. Because I knew I was being a bother, I was too afraid to ask what I should do next. SO, I ended up finding a computer lab on my own and tried (emphasis on tried) to build my own schedule (uh-oh #47289294319).  Since I created my own schedule, I am currently taking classes that A) i\u2019ve already taken B) just took because there were no other classes available and C) do not help my graduation requirements in any way. The hopeful comments I played over and over in my head months before the first day of school, \u201cCollege is far more better than High School!\u201d \u201cYou will naturally attract people who are just like you!\u201d \u201cYou will finally be learning things you want to learn!\u201d began to seem less appealing as I 1) kind of, sort of, maybe a lot, miss the simpler days of high school 2) Still am friendless and forgot that interacting with other human beings is an important staple to keep yourself from feeling alone at all times and 3) still am confused and have no idea what it is I want to study and pursue as a career.  I mean, what do I know? I\u2019m just a silly, lost, confused, lazy, alone freshman who hasn\u2019t opened her eyes yet. I shouldn\u2019t be set on feeling this way about the tOtAlLy spectacular, ~eye-opening~, dazzling years of college ahead of me. But then again, there\u2019s part of me that thinks this is how it\u2019ll be like for years and years and i\u2019ll end up being the weirdo (like i\u2019m not one already) that is hidden in a corner of the library still unsure about anything and everything hoping there\u2019ll be that sudden twist of events waiting around the corner (i\u2019m waiting universe!). So for now, i\u2019ll be in my [to be continued] phase until further notice.  Here I am, typing this answer on quora dot com when I really should be studying for my upcoming midterm (and by upcoming, I mean tomorrow). So if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have 5 chapters to binge read before my next class xx ",

My schedule is perfect, the classes aren\u2019t too long, my professors are great, and I\u2019m really enjoying it. The food is sometimes mediocre, but there are so many days with food I really like too. I did not like high school much, but I had heard so many times that college was a chance to start over. I ignored it. I didn\u2019t think it could ever apply to me. But, it did, and now I\u2019m enjoying school more than I have in as long as I can remember. I feel a lot more comfortable being myself which was really difficult in high school, and the difference that alone makes is incredible. I have a lot more freedom too; even though I\u2019m still a minor and need my parents\u2019 permission for a lot of things they can\u2019t stop me from acting upon minor decisions. Recently a friend and I took a bus to the other side of town and were out for about 5 hours; I didn\u2019t need to clear it with my parents first and we had a lot of fun! I think my dad is finally starting to see that I\u2019m not really a kid anymore too, which is so nice. I\u2019ve been planning to spend my winter vacation with friends oversees and hadn\u2019t told him until just Sunday because I thought he would shut it down immediately. I explained how I could pay for that and have my next semester of college covered, and my tickets were booked Sunday night. It was incredible. Overall, college is great, and I\u2019m really glad I decided to come I hope this helps! ",

The rising heat should\u2019ve given it away, but I had been complacent in a seemingly eternal summer. Having grown all I could in the comforting branches of home, I was frozen in time, waiting for the gust to raise me. I wanted it, yet dreaded it. Anticipated it, yet feared it. And, when it struck, I didn\u2019t know how to feel. How does one even move forward again when they\u2019ve been stagnant for so long? When the low wind first caught me, it seemed almost pleasant. It had the exhilarating feel of a new adventure, a fresh start. I\u2019d already pruned myself before I left, changed my appearance, shed my past self so to speak. I thought I was ready. On some levels, I was. Some levels. But, the cool winds were hiding the true tempest, a torrent of emotions and challenges familiar yet distant. My old self, buried deep, still yearned to sprout, break free the shell I had caged him in. I thought myself safe when new shores were in sight, but instead, I had simply become a stranger in a strange man\u2019s land. It was close enough to fool me at first. I thought I\u2019d found a tribe, a place where I could belong. I seemed to connect quickly, too quickly. Then all the little differences starting adding up. A small phrase here, a different food there. Nothing seemed to nourish my soul quite like home. I found myself slipping into old patterns of behaviour, mistakenly making myself more vulnerable than I have for quite some time before. Control is hard when the tempest\u2019s winds still drive your fate. On the surface, I\u2019m blossoming in this new environment. The numbers on paper all add up. Yet, something inside is still unsettled. Halfway across the world, I wonder if I am still the man who left home but a few weeks ago. I honestly don\u2019t know anymore. I don\u2019t think I made the wrong decision. I just need time. Time to adapt to selective pressure. To grow and evolve. Define who I\u2019m going to be and what concessions I will dare allow myself. But for now, part of me still feels forgotten. And, as I lay my roots, I can only hope that arable soil rests beneath me. ",

But allow me to give a bit more detail. I\u2019m a freshman at Grove City College in rural western Pennsylvania (less than an hour from Pittsburgh). I\u2019m majoring in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Computer Engineering. So far, my professors have amazing. My chemistry professor is a perfect example of this\u2014within the first three weeks of class, he memorized the names of all two hundred or so of my engineering and computer science classmates. In addition, he led two study sessions before the first exam to prepare us for it. Despite the fact that my major entails one of the most difficult courseloads, I haven\u2019t felt overwhelmed\u2014not because I am incredibly gifted but because my professors are dedicated to providing us with the tools we need to thrive in our new environment. Further, I am grateful that there are academically rigorous schools that will edify me in my faith. Some of my classes begin with prayer. The chapel services three times each week are blessings as well. Probably my favorite part of my experience has been my computer programming professor. He begins every class with, \u201cIt\u2019s high noon on a [day of the week], which means it\u2019s time for Programming I\u2014your favorite class this semester.\u201d He then launches into an engaging lecture full of dramatic warnings, interesting anecdotes, and a few well-timed jokes. On the social side, things are going well as well. My roommate and I get along fabulously, and I already have several circles of friends. I found a great church to attend, too.  Also, the view from my window\u2019s not too bad, either. ",

It\u2019s in the middle of Atlanta so you\u2019d think it would be more city-like but it\u2019s actually very green, and bright and it has its own little bubble in the city!    Here\u2019s a cute picture I got with Buzz at the beginning of the year! He is the funniest mascot ever, and will probably mess with you if you\u2019re just minding your own business!  Overall I love my major, Industrial Design really seems like what I want to do right now, there\u2019s so many opportunities and so much room for growth and my professors are all keen on making us the best designers ever! It\u2019s a LOT of work and I find myself staying up consistently to finish my projects but it\u2019s all worth it!  College is so much different from high school and there\u2019s so much to learn from all your professors and classmates. You have independence, but you also have to learn to manage your time, stay organized and do well in classes! Although my start has been rough on that, I\u2019m sure that by the end of the year I\u2019ll get the hang of it; after all, you learn more from making mistakes than being perfect from the start!

            "answer_text": "College is absolutely, 100% insane. It\u2019s only been a month, yet so much has happened to me that it feels like I\u2019ve been here half my life. I could start with all the negatives: my laptop crashed and I had to buy a new one, the CS grading system is absolute ass, my legs and feet and shoulders are sore and always hurting from hours of dance team practice every week. I fight with my roommate and sometimes I can\u2019t bring myself to do anything but curl up on our little futon and think about all the boy drama I somehow managed to accrue. But that\u2019s life. That\u2019s college. My new laptop came with free Beats (that are now permanently attached to my head). Coding is my therapy- I\u2019ve found what I love to do at 17, and I\u2019m lucky for that. So what if I\u2019m sore? I made the dance team as a freshman! Fights are natural when you live with someone, she\u2019s also now one of my closest friends. And between you and me, having boy drama and working through all the shit that happened over the weekend is better than staying in and being too afraid to try anything at all. I talk to my family every day and I miss them so much it hurts. I miss the hugs my mom gives me after she helps me work through my problems. I miss how my dad brings me cookies when he knows I\u2019m upset or sad. I miss my brother sitting at the foot of my bed and reading while I do my homework. I miss my dog so, so much, and whenever they send me pictures of him I almost want to cry. I miss my friends, our inside jokes, driving to In N Out at 1 am or spending all day at the mall. But hey, look at me! I have new friends to do new things with, a different kind of family. And this is a family that will never stop growing. College is completely and utterly insane. I feel like I\u2019ve been here for years, but it\u2019s been hardly 5 weeks. But they are hands down and by far the best 5 weeks of my young life. Boiler up, hammer down, hail Purdue, because it\u2019s going to be my home for the next four years and I\u2019m going to love it. ",

            "answer_text": "User-11254232469424413626, I was reluctant to get back to you when you requested my answer, because UChicago starts pretty late; I was still having orientation week then. As for college, I like it quite a lot so far. I love the freedom that I have, which contrasts a lot with the conservative academic climate I used to be in. There are many many opportunities here and you can choose the ones you\u2019re most intrigued by. Currently, I\u2019m taking 4 courses in the quarter system (Heidegger, Emily Dickinson, Philosophical Perspectives, physics), and 3 sit-ins (a grad course on Sartre, Foucault, and Moby Dick). I also attended this temporary conference on Zhuangzi, and spoke with many professors after class. I\u2019m a bit tired and overwhelmed, but it\u2019s more to do with the bureaucratic annoyance of switching courses and trying to get used to a new environment. I love the courses I\u2019m taking but one disadvantage I would list is that the Core Curriculum here is a bit restraining. Perhaps I would\u2019ve preferred an Open Curriculum more, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a factor that would make me dislike my experience here, because I love the specificity and scope of some courses. As for extracurriculars, I\u2019m trying to get involved in the Buddhist circle here, archery, and philosophy club. I\u2019m not sure what else I might still want to join, given my heavy academic workload. But for now, I\u2019m excited to talk more with my professors and classmates! Living up to its reputation, the party scene here isn\u2019t very popular, and I don\u2019t really partake or care that much for it. I tried going to one for free food, but it was just very claustrophobic and tiresome. The campus is also really really beautiful!       ",

So far, it\u2019s been okay, except for me to get used to the tiring hours of study and homework that I didn\u2019t have in high school. In addition, I\u2019m kind of struggling in my BIO 101 class because I didn\u2019t do so well on the first test (it is a lecture based class). Other than that, I love all my classes and am happy that I used \u201crate my professor\u201d to choose my teachers. The right teachers really make an impact on my learning interests and retention. Also, the teachers all have this mindset of wanting to help you understand the material, which makes me really happy. Other than that, I really like the fact that my college schedule has big pockets of time to do all my homework and study for tests as well as time to self learn on some things that I choose to read and take notes on. Also, the campus landscape is really nice. It\u2019s full of all kinds of trees that I don\u2019t know the name too, and a ton of grassy and shady areas to sit on for a lunch break or just relaxing or napping. So, so far my college experience is ok. Not too overwhelming. ",

I\u2019ve found it relatively easier to prioritize between weekly assignments, and I\u2019ll start studying for midterms soon, also throws a wrench into the equation, pardon the pun. I\u2019m a part of our Turning Point McMaster club, so I\u2019m happy about that. I\u2019ve found a (small) community of likeminded liberty-loving folks, where I can more freely express conservative-libertarian values. We\u2019re the first TP club north of the 49th parallel, so that\u2019s a good thing. There should a TPUSA club on American college campuses, so join it. I\u2019m also going to downtown Toronto for a hospital volunteering interview next week, and I part-time tutor, so my year is locked and loaded. If I can keep my GPA up with my increased workload, I might turn out to be a good med school applicant in about a year. Meanwhile there\u2019s also co-op starting up for me this year, so I\u2019ll be on the lookout for that. Thanks Namish Gali for the A2A! ",

Some professors are strict; some are lenient. 3. Having sleepless nights becomes a norm. On the contrary, having that day when I can sleep at night is rare, nowadays. 4. I have consumed more cups of coffee than ever before. 5. Joining organizations has been enthusiastic and fun! 6. Failing quizzes is not fun, despite tremendous amounts of time I have allotted for studying. I have passed some quizzes, but the failing marks outnumber them for now, unfortunately, which brings me to my seventh point. 7. Failing quizzes in college is normal (especially in my case), as opposed to the seemingly taboo notion teens once harbored towards failing in high school. 8. You keep wondering whether you will be able to progess to the higher years or give up instantly and stop going to college. 9. Choosing friends becomes challenging, due to the diverse atmosphere college/university or any higher education institution can offer. 10. Somebody give me functioning brain cells, please. ",

            "answer_text": "It has been both amazing and difficult ! My first month at the University of Toronto was a roller coaster ride, I\u2019ll try to explain it with pictures :)   University kicked off with orientation/frosh week where I got the opportunity to not only meet truly amazing people but also do crazy stuff like run and cheer on the streets of Toronto. The upper year students and frosh leaders made us feel truly welcomed and special ! On September 6 lectures commenced and the work started pouring in, what fascinated me is that the professors and TA\u2019s were very approachable and extremely qualified in their respective fields. For instance, our professor for CSC165 (Mathematical Expression for Computer Science ) has an Einstein number of three, this describes the \"collaborative distance\" between Albert Einstein and our professor as measured by authorship of research papers. I soon realised that the work-load here is immense as compared to high-school. There are multiple deadlines and micro tasks to complete each day, which all count for the final grade in that course and there are increasingly difficult Problem Sets that have to completed periodically and submitted as well. There was one question (worth 15 marks ) in our first Mathematics Problem Set which took me more than 12 days to properly solve and write down. Even though it gets stressful at times, I am enjoying the pace at which everything works here and I am thoroughly enjoying courses like MAT137(Calculus) that are introducing us to the world of formal mathematics which involves writing elegant mathematical proofs and results. I might actually switch to pure mathematics from computer science if my interest grows in that direction. The tightly knit community of people and the close friendships that I have formed over the last month have made university a wonderful experience for me. They have not only helped me cope with different issues that come along with being an international student but also made me feel comfortable and \u2018at home\u2019. I am still in the initial adjusting phase and there are many things that still need fixing on my part, like my scheduling and time management skills , which has reflected in my academic performance till now. I am currently trying my best to get back on track and become more productive :)  Even though I am very far from home, coming to University of Toronto all the way from India has definitely given me immense hope for the future and my experience so far has been amazing ! It definitely feels worth it in every sense and I am glad I took this decision. This a place with endless opportunities and the only thing stopping someone from seizing those opportunities is they themselves. I have tremendous hope for what is to come and I hope that I make the most out of my university experience in the next 4 years :) Thanks for reading such a long answer and make sure to upvote if you liked it ! ~Nayan ",

            "answer_text": "I LOVE IT! \u2026but just a few weeks back I considered dropping out. Let me tell you what\u2019s changed. Mid-September 2018I\u2019m officially a college freshman. I\u2019m double majoring in Journalism and International Relations and I have the greatest expectations about how my university studies are going to look like. Learning the secret hacks of being a good journalist, discussing all the latest events that made it to the news, listening to the best in the field, making lots of new friends and getting drunk on parties every other day\u2026 The beginning of October 2018This is awful. The classes are boring, I hate going to them, I have so much free time and I don\u2019t know what to do with it, my high school friends are far away, everyone seems to be having a great time and here I am, thinking whether to drop out or not. I can\u2019t do this. This is not how it was supposed to be like. This is not what I want to be doing with my life. Can I go back? The beginning of November 2018I love my life. I attend every single class I have and even some of the extra classes that the school offers for the public. I love working on my seminar papers and going to the library just for the feeling of freedom and wisdom it gives me. I have friends in all the different classes I take, I even have some friends who are in the years above me, study buddies and friends with whom I work for the school magazine - we exchange notes, tips and exam materials. I met this cute guy at a party and he seems really nice. We\u2019re going on a date soon! I go to a party every other week, it\u2019s fun and I like dancing. I go out with my friends every week, I love getting to know them better. I have a part-time job I love, I\u2019m a freelance journalist! Also, I work for an NGO and it fulfils me so much! I have all the freedom in the world to do whatever I want and I love it. This is me, I\u2019ve finally found myself. What has changed? Me. My attitude. I thought that university life comes to you naturally, all you need to do is to become a student. But nothing ever comes to you just like that, you have to be proactive. You won\u2019t make friends by being silent and sitting in the corner. Get up, smile and introduce yourself!Everyone is just as scared and confused as you. Share your feelings, you\u2019ll see that you are not alone.You are not taking classes because you have to. Find the classes that seem interesting to you and find something to enjoy about them. You have the freedom to leave or to be on your phone the whole time, no one cares, you should!Be nice to people and help others if you can.Find something you like doing and join a club. This is the best way to meet people.There are so many things you can do and this is the time to do them. You are young, free and you have the time to do anything, so don\u2019t just sit back and watch, get yourself out there and enjoy it!",

            "answer_text": "I can't decide between the adjectives: hard, frustating, fun, challenging and scary. It's definitely all of them! It's hard because classes are extremely difficult to follow. I'm currently studying Anglo-American literature, Portuguese/Brasilian, Linguistics, European comparative literatures and World's history. Exams are so near and time so poor! It's frustating because being the little spoiled girl I am, I had to learn how to cook/ do the laundry and clean the house. Plus, I literally have no time to sleep. It's fun because I get to know people who come from all around the world. Also, there are so many parties or cocktails on boats.  It's challenging because I moved 16 hours away from my birthplace, my family, my boyfriend, my friends and I'm terribly homesick. Moreover, I live in Venice which is always so full of tourists and I'd like to arrive in class on time for once!   And it's scary because I'm 18, I feel so young and yet I have to work hard and build my future. ",

I did panic when I glanced at my syllabus for my classes, but today I read through it and it wasn\u2019t that bad at all. I have been out until 1\u20132am every night, and I need to sleep early soon. Overall, I think I will have a good year. I just need to keep myself busy and I will get through it because when I am not busy and I\u2019m alone, I begin to think about life and all the things I have missed from home. But so far, so good.
