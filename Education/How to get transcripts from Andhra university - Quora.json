I am the best source of advise or solution to the question (I think so.. Emoji again). Andhra University is one of the greatest and oldest Universities of India. When coming to organising an event or any sort of work with administration it is a total \u201cChaos\u201d. Believe me students gets irritated here all the times, those ass holes in the examination section always make students irritated, they don't even consider or listen our urgency. Examination results are always late(usually 3 months, also even 5 months sometimes) the corresponding transcripts take other 2 to 3 months after the results. I was excited in the beginning to study in AU bcz of it's history, progress, and some sort of uni fantasy(Imaginations). Despite I had a bad experiences with the administration throughout my study and even when I wanted my provisional certificate they fucking tested my patience. I am not at all offending at any cost, but after I have seen this question I have sailed through all the experiences I had been fought through. Despite I love my University and the value it's carrying throughout the ages. However I will explain in a step by step process of getting your transcripts. Sort a clear view of transcripts you want.Go to the examination block in Registrar office and find a suggestion.It costs an approx of 600\u2013800 per transcript, double the cost if you want them instant.Make a Demand Draft(DD) of the amount corresponding to your requirement.Submit the DD in the DD cell and you will be guided to the examination block with a attested copy of document.Submit and wait for the time they have gave you to get your transcripts.Usually you will be getting your transcripts by evening or the following day.Contact:0891\u20132844024, Examination block, Registrat office Andhra University, Waltair, VISAKHAPATNAM. Fun fact: Recommendations gives progress here. Thank you all for reading (EMOJI\u2026). ",

            "answer_text": "Hi All, I recently got my transcripts from Andhra University on (21\u201305\u20132018). This will help you to get a clear understanding on how to get yours. Follow the steps as below - Step 1: Get all the xerox copies of your documents, that you need as transcripts. eg: Provisional Certificate, OD, Marks list (Semesters), Consolidated Mark memo. In addition buy an A4 size envelope as well. Step2: Go to AU, Admin Building on the first floor they will guide you to the registrar building. Go and show them what all documents you need. They will tell you the amount as in to paid as DD to the registrar. Step3: Go to a near by bank ( NO SYNDICATE BANK DD ACCEPTABLE) get the DD as mentioned along with some additional charges depending upon the banks. Step4: There is a DD Cell available opposite to the Admin building , there will be an application that needs to be filled. Later. submit the DD and get an acknowledgment. Once you get the copy. Step5: Go back to the registrar office, they will check the acknowledgment and put stamp on all the documents that you carried. Step6: Go the Education Cell , near by submit the copies they will take some time to verify 1- 2 hrs. once the superintend confirms all the information on the document, they will sign (make sure all your copies are signed). Step7: Submit the documents back in the registrar office and again wait for some more time. The registrar will sign the paper. Step8: Finally, the documents signed needs to be in the A4 envelop sealed with gum. And you need an official AU Stamp, seal and sign of registrar on the envelope as well. PS: A suggestion, make sure you be in AU by 10:00 AM. It will take approximately 3\u20134 hrs depending. Maximum by 6:00 PM you will receive your transcripts. Hope this helps you!!! ",
