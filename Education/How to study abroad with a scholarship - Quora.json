            "answer_text": "The easiest way might be to get admitted to a university in your home country with a scholarship, and then participate in a \u201cstudy abroad\u201d program offered through the university in your home country. That is what many US students do, at least. Scholarships at the undergraduate level at US colleges/universities for international students are extremely uncommon, unless you can either gain admission to one of the few universities with \u201cneed-blind\u201d financial aid (Harvard is one such place \u2014 but it is an extremely selective institution), or possibly to a private college with a very large endowment, which would allow them to offer merit scholarships without US citizenship requirements. Talk to a guidance counselor at your secondary school about how to apply to universities/colleges, including what tests you should be taking between now and this fall which the universities will want to see the scores of when you submit your applications.
