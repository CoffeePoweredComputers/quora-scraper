            "answer_text": "The answer to this question actually lies in what you tell yourself. Somewhere in your youth, you decided that math was hard for you. You repeated this train of thought many times over, and that became a solid belief. While this was going on, you also found that you liked language arts, and that it was less challenging for you. As you continued to tell yourself this, it became a solid belief. Math skills, and language skills develop in different parts of the brain. Your brain is essentially a muscle, though it does not flex in quite the same way as a bicep, or an abductor. When you worked out your English \u201cmuscle\u201d, it became stronger. As you avoided your Math \u201cmuscle\u201d, it became weaker. There is nothing inherently wrong with this. It is just a subconscious choice that you made early on. If you choose to become good at Math, and do the work to make this happen, you will be good at both. The real key, is in what you tell yourself. Change your internal talk from \u201cI\u2019m bad at Math.\u201d to \u201cI like the challenge that Math brings to me.\u201d Notice, I didn\u2019t say change it to, \u201cI\u2019m good at Math.\u201d That would be too much of a stretch for your mind to believe, right away. The phrase, \u201cI like the challenge that Math brings to me.\u201d, can be completely believable. Which makes the transition much less of a challenge. Change your self talk, and you will notice a change in your behavior. The change in your behavior will manifest in a change in skill level. The choice is yours to make, and there is no bad choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's see have you ever tried doing maths when you're tired and have worked or studied hard all day\u2026chances are you'll have a better grasp over mathematics and logical explanation of numbers and formulas. Our brain is a complex organ but follows some patterns while dealing with words and numbers. Much like remembering and understanding abstract ideas and physical locations or objects. Each task occupies a separate section of this complex machinery. So while learning or using language it is said that we use the Broca's area where linguistic process is handled along with language processing, comprehension of ideas or even reading anything is processed here, besides the vital task of speech activity and the controlling of neurons related to facial expressions, so technically this part responds much to emotional aspects of language and reaction. It is located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. It\u2019s where expressive language takes shape. Broca was the first person to have studied and concluded that the left hemisphere of the human brain deals with language. Wernicke's area is the region of the brain that is important for language development. It is located in the temporal lobe on the left side of the brain and is responsible for the comprehension of speech, while Broca's area is related to the production of speech. Language development or usage can be seriously impaired by damage to Wernicke's area of the brain. On the other hand there\u2019s a prevalent idea that left side of the brain is responsible for controlling all our activities that takes place on the right side of our body. It also performs tasks that have to do with logic, that is required as in learning science and mathematics. However, our brain has separate areas for activities and each development marks a predominance of talent in individuals. ",
