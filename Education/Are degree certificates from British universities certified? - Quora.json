            "answer_text": "Are you confused about certificates or degrees? A degree is evidence that you completed all the requirements for a course of study. A certificate is evidence that you completed all the requirements for the topic/course indicated. Universities everywhere will confirm that a degree has been issued for the person being inquired about. There can be a certification process (in the courts) where a university administrator certifies that the degree has been issued. Usually a verbal confirmation is all that is necessary from the university (for background checks, etc.). Certification presumes that there is some board or entity that has the power to attest to the degree or whatever. The university has that power. This is true for every accredited university in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Employers and other universities can ring up the university where you claim you were awarded a degree and the university will confirm whether they hold records of a person of your name and the degree awarded and the date. They can also confirm in writing you have a degree from that university. When I applied to Imperial to complete a postgraduate degree they never asked me for my degree certificates. They wrote to the university where I claimed I studied requesting a breakdown of my exam marks. ",
