            "answer_text": "Health and Nutrition: A healthy body is essential to achieving whatever goals you have set for yourself in life. Understanding nutrition and the ways in which one can keep oneself fit, in function and in form, goes a long way in life.  Personal Finance: Managing your finances well earns a sense of security that could be a precursor to functioning well in other areas of your life. Psychology: It helps you connect with other people in a better way and also to understand your own actions and choices effectively. It helps you in making personal as well as financial decisions.   These subjects could also be seen from the perspective of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.    When you learn about nutrition, hygiene, and exercise, you are able to better satisfy your physiological needs and ensure safety of body and health. Knowing about personal finance helps achieve security of employment, resources, family (financial requirements of a family unit) and property. Studying psychology helps connect with people in a better fashion. This aids to creating an environment of love and belonging and to build up self esteem and confidence. ",
