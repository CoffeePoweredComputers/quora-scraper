            "answer_text": "Lets begin with explaining how schools are funded. Schools get their funding per student. The average school gets 11,762 per student per year which boils down to 65.34 per student per school day. This assumes a school year of 180 instruction days. Now before we explore a little more on how much schools get per student we need to point out that major source of frustration in education is that school are not adequately funded. Schools are required to have certain state or federal programs in their schools, the problem is nearly every time these programs are never fully funded which means school have to use a portion of their general fund to pay for the difference of these programs. Now lets take a look at what happens to schools if we institute a voucher program. Lets say that a school has 1,000 students. If this school makes 11, 762 per student for a school year that school will get $11,762,000 for the school year. Now lets say that we provide vouchers to every student to this school and 200 of those students get into a private school. This school now has only 800 students but that also means that their annual funding is less as well which means they have less money to pay the difference to mandated programs, less money to pay teachers and adminsitrators as well as provide other essential services schools have to provide. How does having less money increase student achievement in the schools? The other thing to keep in mind is that private schools only accept a certain number of students and a lot of private schools require students to pass a test before ebing admitted which means most likely these schools have very little students with learning disabilities. If we leave only students with learning disabilities that need extra help in the schools and provide less funding how do we help these students? In other words yes school vouchers might give more choice but it also leaves schools worse off than how they would be without this program. If we want to help schools and make them better lets provide better funding to the schools, less class sizes and provide help to those students who need it. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see many answers here from folks who have used alternatives to public schools, as I have. My wife and I used a publicly-funded cyber charter school with our three kids for two years. What most of the anti-charter, anti-voucher answers here just plain ignore is that many urban public school systems are absolutely awful, despite the fact that in some cases they spend lots of money per pupil. Washington DC is a good example of a really expensive per-pupil system that delivers awful results. In the two cities I know best, there have been multiple attempts to reform both the Chicago and Philadelphia public school systems with generally poor results. The teacher\u2019s unions are simply too strong and too opposed to any kind of accountability. If Rahm Emanuel, with all his connections, couldn\u2019t reform Chicago schools, it just can\u2019t be done. We live in suburban Philly. When we did the cyber-charter, and would attend events with other K12 families, they were overwhelmingly African-American parents from the city. They were using the charter option to get their kids better educational outcomes and to keep them safe. Our U.S. public schools are far more expensive than those in any other rich country, yet consistently deliver mediocre results compared to our global competitors. Create serious competition for public schools, and make teacher jobs and salaries dependent on performance, and public schools will improve. Protect them from competition and they will continue to demand more and more money but evade any accountability. ",

            "answer_text": "Vouchers do give parents a choice of school systems, including private schools, and from one perspective, that is a good thing. However, vouchers to private schools take funding away from public schools, and then people decry the lack of funding available to improve public schools. I was a Catholic School kid. Like all parents who, without vouchers, send their kids to private schools, my parents paid tuition to send me there, and paid taxes to support the public education system. They would have been amazed and appalled at the idea of tax funds being used to support the private school; they considered it their obligation to support public education, and their choice to support the Catholic school system in our town. As a parent and a career teacher, I threw my lot in with the public schools, for a number of reasons. I feel I made the best choice. I support other parents in their choice to use a private system, but I do not support the idea that their choice should then be supported by tax funds. Charter schools are public schools; vouchers to use a public charter instead of the general public school institution is an entirely different thing, and I don not think I have a problem with it. It is entirely possible that supporting charter schools, which, again, are public schools, we are encouraging stronger public schools of all types. ",

They take money budgeted for the public school system and give it to non-public schools.They tend to pull the strongest students out of the public schools, leaving weak and problematic students.The accusation that public schools are a \u2018closed\u2019 system that is bereft of competition is horse-pucky. Teachers and Schools compete against each other all the time. Tenure does not protect teachers who commit malfeasance. (i.e. break the rules or suck at their job). It DOES protect students against powerful people in the community who might want to be able to threaten a teacher for not giving away grades to their kids. Public schools that can pay enough to attract the strongest teachers perform best. This is demonstrated by the fact that many public schools systems in suburbs are superlative, as the system rewards hard work and competes for good teachers. Give the school systems more money. You\u2019ll improve teacher quality. ",

            "answer_text": "Please understand when reading this that I was trained specifically to work in Charter Schools by a college that was a leader in that field. I have also worked in Milwaukee, which has a very high number of charter schools compared to most cities. Most of the other answers here are pithy hogwash about school choice and it\u2019s benefits, unfortunately privatized schools are much harder to run than people would think. For schools to work a legacy organization must be present to act as an anchor for that school, that organization can be a church, a very solid board(in rare cases) or a school district. I spent two years researching and attempting to start a charter school. It\u2019s not the vouchers that are harmful as much as it is the many other pieces in play that are harmful. There are a number of factors in play and the biggest problem is that in many places politicians pick winners rather than the education systems winning on their merit. Location: Voucher schools are only a reasonable option in suburban and urban areas. In rural areas voucher schools just don\u2019t work because the cost of bussing would be far too high.Grants and Assistance: Voucher schools are given all sorts of other types of assistance in addition to the vouchers which most of the time will bring the per student expenditure to around the same amount as a public school. For instance voucher schools will be given planning grants, buildings, computers and other financial help.Charter schools can exclude students: A small percentage of students end up taking up a disproportionate amount of funding, voucher schools can often decline these students. They end up starting with higher performing students and then often get better results.Special Education: Voucher schools aren\u2019t required to give special education services, that falls on the local district. It is extremely inefficient for a teacher to travel to another building. This cost is borne by the local school district.Charter Schools often struggle with corruption.-Travis Academy voucher school owes state $2.3 millionVoucher schools can often not afford labs, shop classes or field trips.I have worked in both rural towns and in Milwaukee. Milwaukee has enough students and a transit system that supports multiple small schools, rural small towns have neither of these things. If a school is not attached to a church or school district it will not have enough students or revenue to be worthwhile. There is a certain capacity in any area for voucher schools, be they the local catholic school that accepts vouchers in a small town or the numerous options of dubious quality that are present in a city. Politicians push the number of schools over this capacity, by re-allocating funds away from public schools. At the end of the day I have found that the biggest supporters of education choice/privatization send their kids either to a good public school or a private school attached to a legacy organization. Storefront schools serve minimal purpose beyond leeching taxpayer money. Quite simply these fly by night voucher schools are great for other people\u2019s kids, because nobody in wealthy red suburban areas wants them. ",

            "answer_text": "They are in that the funding for vouchers usually comes directly from the funding states set aside for public education, thereby robbing the public school of funding for good teachers and appropriate materials. Were that not the case, vouchers might be useful in helping parents in rural or urban school districts pay to send their children to more productive private schools. Another reason why vouchers are damaging is secondary. Often the concerned parents that would utilize vouchers are the type of parents who value education, and pass those values to their children. Those children would do well in any school, because of their value system, but by being taken from the public school system, they rob the students that remain there of their positive example and values. This negatively effects the public school as well. ",

In most cases, parents feel that they made a good choice in requesting an educational voucher and choice of an alternative school but in reality the choice may be less fulfilling to the educational need of their child then the public school system. The reasons are varied, but unless the parents take the time and effort to weed through the myriad charter schools that have risen in anticipation of the educational vouchers, the choices become limited and additional cost may be occur from transportation needs to special requirements of the charter school. Additionally, parents like how the \u201coutside\u201d of the school and the warm welcome they might get, but its hard to find out and identify the quality of the educational system offered in the charter schools and if the charter school have meet and or exceeds the State requirements and mandatory testings results.

Advocates for educational vouchers might argue that \u201cthe vouchers represent their own tax contributions and they are only taking out what they put in.\u201d This is incorrect. The taxes paid into the public school system are to pay for the education of ALL students, so that we can have an educated populace, not just paying for your own kids. ",

They also knew they were the only choice we had, unless we forked out money for private school. Lie is better now. If my local school wants my child to attend, it has to prove to me that my child will thrive there. ",
