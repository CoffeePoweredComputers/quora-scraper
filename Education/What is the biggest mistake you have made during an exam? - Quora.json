            "answer_text": "I do my best work under pressure. I\u2019m like a piece of coal that becomes a diamond. That must also explain why I\u2019m always being pursued by angry miners (not to be confused with angry minors). So exams are my jam. Well, they were. There\u2019s a surprising lack of exams in the real world once you finish school. That was a letdown let me tell you. I spent 12 years perfecting the art of memorizing answers and *boom* I haven\u2019t had one single pop quiz in my life since. My first day as a bartender, did they give me a test on American history? No. They gave me a water bottle and told me to spray it at birds so they would stop eating people\u2019s chips. But back in the day I enjoyed an exam as much as the next guy (if the next guy was someone who enjoyed exams). And coming up to my 12th grade finals - the last exams I would ever have in my high school life - I came up with a plan so cunning and clever it would revolutionize how kids study. See, I read somewhere that certain scents can actually stimulate the brain. Making you more productive AND able to retain knowledge more effectively. Then I read that cinnamon is proven to boost memory when smelled. So I went out and bought all the cinnamon candles I could find. I feel I single-handedly saved the local candle shop from going out of business. How else would they have moved this much merchandise? It\u2019s like Christmas decoration shops that are open all year round. Who is buying this stuff? They need to be on some sort of watch-list. If you\u2019re buying a sign that says \u2018Santa Stops Here\u2019 in March then you are a menace and I want the government to monitor you. Anyway, when I got home I set those bad boys alight and studied as hard as I damn well could. I read every word and took in every bit of knowledge. And by the time exam day rolled around, not only did my house smell like a Sri Lankan cinnamon farm, but I was ready to unleash my secret exam powers. Now I know what some of you are thinking, \u201cAlexander, you have to smell the cinnamon in the exam to enjoy the memory boosting benefits, so what was the point of the candles?\u201d And I hear you loud and clear. That\u2019s why I bought an equally outrageous amount of cinnamon sticks - the type you use for cooking - and brought them into the exam in my pockets. The second the examiner told us to turn over our papers and start, my plan was in action. I took out all the cinnamon sticks and began cracking them in half on my table and around my desk, releasing the aroma and unlocking the part of my brain where superhero-esque powers of memory lie dormant\u2026  Anyway, long story short. The cinnamon sticks did nothing. I felt sick to my stomach from the stench. My hands were stained orange. And everyone looked at me like I was some type of school shooter. I managed to pass the exam despite that mistake. But the joke\u2019s on me. The cinnamon must take time because now I can\u2019t smell cinnamon without instantly remembering that Abe Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1st, 1863. Ah well.

            "answer_text": "This is the first thing that comes to mind and made me feel really stupid. *Warning this may be long*. I got into graduate school and moved the furthest I had been from home. This was a distance from help of family or friends. I was setting up a new life as a student. The thing was I didn't have much of a support system established\u2026 and this is doubly important because I have a chronic illness. I am an insulin dependent type 1 diabetic (I was diagnosed at 17). I was newly placed on an insulin pump when I moved, and I made sure to established a very firm connection with the student health center on campus. Now, living as a type 1 diabetic is a 24/7\u2013 365 day a year, \u201caffects everything in your life,\u201d full-time very difficult job. I was diagnosed at 17 and by 21 or so I was so/so at managing it. I was trying to hold everything together and didn't realize I was going to struggle. So early into the semester I'm in a relatively difficult class about kinship and culture. It was not beyond me and I studied for the first exam I ever had in grad school. I sit down at my desk and that feeling hits me. That feeling I've known since I was 17 and before, my blood sugar is crashing. Now were I thinking logically and clearly I would've grabbed the juice I should've kept with me to get my blood sugar up. Instead I'm sitting at the desk trying to form a sentence for an essay but my brain just could not make a clear sentence. This isn't my brain just anxiously being unable to write, this is my brain without fuel (glucose) unable to form a sentence. I try and try again, erasing and rewriting, but nothing sensible for an essay was eeking out. Finally I stop, sit, and wonder whether I should let myself pass out or ask to get some sugary item. I eventually choose to ask to get some sugary item at a nearby vending machine, am allowed to leave, and am thankful I have quarters. Time is running out on my exam due to what was a medical emergency\u2026 but in my brain I didn't frame it that way. Instead I'm busy berating myself as a failure\u2026 as obviously to my teacher I'm just going out for a snack, and to anyone else watching me I'm just stuffing myself because obviously I was just probably stupidly hungry, and why didn't I have a juice box on me or didn't I check my blood sugar before going to class! I take several very long breaths until I feel okay and go back to the exam room with 15 minutes left. I sit and try again to make a coherent sentence\u2026 nope, nothing. The clock runs out and I'm the last one in the class. I apologize to my teacher, knowing I failed my first test in grad school! How!? I speak to my advisor and drop the class. The content wasn't beyond me, but when my teacher hunted me down I explained what happened and he thankfully understood. Back to the present, I've now been diabetic for a while and there have been a lot of things I know how to handle and things I understand better. I have had lows and highs in various situations, but this was the most embarrassing. I know now that lows are exhausting, and sugar takes a while to get into the blood stream and work\u2026 much longer than the 15 minutes I had left in the exam. I needed an hour. I don't cheat and would've rather taken the test with a new even harder question if he wished to give it to me, but we did come up with an acceptable plan. I think this was my first time really feeling and being a person with a hidden chronic illness, and understanding how essential a support system is. It meant taking on a 3/4 class load, but I did much better. I graduated 3 years later with my M.A. and did fine. Note: Type 1 diabetics do not produce insulin. We require insulin by either shots or an insulin pump to live. Were I equipped with present technology this entire mess wouldn't have happened. People experience lows and may treat them differently, but this is just my experience . Obviously, your mileage may vary. Excellent question! Answer edited for clarity. ",
