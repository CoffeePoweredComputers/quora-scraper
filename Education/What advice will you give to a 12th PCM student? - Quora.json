            "answer_text": "Hey! Actually I am from PCMC (Comp.Sci) background.Here are few advices from my side. You are in one of the important phase of your life. This is like a bridge between your schooling and professional course. So,recognize your interest, passion and move towards it. Be regular to class and concentrate to lectures.If you are planning for B.E then better start preparing for JEE or other entrance exams from the very beginning of the year.If you plan to opt Engineering, learn basics of programming (C or C++) now itself.Prepare time-table and try to follow it regularly.Marks matters alot in this course.But remember understanding the concept is most important.Read Textbook.Spend sometime for physical exercises(sports, jogging) to keep yourself active everyday.Minimum 6 hours of sleep is must.Be an early bird rather than a night owl.At last, don't be afraid. Spend time with your friends and relax. Don't worry if you could not excel with flying colors.12th is not the end. There are still more opportunities in future to be a better version of yourself . All the best for your future. Thanks for scrolling ;) ",
