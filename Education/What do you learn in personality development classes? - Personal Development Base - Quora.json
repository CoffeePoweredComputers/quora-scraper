We are aware in 3 main areas: Thinking Feeling Doing These areas can be further divided such as spirituality, sexuality, appearance, verbal activity and such like. Self \u2013 analysis \u2013 involves being honest about yourself and making the decision to begin to explore your characteristics and personality and what makes you, you. Self- disclosure - does not mean talking to yourself! It means being more specific about what you want to change, or enhance about yourself and focussing on that particular characteristic and working on it. Self-development overlaps with self-disclosure, and follows up with realigning yourself to see if you have changed as you wanted to. Turning a mirror on yourself is not easy and it is often useful to find out how others see you. You can usually ask a work colleague or mentor to give you some feedback about your performance in a certain situation. Providing them with some pointers to direct them to what you want them to look at. After you have their feedback marry it up to your self-evaluation. This will give you a better picture of the real you.

Self \u2013 disclosure \u2013 when I am with my friends I will ask them to count the number of \u2018you knows\u2019 I use in a 5 minute conversation. Self- development \u2013 I will work out from my analysis the extent of my problem and try to become hyper aware of my use of \u2018you know\u2019. I will update myself firstly on daily intervals to see if I improve. I hope the model is useful for your self development. ",
