            "answer_text": "I teach high school. I am in awe of primary school teachers. So are my colleagues. So many subjects to teach, so much patience!  From conversations with primary teachers they feel that they could never teach teenage 'monsters' and think we have the harder job teaching one or two subjects at a higher level. I really think that intelligence in all its forms is handy at both levels. The only thing is, according to my observations, the skills we practise , we hone. Primary teachers develop a just and authoritative way of speaking, in simple language, that primary school students learn to obey and to accept because of their level of develoment. They may not sound as academic because they practise speaking to little people. High school teachers have a different student cohort, one that must learn to question authority and think for themselves both in matters of research for their academic assignments and as young adults learning to look after their rights. Thus, the high school teacher uses different language. They still need to be authoritative but gradually speak in a more and more 'adult to adult' way. Until of course they have to use 'that voice' again.Nobody really likes 'that teacher voice'. It is a voice that results from having to take responsibility and coerce a bunch of kids into working when the sun is out and it's nearly lunchtime.I think the voice leads people to jump to conclusions about intelligence, but in fact the primary school voice can be that of a highly trained and academic professional, using the language she employs by habit in her job. In the end , entrance scores to university and the desirability of the income  influence the academic levels required for entry but I don't think this has necessity had an impact on the two groups as yet.

            "answer_text": "I now teach graduate students but I don\u2019t teach graduate school because I\u2019m smarter than middle school teachers. I really loved teaching middle school and I quit and never went back because I hate getting up early enough to be at school by 8 am. People laugh when I say that because it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any smarter now than when I taught middle school, but I didn\u2019t teach middle school because I was smarter than elementary teachers. I taught middle school because there is not enough Prozac manufactured every year for me to handle a class of kindergarteners. It\u2019s like herding cats. I have no idea how primary school teachers keep from losing their minds. I taught judo to small children once a week and there were enough conversations like this to make that more than enough: Michael! Kirk is crying because he says you licked him. Did you lick him? Yes. WHY did you lick the kid next to you, for God\u2019s sake? I don\u2019t know. This experience makes me want to say middle school teachers are smarter because they are smart enough not to teach primary grades! I think my daughter, who is a middle school teacher described it best. She said, \u201cElementary school teachers love the students they teach. High school teachers love the subject they teach. Middle school teachers love their students and their subject.\u201d If L.A. Unified ever goes to starting class at 10 am, I\u2019ll be right back in the middle school classroom. ",
