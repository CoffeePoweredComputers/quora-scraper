            "answer_text": "The best way is to talk to girls. Get to know them better. Go to socials, dances, spirit events, etc, and meet as many people as possible. Talk to them; be cool and stay confident. If you find somebody you would like to know even better (*wink wink*), ask them on a date. This could be as simple as taking her downtown or to a snack shop after school, or as formal as getting dinner with her at a sit-down restaurant. Do not fear rejection. The worst thing that could happen is that she could say no. If that\u2019s the case, move on and don\u2019t linger. In the end, the best way to try to get a girlfriend (nothing can be guaranteed) is to put yourself out there in the social scene. You don\u2019t have to be popular, you don\u2019t have to be athletic, heck you don\u2019t even have to be the most suave person in the school. You just have to TALK, GET TO KNOW BETTER, then ASK ON A DATE. If the first date is successful, tell her you would like to hang out again. And again and again. Now this is where the word \u201cdating\u201d comes from. I hope this helps. P.S: Getting a girlfriend senior year is not the most advisable thing to do. For the first semester, you will be bogged down with academics, extracurricular activities, and college applications. The best thing to do would be to wait until you go to university. That way, you have more girls to pick from (more fish in the sea) AND you have a more flexible schedule that allows you to have time to date (more freedom in college). ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I will try to give you some advices about how to get you in the situations when you can start talking with a girl that you like. Worked for me. First, I need to say that the easiest is to have a freshman girlfriend. This girls are very curious and eager to experiment. Be active on your facebook group of your highschool or the group made for the people who wants informations about the highschool. If you answer the questions, post some advices or, I don\u2019k know, some funny memes, they will take you as a popular and social guy (which is very good).Go to the freshman meeting. If there is no meeting organized, even better, you can have the initiative and make it yourself and \u201clead\u201d it.Sign up for extracurricular activities (ex: theater course, there I meet a freshman girl that introduce me, after a couple of days, with another girl, and that girl was my girlfriend for 3 years of highschool. You never know how it could happens)I hope that my advices fits for your personality and you find the girl for you. Have a nice day! ",
