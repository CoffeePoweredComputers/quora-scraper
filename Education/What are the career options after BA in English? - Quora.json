            "answer_text": "The first option is, and has always been, journalism. It used to be sufficient for the English graduate to walk into any newsroom and get a position. Especially in medium or minor markets. Especially when many veteran and \u201cgrunt\u2019 reporters hadn\u2019t finished high school. But they knew how to get a story, and they knew how to type fast(50 wpm). Though there are legends of two finger specialists! Now a degree is de riguer(if you don\u2019t know what that means how did you get your degree??) just to get in the door. You must come armed with social media smarts and complete mastery of the internet. \u201cMr. Google \u201c is your 24/7 friend! These two have replaced the old hang-out-in-bars - police stations and courthouses. Though juicy tips can still happen there. To land the top spots anywhere you have to have a great track record of readable text(print),breaking stories, incisive opinion pieces, and persistence. For radio a clear, mid range voice that is calm and makes people trust. TV is the last bastion of sexism. All the above apply first and foremost. But stations then pick on the basis of attraction and age. Handsome shiny young men and beautiful(yes) radiant young women. This is because the camera \u201clikes\u201d such faces, and again so do the viewers. Second is teaching, but math, science and computers are teachable subjects in much greater demand. Third is PR and Communications, if you can get in. The sub-options are wide, from marketing to advertising spokesperson to political spin doctor. Here there is still great hope. If the airhead Sarah Huckabee can be President Trump\u2019s Press Secretary anybody can. If you are still thrown to the wolves and find yourself doing a Mc Job, etc. keep notes! They could be the basis of the \u201cGreat Canadian Novel\u201d! Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "BA in English graduates have numerous job opportunities such as:- School teacher You will need a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) to teach in State schools. Journalism and writing Many English graduates are attracted to Journalism and Writing. It's important to gain relevant experience on the student newspaper or other publications and to build a Portfolio. Publishing This covers books, magazines and electronic publishing, generalist or specialist (including academic publishers). Graduates may work in editorial roles or in business roles such as production and marketing. TV, Radio, Film, Drama and Music is the most popular career area for Arts graduates. To be successful you need to gain and be able to show evidence of relevant practical skills (writing for INQUIRE, Kent Radio, Film Making Society, word-processing skills etc.). Take action well before your final year. Many jobs in the media are not advertised - organisations get enough CV s from people applying speculatively to be able to fill their vacancies from these. You need to be prepared to chase employers - you must take the initiative by visiting them. Teaching English as a foreign Language is a popular option and still relatively easy to get, although you would be wise to get the CELTA Certificate in TEFL as this will make the better jobs available - it can be done in one month. The JET scheme each year takes about 200 British graduates to Japan to teach English for one or more years and pays well - it is usually advertised in October each year with a closing date is usually about late November. University lecturer This does not require a teaching qualification, but you will need a higher degree, ideally a PhD plus teaching experience (which you may be able to gain while a postgraduate student). Library and Information work This may be carried out in public, academic or specialist libraries and involves managing the library's collections and helping users to get the most out of them. Other occupation where an English degree would be useful Many careers are open to graduates in any subject and may offer the potential to use the analytical, information and communication skills that you have gained through studying English. Your interpersonal skills, however, are likely to be even more important. Below are just a few of the occupations where the skills of English graduates may be particularly relevant: Marketing, Advertising and PR. The typical job here is working as a Marketing Brand Manager - being responsible for the sales and marketing of a brand, be it breakfast cereal or sports cars. It's a very creative role, but also (unusual for many creative jobs) well-paid!. Advertising account manager - these plan and run advertising campaigns on behalf of client companies. Very competitive to enter - you need to do your research! Law Solicitors advise clients on legal issues, using statutes and case law to determine their relevance to their client's problem. Barristers also investigate and advise on legal issues, often the more complex ones, and present the client's case in court if necessary. HR or Personal Management is another option which requires strong communication and advice giving skills. Civil Service Graduates joining the Civil service fast stream are involved in a wide variety of tasks, such as researching and analyzing policy options, drafting material that will be used as the basis for new legislation, supporting Ministers in parliamentary work and the management of their departments and liaising with outside organisations. Finance has become another popular option. Many Humanities graduates enter business careers in accountancy, Banking, Insurance and other areas. Post Graduate Study Postgraduate study may enable you to explore aspects of English in greater depth or to study a new subject. As noted above, a postgraduate qualification, either academic or vocational, is required to enter many fields of work related to English, such as research or teaching.You should consider why you want to do postgraduate work, whether it will affect your career prospects and whether you are likely to get funding. Some of the institutions that offer these courses are:- J D Birla Institute - Kolkata Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration - Kolkata K J Somaiya College of Arts & Commerce \u2012 Mumbai Mithibai College - Mumbai ",
