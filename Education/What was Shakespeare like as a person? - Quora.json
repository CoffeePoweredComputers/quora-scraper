            "answer_text": "We don't know that much about him. He got his fiance pregnant and had to have special dispensation from the bishop to marry her before she gave birth. He had some legal problems with charges of tax evasion in London, and \"hoarding food\" in Stratford, but this isn't unusual for the Elizabethan period. In fact, Shakespeare was one of the better-behaved playwrights of that period - we know more about other contemporaries of his as they were frequently in serious trouble with the authorities. From his work, he seems to have been severely depressed following the death of his son, and many of his bleaker and more vicious moments occur in plays written after this. He seems to have largely given up on London following the fire at The Globe, but retained his shares in the theatres and probably still visited the city from Stratford. A lighter and more positive note gets injected into his work after his daughter secures a good marriage to a wealthy doctor! Out of all the pictures and statues created of him, the monument in the church where he is buried is said to be the most lifelike as it was commissioned by friends and family shortly after his death. Some Shakespeare fans hate it, one saying it makes him look \"like a pork butcher\", but other depictions were created long after his death or by people who never met Shakespeare (such as the engraving in the First Folio, created by a Dutchman).

            "answer_text": "Shakespeare Was Subversive When you hear that Shakespeare mainly wrote for the Queen of England and later the King of England, the first instinct is to believe that his plays were politically accurate as a means to appease the monarchs who were in power. His plays contained several references to off-color humor, and it would make sense in the spirit of self preservation, to keep his plays in line with the current political environment. However, that was not the case. Shylock and Jessica from the 'Merchant of Venice'  While Shakespeare may have written to entertain the high and mighty, he was still an actor, and spent most of his time with those considerably lower in status than the nobility. Many of his plays are full of propaganda, regarding the lives of famous kings and their surrounding attendants. Otherwise, many of his characters are not at all in line with current political trends. For example, Shylock, the famous Jewish character from The Merchant of Venice, is portrayed as a villain, which is very much in the style of the time. However, Shakespeare gives Shylock a monologue, the famous, \u201cIf you prick us, do we not bleed?\u201d monologue, which clearly shows some compassion for and understanding of the character rarely present in the treatment of Jewish characters of the time. Recall that in 1280, anti-Semitism in England was at an all time high when the country was declared Judenfrei. The character\u2019s forced conversion in the play is also reminiscent of contemporary political troubles, as the country of England was switching rapidly to and from Protestantism and Catholicism. Shakespeare himself was born a Baptist, but converted to Roman Catholicism during his lifetime to go with the current trends. It is possible, as some scholars such as Ackroyd note, that by humanizing a commonly dehumanized character of the time such as a Jew, Shakespeare showed sympathy. ",
