            "answer_text": "I did the same...I can tell you to...Be ready to write long answers...which are explicit and detailed...this is because science students aren't used to it...it wont be like physics and maths at all...only in first year I had statistics...and accounting in first and second year and there was Taxation also in the same year...this much only was the mathematical or calculative part...rest all in BBA will be like social science in schools...follow the material that your teachers prescribe and I would suggest you to be in personal touch with them...do attend college if classes do happen...in the final year you may have to choose one of four optionals namely marketing, finance, human resources management and information technology...if you are good in calculations...finance...if you have interest in IT or know it from your science background...go for it...if you are interested in sales and markets...marketing...if you are interested in people management, training, recruitment etc..HR is for you...but that is about the final year...you can decide while pursuing the 3 year course...take a step at a time..all the best for your future...do enjoy what you do...thanks ",
