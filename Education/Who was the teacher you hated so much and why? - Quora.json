            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never hated any of my teachers as people, but certainly have as teachers. There are a few bad teachers that spring to mind, but none was as bad as my AP (Advanced Placement) Junior English teacher in highschool. I\u2019ll call her W. W was in her sixties when I took her class and she was crazy. She was a complete English nut. And when I say nut, I mean nut. She went to all the English conventions, knew all the authors personally, was published in snooty English journals that only pretentious poets and authors read or even knew about, you get the idea. She lived and breathed writing and English. It was great that she was so passionate about her craft, but she was the artsy type. This meant that she would never plan anything for her classes, and we students had to feel around in the dark to figure out what exactly she was expecting from us. She gave us a class schedule the first week of school and by week 2 we were already way off course. She would assign us projects to do, and we would spend 2\u20133 days in class working on them, and then we\u2019d move on to something else and she\u2019d never take them up for a grade. Or, she would assign us projects but not tell us and then expect us to have them ready to go on the due date. Every time something like this happened, especially if it was because of her own lack of planning/communication, she would use the same line, \u201cYou guys are AP students. You should be on top of this.\u201d The worst part about the class was the Major Author project. It was a state-required project that lasted about 1/2 of the school year. The students had to choose an author from a predetermined list (guaranteeing that you were pretty much screwed regardless of who you chose), read at least 4 of their works, and then discuss them in a 10 page essay worth at least 30\u201340% of the total grade in the class, with minor assignments along the way. It wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal now, but back then I really struggled with it. This was due in major part to the fact that I had transferred to this school as a sophomore and this was the first major formal research work I ever had to write. So I did not know the system or how to write under it successfully. She was anything but helpful. I stayed after class more than anyone else in the class to ask questions and try and figure out what the hell I was supposed to do. She liked me because of this, but she was so extremely vague in her answers that I was always left with more questions. It didn\u2019t help that she didn\u2019t seem to know what she wanted from us. In one meeting she told me to write the paper as if someone had read all of the books but didn\u2019t know what they meant. So, I did that. I included references to the events of the books which would be understood by anyone who had read them. When I got the draft back, she marked off points because \u201cshe didn\u2019t know to what I was referring.\u201d That class was unbearable because of her artsy-airy approach, but I managed to get a B on that stupid paper after 2.5 months of hard toil. I was rather proud of that B just because of the extra lengths I had to go through to understand how to write under her kooky system. She was a nice person overall, but a crappy teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "His name was Mr. Karlozian. I was in 10th grade, and he was my teacher for French I, in 7th Period. The last class of the day. He was from the French-speaking regions of Canada, and had a very thick French accent. He taught us using only the textbook. His bizarre, inexplicable textbook. Every lesson was lifted straight from it. Every chapter was a story about this guy, an American who had emigrated to France, and his assimilation into French culture. First, we would read the story along with an audio recording of it, with actors reading the lines of the different characters. The second day, all we did was listen to the story repeat over and over with classical music in the background. His argument was that the music would \u201chelp us internalize the language.\u201d I don\u2019t recall him ever explicitly teaching the language. I don\u2019t recall ever discussing conjugation of verbs, the proper use of articles, anything. Just going through this stupid book and it\u2019s stupid stories over and over again. No doubt this was some pet project of some out-of-touch academic trying to prove some grandiose abstract educational theory. Ugh. His grading system was impossible to understand. A huge fraction of the grade was homework, and the homework was scored by giving either a 1, a 0 or a P. The P meant incomplete or something, and I never quite figured out how that went into the grade. All I know is that I got a bunch of 1s, a couple of 0s and the occasional P but somehow my homework grade was an F. His quizzes tests seemed like they were taken straight from the regular French textbook, so they never really matched the weird stuff we were doing in his special textbook, though I did well enough on them because I am unusually talented with picking up new languages. Much of the class struggled and really hated the guy. They argued with him constantly, frequently scored poorly on work and some of them generally made his life hell during 7th period. Particularly one girl. I have an Autism Spectrum Disorder, so I wasn\u2019t really able to disguise my utter disdain for his incomprehensible teaching practices, and as a result he didn\u2019t care for me either, despite my high scores and ability. But the icing on the cake came in the last few weeks of school. Yearbooks had arrived and it was Thursday of the second to last week of school. We were all saying \u201cGoodbye\u201d the seniors who would be done after that week. I had two senior friends I wanted to sign my yearbook. The problem was that I was only on the North campus for 3rd and 4th period and they\u2019d been absent that day. The next day, Friday, was the last time I anticipated seeing them, perhaps ever. After I bused back to South Campus at lunch the next day, I would likely never see them again. I went the restroom during 7th period that day and when I came back my Yearbook was missing. Mr. Karlozian played dumb and claimed that he hadn\u2019t seen it taken. Was I sure I\u2019d brought it that day? Maybe I forgot it at home. No, I told him. I\u2019d had it signed by dozens of people throughout the day, including some in that period, just now. Well, he didn\u2019t know where it was or who took it. I was furious. When I got home, I told my dad what happened and he hit the roof. He took me back up to the school and we saw the Vice Principal. He said he\u2019d look into it. The next day, he showed up in 3rd Period, on the North Campus, with my yearbook in hand. Mr. Karlozian not only knew who hid it while I was in the restroom, but he knew where they hid it and had refused to tell me because he didn\u2019t want me to create a scene. As if I\u2019d ever given him any indication that I was the scene-creating type. The VP also informed me that Mr. Karlozian had been asked to apologize to me. I arrived in 7th Period and Mr. Karlozian barely acknowledged my existence. About 5 minutes in, the VP entered the room and took Mr. Karlozian outside (I assume he was reminding him that he owned me an apology). What happened next is something I will always remember. Mr. Karlozian stormed back into the room in that unique way that only really short people can, with his little legs moving fast it an almost cartoonish fashion. He stopped in front of me and began to yell. And with every sentence, he punctuated it with a rude gesture. \u201cI DON\u2019T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU, YOU FUCKING CRYBABY. I DON\u2019T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU, OR YOUR CRYBABY DAD. YOU THINK I\u2019M GOING TO APOLOGIZE? YOU ARE A CRYBABY, AND I DON\u2019T GIVE A SHIT!\u201d Then he stormed back to his desk, sat down and didn\u2019t look at me again. Before the period ended, a campus security officer came and took me to the VP\u2019s office. He asked if Mr. Karlozian apologized. I asked for permission to tell him exactly what Mr. Karlozian said. Needless to say, the VP was not pleased. Mr. Karlozian was not there the following week. Mr. Karlozian was also not there the following year. I won\u2019t say for certain that he was fired for that incident. But I like to think so. ",
