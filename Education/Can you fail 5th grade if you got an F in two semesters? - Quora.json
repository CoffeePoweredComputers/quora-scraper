            "answer_text": "As far as I know, you cannot flunk 5th grade unless the parents or guardian agree to the retention. You cannot be retained for more than one year. If the teacher, principal, and parents agree that it is in the best interests of the student, the student can be retained. It rarely happens today. Most students who are retained are kept back in kindergarten or first grade if they are simply too immature. They need an extra year to achieve the standards. Almost all students in elementary and middle school are socially promoted even if they are failing multiple classes. Keeping them back one year would do more damage than helping them. Unfortunately, some non-productive students get used to social promotion and have a rude awakening in high school. In high school, you have to pass the classes to get credits to graduate and get a diploma. In high schools where I taught, we would see a 40% reduction in the number of students from 10th to 11th grade. ",
