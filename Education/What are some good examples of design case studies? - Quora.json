            "answer_text": "Here you go Fitness Center Platform Case Study  The Backstory Our client, an innovative Saudi company that builds smart indoor positioning systems for shopping centers, airports, hospitals, universities, and other establishments, took on a challenging project to build an indoor navigation system based on iBeacon technology for a fitness center in Qatar. To complete this project, they needed a reliable technology partner. Our client was entrusted with building a complex, multi-tier fitness center platform (consisting of a visitor app, a staff app, and a web-based admin panel) to support all of the fitness center\u2019s services. The visitor app \u2013 probably the trickiest part of the platform \u2013 would be an iOS app that would let users navigate the fitness center, book appointments with fitness instructors, order food within the fitness center, and more. The client\u2019s team wanted their app to be functional, beautiful, and provide an optimized user experience. They came to Yalantis because of our strong UI/UX design. Our task Our client\u2019s request was to create a stunning and attractive UI design that would comply with the company\u2019s branding. We also needed to optimize the UX of this complex, multi-tier app to fully demonstrate its potential. While our customer\u2019s responsibility was to build and deliver the technical part of the Katara app (frontend, backend, and the indoor system), our task was to \u0441reate the UI/UX for the iOS version of the app; at some point, however, guys decided they needed our help with building the frontend part of the application as well. So in the end, our team designed and delivered both the frontend and the design of the customer application. Starting with UX This project is a platform designed specifically for staff and visitors of a fitness center. But it was hard to get access to competing apps because of their private nature, which made competitor research virtually impossible. Luckily for us, our client had a clear understanding of what the app should do and what results it should deliver. But they had some problems defining how all of their ideas could be implemented in one app. They knew exactly how their part \u2013 the indoor system and navigation \u2013 could be implemented, but the rest of the app\u2019s functionality had some gaps in its logic. This is where our client asked for the help of our UX design experts. First, we needed to define the information architecture of the project. Put simply, we needed to create an app structure (or design) that balanced both the end users\u2019 desires and our client\u2019s business needs. Information architecture and user flows Since we were working on a big and complex project involving numerous user actions, the next logical step was to create smooth and consistent user task flows so the app would feel natural and intuitive and deliver a great user experience.

            "answer_text": "The most popular format for design case studies is written and most often published on Medium, but I've also seen a few good ones in video format too lately. There's a trend amongst UX students who publish unsolicited case studies, although not based on \"real\" problems, they tend to go deep into explaining the UX process. Here's a list of some of the most comprehensive examples of good design case studies I've come across: Designing a New OS for a Minimalist Phone\u200a (YouTube)By Matt D.
