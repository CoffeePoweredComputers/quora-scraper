            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There are a ton of good answers. When you look at the details, they don\u2019t contradict. To summarize, before I extend: GPA is a useful metric of your academic/intellectual performance in college, but not of your long-term potentialGPA is used to determine who gets interviews/consideration in many hiring situations and in all grad school appsA 3.68 and a 3.72 aren\u2019t actually any different from anyone\u2019s perspectiveA 3.0 is necessary for grad study, except when it\u2019s notI should also summarize my own GPAs. For college/undergrad/bachelor\u2019s degree/university (depending on where you\u2019re from), I started poorly, brought my semester GPA up to respectable quickly, and slowly raised my cumulative. I ended somewhere between a 3.0 & 3.5 out of 4.0. For my MS and PhD, I was fortunate to get an A- for each in the first semester, so I never had a 4.0 to obsess and worry over; I probably ended both with a 3.8\u20133.9+. GPA from a master\u2019s degree can be important, but no one cares much about your GPA from your PhD, since your dissertation & publications are the important things. For a PhD, classes are like warmups at a track meet. My father wisely told me that school and GPA matter for getting your first job, and that\u2019s it. This is mostly true, but understand that your first job leads to your second, etc. You can climb out of a hole. I was an IT professional, in support for a short period of time and then a software developer, but I had a degree in English, and it took a while to get my opportunities and salary to match my output relative to my peers. Someone said that your GPA is a lifetime mark. This isn\u2019t quite true. If you want to go to grad school, the old maxim was that you needed a 3.0+ to qualify for a master\u2019s degree and a 3.5+ for a PhD. There are a few reasons this isn\u2019t quite true: Some master\u2019s programs will accept lower GPAs, especially if you started weakly but got better. If you had a semester GPA of 3.5 during each of your last two semesters, then that counts for something (at some places; not so much at Stanford).In the US, you can always do postbacc work (taking courses, sometimes undergrad and sometimes even grad-level, but not in a degree program) to establish your bona fides, and thus get into a grad program.You can do a master\u2019s degree; if you do well, you can then get into a PhD.Outside of academia, my favorite example of a student is Steve Wozniak, who failed out of college, went to community college in order to qualify for re-admission to a 4-year school, did well, and ended up getting into UC Berkeley, then going to co-found Apple Computer.However, there are issues: Obsession with GPA is a path to misery. I see this all of the time. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t strive for good grades, I\u2019m saying don\u2019t worry about the number so much.Grades reflect your ability to master explaining, applying, and extending/synthesizing what you have learned, along with sustained effort and creativity. The reason recruiters/hiring managers/grad admissions committees like GPAs is that these are precisely the things that count. If you are naturally brilliant at X and can take a senior-level Introduction to X in Theory and Practice course, not study, and get an A, this tells me nothing about your ability to work when you hit a challenge, and I\u2019m not hiring you to do upper-level undergrad coursework; I\u2019m hiring you to create, innovate, extend, lead\u2026 nothing that an exam can measure. That\u2019s why grades composite all of these things. I also know that you will hit a challenge, and I want to know how you work when natural intelligence isn\u2019t enough. This is especially true in grad work, and especially especially true in a PhD program.When you do work, we (your instructors) evaluate that work according to some rubric or metric and compare it to the work of others (to some extent) and assign a grade. At the end of the semester, we do some kind of math involving averaging those grades. Then we assign a letter grade to your performance. These letter grades are converted to numbers, multiplied by the number of credits for the course, summed, and again averaged. If you are majoring in English, your 4-credit freshman bio class counts more than your 3-credit senior seminar. GPA is an heuristic and nothing more, and no one should pretend or believe otherwiseYour GPA is not a measure of your worth as a person. It\u2019s not a useful metric to tell me how you will live your life. It tells me nothing of your willingness to stop and help a peer in need. It tells me nothing of whether you will be honest and good when no one is watching. It doesn\u2019t tell me if you\u2019ll be a good spouse/parent/friend.If you work hard to understand, apply, extend, explain, justify, and otherwise master knowledge, you\u2019ll get good grades or at the very least have something to show for your work. I often have students who complain that their grades are justified as measures of their performance, but not their mastery of material. I ask \u201cHow will you show that mastery to someone?\u201d Most are stumped, but some launch into long explanations, and I stop them and ask \u201cHow will you fit that on a resume or in an elevator pitch?\u201d There\u2019s no answer.To extend this point, when students perform poorly on coursework but take the ideas and produce something amazing through insight, ingenuity, dedication, hard work, discipline, independence, and creativity, there are two outcomes: some profs will make sure their course grade reflects this, and some won\u2019t. However, in my experience, no prof will let that work go unrewarded. They will make sure that this student is given opportunities warranted by their work.We don\u2019t talk about it much, but anyone who has been hiring/managing in industry and/or working in academia (especially at the graduate level, in which I\u2019m no longer involved) has seen students with high GPAs flounder for a variety of reasons. It\u2019s no guarantee of even short-term success.I had a student who was (and is) intelligent and hardworking, and thanks in part to a high GPA, was about to start a prestigious graduate fellowship funded by the government. Given the nature of this fellowship (and this is common), good judgment in life is key. Then this student got a DUI. That was it. Fellowship gone. Fair? Well, there was someone waiting in the wings who managed to not get caught showing a spectacular lack of judgment in endangering their life and the lives of others. A colleague of a friend at a large, prestigious, global consulting firm got a DUI, and was summarily fired. Same thing: if you\u2019re selling the work of people who are supposed to be above and beyond, if their judgment isn\u2019t above reproach, it\u2019s kinda hard to charge $400/hour for their work.tl;dr Yes, your GPA in college matters, but for some specific purposes and in specific places, and only those places. It\u2019s not a lifetime brand, and it doesn\u2019t convey anything about life skills, values, or willingness to adhere to those values. ",

Do you have integrity? Are you innovative? Do you solve problems? Somebody's got to do that homework and redesign the educational system so that it can actually train people to be successful in life.\" ~ Neil deGrasse Tyson  Source \"Whatever success I have achieved, whatever positions of leadership I have held have depended less on Ivy League degrees or SAT scores or GPAs and have instead been due to that sense of connection and empathy, the special obligation I felt as a black man like you to help those who need it most, people who didn't have the opportunities that I had because there, but for the grace of God go I. I might have been in their shoes. I might have been in prison. I might have been unemployed. I might not have been able to support a family. And that motivates me.\" ~ Barack Obama  Source \u201cWe live in a world where there are no limits for those who can create results. The faster you can use what you\u2019ve learned to execute results, the sooner you will succeed. Your GPA no matter how impressive or abysmal- WON\u2019T MATTER!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aTony Robbins  Source \"To those of you who are graduating this afternoon with high honors, awards and distinctions, I say, 'Well done.' And as I like to tell the C students: You too, can be president.\" - George. W Bush My Personal Thoughts:Yes GPA is important. It measures your academic success. Having a high GPA does, on some level, show that you have been a hard worker and managed to be in control of all your courses. And that is quite an impressive feat. So what about all those quotes from presidents, scientist & successful entrepreneur you just went through? \u2192None of them are telling us to NOT focus on the GPA. But there is a pattern in all the quotes. These successful and charismatic individuals are all urging us, to not be obsessed or fixate about GPA. It is not the sole factor for success in life. There are many other factors that contribute to making you a good candidate for getting hired or giving you success in general: Leadership SkillsTechnical SkillsCommunication SkillsProblem Solving SkillsAbility to apply knowledge in real life scenariosPunctualityAbility to have a positive mindsetAbility to work in a teamThese points are just a few among many that dictate success. GPA alone can never make up for your lack in all the other factors. So don\u2019t obsess about GPA\u2019s. Focus on building skills that are relevant in your field. Focus on building soft skills that you can use be an effective member of your work/business community. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It depends entirely on your goals. If you\u2019re looking to just get an undergraduate degree then get a job, and you\u2019ve got realistic expectations, then stay above a 2.0. If you\u2019ve got a somewhat lagging GPA (2.0\u20133.0), be sure to explain yourself, if employers check your transcripts. Are you well-rounded? Do you have great people skills? Were you working while in college? The reasons could be endless. Some employers do check transcripts, whereas many do not. If you\u2019re looking to get into grad school, a 3.0+ is important. This is especially true in the upper two years (although it depends on your school and on what you\u2019re applying to). If you\u2019re looking to get into law school or medical school down the road, heck, you\u2019ll need a GPA in the 3.5\u20134.0 range. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to hover about a 2.0, because this would leave me feeling anxious about my academics and the possibility of being put on probation or not receiving a GPA high enough for graduation. If you have 3.0+, you could note this on a resume and potentially put yourself ahead of other job applicants. Similarly, having a 3.0+ leaves the door open for transferring to most schools or transferring to most faculties down the road. In short, be conscientious of your personal goals, and strive to attain them. Academics aren\u2019t for everyone, so if you have a not-so-stellar GPA but you\u2019re content enough with getting by on straight C\u2019s, well good for you for getting an education. A higher GPA = more doors open for education and for prospective employment opportunities too. In general, your GPA signals whether or not you take your education seriously. Overall, it\u2019s the upper two years GPA that matter more than the lower two years, because often students are required to take some irrelevant weeder courses in the introductory years, and people understand that it\u2019s tough to learn the art of mastering your grades in college fresh from high school, because the material is more difficult and the learning is more fast-paced too. If your GPA shows an upward trend over time, this signals that you learned how to study more effectively over time. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you plan to do after college. Graduate programs do look at GPA. If your GPA is low, you will have a tough time getting admission to graduate school. There are several ways of calculating GPA however. GPA in your major counts more than overall GPA. If there is a significant improvement in GPA in your last two years, it can overcome weak performance in your freshman and sophomore years. A strong statement of purpose, excellent reference letters and something remarkable like a publication in a professional journal as an undergraduate can make up for a weak GPA. GRE test scores can also show potential, but if you get top scores on your GRE, LASAT, MCATS etc. and have a C average GPA people might wonder whether you were capable of working up to your potential.  The greatest impact is in determining who gets internal competitive fellowships. Persons with less-than-stellar GPAs might get into graduate school, but only people with outstanding undergraduate records are going to get competitive fellowships.  If you plan to go directly into the employment market GPA is often not very important. Your specific accomplishments are, however. If you did a great fieldwork project, if you know Chinese, if you completed an exciting design project, if you won a significant prize--things like this can attract even more attention than a 3.0 GPA.  After your first job, no one will care about your GPA. But if you were good enough to get into Phi Beta Kappa or Sigma Xi, that credential can open doors for you.  ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely!  Try to get into grad school with a low GPA.  A good GPA as an undergrad at a reasonably good school can get you into a good graduate school program.  It can also help in getting financial assistance.  Try going to a really good undergrad program, finish with a low GPA and try to get into any good grad program.  No way.  If you got into a really good undergrad program, the understanding is that you are probably smart or at least smart enough to have been accepted.  A low graduating GPA suggests that something probably went wrong, particularly if the average graduating GPA for the major is higher.  So it might be assumed that the low GPA was either the result of a modest commitment to learning the material or worse that the individual was unable to comprehend the material.If the plan after receiving the undergrad degree is to join the work force, the graduating GPA is influential.  Take two graduates from comparable institutions and the same degree, one has a 3.7 and the other has a 2.5.  They apply for the same job and during the interview process they are equal.  I would probably hire the person with the 3.7.  Even if the person with the 3.7 stumbled somewhat during the interview process, I would still be more likely to hire the person with the higher GPA.  There is at least the appearance that the person with the higher GPA achieved the grades through intelligence and/or study (work ethic).  Both are valued by employers.  The value of the GPA can diminish with time, but I think it tells a lot about the individual even ten years out.As an example of the importance of the GPA, I graduated with honors as an undergrad.  Early in my senior year I was offered a free ride to a graduate school.  This came as a complete and unexpected surprise.  I have no doubt as to the influence of my professors, but having a good GPA had a significant impact.  FYI, the undergrad degree was in CS. ",

It matters if: You want to go to graduate school and get into a good program (there are 100's of students applying, they have to find a way to select the most qualified ones. GPA is one indicator, but not an end all).You want to get scholarships to fund your studiesYou apply for a job and need to convey your consistency in your work ethic - holding a 3.8+ GPA at a reputable university with rigorous coursework is nothing to scoff at.You're obsessed with ratings/numbers - some people only watch movies with 4/5 stars or more, or x% on rotten tomatoes. These things can sometimes be arbitrary or subjective but to certain people it means everything. To a lesser extent, GPA is like this. Math questions have one and only one correct answer. Biology and other sciences strive for that level of objectivity, while classes in the arts that require papers or essays are much more subjectively rated.You need to stay above a certain GPA to receive and continue to receive financial aid.It doesn't matter if: You're just going to college because all your friends did too and it's just \"the next step\".You're a computer science/IT/engineering major who could get a job as a sophomore and join the workforce right away instead of racking up debt.You're a business or entrepreneur type where you don't necessarily need to rely on hard academic skills like reading a lot in short periods of time and taking tests. Networking might be the most important thing here.You're an athlete who people recognize and you might go pro. People like sports and athletes.",

            "answer_text": "Let me share a personal story. Even though it has since worked out for me, if you are looking to get into an ivy (or good school) the story would be much different. When I started high school I was very motivated. I took honors classes, did my homework, and never missed a class. After I took the few honors classes that my socioeconomicly low school offered, I became bored. Not because I was a genius or anything, but because I lost interest in school. My 3rd and 4th year I started skipping class, getting bad grades, and generally did not care about my GPA. I did however make sure to pass the classes needed to graduate. When I graduated high school I decided I wanted to continue playing in a band that myself and some acquaintances started a year before. My dad told me I was dumb, and should go to college. But, he also allowed me to make my own choices and learn from them. Our band broke up, I was bored, so I joined the military. While I was in the military I attended a small state college that accepted sub-par GPA\u2019s and I did quite well. After I concluded my service (with a couple combat deployments), I became a teacher. It was really the only thing is could do with a history degree. When I was teaching I met my beautiful wife and decided to go to law school. I am now happily married, proud of my undergraduate degree and my service, and about to graduate law school. So in my humble opinion, high school GPA\u2019s do matter, but only MAYBE for the first year or so when you get out of college. Don't live a safe sheltered life. Explore, make mistakes, and just roll with it. ",

Some organization (that has, itself, been approved by their own third party) certifies that you've gotten to the point where they think you're basically hireable.  The GPA says how confident they are. It's like when a friend tells you that they have a friend you should meet.  The hiring manager is using that recommendation to make a decision, and they're doing it because there's no other useful information about you. Once you have work experience, though, that's more important.  Knowing that you stayed at a job for two years and didn't get fired is far more useful to hiring a candidate than their GPA. Of course, how do you get that first job?  Your degree and GPA. So no, in five years, nobody's going to care.  But dismissing those five years is like eating junk food today figuring you'll exercise once your weight becomes a medical problem. ",

Once you are past the initial resume screening, however, its much more about extra curricular activities, if you can form coherent sentences in person and in writing, and how much your personality will mesh with the team you would work with. I'm now 9 years out of school and would probably still include it *only if* I was looking for something that more directly related to my major since my current role is more orthogonal to what I studied.  If my current role was in engineering, however, I wouldn't bother.   My husband recently changed roles at his company at 11 years of work in one division and had to do his resume as part of the hoops (he had a yes from the manager, but HR has a process) and we did not include this when we updated his.  His GPA (nearly 0.5 points higher than mine!) was also part of how he got both his internship and in front of the appropriate hiring managers. Not part of your question, but bonus advice:  if your GPA is an X.98, do not round to X+1 (so don't round 2.98 to 3.0, or 3.98 to 4.0).  Rounding to one decimal point at the other tenths doesn't seem to be an issue, but there is a BIG difference between straight As and \"almost\" straight As! ",

I will set a criteria of 3.5 GPA out of 4 GPA. Most probably I'll be left with 100 students to be interviewed which I can do easily and I am quite sure that a student with 3.5+ GPA will serve the role of \u2018Y\u2019 position well, in fact very well. I also know that, it may happen, one of the other 900 students may be Elon Musk but anyway he is going to be the greatest of entrepreneurs and would have left my company as many great minds did earlier in history. There is very less probability that, he would work for my company for a longer duration of time. My selection criteria stands correct. Students Perspective: Student 1: If I have to get a job as soon as I graduate I must have 3.5+ GPA. I took this course \u2018X\u2019 because I wanted to, if not, I wouldn't have chosen this. It's pretty clear to me. Student 3: I am like Elon Musk, future entrepreneur and will be among the wealthiest of people in the world. I don't like to waste years of my time for this \u2018X\u2019 graduation course. I will start working for my dreams right away and I will be persistent until I achieve my goals. Student 4: I know it's important to get good grades but I need to enjoy life as well. So, I will maintain a balance with college and life. I am confident that I will be placed somewhere even if it's not the position \u2018Y\u2019 I will become \u2018Z\u2019 for some company. PS: I suggest you to be like Student 1 or Student 3 or Student 4 but please don't be like Student 2. They'll complain about education system at the same time they don't want to work hard for any dreams. ",

From engineering in Thailand, you generally need:- 3.00, no previous F or D, for on-campus jobs- 3.00~3.25 for scholarships- 2.50 for internships in non-specialist or manual-work companies (trading, manufacturing, etc)- 3.00 for internships in specialist or high-knowledge companies (offshore, IT, aviation, etc.)- 3.00~3.50 to go to grad schools (can be waived if you have job experience) Note that 3.00 is considered mid-high in my study (computer engineering), because most engineering classes here have difficult exams. After you graduate and a few years into your job or grad school, you will use your CV instead of grades. Even though GPA is just a measure of how well you did in exams and schoolwork, it is a primary metric used to measure your actual performance (even if it's not -- you can be a good diligent student who flops exams, and bam you get 2.0). Therefore, you will need it. It probably doesn't matter when you want to be your own boss, but while in school you are advised to keep it at a respectable range. ",

I was about to wrap up some stuff to attend tomorrow\u2019s lecture of my graduate studies at Kathmandu University. (I\u2019m studying MTech in IT at KU and teaching to the seventh-semester students at NIST College Banepa on a contract) Suddenly, I remember that tomorrow is the last day to submit the application for Teaching Assistantship at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at KU. From May I will be teaching two courses at NIST college so it is already a tight schedule for taking some extra course load(to teach especially). But also I visited the website and checked the notice. I was thinking that I initiated the OpenLab, now I have plans for projects and research. If in case I will be the TA at the department. Then I can formally supervise some project group and then run the lab full functional. But shit happened and I am not feeling bad at all.  The notice clearly mentions that a minimum of I\u2019st Division is required for applying to that position. And to clearly mention my CGPA is 2.58 which is a second division. Sad isn\u2019t it? Haha. This is where the GPA mattered. Birat said that \u201cBillion dollar companies don\u2019t even require an academic qualification and KU requires GPA.\u201d Well, this is the first time GPA mattered or slapped in my face. But not an issue at all. I got a good job in the top-ranked software company of Nepal(Cotiviti Nepal). They definitely saw my GPA during the internship interview. But nobody asked why is it low. Instead, my one hour and ten minutes long interview were all about my semester projects, research interests, Computer club, IT MEET, Open Source Communities and etc. But this incident pinched me somehow, somewhere a little bit. That\u2019s why I searched GPA at Quora to express my feelings. Because Quora feels like home. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it does. It is super important. If your GPA is too low, you\u2019ll be placed on academic probation and given a set amount of time to improve your GPA to the bare minimum required for you to progess. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be dismissed/throw out. Academic honors such as summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude are also determined by your GPA. Nomination to honor societies is based on your GPA. So your GPA matters very much in college. It also matters very much if you plan to/hope to on to graduate or professional school. The better you do academically in college, as evidenced by your GPA, means you have a better chance of getting admitted to graduate or professional school. It may matter for internships to some employers. If they have to choose between the student with a high GPA vs students with lower GPAs, they may opt for the former because students don\u2019t have anything else to bring to the company. The same may hold try for your first post-college job with some employers, given that most students can\u2019t say they have 5\u20138 years professional work experience required for that entry level job. The employer can\u2019t rely on past work experience, so he may rely upon your GPA to help him make a decision whether to hire you or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it does. It matters for your first job right out from college, or for graduate school admissions. After five years, it doesn\u2019t matter much (if at all). Your performance in those intervening five years matters much, much more. If you have some tremendous other accomplishments, such as outstanding leadership in extracurricular activities, or running a successful small business, or national presentations or publications, that can ameliorate the effect of a lower GPA. In the interests of full disclosure, I will say that my GPA was good but not great in my undergraduate program (I grew up in India). In spite of that, I got into the best graduate school in India. In my electrical engineering degree, I had a slightly above average set of grades from my undergraduate institution, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay \u2014 but that school is generally regarded as the best undergraduate degree in India, and 60 Minutes (CBS New magazine) has done a full episode on it. Video: 60 minutes- IIT - World imports Indian engineers in which Lesley Stahl said, \u201cIIT is dedicated to producing world-class chemical, electrical and computer engineers with a curriculum that may be the most rigorous in the world.\u201d To make up for my GPA that was not outstanding, my extra-curricular activities were very solid, and more importantly demonstrated leadership. In high school, I was a President\u2019s Scout (King\u2019s Scout in the UK, and Eagle in the US), with additional merit badges, and had been a troop leader. I had also won several awards, prizes, and gold medals for elocution/debate. In college, I reached the highest cadet rank possible in the NCC (sort of like the ROTC), Senior Under Officer. I had won several awards in acting and directing plays at the university level, and even staged plays for the broader city community. I had been General Secretary (SGA President) for three consecutive years \u2014 at the hostel level, the institutional/university level, and at the departmental level and created substantive positive changes in these units during my terms. And, my GRE/GMAT scores were in the high 90s (percentiles). If there are no such ameliorating circumstances, in a competitive environment, put yourself in the position of a recruiter for a Fortune 500 company or an admissions officer for a great graduate program. GPA does not matter if it comes to a difference between a candidate with a 3.95 GPA and another one with a 3.90 GPA, but would you really say, \u201cNaah, a 2.5 GPA is about the same as a 3.95 GPA?\u201d GPA matters.

Also, I cannot tell whether you\u2019re asking whether a high school GPA matters when applying to a college, or whether a college GPA matters when applying for graduate schools or for jobs in your future. I hope that you will give further details, so I can give a better answer. In the meantime, however, I can tell you that to advance further in school, academic history is usually the most relevant; proof that you were a good student is strong evidence that you will be a good student. For jobs, this is not necessarily true; extracurricular activities or accomplishments outside of the classroom are often more valued in the American Job market. ",

I remember this line I read somewhere.  \"GPA is just the reflection of your belief in the education system.\" To be very frank if you are good enough it won't matter and if you are not good enough it will. Try and be a proficient learner. Learn what you are studying not just for the sake of scoring well but to get better at it. If you go for a job interview or higher studies, you will get more than a few chances to showcase your ability. GPA is one of them. It's upto you if you want your GPA to matter. Don't let a few 3-hour exams decide how good you are. If it helps, I have a below average GPA but I will soon be flying to the states to work with a really good research group headed by professors from Stanford and Oxford. All the best. ",

It\u2019s a time consuming process and they often are tied up checking 100s or more applications. Also there are Employment Businesses that may do it also but again doubtful except for certain positions. The fact you have a Degree, a personal interview are more important to Personnel People. When I first applied for about 8 jobs not once did I have to fill out a line on my GPA or was I asked at interviews. After a few years when I moved up the ladder I would get applications and interview prospective employees. I never bothered with GPAs. Also many jobs only require a Degree in any Major and the Major may have nothing to do with the job and a GPA is not that important. ",
