Won't be able to know until much later on in the year but you can have a look at previous grade boundaries to see where the rough boundary is. The most recent grade boundary were: A*: 164 - 200,A: 133 - 163,B: 95 - 132,C: 57 - 94,D: 28 - 56,E: 13 - 27,U: 0 - 12 ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is the same for any other subject. In most countries, 45% is the passing mark. Sometimes it is 50%. I have been teaching mathematics for quite some time, and I can tell you that it is not advised to aim for such grades. It is better to try to get 75% so that even if you fail to reach your goal, you might at least get 60%. I hope that you will do well if ever you are about to attend an exam. ",
