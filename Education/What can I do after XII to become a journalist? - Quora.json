Having said that Journalism and Mass Communication is a practical oriented course and requires learning of many technical aspects. Journalism students involved in a lot of activities whether it\u2019s print or electronic media, during the course you would go for 6 months training and according to your area of interest PCTE would also gets you a job once you are graduated so you don\u2019t have to look for a job. Journalism and mass communication however is a very interesting course I have seen the students do a lot of practical work, they buzz around the campus to cover campus events with drones, gimble, and other sophisticated gadgets. Also visited this sound proof studio where mixing and editing computers, software and equipment are used by the students. Later saw several videos which were shared in our WhatsApp groups, which were shot and made by Journalism dept students. I was really inspired. So, if you really wanna enhance your skills and are looking for a future in this field you consider checking out my college as they would definitely enhance your skills which would help you a lot once you are graduated and working in the industry. you can go through the website of my college if you want : www.pcte.edu.in ",
