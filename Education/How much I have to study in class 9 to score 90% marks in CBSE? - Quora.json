            "answer_text": "You can be either of the two types: A smart student who gets every concept easily.Or , not so smart one who'll need to work hard.Either way ,you'll need to Work hard and Study smart. Few important tips are: 1.Read NCERT carefully and thoroughly. The questions in exam will be based on NCERT. So, study it thoroughly. The side books may seem tempting but many times, they miss certain topics or facts that NCERT has. NCERT is your main book ,so read it through and through. 2. Build your concept. Take help of reference-books to build your concept. But, don't entirely depend upon them . I repeat, Don't entirely depend upon them. This can really screw your exams. 3.Take notes. I can't emphasis enough how important it is. Taking notes will not only help you understand topics well but will also help you remember them . It will also help you to skip any topic. 4. Follow a time-table. A routine is very necessary to inculcate discipline. And , you won't be able to stay focussed without discipline once you loose motivation. 5. Exercise everyday. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body. You won't be able to study if you're sick. 6. Study everyday. You must not skip study at all , no matter what. It is necessary you keep the momentum going. 7. Give time to every subject. You should not ignore any subject ,no matter how good you are in it. Over confidence can be your undoing. 8. Don't loose confidence. The person sitting next to you , beside you or in front of you IS NOT you. Don't compare yourself with any one . You have your own pace. Look sometimes it gets really hard to continue when you see everyone ahead of you. But, it is also true that most people are \u2018 all talk and no action' . They may not be as strong or ahead as they claim. Stick to your plan and finish your syllabus on time. That's what important. 9. And lastly, take a chill pill. Don't go too hard on yourself . Not getting 90% is not the end of yourself. You won't die if you don't. And always stay true to yourself. ",
