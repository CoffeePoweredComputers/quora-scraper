            "answer_text": "there is no update from any sources of NCERT but as the stage 1 update has already come the stage 2 update is expected to have come soon but its quite sure that the exam will be conducted after ntse stage 1 2021 as the registration for stage 1 is about to start and now ncert will be busy with stage 1 also the date is of December 2020 for stage 1 so conducting ntse stage 2 before it is not favorable but its quite weird to see that the ntse stage 1 is being conducted before the stage 2 of previous year and ncert seems to not to care about the exam as it has been postponed from months because there are fewer students selected for stage 2 and most of them are preparing for other exams in class 11 th . therefore , ncert is not being pressurized from students side to conduct examination . moreover , the examination conducting authority were busy conducting jee and neet . [ it looks like ncert only interested in taking [reg. fee] from students and not giving [scholarship] back to them] hope for the best ! ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t hold your breath. This is a crazy year. The last time it happened in 2014 - when court postponed on the evening before the exam - NTSE was held in August. This year I am not sure\u2026though it is a simple enough as only about 5000 students take the exam. But students have to travel from districts to state capitals where it is held. For that transport has to be restored\u2026so I don\u2019t see how it can be held before things get normal. Also, NTSE is not a priority exam considering it is only a scholarship exam affecting 5000 students. NEET/JEE etc are career defining affecting http://lakhs\u2026.so you see things are not looking rosy right now. When it was postponed in 2014 that was the reason given\u2026that it is only a scholarship exam\u2026and how does it matter when it is held\u2026 ",
