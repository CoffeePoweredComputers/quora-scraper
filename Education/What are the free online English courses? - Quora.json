            "answer_text": "Your question is kind of too big to answer. Firstly, in terms of the definition of course we could divide the courses into two types. We should first know what a course is.  At least four elements should be included in a course academically, namely learning objective, learning content, learning resource, teaching activity, and evaluation.  So, academically speaking, MOOC is the most recommendable for you, with its subclass Massive Open Online English Course will certainly meet your needs.  And, nonacademically speaking, related videos on Youtube or other official site of those very famous universities like Harvard, apps like Duolingo which is based on big data and other training websites like those listed here: Top 10 Websites to Learn English Online for Free Fundamentally, almost all the following are not courses but materials.  Secondly, in terms of  four parts of the English skills namely listening, speaking, reading and writing, I usually go to this sites: Listening: http://www.elllo.org/english/home.htm and BBC listeningSpeaking: http://www.talkenglish.com/ and the tools: Skype, Language Exchange Community - Practice Foreign LanguagesReading: http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/culture/literature-and-creative-writing/reading/content-section-0?name=GSG_3 and the magazine, The EconomicsWriting: https://www.coursera.org/course/basicwriting and tools: Dictionary, Encyclopedia and Thesaurus - The Free Dictionary, synonyms and antonyms of words, lang-8 and Quora Thirdly, in terms of your purpose, you could visit these sites:For IELTS: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ieltsetc... If you could please make it clear that why you want or need to learn a certain language, you will be confused  less.  It actually will take you lots of practice and time, so keep calm and carry on.  Thanks very much for the A2A, and I am hoping to contact you more. ",

            "answer_text": "Who told you that practicing English speaking is the fastest way to learn English? The probability that practicing English speaking online will help you to improve your English communication skills is about 5%; in 95% of adult learners will fail and here is why. Practicing English conversation could not provide the desired results because adult learners are thinking in their native language. It is nearly impossible to think in one language and speak in another. To learn quickly and easily you need to overcome the main barrier of thinking in your native language. To speak fluently you have to think in English! Unfortunately, the English speaking course will not teach you how to think in English. To overcome the tyranny of the mother tongue you need a special approach that will resolve the problem automatically. For adults, it is more beneficial to use comprehensible multimedia input to become fluent in English than using talking to native speakers. The assumption that interacting directly with native speakers is necessary to learn English is a widespread harmful misconception. For example, in China as a result of this misconception, only native speakers are allowed to teach English in private English Training Centers. Did this decision on the Government level help to increase English proficiency in China? Not quite. The English proficiency ranking of China among 80 countries according to the Index introduced by the Swedish firm Education First is still low: in 2017 it was the # 36. What should you do if you don\u2019t know how to begin your sentence? Even after thinking for a while, you stop in the middle of a sentence, and can\u2019t continue because you don\u2019t know a word. If you produce awkward-sounding sentences because you don\u2019t know how to say something in a natural way, you often make mistakes and are not aware of them. Could we recommend multiple applications offering talking to native speakers online for resolving these issues? No, I wouldn\u2019t, because you need more input, not more speaking practice. The multimedia comprehensible input, i.e. reading the text, listening to the recording and speaking at the same time, brings new word blocks to the learner which he first imitates and then after multiple repetitions will be able to produce automatically. The proposed input is comprehensible because the application contains support in the native language that is organized in such a way that it precludes cross-translation. For the sake of brevity, performing concurrently reading, listening and speaking is called simultaneous repetition. The multimedia comprehensible input and simultaneous repetition offer the following advantages: 1. It automatically turns off the innate habit of cross-translating the incoming information into the native language. 2. It allows increasing dramatically the time of active speaking in English because all learners use their devices concurrently due to simultaneous repetition. 3. It allows learners and teachers to create an unlimited number of new lessons using authentic material available online. This is not learning as we know it; it is Active Training in English skills. The installed application, with downloaded lessons, does not require an Internet connection and could be used even in remote areas, thus substantially increasing the database of possible customers.
