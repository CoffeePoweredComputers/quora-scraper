            "answer_text": "I haven't participated in any case study competition but I will tell you what I know about it. The purpose of case study competitions is to promote business education.Different case study competitions may have different formats. Basically there are two formats: Case study completion: Teams will be given a case study and they will be required to provide the solution. The best solution wins.Case study preparation: Teams are required to provide a case study based on a real life problem scenario faced by an existing company or individual and how it was tackled.This is the more prevalent format. As your theme is marketing, you need to concentrate on a company/individual's marketing strategies. Your case study may include scenarios from brand/line extension , brand management, positioning strategy to segmentation challenges.I am citing some instance to help you : Nestle's brand management strategy when it acquired Cadbury giant Rowntree. How it managed and internationalized Rowntree's brands like Kitkat.Another example is how Lenovo , a Chinese computer company , became a well known global brand.Hope it helps. ",
