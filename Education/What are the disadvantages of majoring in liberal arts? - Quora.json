            "answer_text": "I majored in liberal arts for an associates degree, from a local community college. The admissions rep made it sound like a great idea. However, after I graduated, I found out that it was a terrible idea and one of the worst mistakes I have ever made. Even though I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, I could not find a job, in my local area, that paid more than minimum wage and offered more than 20 hours per week. If I had majored in something to do with computers or medical assisting or earl childhood education, I might have been able to find work. After I graduated, I had a lot of student loan debt, I owed over $30.000 for just those two years. You only get 6 months after you graduate before you have to start making payments. My payments were $645.00 per month. That was more than half of what I earned working part-time. The loan company did not care that we had kids to support and had to pay for rent and utilities and our car payment. They did not care if I got sick and had to miss work and pay for medicine. The loan company wanted their money. Eventually, I had to stop paying or we would not have had a place to live. The loan company called several times a day and sent letters every day. Eventually, they tried to garnish my paycheck, but I did not make enough money so it was not garnished. Then, when I had to stop working because of bad health, they tried to garnish our tax returns, and it took a long time to get our refund because only my husband was working, at the time. I ended up and had to go back to school and take out even more loans to try to get a more advanced degree to try to find a job I could do. A BA brought my student loan debt to over $90,000. I still couldn\u2019t find a job in our area and could not afford to move. College reps and local unemployment office then suggested I get a Master\u2019s because then I might be able to teach college classes at the local community college where I got my AA. When I got my Master\u2019s my student loan debt was over $200,000. I was able to get a job teaching\u2026.part-time\u2026for $3500 for one class for one semester at a different community college. $7000 a year before taxes and guess what the student loan people wanted me to pay $3,245.00 per month for my student loans debts. Then, when I try to get better paying jobs, guess what I get told\u2026\u201dYou are overqualified.\u201d Job counselors then told me I should get a Phd. then I would be able to get full time jobs teaching at the local colleges. That Phd, put me into more debt. Now, I owe over $300,000, and still can\u2019t find full-time work in my area and still can not afford to move anywhere\u2026and still can\u2019t afford to pay my student loan payments. People say I could find full-time work in another area of the country. However, I don\u2019t have the money to travel to those areas to go to interviews. Nor, do I have the money I need to move our family anywhere else. My husband graduated from high school (barely). He makes more money an hour than I do and, occasionally, is able to find full-time jobs or a couple part-time ones. Majoring in any form of art is not worth it. It\u2019s a waste of time and money because in most areas of the country\u2026.there are no jobs for us , unless you want to try your hand at writing novels and selling them on Amazon\u2026.I\u2019ve grossed $505 this year doing that\u2026.

            "answer_text": "This is actually a confusing question. Almost nobody majors in something as broad as the liberal arts per se. What they do is attend a liberal arts college and major in one or two of the liberal arts, which, at most schools in the USA, can include anything from studio arts to the STEM and business disciplines. Having taught international business in a liberal arts program for a quarter century, I can think of almost no disadvantages of majoring in one or two of the liberal arts disciplines. Sometimes the key is creating a multi-dimensional major-minor emphasis. Some of my more successful advisees have combined, for instance, a business or economics major with a minor in something like Spanish or psychology. That combination opens up opportunities for either further studies in graduate school or for occupations that combine multiple fields, particularly in this era of globalization. The only real problem that emerges is when one graduates with a major that is extremely niche-oriented but has no supporting field: women\u2019s studies, German literature, Asian studies might be examples. But even graduates in these fields often build very successful careers after graduate programs. ",
