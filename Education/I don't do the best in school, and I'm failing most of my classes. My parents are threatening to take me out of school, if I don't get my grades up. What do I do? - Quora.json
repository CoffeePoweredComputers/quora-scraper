            "answer_text": "It has been my experience that there are two types of people who do well in school. The first are those who are naturally blessed with a high IQ and with little or no effort, breeze through. It has also been my experience that most but not all these high IQ students are somewhat inept when it comes to social skills. They can be impatient with others who \u201ddon\u2019t catch on\u201d, or they can also be a little to quick to pull the trigger, because they believe they already have it figured out. The second type who do well are those who have a passion for their field of study. a sense of honor for their contributions, a sense of achievements not just for themselves, but for the breakthroughs in their chosen fields and will use those things as a springboard to do even better. These people, imo, are generally blessed with common sense. They are likely to be heavily involved in social gatherings, team sports and outside interests that add to developing a personality that others want to associate with. There is a third type person, not so much scholarly as they are just content or even happy to do their job, perhaps have a family, pay the bills and enjoy the football games with friends and family. They are just as an important a segment of our society as the others described because they too make an important contribution to our well being. Imagine a world where every accountant aspired to be the CFO. Obviously we would not have enough companies to support such a dream. Our social and economic society depends on diversity and presenting various levels of happiness. An honest self evaluation should tell you which of these three types you prefer to be inclusive. You may believe you are currently a Type 3 person, without a high IQ nor a real passion. If so, give yourself the time to discover who you are and what you are about. My middle son, started college and shortly thereafter came to me and said he wanted to drop out and go to Hawaii, live with a friend, surf everyday and earn just enough to pay his rent and to eat. He had already reflected his lack of interest in college by doing poorly. My advice to him was to go to Hawaii, live his dream life and when he was ready to commit to his education, call me. I promised when that time came, he need only call and I would provide the ticket home. His experience in Hawaii including befriending a Chiropractor and learning more about what it meant when one could actuate pain relief. It took a year, but when the call came, the ticket was provided and he proved himself outstanding in his chosen career. Neither of us ever regretting his decisions and gave him some life experience used throughout his career. God bless you and guide you in life\u2019s important decisions. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't do the best in school, and I'm failing most of my classes. My parents are threatening to take me out of school, if I don't get my grades up. What do I do? I\u2019m assuming you want to stay in school and improve. If that\u2019s the case, do you understand why you\u2019re not doing as well as you\u2019d like? If not, would it help to figure that out? (Are you disinterested? Might you have a learning disability? Does the material not make sense to you? Is the workload too high? Do you struggle when you have to take tests, and are some types of tests more difficult than others? Are you obtaining some kind of benefit by not doing well?) It can be easier (not easy, but less difficult) to address the issue if you\u2019ve identified it specifically, and you may want help doing both the investigating and the remedying. Have you sat down and discussed it with your parents (or if not, is that a possibility)? Do you think they\u2019d be receptive and helpful if you let them know you want to do well, but something seems to be stopping you even though you\u2019re genuinely trying? Have you asked your teachers or counselors about it? Even if you don\u2019t identify the underlying cause, you may still be able to find tricks or techniques that help. Again, chances are your teachers have helped students through this before, and even though everyone\u2019s different, they may still have ideas that work for you. Maybe it\u2019s changing the time, place, or manner in which you study. Maybe it\u2019s coming in for extra help. Maybe it\u2019s as simple as creating a reward system for yourself that gets you through the day\u2019s classes and homework. For me it was painful to do homework alone. It wasn\u2019t that I needed help; it was the alone-ness. So I\u2019d work in the kitchen where family would be around, or in study hall, or on the phone with a friend. In college (a Psych class, of all things!) one student told the professor he had trouble with multiple-choice exams and did better with essays, and the prof agreed to let him take essay tests while the rest of us did multiple-choice. I can imagine how stressful and discouraging this must be for you, but please remember that you\u2019re not alone, and keep in mind that countless other students have dealt with\u2014and overcome\u2014similar struggles. It\u2019s a question of continuing to look for solutions and trying different ideas until you find some that work for you. And as ridiculous and unbelievable as it probably sounds now, learning to work through today\u2019s difficulties will most likely teach you skills that will put you ahead of many others as an adult. Best wishes. ",
