            "answer_text": "Hope can either make you succeed or it can shatter you to pieces. The chances of the latter happening are more but there\u2019s also a teeny weeny slice of chance that it might work and you succeed. Isn\u2019t that worth holding on to? To me, hope is a beautiful thing. It keeps you going, helps you get past all the hurdles thrown at you. It\u2019s like, you are your own motivator. It keeps you going even it\u2019s for a lost cause. Isn\u2019t it a great thing? Some would disagree with this, they say hope only leads to disappointments. Some have even gone to the extent that they\u2019ve blatantly asked me not to hope for anything. *sighs* Let me cite a very silly example, Me and my friends play an online game, we were on a 26 match win streak and then on the 27th match we were drawn against a tough opponent, I had already messed up my attack and we were left trailing the opponent 27\u201328(30 needed to win the match), they had five attacks left and we had only one. The last attack from our side was a brilliant one , which fetched us 2 stars and the scores were 29\u201328, but they still had FIVE attacks left. I knew we had lost the match, I had given up on all hopes of continuing our dream of a 50 match streak. But then the most unusual thing happened, they did only two attacks, which were unsuccessful and didn\u2019t use thee other three attacks , so the scores remained 29\u201328 and we won the match. I had given up on all hopes of winning the match, but I wish I hadn\u2019t. This and many other incidents have always restored and reinforced my belief in hope every time when my faith on it was wavering. To them I\u2019d say, don\u2019t you just hope for something and wait for it to it\u2019s magic, do something to increase its chances. Hope is not pretending that troubles don\u2019t exist, it is the hope that they won\u2019t last forever. Hope is like your puny little voice squealing \u2018maybe\u2019, when the entire world yells \u2018no\u2019. \u201cI know it's crazy to believe in silly things, but it's not that easy.\u201d -High Hopes.

            "answer_text": "It's been sometime I wrote an answer and here I am writing an answer on something that means a lot to me. Writing on a word that has been my friend for many years, a word more powerful than the strength of Hercules, more sharp than the blade of King Arthur.  Quora helped me reach a point where I found my experiences in life helping people reach me out who are in similar situations where I once was, some corner fighting the battle I once fought. With my answers I have been greeted with amazing messages from people who have asked me for how I fought this battle and how should they move ahead. What did I give them? I of course couldn't fly to them and reach them out in person. But I gave them a powerful weapon that became my strength. That weapon my friend is hope.  What is hope? Hope is like a fire. Once lit, even the fiercest and the most chilly wind can never touch you.  Hope holds within itself strength to allow a man to walk a path filled with thorns and burning coal.  Hope holds illumination which can blind all the negativity turning everything positive with its luminosity.  Why is hope necessary? I question you why not? We all need hope. How can a person dream when the person has no hope of achieving it. I don't deny hard work pays. But we need motivation. In today's time, people have no time for one another. To motivate oneself, one needs oneself to motivate. How to motivate? To hope am already close and my goal shall and was always mine. What does hope do? Let's think of two convicts falsely framed in a case that sentenced them to life imprisonment. These two men were robbed off their life and they were not sentenced to death but were truly given the feeling of being dead. But there was a difference. The difference between the two was of hope. One accepted his inevitable doom and the other didn't. What did the other have? He had faith and strength. But from where this man got faith and strength? Hadn't the almighty ruined his plans for life? He had a weapon. A power that can invoke light in zero illumination. That man had hope. With this hope of waking one morning by the sun, to feel the breeze of freedom blow by his rustled hairs and to feel the smell of salt across the ocean, this man devised a plan to escape the abyss. It took time but he never let hope die. The hope of freedom gave him strength to forge a way out. For us, it\u2019s a story of freedom, but for him it was finally payback for his undying belief in his hope for re-birth into the world which was once his. People who know me have read my story and know that I am a frequent flyer into the dark dungeon which I famously call the hell\u2019s gate. Each time in it. I have felt so helpless. I have prayed for mercy to sometimes death. But I let something stronger come into me.  \u201cEverything is gonna be fine\u201d and that was my hope. And trust me the battle was long. I had battle scars but the man that re-surged from the abyss became more stronger and fearless. I did it without a sword or an arrow. I slowed the poison of depression and cured the poison of emptiness with my belief in hope. With this answer I urge each and everyone out there who are in situations where life has either come to a standstill or is approaching an end, don't loose hope. And if your loosing it, hesitate not to message me. Together we shall find hope for you. In the end my favorite quote,\u201dGod is kind and hope is a beautiful thing.\u201d ",
