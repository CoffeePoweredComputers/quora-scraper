            "answer_text": "No, They don\u2019t allow for this\u2026 There are restrictions for students living in the hostels to visit outside the campus after the academic hours are over. Say it is 6:00 PM and then the morning batch is over, you need permission of the warden of the hostel to put your feet outside the campus.Even if you are studying in evening batch you can't go outside of the campus after 6:00 PM. On the University holidays eg. Holi, Diwali, Dussehra etc. or any vacation announced by the Amity University, You have to take passes one evening before the holiday starts, through which you will be able to go outside and after the holiday is over you can enter the campus with the same pass to the hostel as a token of your Identity along with your campus ID i.e. with your enrollment ID. No excuses will be entertained if you stay a night outside the campus without giving any information or without taking permission of the warden of the hostel. One more thing that adds into it that there is attendance at every morning and evening inside the Campus for Hostel students and you should have minimum 80% of the present in the whole semester. Without that you wouldn't be able to live in the hostel any more for next semester. Hope it will help\u2026. ",
