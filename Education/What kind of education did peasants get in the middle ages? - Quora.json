            "answer_text": "The vast majority received no education, at least not in the way we think of education today. By the end of the Medieval period in England, no more than 5% of the population could read or write. The idea of education for peasants (or the lower classes) is a very recent one. Education for non-aristocratic or landed classes didn't exist in any real sense before British Empire and the new middle-class that emerged from its necessity for skilled clerks, accountants, etc. My knowledge of Medieval education is of that in England, so this would not be universally true for Continental Europe. In England there were basically three types of schools we could loosely connect to what we call primary/secondary school today. There were elementary song-schools which were usually connected to the local parish church. As their name implies, these were schools which taught younger boys hymns in the Latin and, if the local priest was literate, they may learn to read and write. If a peasant farmer were to receive any education it would have been in one of these schools and in turn the boy would have labored for the church. The other two types of schools were for the sons of noble birth or landed gentry. The first of these was the Monastic school. Monastic schools prepared boys for priesthood and all teaching was of a religious nature. The second was grammar school. These schools were also connected to the Church, but were usually located in the larger churches and cathedrals throughout England. In these schools boys were taught Latin grammar, as well as logic and rhetoric. Boys who excelled in grammar school would eventually go on to Oxford or Cambridge to obtain their Bachelor\u2019s Degree. ",

            "answer_text": "It differed, it depended on a time and a plece. However since the Fourth Lateran Council of 1213\u20131215 there should had been a school for boys in every parish.In Italy or France there might be a parish church with a priest in almost every village, at least in the nearest town, a couple of miles away. In the younger Christian countries, like Mazovia in Poland, a village might lay a couple of dozen miles from the nearest parish church, so certainy less peasant boys could manage to frequent school there. Also the priests in the provinces were often less educated, sometimes on a verge of secondary Latin illiteracy.The boys in such a parish school were taught some basic religious matters, reading in vernacular, at least so much that they could read from a prayer book and a psalter, some basic arithmetics, a little of general contemporary knowledge about ther world - geography, history, nature. From the inquisitions protocols of the trials against Cathars in Montaillou, a small village in the Pyrenees with only around 250 inhabitants, at the beginning of the fourteenth century, we know that in this backwater place the peasants had no much trouble reading various, often heretic, books and to dispute their contents.If not these parochial schools, neither the Guttenberg revolution, not the Protestant movement would have had a chance for success.
