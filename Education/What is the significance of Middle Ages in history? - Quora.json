            "answer_text": "The Middle Ages lasted for a millennium, between the Fall of the Western Roman Empire (456) and the discovery of America (1492). In European historiography, it was preceded by Antiquity, and followed by so-called Renaissance era. The term is a specifically European concept, irrelevant for the rest of the world. The Middle Ages saw the establishment of a specific and elaborate European Christian civilization, entirely different from the Greek and Roman Antiquity which almost only involved Mediterranean countries. The Middle Ages can be divided into two different phases, roughly before and after year 1000. The early stage is known as the Upper Middle Ages or Dark Ages. Dark Ages The Roman Empire had already been split into two halves. The Eastern Roman empire aka Byzantine had adopted Christianity early on, was relatively spared by invasions, and remained fairly prosperous. The western half including the city of Rome was run over by a series of invasions by Germanic peoples (Wisigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals, Franks, Lombards etc.). The Germanic tribes established Christian states in the Southwest of Europe, which remained backwards and autarchic. Civilization receded in all areas by comparison with Roman times. The rest of non-romanized Europe maintained a tribal and pagan organization as it had been during the Roman era.  There was an enormous expansion of Slavic people, spreading to the whole plains of Eastern Europe, and intto the Balkans. There were also continued waves of invasions by Central Asian people (Huns, Bulgars, Khazars, Magyars). The Vikings from Scandinavia also famously raided Europe during this period from France and the British Isles to Russia. A major split that occurred across the Mediterranean with the expansion of Islam. The Byzantines lost more than half of their territories to the Arabs, whose dominions spread until the Atlantic and conquered the whole of Spain in the 8th century. The Pope in Rome claimed for hegemony over the Christian World as a successor of St Peter, but had to rely on the Byzantines for its defence. In 800, Charlemagne was crowned by the Pope as Emperor. The Frankish Empire became the major contender to the Byzantines as a Christian power, extending over France, Northern Italy, Germany and the Low Countries. It developed a culture and institutions which served as a model for other European States. By the year 1000, Christianity had extended to the whole continent, with only a few pagan remnants in the Northeast. Beyond religion, it revived civilization after a long standstill, and brought diversified agriculture and handicraft, script and urbanization to lands that had little or none until then. France broke away from the former Frankish empire, the rest turning into the Holy Roman empire, still extending over much of Europe as the major catholic power. Tension grew between the Pope and the Byzantine Empire, eventually ending into a major split in 1045, which resulted in a lasting divide between Western and Eastern Europe. Russia and the Balkan countries would develop according to the Byzantine model, forming a sub-civilization of their own.  Feudalism The Middle Ages saw the establishment of an elaborate hierarchy of the nobility. Similar titles would be found in most countries with a few local variants : king, prince, duke, count, knight etc. The noble families adopted coats of arms which developed into heraldry. In principle, every rank owed allegiance to the superior one. A knight culture of honor developed, knights were supposed to defend \u201cthe widow and the orphan\u201d. The past of invasions had led to a marked tendency to fortify everything : castles, abbeys, cities. This focus on defence was illustrated by the use of crenelations, drawbridges and moats. Soldiers wore chainmail, and armament became elaborate. At the bottom of society was peasantry, which amounted for most of the population. The roman institution of slavery was replaced by serfdom. Serfs could not be bought or sold, but they were tied to the land that they cultivated for the lords. New farming techniques were introduced, notably the three field system.  Society Religion was central in medieval European society. The Pope was the highest authority in all of Western Europe, and could excommunicate kings or Emperors who would not comply. The Church was very wealthy, owning much of the land, and high titles in its ranks were reserved to noble families. Pilgrimages were common, and saints and relics worshipped. A whole elaborate collection of religious orders appeared. Up to one fourth of the population might have lived in convents or nunneries. There were however numerous heresies like the Cathars that could extend to whole regions. Heretics were burnt at the stake. Jews were tolerated in certain professions, but ostracized and routinely persecuted.  Outside of the countless castles and fortresses, the most impressive buildings were abbeys, churches and cathedrals. These went from the more simple Romanesque style to the elaborate Gothic one. Cathedrals were monumental when you consider the small size of the cities, and they usually took several generations of workers to be built. A spectacular art of stained glass windows developed. Hell, demons and the Last Judgement were commonly portrayed in the front of churches, to scare commoners away from sin. Sculpture and painting existed in primitive form, almost only dealing with religious subjects. Gabled and half-timbered houses were iconic of the period.  The rise of Islam had disrupted Mediterranean trade. As a compensation, the Northern and the Baltic Seas opened as new trade regions. The eastern plains added plenty of cultivable land. A whole network of cities appeared in Western Europe, often organized as free communes with mayors and city halls, soon forming trading leagues (the Hanseatic league in the North was the most famous). The different professions were organized in guilds. Venice was the biggest trade center with the Byzantine and the Orient. Its canals were mythical, and emulated a vast network in the Low Countries. Banks appeared most notably in Italy, and wealthy merchants bought nobility titles.  Literacy was very low for today\u2019s standards, although difficult to evaluate. Books were manuscript, copied manually by monks, and sometimes decorated with miniatures. Latin was the language of the educated, but local languages started being written. A network of Universities developed, counted by dozens at the end of the period. At the time, they mostly focused on theology, but would play a key role in the spread of knowledge later on. Literature was very much focused on religion, but poetry, chronicles, tales and farces appeared. Courts were entertained by troubadours and minstrels, which would spread the chivalric ideals of courtly love. Medieval music is not well documented, but music and dancing were common in all classes of society.  Cities were numerous, but small. Only Constantinople was very large, with about half a million people. At the end of the Middle Ages, the largest other ones would have about 100.000 people. They were cramped, which gave way to epidemics, most notably the Black Plague in the 14th century. Hygiene conditions were generally poor. The nobility ate mostly game and venison, except on Fridays and lent when fish was mandatory, while the common people survived on bread, butter and porridge. Fruit and vegetables were rare. Punishments were harsh and varied : beheading, burning, quartering, fledgling etc. Torture was commonplace. Life in medieval Europe was certainly most unpleasant by today\u2019s standards, but such was human condition throughout the world at the time. Relations with the rest of the world The only non Christian civilization well known to Europeans were the Muslims, and relationships were notably hostile. The Middle Ages saw the gradual reconquest of Spain and Portugal over the Moors. In the Southeast, Ottoman Turks had started to attack the Byzantine Empire, eventually conquering Constantinople in 1453 and absorbing the whole Balkans. Russia was isolated and badly known to West Europeans, and large parts of it underwent a 200+ year long occupation by the Mongols after 1240. A major movement was the Crusades, started in 1066 to reconquer Jerusalem from the Turks. Countless knights participated, seeing the occasion to increase their status if ever they came back alive. The Crusaders managed to occupy the shores of the Levant for sometime, but the Crusades were globally a failure. They lasted however for two centuries.  However loathed and feared, the Muslim civilization was also admired. Arabs had built a trading network extending over three continents, and had achieved high standards in sciences. The little science that existed in Medieval Europe was initially modelled on Arabs, best illustrated by the adoption of Arabic numbers and the introduction of countless Arabic or Persian loanwords. However, Europeans started to catch up gradually, and would soon surpass all other civilizations with the spread of the printing press. The spices introduced by Arabs triggered curiosity and envy. Venetian Marco Polo had made his famous journey to China in the 13th century. But it was mostly India which captured attention. It was in an attempt to reach India by the West that Columbus discovered America, mistaking it for India and wrongly naming its people Indians. The Portuguese started sailing along the African coast. Legacy The extraordinary economic boom in Europe that resulted of printing and global exploration made the Middle Ages appear as backwards and obscure in the ensuing Renaissance period and beyond. However, the Middle Ages have set the standards for an autochthonous European civilization, which was in fact pretty sophisticated, already comparing favorably with other advanced parts of the world such as China, India and the Muslim lands, all referred to as \u201cthe Orient\u201d by Europeans. It was in the 19th century that a revival of interest for the Middle Ages took place, with neo-gothic architecture, historical novels and revisiting of the European past by historians. The interest has not dwindled since, and the European Middle Ages still nowadays. At the turn of our century, there was a marked interest in Europe\u2019s pagan and medieval past, widely felt in music and modern fantasy. ",
