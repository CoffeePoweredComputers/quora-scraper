            "answer_text": "If you are highly talented and driven, it shouldn\u2019t \u201cmatter\u201d, unless you are looking for a very tiny segment of all jobs. Some people will say those who aren\u2019t Ivy are \u201csour grapes\u201d. I\u2019ve gotten that before. My sincere rebuttal: I was accepted to an Ivy League school for undergraduate, but didn\u2019t go because long-term costs were excessive relative to benefits. In almost every discretionary product market, what\u2019s considered the pinnacle of quality is at a price much higher than what it\u2019s intrinsically worth. However, overpriced doesn\u2019t always mean bad. If the terms are favorable to highly specific goals, then you should consider biting the bullet. After continued deliberate analysis and soul-searching, I concluded the alternative was extraordinarily more favorable. Exception: Your family is from low-income/URM family to qualify for free tuition/scholarships. For me, that wasn\u2019t the case and it wasn\u2019t lack of trying for scholarships - I sent more than 200 applications and got <$300 in merit scholarship money, despite a perfect score. In short, I decided on state flagship in Texas at UT Austin, because in my case, I would save almost $500,000 difference in student loans for undergraduate and medical school. If including loan interest, that would make the Ivy League a million dollar mistake for someone like me. If I imagine I was an Ivy League graduate right now, I would gladly gain $1,000,000 to be where I am right now. (Jeff Bezos calls this the \u201cregret minimization framework\u201d) That being said, the analysis is more nuanced than that - factors such as educational quality, location, total costs and networking matter, my thought process is later explained. My dad went to Harvard.  I am currently more wealthy than my dad. He had a 40 year headstart and an Ivy League degree. Here\u2019s my thought process: My belief was and still is: Ivy Leagues are incentivized to select more talented people that will likely become successful, but not necessarily help them become more successful beyond what was intrinsic. This doesn\u2019t mean that \u201cselection\u201d is necessarily a negative attribute, it\u2019s closest to something in between a \u201cclub good\u201d and \u201cprivate good\u201d. Ivy League schools has similar characteristics of a \u201cVeblen good\u201d, especially when it is a degree where it is more difficult to evaluate skills and quality i.e. liberal arts or business degrees. I\u2019m not going to say names don\u2019t matter at all. That is absolutely false. Names matter because it\u2019s a brand - in essence a marketing signal. That being said, marketing is only useful if you get a return on it, otherwise you\u2019re engaging in a high \u201cmarketing burn rate\u201d. This strongly depends on what you\u2019re applying to, what you are seeking, and how much the signal matters to who you\u2019re sending the signal to. Ivies especially are critical for certain \u201cextremely selective\u201d employers as signalling for social closure in \u201celite\u201d labor markets. Ivy League seniors survey shows they aim for law (25%), finance/IB (17%), management consulting (12%). That\u2019s over half the class looking to move to extremely selective prestigious job markets. The \u201cIvy-to-Wall-Street\u201d pipeline is quite real. Recruiters seduce you early on with a familiar \u201celite selective\u201d structured application processes and fancy offices, insulating you from the start. These \u201celite\u201d labor markets are generally competitive even among Ivy League graduates, so they rarely look at any other schools. Ultimately, this boils down to economics, unless money doesn\u2019t matter to you at all. I have always believed in avoiding competition unless absolutely necessary, because that\u2019s where you really make the most value. Let this fundamental but often overlooked concept of economics digest - in a capitalistic environment, perfect competition is the anti-thesis of the accumulation of capital, because competition will compete away all your profits in the long run! I'm not saying people should always be motivated by money or something like that, but I think we should be a little bit more critical of perfect competition as a rationalization, and look at cost-benefit ratio for prestige brands. We should also be wary about not making a fundamental error on market sizing. A new Italian restaurant with a new recipe in an area without Italian restaurants is not devoid of competition, but is likely operating in a highly competitive market of the restaurant industry. Most customers likely don\u2019t care if your recipe is better than your grandma\u2019s recipe. When I was deciding which school (state flagship vs. Ivy) to attend, here is what my decision process yielded: Opportunities of Ivy relative to state flagship: Specific employers in \u201ctop-tier\u201d law firms, financial companies and management consulting firms use Ivy as the major hiring heuristic and recruitment. Relative to state flagship, there is a significant benefit for those specific employers that make up a tiny percent of all employers. If you need the \u201cname brand\u201d to get into those \u201ctop tier\u201d firms, I would suggest getting a top 10 MBA after a flagship undergraduate, paid by your employer who will write it off taxes unless you get a free ride in an Ivy League. Why pay exorbitantly more for prestige when you don\u2019t have to? You don\u2019t need to chase an expensive Ivy League for undergraduate to do that. In the same state, flagship schools have an excellent reputation. In other states, it likely won\u2019t hurt your employment opportunities, because it\u2019s still a strong reputation. My fianc\u00e9 is also from a state flagship - University of Florida with a full ride - and got a 6 figure engineering job quite easily here in Texas. Outside of the tiny amount of \u201celite\u201d labor markets, what matters is individual effort, smarts, and personality. My fiance out-earns 75%+ of all Ivy League graduates. I will out-earn 90%+ of Ivy League graduates, on a physician salary doing what I love. This does not take into account real earnings - when you include state taxes, size of student loans and cost of living. If we include that, my fiance will out-earn 90%+ of Ivy League grads. In fact, we can both retire at 40 - if we wanted to.Connections and alumni network are supposedly \u201csuperior\u201d. You\u2019ll undoubtedly make contacts that feed into the \u201celite job markets\u201d, but I highly suspect that depends on the person. \u201cSuperior at X\u201d is not the same as \u201csuperior\u201d. Personally, the alumni network in UT has been highly valuable to me, while it didn\u2019t really do anything notable for my dad because Ivy League students have an additional layer of selection amongst themselves. If you can\u2019t connect with people by joining the in-group, then you\u2019re not going to get much out of the network. You\u2019re going to get weeded out of friendships based on what you can afford (it\u2019s easy to tell from family background and occupation). I couldn\u2019t afford what I saw going on in Harvard. The UT alumni network landed me multiple opportunities in entrepreneurship and helped me close software contract sales. It is also much larger. UT has 40,000+ undergrads and 500,000+ alumni. Alumni are very \u201cprideful\u201d about the school and it\u2019s often called \u201cbleeding burnt orange\u201d - don\u2019t take my word for it, search for it yourself - alumni always give a second look if they hear UT and classmates are much more empathetic. In addition, size does matter - UT has the most Fortune 1000 CEOs and it doesn\u2019t pale much compared to Ivy in those types of job markets when it increases your sheer chances substantially at \u201cthe numbers game\u201d.Resources are supposedly \u201csuperior\u201d. This depends on a lot of variables and there\u2019s no clear cut general answer. There is no doubt Harvard and Yale has a overall huge amount of resources, relative to state flagships. That being said, when we look at relative resources - in my case, UT has the 3rd largest endowment in the nation and is one of the three that received an AAA rating from S&P for strong and stable financing outlook, even in a recession. I had no trouble getting research opportunities or outstanding professors. This really depends on the school, department and what resources you seek. You have to do your own research.Costs of Ivy relative to state flagship: Extremely high cost of attendance. I personally save ~$60,000 a year for 8 years (B.S. + M.D.) from the difference in cost of attendance - that\u2019s half a million in student loans, not including interest - which can balloon to ~$1,000,000 dollars in just one decade after school. The high cost does not pay off either - you generally do not get a significant earnings advantage, unless that is you get a free ride by being from a low-income family or as a underrepresented minority. In state-funded schools, the tuition is partly subsidized by the state.There is a selection bias among Ivy League graduates towards track dependency of prestigious \u201celite job markets\u201d that are landlocked in highest-cost of living areas. What cities do Ivy League grads overwhelmingly stay at? New York City, NY; Boston, MA; San Francisco, CA. $100,000 in Houston, TX is easily $200,000 in those areas (see the \u201clifestyle trap\u201d). My cost of living (rent+utilities+meals) is about $7,050 a year right next to campus with my private apartment. Harvard \u201cestimates\u201d the cost of living is $30,000 per year and can be much higher depending on the individual, and they\u2019re more likely to keep paying that early on after graduation since their identity is intertwined with living in a certain way. Savings rates are estimated to be about 12% on average for these people. (Wealth Inequality in the United States since 1913: evidence from capitalized income tax data. Emmanuel Saez & Gabriel Zucman) If you want to stay in a certain area, you should consider locale-specific reputation for those specific careers. It\u2019s 10x easier to amass professional connections with your neighbors in a community based on proximity. Most jobs are based on who you know. They already know what\u2019s it like to work with you and can give you a convincing recommendation.Increased risk of burnout. Health > Money. Staying healthy in mind and body is much harder than making extra bucks. The cost of burnout is much higher than you think in Ivy League. Burnout costs employers $150\u2013300 billion a year. This is not a ticket to slack off, but one must also consider the risks of overloaded expectations in a cut-throat environment. My medical school has an emphasis and culture of chillness and cooperativity. That increases productivity because we are there to help each other out, not outcompete each other by a few points with relatively obscure medical knowledge that will be forgotten after graduation. Stress is already high in medical school, why add to it with irritated attendings and cut-throat classmates if it doesn\u2019t increase your salary substantially? On top of that, 58% of Princeton students report feeling well rested only three or fewer days per week. It is one thing to have a strong work ethic (presumably), but another to undergo sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is directly counterproductive to memory, learning and creativity. This is particularly well-documented in the literature with strong evidence, yet Princeton claims they cultivate students to be \u201ccreative\u201d in their marketing materials. They should focus on getting their students well rested first.Talented students at non-Ivy universities can possibly get more attention from professors (depends on the culture). Personally, I would get the time of the day from the department heads in state flagships really easily. To my understanding, the best academians only conduct research, and even if they offer a course, it\u2019s not easy to get a spot. Look at the rankings of RateMyProfessor or any other data regarding how professors treat students (US News doesn\u2019t take this into account, and basically rooted as a popularity contest amongst college presidents), here's how all the Ivy League schools fared: 111. Princeton University 152. Columbia University 187. University of Pennsylvania 196. Brown University 213. Yale University 247. Harvard University 294. Dartmouth College 414. Cornell University. Out of ~600 schools. Abstract matters, such as credit/recognition, generally warps academia. Clearly, most schools are biased towards tweaking their numbers in terms of what increases their rankings, and tend to de-prioritize anything that doesn\u2019t increase their rankings, such as actually getting more quality professor time at a reasonable cost. Becoming a professor is extremely competitive at good state schools, so you really aren\u2019t missing out relative to Ivies. In fact, the honors courses always had the most outstanding faculty with no trouble enrolling, since the spots were fixed to honor students only.Don\u2019t ask whether Ivy League matters. What you should ask is - what matters to you? There are areas with significantly higher social impact - such as research, startups, politics, grantmakers and non-profits that require highly skilled people. Work backwards - if getting into an elite bulge bracket IBD is your dream, I highly encourage you to consider top \u201cprestigious\u201d Ivy League schools they care most about. However, you should be assessing whether crunching mind-numbing Excel sheets for 100 hours a week as a entry level grunt is what you\u2019d enjoy as a career. If it\u2019s only the money you\u2019re after, then you should still consider opinion on Wall Street: A Wall Streeter Tackles An Age-Old Debate \u2014 Do You Take Prestige Or Money? According to the article, in short: \u201cA better decision metric would have been: F**k prestige, get money.\u201d For those who are not just for the money which I assume is a substantial crowd - think about this - a big company teaches you how to work for a big company - generally slow, bureaucratic and frustrating. A small company or self-employment will pile more valuable responsibilities to the most talented person at a breakneck rate. That prepares you for everything and sets you up for maximum impact - no risk, no reward. To give some color - small businesses make up 99.7% of US employers. Nobody cares where you come from if you bring enormous value. Non-monetary value dictates you are missing out on the entire universe which has immensely high value by only joining the extremely narrow range of big companies. In fact, it might well be riskier, since big companies don\u2019t do \u201cwatch jobs\u201d anymore. It is past the time where you stay at the same company for life. Everyone is essentially disposable in a recession, unless they are the few that are \u201ccritically needed\u201d. Ultimately, what matters is what sort of career you seek, what are the costs, how you relate to people, and what value you bring. The notion that you\u2019ve got to do X, Y, and Z or else your life is over is clearly flawed. All I can say is that you have to follow your own dreams, think critically, and make well-informed decisions. Ask in-depth questions such as \u201cBest how?\u201d, \u201cBest for whom?\u201d, \u201cBest at what price?\u201d, rather than the undefined superlative of \u201cBest?\u201d. Rankings generally focus on the superfluous, and doesn\u2019t always make the best personal fit. Other considerations: Contrary to what Ty Doyle says: In medicine, Ivy prestige does not increase your future salary or medical school acceptance rates. This is a common misconception. I will point to my current medical school class - only 1\u20132 Ivy League graduates out of 220 students. Take a look at salaries for doctors from state vs. Ivy League schools. There is no premium. In fact, the average board exam scores (which is the top determinant of your residency match and consequently, salary) for my state flagship are higher than almost all the Ivy League medical schools. Ask any doctor and he/she will agree that salaries won\u2019t be higher. This makes it clear that the quality of curriculum, attitude of the professors, and individual drive are more important than getting the most prestigious name in medicine. To sweeten the deal, physicians salaries AND real earnings are generally significantly higher in Texas and in-state tuition is the lowest in the nation. That being said, I agree with Ty for law school - being in the top 10 matters a lot for prestigious law firms, with some rare exceptions - the bimodal distribution of salary inflates the average law graduate salaries. In response to Alex K. Chen: Don\u2019t just base it on class size as a whole, but find out how each school breaks the class down from a whole into its smaller parts. It wasn\u2019t commuter for me. Both private and school dorms were right next to campus. My college and medical school dorm cost me ~$400/month including utilities with my own private room, right next to school. On the contrary, it wasn\u2019t hard to break into \u201cfriend groups\u201d as people in Austin are quite open to new friends. This depends on the culture, rather than size. It was not hard to make friends in a \u201cbig school\u201d as the amount of diversified choices in interest groups and classes are high. Also, my current class size is 220, but the small group PBL sessions are 6\u20137 people per faculty. Attention matters. Everybody has a scarce resource called time. Two of the department heads would entertain my request for meeting in one room for joint research with me by taking out time from their busy schedule and coordinate a meeting. If you had the experience of coordinating busy schedules, it\u2019s quite messy. It\u2019s not a matter of being \u201ctoo busy\u201d, but ultimately what their priorities are. I think students should consider schools that have more strong faculty who make students a priority, whether Ivy or not. With higher Ivy grade inflation and lackluster general undergraduate lecture quality, we should question the assumption that Ivy Leagues have generally better teacher attitudes and class/academic rigor without proper analysis. The priorities are skewed towards not adding value to students, but publishing papers in prestigious journals to maintain the brand prestige. Although this can heavily depend on the individual professor as well. The main point is you are more likely to shine if the professors prioritize cultivating talented students. These professors are going to be the network base for which you get references and contacts. Almost all of the department heads have top credentials in my medical school, so I really maximize bang for buck. Location matters. This is another factor I looked at in the process of choosing which school to attend. If your network is in the same state, it will be highly advantageous for your pursuits. Not to mention, Texas has no state income tax, strong asset protection, and favorable tort reform. With the new tax bill, real earnings are even better than before relative to high tax states such as NY, MA and CA. Texas has ~2% effective state taxes for high income earners. It\u2019s also one of the most business and landlord friendly states out there. If you plan to obtain high leverage in real estate markets, Texas is an excellent choice for inflation protection, because asset prices stayed steady throughout 2009 when the housing bubble burst. Houston especially is a good location for my RE investment purposes because the \u201cno zoning\u201d allows supply to meet demand, which reduces the likelihood of a real estate asset \u201cbubble\u201d and increases long-term health of the city by keeping rents low for both commercial and residential. Higher education predators. On the other end of the spectrum, don\u2019t mistake colleges that are known to be predators, you know - mostly the ones that offer an easy degree on advertisers that only see the dollars. Don\u2019t believe the average college degree makes you richer \u201chype\u201d, asymmetric outcomes are more likely to happen because there is a lot of noise and dilution. There is a clear problem with new institutions, especially specific for-profit colleges that prey on students that can\u2019t make it anywhere else. If you are just looking for a 9\u20135 \u201cwhite-collar\u201d job, look carefully at the value of your degree - in particular student loan default rates and similar career profiles on LinkedIn to assess the job market. There are many more people in college these days, so attending a \u201cdiploma mill\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much. You don\u2019t need the name or even college for that matter to make as much as a Ivy League graduate in an \u201celite\u201d investment banking job. You make your own fate by working as smart and hard as possible. If you follow \u201cavoid competition unless absolutely necessary\u201d, you should be very careful how you select your college institution for a lasting, sustainable edge over a lifetime, or consider alternatives you may enjoy, such as trade schools. Focus your efforts on what matters to you and do your own research. Prestige should only be a tool, not an idol. Don\u2019t go into Ivy just because your high school friends hype it up. Think critically beyond the hype - and assess what\u2019s the best decision for your situation. Heck, even a \u201cblue-collar\u201d government janitor (How one Bay Area janitor made $276,000 last year) made much more than Ivy graduates living in cramped Manhattan apartments for the right to \u201cslave\u201d away on Excel sheets at Goldman Sachs and pay NYC ~13% top state taxes on top of Uncle Sam\u2019s 37% top federal tax rates with a maximum $10,000 SALT deduction. In short, every extra $1 you make, you pay ~$0.5 in taxes if you work for GS in NYC at the highest income tax bracket, if you work for someone else. The janitor\u2019s general manager made ~$500,000 on public salary record: 'Grace Crunican' - Transparent Public Salary Search. If you are a top 5% plumber with your own growing business and employees, you can make $1,000,000 a year (at the lower 21% corporate tax rates and effective <17% tax rate I might add!) in some geographical areas. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg recommends to consider forgo paying $60,000 tuition a year at Harvard for plumbing. If you have the talent and drive to get into Goldman Sachs (~3% acceptance rate among already \u201ctop\u201d Ivy talent, which selects top high school talent at ~5%), there is no reason you can\u2019t do this, if you can already make the top 0.15% of candidates. Even fewer of those candidates who are bald, white men have a shot to become the CEO. It is much better to take fate into your own hands if you have a different vision of \u201cminimizing regret\u201d. How are the most millionaires made in America? Look it up - it\u2019s laundromats.

            "answer_text": "Here is my story\u2026.. I was a mediocre high school student and attended the local county college right after graduation. After a year of junior college I dropped out with poor grades. I took a job in Washington DC as a file clerk at FBI HQ making $135 a week, and soon afterwards I enlisted in the Marine Corps reserve. After returning from Marine Corps boot camp, I realized that my life was headed nowhere fast and I needed a college degree. I returned to the junior college with renewed zeal and focus and soon I was making \u201cA\u201ds in all of my classes. I applied to Trenton State College, now the College of NJ and continued to excel in my studies. I moved away from my Marine Corps reserve unit to go back to school, but I was allowed to transfer into the Navy reserve. When I ran out of money for college, my boss in the Navy offered me a full-time position in an Anti-Submarine Warfare helicopter squadron. I flew training missions as an air crewman by day, and went to night school in the evenings. Seven years later I eventually graduated with a BS degree, magnum cum laude, from the College of NJ. I applied for Officer Candidate School and received a commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy. While in the Navy I drove ships up and down the Atlantic coast, became a Navy Diver and a Master Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician. I sailed around the world and had many adventures along the way. In the latter part of my career, I realized that I needed a graduate degree. My boss in the Navy told me about a program in Government Administration at PENN. I told him I would think about it but I wasn\u2019t too interested in going to Penn State. He said, \u201cYou know, Penn State and U PENN are two different schools?\u201d \u201cThey are? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d I said. Then my boss said, \u201cYou idiot, U PENN is an Ivy League University\u201d. So I said, \u201cWell I guess I\u2019ll try that one then\u201d. I interviewed for the Government Administration Program at the Fels Institute and graduated from PENN with a Master\u2019s in Government Administration. It was a life changing experience and it opened many doors that probably would have been closed to me if I had not attended. What helped me get into PENN was having great mentors that steered me down the right track. When I started out in life I was certainly an unlikely candidate for an Ivy League university, but my Marine Corps mentors instilled discipline in me that didn\u2019t exist before boot camp and my mentors in the Navy must have seen something in me because they continued to encourage me to excel. The best advice I can give to a young person starting out on life\u2019s journey is this: don\u2019t underestimate life experience. If your goal is to attend an Ivy League, don\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t get in the first time. Go out and do things, make yourself stand out, be a leader and inspire others. Continue to study and make a difference in the world. An Ivy League may help give you an advantage getting your foot in the door for your first job, but I work with many Ivy League graduates who are less than successful in the work force because they lack life experience. When the time is right and you have good grades, you may have an opportunity to attend a great school like PENN. Be persistent and good things will come your way ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. There is a fairly well-known 1999 study (by Stacy Dale and Alan Krueger) [1] that basically shows that students who apply to Ivies but ultimately don't attend Ivies just do as well as students who ultimately attend Ivy League schools, income-wise. Most students who apply to Ivies usually have certain characteristics (along with academic qualifications) that tend to be quite beneficial to them no matter where they end up.  Below is a summary of the study: (another summary at How much does where you go to college affect earnings? ) Who Needs Harvard?  But maybe the kids who got into Yale were simply more talented or hardworking than those who got into Tulane. To adjust for this, Krueger and Dale studied what happened to students who were accepted at an Ivy or a similar institution, but chose instead to attend a less sexy, \"moderately selective\" school. It turned out that such students had, on average, the same income twenty years later as graduates of the elite colleges. Krueger and Dale found that for students bright enough to win admission to a top school, later income \"varied little, no matter which type of college they attended.\" In other words, the student, not the school, was responsible for the success. Keep in mind, though, that this original study tracked students who graduated in 1976, and tracked their incomes by 1995. So it may not necessarily be as applicable today (as top colleges have become even more competitive today, and the applicant pool is most likely stronger). There is one newer study (http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/51889/1/664668143.pdf ) that tracks students who were freshman in 1989 and which tracks their incomes through the mid-2000s, and which comes to fundamentally similar conclusions.  As you can see from the link below, however, some students benefit more from attending top colleges than other students. Revisiting the Value of Elite Colleges  It\u2019s important to note, though, that a few major groups did not fit the pattern: black students, Latino students, low-income students and students whose parents did not graduate from college. \u201cFor them, attending a more selective school increased earnings significantly,\u201d Mr. Krueger has written. Why? Perhaps they benefit from professional connections they would not otherwise have. Perhaps they acquire habits or skills that middle-class and affluent students have already acquired in high school or at home. There should be a number of other important points to make (regarding whether or not going to an Ivy is worth it). (1) Harvard, Yale, and Princeton generally offer generous financial aid to most students. So going to those places generally shouldn't break a student financially. This could be different for other Ivy League schools, which don't necessarily have that level of financial aid.(2) A lot of it depends on what you ultimately want to do. Going to an Ivy League school definitely helps if you want to, say, become an investment banker. There are a number of other types of careers that hire very heavily from Ivy League schools, and where having an Ivy League degree can literally mean the difference between whether or not your resume gets read or not. Also, the Ivy League connections matter more for some fields than for others (and can be quite big if you go to, say, UPenn's Wharton). That said, 1st-year college students often change their idea of what they want to do in college (as horrible as it sometimes sounds).(3) Location. Much of it could also depend on resources available at the school that you can't necessarily get in your home state. Many Ivy League schools are in the Northeast, and if you're interested in fields like journalism or finance, it's much easier to get opportunities in the Northeast than it is to get in one's home state (of course, this also applies for universities like NYU and Boston University). And also since (somehow) the Northeast urban corridor doesn't have any particularly strong public universities at the level of Berkeley/Michigan/Washington.(4) Risk. If you're not the most conscientious person (and aren't prone to getting the highest grades - or if you want to spend significant time on extracurriculars), it may actually be safer to go to an Ivy League school than a state school. There is more grade inflation at Ivy League schools (see National Trends in Grade Inflation, American Colleges and Universities ) even when you control for student quality. Furthermore, people will at least be somewhat more likely to look at your resume/application if you came from an Ivy. Some schools (like the University of Washington) also don't seem to treat all their undergrads equally, in that admissions to some of their departments (like Computer Science) is competitive even once you're in. You don't see these types of hurdles at most Ivies (UPenn being a possible exception). (5) If you simply need more time to graduate, it may be easier to stay longer than 4 years to graduate at a state school than at an Ivy. Also, if for some reason you can't find a job/position post-graduation and have to live with your parents, it may be much easier to do this by attending the local state university (though this depends on the strength and opportunities of the local state university). This could be especially relevant if you have student debt left. If you couldn't secure a position post-graduation, the debt could be especially harsh on you (though most Ivy students eventually find some form of employment). (6) I think it would be especially informative if these studies tracked broke down post-graduation earnings by specific field. All of these studies are fairly old, and the job market could have changed since then (for example - computer science has definitely exploded in popularity since then). I'd be especially curious to see if Humanities students at Ivy League universities enjoyed an advantage in finding positions compared with Humanities students at state universities. Most Ivy League schools (other than Columbia and Cornell) also tend to be comparatively weak at engineering, which is one of the higher-paying fields. It's possible that in terms of average salaries, better engineering opportunities at some state universities could partially compensate for weaker opportunities in finance, journalism, and other fields.(7) It may be easier to make friends at Ivy League schools (especially for students who are smart enough to get into Ivy League schools to begin with). As Sean Carroll says in an article quoted below, the best part about Ivies is your fellow students. The students who you will be friends with are more likely to be the world-changers of the future (though many Ivy students I know don't seem to have those connections). And perhaps most importantly, they're more likely to be the people who will push/nudge you to be at your very best (both inside and outside the classroom). It takes a certain type of pressure to do that, and it's hard to find that at state schools.  Many state universities are commuter schools, and it's generally much harder to closely bond with other students when you're not living with them all the time (though this probably doesn't apply as much for isolated schools like UIUC and Penn State). Furthermore, many in state universities remain in the same friend groups as the ones they had back with their high school friends (though not all of them), and it's often harder to make friends in the larger 1st-2nd year introductory courses offered in state universities. By the time class sizes get smaller in people's 3rd-4th years, most students are already somewhat more established and harder to become friends with.  Many Ivy League students seem to bond particularly well with their peers and with their alma mater. But this does not happen with all Ivy League students - I know several who pretty much felt lonely and isolated in their own school. One advantage of state schools is that they have so many students compared with Ivies, which also means that there's often a wider diversity of student organizations and clubs at them.(8) As I've hinted several times before, much of it really depends on the opportunities that exist within your state (and your local university). If you lived in California, for example, then there's a much weaker argument for going into debt just to go to an Ivy because there are so many amazing opportunities at the UC schools. But if you live in a state that doesn't have especially strong public universities (which tends to be true for New England, for some reason), then you may benefit a lot from going to an Ivy, even if it meant taking out student loans. If you want to go to grad school, then it the relative strengths of state university vs Ivy also must be taken into account. If you come from California, for example, you can get amazing research opportunities within the University of California system - opportunities that may even beat those that you get at most Ivy schools. On the other hand, you may be interested in a specific field that your local university may be weak at. When it comes to graduate admissions in some programs, letters of recommendation and research are often the most important factor. In that case, the strength of a program (or the professor you work under) can be an extremely important factor, especially if things don't go perfectly for you and you're unable to get stellar grades in undergrad. Unsolicited Advice, Part Three: Choosing an Undergraduate School gives some amazing advice on choosing an undergrad school (from an astrophysicist's point of view). As Sean Carroll says, the best part of an elite private university is the other students.  The best thing about an EPU is the other students. So much so, that at a place like Harvard it\u2019s generally acknowledged that a large fraction of your education comes from extracurricular activities. You\u2019ll meet people, in your field and out, who will be running the world a few years down the line. The professors will be great researchers who may or may not be interested in teaching; there will likely be some opportunities for research and individual contact, but not all that much.  The college years are a very formative period of one's life, and they can really change someone. I believe that one of the most important things that students can  do is to try to do things that can expand their imagination of what's  possible. Some of the experiences that people have from fantastic college experiences are impossible to quantify in terms of dollars or debt - they're worth it despite all the debt. Some students are better at getting these experiences than others - they're not guaranteed at either an Ivy or a state school. But for many students, they might be somewhat more likely at an Ivy.

            "answer_text": "Plenty of great answers here already so I\u2019ll take a narrower focus: when does it really matter if you go to an Ivy (or Ivy plus) school? I can think of two circumstances where it gives a big boost. First, if your parents are in the lowest earning quartile or quintile (depending on the study) you are most likely to get from there to the highest quartile or quintile if you attend an Ivy (or Ivy plus, or highly selective) school. State universities still move the most students from the lowest to the highest earning bracket, because they admit the most students from the lowest earning bracket. To my knowledge no one has done the study to see whether a student who chooses state over Ivy (admitted to both) is equally likely to move brackets than one who chooses Ivy. That statistic is known for students overall, but there is reason to believe that attending an Ivy will give students the network and connections that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to access (unlike students in other quartiles who can access these networks through their parents regardless of where they attend school). Second, if you are going into a humanities major and plan to support yourself in a career in academia (as opposed to getting a job in finance with your history or English degree, which plenty of people do) then the Ivy or highly selective diploma (or diploma from a program well known in your discipline) can really matter in several ways. First, you will be networked with other successful professionals in your field; this matters for having strong research opportunities as an undergraduate which you need for recommendations to top graduate programs and ultimately for getting a faculty (or museum or institute or nonprofit) position. Second, you will have access to more funded fellowship opportunities after graduation, and you will be at the top of the list (assuming you do well in school) for graduate programs. The graduate programs at the top of the list might be the only ones with money to cover your tuition and fees and provide a teaching or research fellowship to live on. And you will then be first in line for the faculty (or museum or institute or nonprofit) jobs which may be few in number. For many people in many majors going to a top 10 vs a top 20 vs a top 50 school won\u2019t really matter. The best schools for your major might stretch pretty deep into that list or beyond it (anthropology and hotel/hospitality majors are good examples). In some cases any somewhat selective school will do a good job if the student is motivated and demonstrates talent (biology comes to mind - liberal arts colleges and major state research universities both turn out strong pre-med and pre-PhD candidates). And in some majors the school name might carry significantly more weight in a major sector than its rank suggests - think of Purdue in engineering (65th in USNews & World Report overall but in the top ten in many engineering fields and sending plenty of students to Amazon and Microsoft each year: Purdue CCO - Data Dashboard).

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There have been many who have written here and in the media about this topic  and the answers they propose are, at times, conflicting or incomplete. I am going to quote from just three of the big names who have addressed this issue and then make some comments of my own.  Writing in The Atlantic, Derek Thompson supports what many have already said in response to this question:  It matters where you go to college, plain and simple. Graduates of the most-select colleges often earn more than graduates of less-select public universities, who are employed at higher rates than those of community colleges, who get more calls from potential employers than graduates of online universities. A world where \"44.8% of billionaires, 55.9% of [Forbes's most] powerful women, and 85.2% of [Forbes's most] powerful men\" attended elite schools is not a place where college doesn't matter.One of the most reproduced statistics from Frank Bruni's new book on this subject, Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be, is that just 30 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs went to elite colleges like the Ivies. (I have not read his book, and am not commenting on its quality outside of this statistic.) This factoid is being widely interpreted to prove that elite schools are overrated predictors of business success. But that's the wrong way to think about it. If a tiny share of college attendees account for a third of business leaders, that means graduates of elite schools are at least 10 times more likely than their peers to be Fortune 500 CEOs.The Inspirational 'It Doesn't Matter Where You Go to College' Meme Is Wrong I agree with Thompson. At least I do in part. The data about CEO\u2019s does show that business leaders are from elite schools in far greater percentages than the population of students at these schools would predict if the kind of school did not matter. He is also correct to point out the there are not just two kinds of school, elite and non-elite. There are thousands of schools and they extend across a wide range in terms of how much they prepare students for success and also what kinds of students enroll in these schools. If I ended my answer here it would fall under the rubric of common wisdom\u2014of course it matters which school you attend. On the other hand, Thompson cites a statistic from Frank Bruni\u2019s book. Thompson says he has not read the book, which given what Bruni says throughout he should have, since the thesis is that it does not matter nearly as much as most think where one goes to college. The quotes from Bruni\u2019s cite what looks to be some solid research that suggests it is not the name of the school that matters; instead, it is the background, preparation and grit of the individual student: And similar dynamics could well be at work in any discrepancy between the achievement levels of elite-college alumni and the achievement levels of graduates of less selective schools. A 2011 study done by Alan Krueger, a Princeton economics professor who served for two years as the chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, and Stacy Dale, an analyst with Mathematica Policy Research, tried to adjust for that sort of thing. Krueger and Dale examined sets of students who had started college in 1976 and in 1989; that way, they could get a sense of incomes both earlier and later careers. And they determined that the graduates of more selective colleges could expect earnings 7 percent greater than graduates of less selective colleges, even if the graduates in that latter group had SAT scores and high school GPAs identical to those of their peers at more exclusive institutions.  But then Krueger and Dale made their adjustment. They looked specifically at graduates of less selective colleges who had applied to more exclusive ones even though they hadn\u2019t gone there. And they discovered that the difference in earnings pretty much disappeared. Someone with a given SAT score who had gone to Penn State but had also applied to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school with a much lower acceptance rate, generally made the same amount of money later on as someone with an equivalent SAT score who was an alumnus of UPenn. It was a fascinating conclusion, suggesting that at a certain level of intelligence and competence, what drives earnings isn\u2019t the luster of the diploma but the type of person in possession of it. If he or she came from a background and a mindset that made an elite institution seem desirable and within reach, then he or she was more likely to have the tools and temperament for a high income down the road, whether an elite institution ultimately came into play or not. This was powerfully reflected in a related determination that Krueger and Dale made in their 2011 study: \u201cThe average SAT score of schools that rejected a student is more than twice as strong a predictor of the student\u2019s subsequent earnings as the average SAT score of the school the student attended.\u201d When I interviewed Krueger, he explained: \u201cThe students are basically self-sorting when they apply to colleges, and the more ambitious students are applying to the most elite schools.\u201d The inclination to consider UPenn, not attendance at UPenn, is the key to future earnings. Or maybe it\u2019s the inclination coupled with assertiveness and confidence, two other attributes suggested by the fact of applying to a college or colleges where admissions are fiercely competitive. \u201cAnother way to read my results is: A good student can get a good education just about anywhere, and a student who\u2019s not that serious about learning isn\u2019t going to get much benefit,\u201d Krueger told me. Bruni, Frank (2015-03-17). Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania (pp. 139-140). Grand Central Publishing. Kindle Edition.  Bruni\u2019s book has received lots of attention and it should. I find some of the things he says right on target. I also think that it will mislead a lot of people who do not read it closely. The data he cites, however, underscore what I find best about his book. If a student is highly motivated and applies to top schools it does not matter if he or she gets in. The character traits and the academic background of students who apply to the most elite schools predict future success. To me this makes perfect sense. A smart student who is motived and ambitious will take advantage of what his or her  school offers. They will knock on doors and find research or internships or independent studies. At hundreds of schools there are these opportunities. But not many students in the aggregate of the college going population have the desire to do everything they can to get the most out of their education. The stats about this are pretty clear too. In the book Academically Adrift, the authors underscore that over a third of students who graduate from college have not increased their critical thinking skills at all. It is possible, all too possible,  to get through 4 years without learning much. At the far end of the spectrum, however, the one Bruni talks about in his book, there are students who go to less than great schools and then go on to successful lives in virtually every field imaginable. But these are the ones who are motivated to do so. They are the ones who work hard and take the initiative to get the most out of their education. But I want to comment again on what is the key to success for student regardless of the name of the school. The students who have done well in secondary school, who have high grades and strong programs and strong testing and are also wired to seek out opportunities are the ones Bruni cites in his book as examples of those who do well in life. Many in education do not like it when testing becomes a prediction of future success. But testing at the far ends of the spectrum do predict well. Those who apply to Ivies are usually in the 2100 range and have a slate of APs/IBs to their credit and almost all A\u2019s. Few students without these things apply as they would never be encouraged by counselors to do so, given the exceptionally low acceptance rates. Some students still do so, but not many who are not near the top of the class. To sum up-- the most important part about this issue --smart students tend to do well in college. Those who have poor scores often struggle to graduate.  The last writer I will quote is Jeffrey Selingo. His book, College (Un)Bound, is one of the best overviews of what is happening today at US colleges and universities. The data he cites is well researched and he has a lot to say about what needs to change in education that I think is useful. I rated it as one of the my best books when it came out in 2013 Parke Muth, consultant: Education and Religion: What Do They Have in Common? Best Books 2013, Part 2 Just recently, in a piece he has written for the Washington Post, Selingo  essentially brings together the points each of the above authors makes:  Bruni worries about the unintended consequences of putting so much pressure on teenagers to get admitted to a selective school. Last year, Bruni taught a course at Princeton and saw firsthand how many students view life as a series of challenges, a set of hoops to jump through, and getting into Princeton was one of them.\u201cA significant number of students had put so much energy into getting in, and then getting ready for the next competition, the job,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they didn\u2019t save their best energy and best selves for tilling the four-year experience for what it\u2019s worth.\u201dA college alone doesn\u2019t make a successful graduate. Sure, top colleges provide a peer network that greatly helps both while students are on campus and afterwards as alumni. But someone with grit and ambition can succeed at many different types of schools. http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/03/16/forget-harvard-and-stanford-it-really-doesnt-matter-where-you-go-to-college/ Selingo admits that it does matter where you go to school, but also says that it doesn\u2019t too. I don\u2019t see this as a contradiction but rather as a way of bringing in two different types of thinking and combining them. Some schools like the Ivies will have on campus recruiting that many schools do not have. The alumni network will have more people placed in certain sought after businesses, government positions,  non-profits and start-ups etc. At the same time, those students who have the background and personality to achieve well at a school that is not necessarily categorized as elite still have the chance to rise to the top too. Both of conclusions are backed by data. I said that I would quote three writers, but I will now mention a fourth since I have referred to him and the research he cites many times before. Malcolm Gladwell in his Book David and Goliath, has a chapter on education in which he tries to encourage students to attend schools at which they are relatively certain they will do well. He cites the example of a student who chose an Ivy over another fine school. Once there, as a premed, she had problems standing out in classes. Her confidence was shattered and she had to change her life plans. He talks about how research shows it is better to be a big fish in a smaller pond (by which he means the students are not all superstars rather than the referring to the size of the school). For students, the choice of a school, as I have said again and again to families and students, should be about fit, not about name. A student wants to go to a place full of confidence and a desire to squeeze everything out of the time spent on campus. Students who do this will, for the most part, experience tremendous growth, a great deal of success, and, perhaps, a lot less stress. ",

            "answer_text": "All things considered, I believe so, yes. The first few years of my career I was set back a little bit because I didn't come out of an Ivy League school. My family and I had moved to California from Korea when I was 16. While attending high school I maintained a pretty decent GPA and my score on the SAT was decent enough that I'd likely get at least a second look by any number of top-tier schools. I, however, wasn't crazy about the idea of continuing the student life. A formal education seemed like a bore, and I was in a rebellious streak against my parents. The long of the short of it goes something like this: My dad, without my knowledge, began applying, as me, to schools throughout the University of California system. I became subsequently enrolled at a middle-of-the-road university, a top 100 school, as a matter of fact. More on this in my book Coming out of UC-Riverside I had a very respectable GPA, what I believe to be strong interview skills and an internship at Merrill Lynch. Despite this, there were very few investment banking firms that would even take a look at me for the first four years, or so. Those firms saw a top 100 university resume before they saw anything else. Undaunted, I began to develop creative ways to throw my hat in the ring and make enough noise to be heard but I assure you, those first four years were tough. I later wrote about these experiences in my book The Outlier Approach: How to Triumph in Your Career as a Nonconformist. Would I trade these experiences for anything in the world, including an Ivy League degree? Of course, not. Would I advise a brilliant mind to forego the Ivy League as an act of rebellion and/or solidarity? No. Top firms on Wall Street are as brand-oriented as you or I. My resume didn't come embroidered with the Nike Swoosh or the Amazon Smile. An Ivy League degree is precisely that and it suffices to say it gives you a MAJOR leg up on the competition. And I don't need to tell you there's plenty of that, grasshopper. Years later, I attended the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and that's where this crystalized for me. Simply put, it's easier to get the benefit of the doubt with that top-flight brand on your resume. To them, it's more likely than not that the book cover is as good as the pages within, so to speak. Think about what the cover of your book is going to look like. Would you read it? It's one of the hundreds on the shelf. That said, if you're not highly motivated, none of this is pertinent information. Or if you've decided, later in life, to be highly motivated there are ways to still break into the industry of your choice. You'll just have to develop and/or borrow creative ways of doing so. Follow my blog, follow me on Twitter to learn some of the secrets of succeeding on your own terms. Ivy League doesn't hold a monopoly on happy outcomes. Best of luck to you! ",

Then go to an Ivy League school. If you care less about where you go as long as it gets your foot in the door and it makes it possible for you to get insanely rich with a 100-foot yacht and an attractive spouse then try and spare yourself a couple tens of thousands of future student loans you will possibly be 45\u201355 and sending your own kids off to college before you fully repay. I would respectfully say no. With all due respect to the other poster, I am more impressed with someone that finishes Summa Cum Laude from Maryland than a solid 3.0 at an \u2018ivy league\u2019 school. Unless you are talking about a Law degree, Medical degree, or an MBA then I am certain there is at least one or more non-Ivy league schools that are highly respected (MIT, Cal Tech, etc.). Also, whatever you want to do in life academically, it will be defined more by your post-grad education and jobs you do thna where you get your first degree. The name of the school on your diploma does not matter as much as what YOU DID with your time at the university. If I have two kids in my waiting room, one is a Harvard grad with a solid 3.2 gpa and the other attended Boston College with a 3.8 and finished in top 10% of his class while on a work study all 4-years and for 3 of those years helped lead and create a student activity group around his major, who do you think I would hire? More than a solid gpa things that you will or won\u2019t do such as participate in research, lead or build student activity groups, internships, etc. will define you much more heavily.Universities do not hire faculty and pay them large sums of money because they are good teachers. First of all, when you go to an Ivy League school, chances are that every \u2018elective\u2019/non-major course/gen-ed credit course you take will be taught by a graduate student/TA. People with 30+ publications to their name don\u2019t waste time teaching Horticulture 102 or Freshman Lit. You won\u2019t even see a tenured faculty member most likely until at least your junior year. The supposed \u2018big shots\u2019 curing cancer and Alzheimers and appearing on CNN 3 times a week about their latest political insights novel barely teach courses and if they do, its more often for graduate students. Secondly, universities pay money to have their names spread across academia as the sponsor of these researchers. That is why they\u2019re called Professors. They profess. If you want \u2018teachers\u2019, go to a community college where its not research but student evaluations that determine success or failure.You can go to any university, ivy or not, and become a number. To believe that someone will say \u201cthis an Ivy League school\u201d and suddenly try harder and do more for themselves is bull-squat. Meanwhile, even smaller schools have a ton of offerings for students who want to stick out. If the school has clubs or student organizations that interest you, join them. If it doesn\u2019t have a club you like, be even more impressive and create it and help lead it. Get to know faculty members and learn their academic histories. When I was an undergrad, the university would even pay for you to take your advisor to lunch. Find out what research they are doing and see if you can \u2018get in\u2019 on it. It says a lot more about you to take initiative and do things than to follow by the schedule alone.What motivates you seems to a big question. If the idea of running a race and being out in front and knowing everyone is behind you makes you run harder, then don\u2019t go to an Ivy League school. If there are a few in front of your and you ar eare largely running in a pack and you run harder to stay up with them, I would suggest the Ivy League school. In the first case your are a leader, you want to win, and you have no fear of running off the path because everyone is chasing you. In the second case, you are defined at how hard to work based on your competition and that is what pushes you, then by all means go Ivy League.Over all, if it were my child, I would tell them to go local for the first 2-years and just crush it. No matter what school you attend, the first 1-2 years will be mostly gen-ed credits and for the most part courses in your major that can be found anywhere. You may as well stay at home and earn a 3.95 from a local university and then get in to an Ivy League for the last 2 years. It will drastically cut your expenses, you will be taught by better instructors(and not grad students) for 2 years, and for those 2 years that you are in the ivy league school, you will be taught by faculty members with all the best equipment/supports.",

            "answer_text": "No, it doesn't really matter. As you correctly note, a lot of very smart and successful people--in fact, most smart and successful people--did not go to Ivy League schools. Studies have indicated that those who had what it took to be admitted to an Ivy League school, but were either rejected or chose to attend a less prestigious institution, did pretty much the same as those who did attend an Ivy League school. E.g., Page on cbsnews.com. In other words, high achievers do well because they're high achievers, not because of the name on their degrees. And certainly, once you get out into the real world, who issued your degree matters less and less; a Harvard degree isn't going to magically catapult you into the CEO's chair if you don't put in the work or deliver results. Life is a marathon, not a sprint; the fact that you were really good at high school doesn't mean that you will be really good at adulthood. That being said, people wouldn't want Ivy League degrees if they didn't confer some advantages. Elite graduate programs, for example, are very diverse in the schools they draw from, but they still take an awful lot of Ivy Leaguers. In my own personal experience, I was accepted into several top law programs after graduating in the top 10% of my class at an Ivy League school. There were plenty of state/lower-ranked private school grads in my law school class, but most of them were likely top 2-3%, if not higher. A lot of highly competitive jobs--law, medicine, finance--have a strong preference for Ivy League (plus a handful of other elite schools like Stanford and MIT) grads. This is because while Ivy Leaguers are no smarter than non-Ivy Leaguers, some people have the perception that they are. If you have to trust someone with the things that are most important to you--your life, your money, your future--all things being equal, you'd probably prefer someone who had succeeded at the \"best\" schools, and that's what employers are betting on. And lastly, alumni connections and second chances shouldn't be downplayed. We can bemoan this fact all day, but the reality is that a lot of jobs come not just from what you know, but who you know; the Ivy League to a school has spectacular alumni networks, and generally take care of their own. Bottom line, an Ivy League degree does not confer intelligence on someone or guarantee their success. Conversely, lacking an Ivy League degree does not make one dumb or doom one to mediocrity. But Ivy League admissions are competitive for a reason, namely that such degrees are very valuable. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. A lot. Not because of bragging rights but because of some very solid reasons. But before I enumerate those reasons, please let me be clear on a couple of things - This applies to all top institutions and universities. Yes, there is a \u2018halo effect\u2019 around the Ivy League universities because with the exception of Cornell U. the other seven were the oldest ones (pre-dating the founding of the U.S. Republic.). But other top notch institutions are every bit as good or even better. Nobody in their right mind is going to argue for example that Brown U. is superior to Stanford U. or M.I.T., never mind that Brown is an Ivy League university.A lot of people will argue about how other factors like hard work, initiative and such matter. Yes they do, but it is completely missing the point. For the accurate analysis of the effect of any variable, you must hold all of the others constant (unless there are other variables which are inherently correlated to the one being examined, either directly or inversely).The question then is not \u201cWill a lazy person who studied at Harvard U. do better than a diligent one who went to Penn State U.?\u201d No. It is \u201cWill there be a difference in consequences if that same person went to Harvard versus PSU?\u201dTo state that a given variable is influential to an outcome is neither to deny the importance of other ones nor to assert that said variable is the ONLY one which matters.With those out of the way now, permit me to list the very tangible advantages which go with studying and graduating from Ivy League universities as well as other top universities. These come systematically at three stages in chronological order - while at university, while graduating from it, afterwards in your career. While at university - The sheer amount of intellectual resources, both in terms of quantity and caliber of talent. Speaking from personal experience, I attended an Ivy League university (UPenn) as a student studying research in molecular biophysics. My department had over forty professors who were some of the top scientists on the planet. That now meant that I had a much bigger pool of options in terms of which research group to join but also as in the of quality of interaction and being forced to bring your A-game. This matters a lot when you are a serious scholar, both the number and the caliber of teachers and colleagues who you are surrounded by.Does that mean that a kid studying mathematics at say Oregon State U. cannot do well? No, it means that that same kid with that same level of drive and talent would be better off in the Department of Mathematics at Princeton U.At the point of graduating - Employers. This is a big one.A lot of top companies are very selective in which schools they recruit. This isn\u2019t because they think that there is no talent in other lower ranked schools. No, from their viewpoint it is simply a matter of efficiency. That they would have to put in much more effort to ferret out top talent at a lower ranked school. It is also a powerful signal because employers recognize how hard it is to get into these schools, that you have to have had a certain level of intellect and to have worked with a great amount of diligence to have gotten into Harvard or Stanford.What\u2019s more, the higher ranked the school, the more powerful the alumni network. Believe me, you graduate from a top university, and will find that its alumni fill several of the top ranks at big corporations. Once again, this is an advantage which cannot be overstated. Because the alumni are invariably very loyal to their institutions and you have much easier access to them. Now this also holds for fields like scientific research in academia. If you have a Ph.D in physics from M.I.T., you have a bigger chance of joining a big name research lab. Heck it even holds for entrepreneurs because a more powerful network of contacts means better access both to capital resources as well as knowledge of what talent to hire down the line.In your career further down the line - Alumni and former classmates.You get access to an exclusive club of contacts. A club both in literal and metaphorical terms. There is a UPenn Club in New York City. There is another just a block away from where I live now in Philadelphia. These aren\u2019t just places where you go to have a glass of wine or smoke a cigar. They are ones where you meet people who can hook you up with all kinds of resources. Again, there are several with considerable initiative who can build such a circle through incessant networking, it\u2019s just that this is now offered to you on a platter. Classmates who you studied with often come from rich and powerful families. Several top dogs at your workplace bond with you because you went to the same institution. My boss, a senior director of finance, graduated from UPenn. Another director of finance who I interact with graduated from the business school I went to. And the woman who runs the whole fast-track executive program at our firm also graduated from UPenn. You think that does not play to one\u2019s advantage in terms of ground reality? I actually do not think it good for powerful executives to favor those from the schools which they attended. It is a form of nepotism in my view, but it is the plain truth nevertheless.In summary, the reputation and ranking of your university matters for reasons that go far beyond just stupid and superficial bragging rights. They have serious consequences in everything from the quality of the scholars who you interact with, your chances of employment and access to a powerful network right through life. I know and have experienced that as has my sister who also happens to be an Ivy League grad (Cornell U.) and several of my friends. No, it is not the only thing which matters. Woe be to such a society where too much emphasis is placed on what institution you attended to the point of an obsession. But the caliber and ranking of the institution which you attend matters. A lot. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, if you want it to matter. Anybody who says an Ivy League school does not provide certain benefits almost certainly falls into one of the following groups: a.) they never went to one b.) they somnambulated through their four (or eight) years at school c.) they have yet to catch their break. Sometimes that \u201cbreak\u201d takes longer to happen. It took a bit of time for me, if I\u2019m being honest. But I look at some of my peers, and I realize that there are opportunities available that have proven elusive to them. But I\u2019m also not here to disparage other schools. Anybody who says that a person cannot succeed without an Ivy League degree either never went to one or has never spent a day in a real working environment. Supremely competent, intelligent, and talented people go to every school, and you can learn from each and every one of them regardless of where you end up at undergrad. For me, the advantage of my education boils down to three things, only one of which could possibly be considered \u201cunique\u201d: I had top flight professors who challenged me and shaped my mind, thus making me more attractive to hiring managers. This is not unique to Ivies. There are fabulous professors everywhere. Elliott Stein at Columbia was a truly gifted math professor. One summer, I audited Alvio Dominguez\u2019 courses at Broward College. He\u2019s spectacular as well. It\u2019s hard to go wrong with either \u2014 make a point to seek out the great educators at your institution.I made connections and \u2014 drastically more importantly \u2014 actual friendships with my classmates. Again, this is not unique to Ivies. You can (and should) make friends everywhere you go. And while it is true that I\u2019ve never realized any \u201cmaterial\u201d benefit from any of these friendships, I\u2019ve certainly been intellectually challenged and felt supported in all of my endeavors. And that, at the end of the day, is the most important thing in any relationship.Certain people confer a sense of \u201cbelonging to the club\u201d right off the bat. This is not so much unique to Ivies as it is to elite schools in general. In much the same way a former Army Ranger is likely to look at someone who has been through the US Army Ranger School with a certain glint in their eye (look the training up\u2026 it\u2019s incredible), a former Columbia alum (or even former aspirational attendee) is likely to feel a certain kinship with a recent Columbia graduate. And this is where the usefulness of \u201cthe club\u201d ends. From that moment on, it is all about your performance.So yes. You can go to an Ivy League school and come out of there with absolutely everything you need to make your trip to the board room take two decades instead of three. Alternatively, you can go there, smoke eight spliffs a day, skip class, and drop out\u2026 in which case you still might make it to the boardroom. College is truly what you make of it. And if you\u2019re fortunate enough to get the slight advantage of going to an Ivy League school, you\u2019d be well-served to make the most of your time. Good luck out there. ",

            "answer_text": "The easy answer is yes, going to an Ivy League school is worth it. Also, you still have a chance. The hard answer is why do you want to? I know you're only in ninth grade, but you are not trying to write like someone who's preparing for college; some things, like \"cuz\" I figure are probably on purpose, but other things like, \"might of\" instead of \"might have\" are usually more a sign of someone who hasn't paid a lot of attention to grammar. And if you want to go to a top school, you definitely need to know how to write. Next, do you really care whether a school is Ivy League, or just whether it's a top school? There are only eight schools in the Ivy League, they're all in the original colonies, and a few of them are in pretty isolated places. There are a lot of great schools that aren't Ivy League, because that's just the name of a football league. So, assuming that you want to go to a top school and that you're willing to work really hard to get there, yes, you can do it. A lot of colleges look at your GPA from 10th and 11th grades; they put less emphasis on ninth grade, because they know that you were just adjusting to high school, and your 12th grade classes aren't graded yet by the time you apply. So here's why I think getting a really great college education is worth it: you're gonna live a really long time, maybe 80 more years;there are a ton of 25 to 30-year-olds here on Quora complaining that they don't know what to do with their life, they're really bored, and they don't know where to go from here;that generally doesn't happen if you have a really good education. You've learned to read, to write, and to think, and with those three skills there's never a reason to be bored again for the whole rest of your life.Just as an added reason, you might have kids someday. They're going to ask you endless questions; kids do that. And you're going to want to have something to say to them when they do that. An angry. \"I don't know; go look it up!\" isn't the way to be a good parent. The more you know about the world, the more you can teach your kids, and the better off they'll be when they're old enough to be on Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a sophomore at Texas Tech, majoring in CS, and I have realized that attending an Ivy League school really does not matter in the long run. It might help you land a really good first job but then again, it depends upon your actions and decision-making processes. The thing that really matters is how you build up your networks and connections. I just recently joined ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) here at Tech to build networks and enhance my programming skills by practicing with others, and soon realized that my college, which I thought would be an average American college that is not ranked close to any top tier colleges, is actually a really good college with lots of helpful resources. I was just not looking for the right people and the right resources in my Freshman year, and had no guidance. We have alumni\u2019s who work full-time at Google, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, etc and they often organize workshops here in our campus. Social life, here at Tech, is also a really good one because the people here are so friendly and helpful. Guidance is what we need to organize, plan, and shape our future career. Cost of education is also another factor to consider. Being an international student here at Tech, I realized that I am paying one-third of what average international students pay for colleges. I thought that I would have to pay out-of-state tuition, however, getting a scholarship of over $2000 here in Texas makes anyone eligible for an in-state tuition. Perhaps the best thing about my University is the amount of funding we receive. Over the last 4 years, we received fundings of over 1.8 billion US dollars for research and scholarships, and even received grants from foundations like Bill and Melinda Foundation. Consider the following situations: > Getting a Bachelor\u2019s degree from an Ivy League; and > Getting a Bachelor\u2019s degree from a public school similar to Texas Tech with lots of alumni connections, scholarships, and research opportunities; Both of them might result in similar outcomes and might land you a really good first job, however, the person graduating from the latter situation, would be better off financially due to scholarships. This not only results in a happy family with less financial burden, but also a family who can spend more on improving their living conditions as well, rather than selling their house or apartment, just to afford their children\u2019s college.

            "answer_text": "If you download admission statistics from National Center for Education Statistics for the 8 ivy league schools, you'll find that only about 10% of US students in the 98th percentile on their SAT scores attend an ivy league school, and 15% attend one of the top 17 US schools (ranked by SAT score). Yet if you look at faculty at research institutions, you'll find that about 90% of them attended a either top-ten US school in their field, or a top-two school in some other country. You'll get similar results if you look at NIH grant winners. You'll get nearly 100% if you count recently-awarded Nobel prizes in physics (though a much weaker effect for prizes awarded before 1980). I think you might find nearly 100% if you counted institutional affiliations in scientific publications that are reported by major press outlets. So 90% of research positions (and almost all media coverage and Nobel prizes) goes to the 15% of top students who attended top schools, and 10% goes to the other 85% of equally-intelligent students. This means that attending a top-ten school gives you an odds-ratio multiplier of about 72 to your chance of success in an academic field. For the most-lucrative careers, law, investment banking, and management consulting, the odds multiplier is higher, since the firms that pay high salaries recruit only from ivy league schools. For comparison, \"The returns to cognitive abilities and personality traits in Germany\" found that a one standard deviation increase in IQ gave an average 2% increase in income (4% for males, 0% for females). According to The Personal Distribution of Income in an International Perspective (Richard Hauser), the coefficient of variation for income (standard deviation divided by median) in Germany was 0.37. Thus a one standard deviation increase in IQ increases income by 2%, which is .05 standard deviations. On a z-table, z<0.05 for 52% of the population, so this one-standard-deviation increase in IQ corresponds to an odds ratio multiplier for success (measured by ranking of income, not by income) of .52 / .50 =  1.04. 72 =~ 1.04^109, meaning that the impact of attending an ivy league on career success is about one hundred times as great as the impact of a one-standard-deviation increase in intelligence, and fifty times as great as the impact of the two-standard-deviations above average IQ generally required to get into a top-ten school. (\"Fifty times\" here means you would need 50 independent advantages, each as powerful as that 2-stdev IQ difference, to have the same effect as attending a top-ten school.) This comparison makes some false assumptions about linearity, notably that a 2-standard-deviation IQ increase has twice the impact of 2 1-standard-deviation increases. Studies I've seen suggest that the effect is less than linear, meaning this may overestimate the impact of a 2-std-deviation IQ increase, and hence underestimate the relative importance of an ivy league degree. It measures career success of ivy league graduates using desirability of their jobs, and compares that to the success effect of intelligence measured by income rank. I think this is a reasonable assumption, since the more-desirable jobs pay higher, so income rank gives the same result regardless of differences in income distribution in academia vs. private sector. The most dubious assumption is comparing career success for scientists (when measuring effect of an ivy league degree), to career success of the population at large (when measuring effect of IQ). I've since heard from Garret Jones at George Mason that, in other studies, a two standard deviation rise in income predicts a 30% rise in wage, or .81 standard deviations. z < .81 for 79% of the population; 79 / 50 = 1.58, 72 ~ 1.58^9.35, in which case the impact of attending a top-ten school would be only about 9 times as great as the impact of the intelligence needed to do so.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it really does.  I think we can all agree that attending an elite/prestigious school is generally an indicator of one's own ambition and talent, not the other way around - the act of attending an Ivy League school won't automatically make you smarter and more successful. It would also be na\u00efve to say that these four years will invariably shape the rest of your life - plenty of people have gone to non-elite schools and ended up as successful and content as their peers who attended X Elite Name Brand University (TM).  However, it would be even more na\u00efve to deny the difference in significance that attending such a school would have for different people. Chances are that if you attend an elite school, your parents probably have a similar educational background. Your friends probably hail from a similar background, and their parents probably come from a similar background as your parents, and so on. Basically, upon leaving this school you're not much in a different place from where you started. For people like first-generation college students and the children of immigrants, to attend such a university would mean to open multiple doors of opportunity. Historically, education has played a crucial role in social mobility and the situation is no different today. People often envision ascending the socioeconomic ladder as a linear path - hard work and perseverance will surely pay off?! - but the American Dream is not as one-dimensional as seems. Even if the combination of the pedigree of your degree and your toil lands you a desirable, high-paying job, that alone won't secure your future. Remember the Princeton Mom who warned educated, ambitious women to snag their husband in college? She makes sweeping generalizations that are unfair to both men and women, but I personally can't help but feel that there is a grain of legitimacy to her ramblings. These elite universities provide a unique opportunity for people from all walks of life to mingle and form meaningful relationships with each other. They provide not only academic and professional opportunities, but social opportunities as well. Who knows? You might end up marrying someone from a \"higher\" socioeconomic background, thus further cementing your new position on the jungle gym that is the social ladder. Your children might enjoy the things that your parents were never able to give you. You won't face the same pressures and worries that your parents faced when they raised you.  Once, my friend and I laughed over what we would've ended up as if our parents had stayed in their home countries. He said something about being a corn picker; I don't know my fate but it likely wouldn't include plans of studying science. ",

And people in the professional world are not going to be \u201cwowed\u201d because you went to Cornell or Columbia - these people either attended them, knew people who attended them, dropped out of them, etc\u2026 Point being, people in the professional world understand what these institutions are really like, and how these institutions don\u2019t always accept the most promising students, nor do the most promising students always attend them. The brand name of your alma mater doesn\u2019t take you as far as you think it would. However, Harvard and other Ivy League universities, as well as their peers - Williams, Duke, Northwestern, UChicago, MIT/Caltech/Harvey Mudd, Pomona, Stanford - benefit in being highly resource rich. There are tons of more easily accessible resources from being an undergraduate at these institutions compared to larger public universities or places like USC. That being said, you don\u2019t get an education by osmosis (it\u2019s shocking how many people think some semblance of this idea) - you have to work at it. You have to be involved, to prove yourself to your professors, to gun for research / internships, to network within the college\u2019s alumni and abroad etc. Just because your peers at Harvard all have high scores and have accomplished significantly in high school will mean very little in terms of your future success, except that you have to work even harder to distinguish yourself in using the resources that Harvard offers. If you stagnate after acceptance to the illustrious Ivy League, you will find that the Ivy League diploma, or any prestigious institution\u2019s diploma, will not help you in the slightest other than for impressing people at debutante balls.

            "answer_text": "Yes, at least sometimes. In my case, in two ways: I got my Masters and was working on my PhD. at a small state university - a good school, with high student/faculty involvement, and good faculty. However, I was bored and somewhat floundering, because my advisor had recently left, and everyone in my department had joked that he and I were pretty much the only two who understood each other, since we were in a less common sub-specialty. The response was that if he ever left, I\u2019d have to go work with HIS advisor. Well he was from an Ivy, and his advisor was still there. Some months after he left, he called and said he was visiting his advisor, who was interested in meeting me and possibly having me apply and working with him. Dream come true, academically! Not personally, since I was happily married, my spouse was under contract at the small state university, we owned a house, etc. But as I tossed out this idea around my department, one professor said \u201cIt\u2019s an Ivy. You\u2019d be an idiot if you didn\u2019t give it a chance.\u201d I went out there right away, applied, got accepted, and transferred. My spouse moved to join me in a year, we sold our house and got another, and I\u2019ve never regretted it for a moment. There were so many more opportunities academically, not just in that department, but other departments with courses related to my interests. So First: having a variety of perhaps more esoteric and advanced course offerings available, was a clear advantage of the Ivy vs the small state university. Second, more faculty were involved in funded research projects at the Ivy than the small state University. That meant more opportunities to get hands-on with research, to make presentations, to get published, and to get funding. I worked with at least one other professor, but I wasn\u2019t really interested in his research and decided to do my own thing instead. But this wasn\u2019t an option at the original school, where a small minority of the faculty had research projects for grad students to work on. (On the other hand, at the smaller school the faculty didn\u2019t seem to have the pressure that they did at the Ivy, so there was more time for and possibly more interest in the students.) Third, a number of years later, when I was finishing/finished with my doctorate and applying and interviewing for faculty positions, at least 3\u20134 times, the faculty or administrators interviewing me specifically mentioned my \u201cIvy Degree\u201d as a plus. Having a degree from an Ivy did make a difference in terms of job offers, at least for faculty positions. I\u2019ve always been in academia, so outside of academia, I don\u2019t know - but the Ivy degree gave me an edge in my academic job search. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question depends on what you believe matters? How do you define success? If your goal is to get a competitive job at a competitive firm and nothing else then it may very well matter. Some places are innately biased towards specific Universities and Ivy League education. If success to you is more broad and can take many avenues and you would accept working anywhere for the job you want then it does not matter. What I tell people is that reaching our goal is like walking a 100 step stair case. Some people are born with the means to be on step 80 and others at step 1. We move up and down those steps depending on life circumstances but the goal is always obtainable it just takes some more time then others. Sometimes you start so far back with so many obstacles that knock you back a step that you do not have enough time in your lifespan to reach the top. That does not make our goal any less attainable. An Ivy League education is just a booster to get you toward the top but does not determine your ability to get there as long as your goal isn\u2019t too overly specific. Perseverance (NOT persistence, there is a subtle difference if you look it up) and at times persistence is what I believe matter most in life in obtaining your goals. We are always fighting against demotivating factors in our life. If you stay lower on the stair case you might have to have more perseverance and persistence then others. If someone places too much value on things like Ivy League education then they may also be from the camp who either their parents and/or themselves believe failure is not an option. The most successful people recognize that failure is a part of life and progress. The debate for and against failure is not an option is extremely important because our current push in education is to instill an urgency for perfection. That is a toxic mentality because nothing and no one is perfect. If you look at it from a sales perspective (we are all salesmen, even students are trying to sell that they know things to teachers and teachers are trying to sell knowledge) which is more realistic? \u201cFailure is not an option\u201d or as Michael Jordan said \u201cI\u2019ve failed over and over and over in life and that is why I succeed.\u201d Well if you look at what character trait each statement is pushing it becomes evident. From a sales perspective the only way that failure is not an option (meaning all sales pitches are a success) is to be perfectly persuasive. No amount of persistence would close all sales. No one is perfectly persuasive. Bias, skepticism, and beliefs will drive many to never buy certain things. On the other quote what MJ was expressing was perseverance and persistence are the necessary traits for success. We need to stop pushing perfection and push perseverance and persistence. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read many answers about this on Quora, either via my Digest or in my feed, that go on for pages about how \u2018prestige doesn\u2019t matter\u2019 and how students should \u2018focus on schools which fit them best\u2019, and if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m sick to my stomach. The mentality of settling for less and rationalising it as a better decision because of inconsequential and ultimately irrelevant factors is something I saw a lot of, growing up. In elementary school, we had a class ranking system, and man, in my first year, my classmates were competitive. Back then, class ranks were determined by 1, sometimes 2 marks, as it was absurdly easy to score full marks in every test. Striving for perfection, for that one extra mark to gain an edge over everyone else, was what we all aspired to. As the years went by, and the tests became progressively harder, students who maintained better grades were streamed into elite classes with higher course loads, which those who couldn\u2019t stayed in normal classes. In my last year of elementary school, I distinctly remember hearing a student from a normal class remarking that there was no point in getting into an elite class anyway because all it meant was that they had lesser time to play in the afternoons, plus the teachers were a lot harder on you because they expected more, so really what was there to gain? These attitudes worsened as I entered middle school and high school. The excuses changed from having lesser time for video games to having parents with lower expectations so you wouldn\u2019t have to be lectured every time you flunked a test, but at the core they were still excuses. When all was said and done, and it was time to apply for university, these students found themselves in a bind, as their track records of Bs and Cs automatically eliminated them from contention for admissions into any remotely competitive university. So what did they say then? \u2018It\u2019s fine. Going to a local university, even if it means an inferior standard of education, is better because it\u2019s less of a financial burden for my parents, and education is the same wherever you go anyway. Besides, I\u2019d get homesick if I ever left the country.\u201d The most frustrating thing about people like these is that they don\u2019t understand that they hamstring themselves every time they rationalise their lack of drive. I feel like this question is a prime example of that. Saying that an Ivy League education doesn\u2019t matter is in no way representative of reality, and is instead a reflection of the expectations you set for yourself.  There are two broadly different views towards education in my experience. The Western view, which is that education is the procurement of skills you need in life and the single most important thing about education is discovering who you are, and the Asian view, which is that education is one of the only tools for upwards social mobility that poor/middle class citizens can take advantage of on a level playing field. The Western view stems not only from the desire to see individuals have a holistic education, but also to enable children to live fulfilled lives. That\u2019s great, because going forward, as the world\u2019s population becomes increasingly literate and standards of living improve, that\u2019s what we should be aiming for. But right now, for the vast majority of the developing world, the same rules don\u2019t apply, and many of the people who write answers to questions like these don\u2019t realise that.  \u2018B-but you can go to a decent, but not quite elite school, or to your local state university, and still do just as well in life!\u2019 I hear you protest. And\u2026 yeah. You\u2019re right. You\u2019ll do just fine. Work at a medium-sized company if you\u2019re lucky, score an easy 9 to 5 job, fall in love, get married, have kids, and retire at 60 with some money in the bank. Live out a life of relative mediocrity, eventually dying peacefully in your sleep. Except that isn\u2019t how it is for the rest of us.  Nearly 700 million people live on less than $1.90 a day. One in nine people go to bed with no food in their stomach. In many countries around the world, GDP per capita is much lower than the American average of $65,118.40 a year. Some countries have GDP per capitas of less than a thousand dollars a year. Many of these people would give an arm, a leg and then some to attend an Ivy League, and gain access to the opportunities that so many people on Quora seem to take for granted. Those who say getting an Ivy League education doesn\u2019t matter remind of cappuccino communists. It\u2019s easy to say what they say because they don\u2019t live in that reality.  To be able to question whether an Ivy League education matters is absurd. Because it undoubtedly does. It\u2019s not about \u2018which school is the best fit for me\u2019 when the only other option is never lifting yourself out of poverty. It\u2019s about aiming high, working your butt off and achieving your goals, or at the very least getting most of the way there. Your freedom of choice was taken from you the moment you told yourself you were going to get into a top school no matter what. There\u2019s no such thing as consolation prizes when it comes to things like this. Either you win, or you lose. What\u2019s important, though, isn\u2019t winning or losing: it\u2019s what you tell yourself. If you tell yourself that going to an Ivy League doesn\u2019t matter because you know you\u2019ll never make it there \u2014 well, that\u2019s half the battle you\u2019ve already lost. ",

            "answer_text": "Does attending an Ivy League school really matter? That\u2019s a great question. I strongly believe the greatest value that comes from attending a top university has to do more with the signaling effect of that institution. For example, attending a Stanford or Harvard will open up more opportunities that you can possibly imagine. The name brand of the institution is where the value of the degree lies. With that being said, there isn\u2019t anything special about the curriculum or education that you get at these schools. If you\u2019re learning calculus or computer science, you\u2019ll still be taking the same courses such as operating systems, data structures, and what not. In fact, you can find MIT\u2019s entire set of courses at MIT courseware, so what\u2019s the point of attending MIT? It\u2019s the name brand of the degree. It\u2019s almost like saying that you don\u2019t need a Rolex to tell time. But people will still try to go and buy that Rolex. Or a Mercedes to take you from point A to point B. Any car will do, but people will still aspire for that luxury car. Other than the brand name of the school, at an Ivy League you will be surrounded with an intellectually vibrant community of peers and faculty. There is real value in that, as well. You might even get taught be a prestigious professor who pioneered that field. So is an Ivy League degree worth it? I\u2019ll leave that up for you to decide. But I can tell you it certainly is in very high demand, and in economics we coin it as a luxury good. With the advent of online education, you can get a superb mode of learning on the Internet - even better than that of an Ivy League. You can also get access to quite a comprehensive Ivy League curriculum through Coursera. But just like how any watch can tell time, or any car can take you from A to B, people still want the best - because it is a signal of prestige and ability more so than what it actually has to offer. And that is why people aspire to attend the Ivy League. ",

            "answer_text": "With the exception to the financially challenged who don't understand the aid options provided by Ivies (plus MIT, Stanford, CalTech, etc), those holistically and intellectually gifted thus able to attend an Ivy who choose a State school for anything other than top tier athletics seem to be leaving something on the table. It is hard to imagine why someone of a high driven and top performing calibur would choose otherwise. Of course there are those who aspire to run the family business, teach locally, deeply family/friend rooted, or perhaps don't require the lifetime credibility and top peer support provided by an Ivy League education. But typically those who ARE academically and socially accomplished toward the top 1% (Ivy type person) are NOT the same people who will accept status quo at an otherwise good or even excellent state school. These students have accomplished at the highest levels and are driven to the highest levels\u2026which are exactly the students sought by Ivy-type institutions (incl Stanford, MIT, CTech, etc). To use a sports analogy, a world-class athlete will not settle for regional competions. The top football players in the world will not settle for a start-up league\u2026or a local league. So how would academics possibly be different for the top driven academic/social minds? Sure\u2026comments here are that the world is filled with some of the brightest minds at non-Ivy universities \u2014 undisputed. But clearly the percentage of bright minds and the challenge to maximize efforts among peers exists moreso at a top 20 World University than at a top 100. Saying otherwise would mean the admissions groups at these top 20 universities (Ivy+) fail in their selectivity AND that the demand of the world's top students to attend these distinguished universitites is greatly overstated. Quality in typically leads to quality out. And most understand this concept. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is widely thought that going to an ivy league school makes a big difference because one can network with other elite people in a way that will lead to future success. I think just about everyone has believed this (including me). But a recent major study casts serious doubt on this conclusion. This study followed a very interesting group of students. These students applied to and were accepted at Ivy League -level sorts of schools. But for various reasons, usually financial (the cost), they ended up choosing to go to lower-level schools, like Penn State. The study compared the later life success of these students to the later life success of students who actually did go to Ivy League schools. The result, which surprised just about everyone, was that the non-ivy-attending students were as successful in their future lives as the ivy-attending students (!). How can we explain this result, assuming that future work replicates it? The most reasonable and simplest guess is that having the intelligence, talent and diligence that leads to getting into an ivy league school is what is more important, not the networking at the school. People who have this kind of talent will find ways to end up equally successful whether or not they go to ivy league schools and meet other ivy league people. So there is a good chance that the networking benefits of going to ivy league schools have been much overestimated. While there are other possible explanations, this seems like the most straightforward one. So if the result holds up, it appears that the networking effects of going to Ivy League schools, at least at the undergraduate level (the study didn\u2019t look at graduate students) have been oversold, a very striking and possibly important result. There may be of course other benefits to going to such schools, but since the networking benefit is the one everyone cites, it is very striking to see that there is currently no empirical support for it.

            "answer_text": "Of course not, the school itself is just a placeholder for something that is difficult to attain. It\u2019s not like the kids at Harvard, Stanford, or Yale are somehow getting a crazy amount more than kids from a state school. The curriculums are probably more involved, yes, but that\u2019s not because of the school. It\u2019s because the kids who get into those schools are usually standard deviations smarter than whatever the median is. The median SAT score accepted into Harvard is 1520. That means 50 percent of kids getting in have a higher score than that. The 75th percentile is 1580. That\u2019s absolutely insane. To put that into context:  The 50th percentile of acceptance into Harvard translates to the 99th percentile for the SAT. So while the ivy league schools themselves don\u2019t matter, the kids that get admitted are already insanely gifted and smart before they ever step foot onto the campus. There was a kid I met in my third semester at U.C. Berkeley. He was a legitimate genius. In our upper-division combinatorics class, he would correct the professor\u2019s mistakes on the chalkboard every 5 minutes or so. There were only 15 of us in the class, and I actually think he knew the entire course better than the person teaching us. He could conceptualize things and compartmentalize mathematics in a way I didn\u2019t know was possible. It was beauty and elegance. No, Berkeley didn\u2019t teach him those things. But it made sense that he was at an elite campus learning mathematics. I likely wouldn\u2019t find him at a state school. In all my years before Berkeley or after, I have never met a kid like that. Harvard didn\u2019t produce the highest number of U.S. presidents. It\u2019s just that all the potential presidents ended up going to Harvard. The best generally gravitate toward the best. ",

            "answer_text": "What really matters is attendance at a school where the other students are smart, hard working, and motivated. That tends to be the case at Ivy League schools, which is why their reputation is so high. If you do well in such a challenging school, then you are very likely to do well at your job, regardless of what it turns out to be. So what I recommend is that you look at the reputation of any school you are considering. You can probably get a good sense from your counselor, but if in doubt, talk to some businessman who hires people. Many schools are excellent. When I chaired the admissions committee for the physics graduate program at UC Berkeley, I jumped at the opportunity to hire someone from any of the Claremont Colleges (e.g. Harvey Mudd) for example. There are many schools with similar reputations, from Swarthmore, to Reed, to Stanford, to Notre Dame. Note that I do not include my own school, UC Berkeley in this list. At UC Berkeley you can get an education as good as at any Ivy League School, and better than at about half of them. However, it is possible to get a degree from UC Berkeley without getting a first class education, and employers know that. So if you go to UC Berkeley, future employers will give you more scrutiny than if you go elsewhere. You can graduate from anywhere and get a good education and a good job. There is an advantage in graduating from a college with a great reputation. All the Ivy League schools have that\u2014but so do many others. ",

            "answer_text": "It ultimately depends on what you want to do. There are two other lawyers in my family, my sister who attended an Ivy League Law school and the my cousin who attended a very elite law school in the south. But ironically, neither of them actually wanted to have a high power job. My sister wanted to do public interest work and help families in need of legal aid, and my cousin entered law school in hopes of being a prosecutor. In terms of legal careers, these are very ordinary. So they could have achieved what they set out to accomplish without going to an Ivy League school. My sister and cousin ended up taking out loans to attend these schools, but these aren\u2019t exactly high paying jobs. My cousin instead of becoming a prosecutor went into a BigLaw firm so he could pay off his student loans, he plans to leave as soon as he makes his last payment. My sister still hasn\u2019t finished paying off her loans, as she doesn\u2019t make much money working with impoverished clients, but she loves the work she does. I chose not to go to an Ivy League and instead went to a lower ranked school on a full scholarship precisely because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to practice, so I thought it\u2019d be best to avoid taking out the same loans. What Ivy League and elite universities are very great at doing is getting graduates through the doors in very high places. So for Law, it\u2019s very difficult to get a BigLaw firm position if you don\u2019t attend a top 14 (T14) school. Even if you go to a top 50 Law school like I did, you\u2019ll need to be at the top of your class, be on a Journal, Moot Court, etc\u2026 whereas Harvard and Yale grads will be given preference even if they didn\u2019t do that simply because they went to a Harvard and Yale. Currently, all of the Supreme Court Justices attended an Ivy League school. As a consequence, getting a clerkship under a SCOTUS Justice after law school is very prestigious and those spots almost always go to Harvard and Yale graduates. Even an ordinary clerkship for a federal trial judge is coveted and difficult to obtain, if you don\u2019t go to an elite law school. But this doesn\u2019t just apply to Law, but to banking and finance for elite Wall Street firms and big tech companies as well. It\u2019s very difficult to get into a place like Goldman Sachs if you didn\u2019t study at Princeton or Wharton. Companies like Google and Apple have a very disproportionately large number of Stanford and MIT. But if you just want to work at a regular place or institution like as a school teacher or nurse and you don\u2019t care where, then you don\u2019t need to go to an Ivy League. But I\u2019m sure Ivy League credentials would help if you land the job though. ",

            "answer_text": "The Ivy League is merely a northeastern sports league. Several colleges decided to not spend on scholarships to encourage amateur athletics. I do not know the full details. They happened to be some of the oldest private colleges in our nation. But in common practice, we term other schools \u201ccomps.\u201d Such colleges or universities are MIT, Cal Tech, Univ. of Chicago, Stanford, Amherst, Georgetown. Swarthmore, Smith, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley. Other great schools often noted are Rutgers, Univ. of Michigan, Univ. of Wisconsin, and places such as Oberlin. It is not the Ivy League or idiocy. Hardly, every state university has outstanding students. I know some comps are omitted from my list. In practice, any of such grads are invited or admitted to gatherings and are welcome. There are a few exceptions. The Ivies have geographical and even subject limitations. Every region has excellent universities. But I did not know when I applied to college. The Princeton Club, for instance, in Manhattan accepts so many from top colleges that are not Ivies. I would say the main driver from Ivy League alums is that we seek those who are very bright, do extensive reading, and have life passions. A few are snarky and mean to others. But it is a very small portion. Most are eager to expand our contacts as long as we do not have people who just do not care much about education. This country is blessed with great educational institutions. Our elite schools in all regions do amazing jobs of imparting knowledge and building character. Yes, some nerds are snarky. This country would be hard-pressed if only the Ivies were excellent. Oh, Univ. of Texas should also be on my list. Depending on location. There are downsides to the Ivies, too. We tend to think alike. It can close off views and other alternative actions. It is kind of lazy to call excellent colleges Ivies. But this the reality. Every Ivy is superb. But other colleges also rank in the superb category. ",

I\u2019m going to steal from a talk I heard this past weekend about not only why an Ivy League degree doesn\u2019t matter, but why no college degrees matter. A degree is a credential. The college/university you attended is a signal of your abilities based on a set of standards that particular school presents. Let\u2019s say you go to Harvard. When you graduate and get your degree, that signifies you are \u201cHarvard material\u201d. When you pay tuition, you\u2019re paying for the right to attach the Harvard name to yourself. It says that you adhere to a certain set of standards and qualities that others identify with the Harvard name. You\u2019re not paying for the classes. Not paying for the knowledge. You\u2019re paying for the credential. That credential is dead. No one cares anymore what college or university you graduated from. It doesn\u2019t signify anything but your ability to sit in class and pass tests. Employers want to see what you can do. In college you only complete assignments for professors. In the real world you have to be able to create value. College degrees don\u2019t signify that you can do that. You have to become your own credential. There are better ways to signal your value and skills than through a degree. The internet allows you to develop a digital paper trail of all your work that employers can look up with a google search. Create a personal website. Publish all of your work. Become a voice in your area of expertise. Those three things will set you apart from the standard college graduate. And guess what, it won\u2019t cost you $200,000. Follow my story at michaelkgaines.com ",

            "answer_text": "As a current Harvard student \u2013 I am going to answer you honestly. No, it doesn\u2019t freaking matter if you attend an Ivy League school or not. Dang, I feel like I am betraying the egos of every Ivy League school by writing that statement. Here\u2019s the truth. Ivy Leagues are wonderful and amazing opportunities. If you are accepted to one, I highly recommend you take the acceptance. However, the will and determination of an individual is what determines success. Ivy Leagues may be an indicator of success \u2013 but they do not just make it happen like Tinker Bell with Pixie Dust.  Let me tell you a story: I went to a summer program with a girl whose dream was to go to an elite school \u2013 like Yale. She worked her butt off and she really deserved to go to one.  Sadly, it didn\u2019t work out for her. She was rejected from all her top schools. So, she decided to take a year off before going to college. What did she do with that time? Did she just sit and cry? Did she tell herself she would always be a failure? Did she give herself a year-long time-out in the corner of her bedroom? Heck no! Instead, she traveled the world (backpacking on a budget) She learned how to code. And she lived her best life for an entire year.  And guess what? A year later she doesn\u2019t need an Ivy League to be successful, because now she is creating her own app and writes as a travel blogger. The individual determines success, not the school they attended. Who knows? Not going to an Ivy League might be the best thing to ever happen to you.

            "answer_text": "I attended Cornell grad school and have been working in Silicon Valley for the past 10+ years.  Having an Ivy League on the resume has opened a lot of doors for me.  Many of my connections from Cornell also ended up in the valley, in big prestigious companies or thriving promising start-ups.  I didn't necessarily land a particular job directly through my Cornell connections, but the information flow in the network, the amazing people I got to know through extended network kept me updated on interesting opportunities.   Ivy League schools constantly receive generous endowment from its alumni network because alumni see continued benefits they receive by carrying a name of Ivy League throughout their career.  These resources enable the schools to spend on promoting its presence, organizing events for alumni and supporting career development for its students.  It is a strong and healthy circle.   Every once in a while you hear a successful story from the valley that a small start-up makes big - guess what, most, if not all, smart investors look for Ivy League names in a start-up's founder list and/or first few crucial hires before they are willing to bet investment on it. That being said, there are universities on the west coast (Stanford, Berkeley, to name a few) that offer similar, or if you are destined for Silicon Valley, better career development benefits in areas I mentioned above.  A self-driven individual shines regardless.  Putting yourself through a good university helps a lifetime. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer can be yes and can be NO as well. Like if you are graduating for a elite college you financial and professional career can be great . According to the economist it really matter to graduate from a ivy league school for a lot of future earning. But primarily it depends on the goals you set for your life .If you want to become a CEO or a president , graduating from the elite college can be benefical for you .Similarly one of the top companies in the world recruit there employee from the elite school only .Also, graduates of elite colleges have an advantage in the business world from strong, powerful alumni networks. However, If you want to be a scientist or teacher, there may not be much of an advantage, at least monetarily, from attending a top school. Again, you can still achieve any professional goal if you attend from normal college , but the graduation rate of Stanford is significantly higher, and the average salaries of Stanford grads are substantially higher. It's important to remember that you can graduate from any college, and if you fully apply yourself, you can be a successful CEO, doctor, engineer, or whatever else you aspire to be. Similarly, if you go to an Ivy League college and try to coast through life without showing the dedication that got you into an elite college, you're likely to experience limited success. World is not the same anymore if you have a skill , enthusiasm and have a courage to do hard work then one can in this world can stop to achieve your goal. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion it depends. It depends if you are talking about undergrad or grad school. It depends on the field you intend to pursue. It depends on your economic circumstances. It depends on what other opportunities you have available to you (opportunity cost). Etc. etc. In general, I believe academic success is more about the person and their personal desire to learn than the school they attended; career success is more about delivering results and connecting with the right people than graduating for a prestigous university (by the way a large portion of the \u201cimportant\u201d people to connect with are not Ivy grads). That being said in some fields, and for some certain objectives, an Ivy degree can be a powerful lever to help you on your journey. For example, in law, business, and politics a grad degree from an Ivy could go a long way, but it is not always necessary either. However, in fields like nursing, social work, or medicine an Ivy degree seems like overkill and will not likely impact your results in terms of financial outcomes. In those fields you would generally be better off finding the most efficient/cost effective and accredited path to your career (which probably is not an Ivy). At one time, I was accepted to an Ivy, but it ended up not being a good fit for my future plans. It was super hard to say no to that offer. The Ivy Universities carry prestige, and that prestige makes attending very tempting even when it\u2019s otherwise irrational to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "Going to a good school is worth it if you can find one that fits how you work and what you want to do. often, the best schools aren't the Ivies, though. If you're into tech or science, few of the Ivies really are top tier in that many disciplines. In most fields of study, there are alternatives which will leave you just as well connected and probably better educated. if you're doing politics, Yale is great, but so is Georgetown. If you're into music, film or drama, Julliard, NYU or Carnegie Mellon are probably better than any of the Ivies, except maybe for comedy and TV writing. Economics? MIT, U Chicago. Entrepreneurship? Given the choice, you'd be an idiot to go anywhere but Stanford. So no, you're not hosed if you can't get into an Ivy. but it really helps to have a clue what you want to do. because what the Ivies mostly have is quite good breadth, and names and networks that can be quite powerful in every career, where many other schools are only well known within their best areas. A few non-Ivies are of a similar or greater quality, prestige and competitiveness in most areas-- Stanford, Berkeley, etc. That said, none of these places are easy to get into, so best get cracking. Last bit of advice: it really helps to have something you really are into. Doesn't have to be the class president/varsity athlete kind of thing, just something you're legitimately good at and excited about. ",

            "answer_text": "Inherently? Nope. While attending an Ivy League school absolutely makes it easier for its students to succeed, it is by no means a requirement. These schools only accept people they believe will go on to reflect well on the school. However, they also reject thousands and thousands of kids with equally as much, if not more, potential every year. If you happen to end up at an Ivy, you probably were likely to succeed wherever you went. An \u201cIvy League\u201d education is only available to about 0.2% of the US population. If only that 0.2% were capable, intelligent, and ambitious, the nation would crumble. Remember that the Ivy League is just a sports league, not the end all be all of higher education. If you have the drive, you could go to the lowest-ranked school in the country \u2014 or drop out of school entirely like Steve Jobs, although I don\u2019t recommend it \u2014 and end up very successful. At the end of the day, what does success even mean? If you look back on your life and smile at least a little, that\u2019s a victory right there. ",

Most people agree that there are hundreds of schools that are as good or better than the eight very different random schools that compete in the Ivy athletic league. What students do in school is infinitely more important than the brand of the school they attend. The Ivy schools are good, of course, but for many students there are much better choices based on location, size and special programs. What you will hear from people who have a different view is that attending an Ivy school is good because you will get to know a lot of rich kids, and those connections are the most valuable benefit of attending. For my taste this is a very stupid reason for obsessing about these schools. If a student is not willing to work to their utmost, all the connections to rich kids will make no difference whatever. After ten years, no one cares where you went to school. They only care about what you have done in your career. An Ivy graduate who is still bragging about their Ivy undergraduate school in their 30s is a pitiful loser. ",

Especially if your major is business, economics, journalism, writing/literature, or political science (I'm sure I've missed a few others as well). However, depending on your major, another private or even state school may offer a better experience. I know many successful people and while there are several that went to Harvard, the rest went to MAC schools or state colleges like Rutgers, Illinois, or Ohio State. They may not be CEO's of major corporations, but they have very nice and lucrative careers. Careers that have allowed them to send their kids to $40-60K a year schools. What I've observed is what really seems to matter is what you put into your education, no matter what school you go to. So, before you put yourself into crippling debt just to go to an ivy league school, check into schools that may better fit your academic and career goals. It's a big decision and warrants a little research and an open mind. ",

            "answer_text": "My advice: Depends on your capability, where you want to work and what you want to do. Firstly, and most applicable for business schools, you should attend an institute located at or near your desired place of work (state/country) or which has a market reputation to specialize in your desired field or industry of work. Ivy Leagues just happens to fulfill this criteria quite well in the States, but it will not help you massively if you want to be involved in Asian or European markets, where institutes like NUS, NTU, HKU, LBS, Oxford, HEC and INSEAD would have the upper hand in the respective geographies. When it comes to research, more often than not, the Ivy Leagues and other top-tier universities will be able to provide you with the resources to support your research. But again, not a lot of students will have the financial resources to attend these and still could achieve similar if not better results in schools overseas. But for both cases, you need to have the right set of characteristics to be able to utilize these resources and networking opportunities well. So it will be quite stupid and shortsighted to say you, not attending an ivy league, wouldn\u2019t be better off than an individual not as \u201ccapable\u201d as you but had the financial resources to get into Ivy Leagues. If you think an Ivy League is right for you and will help you achieve your goals, then go for it. Otherwise, you are just going for it for the sake of it and it would not help you achieve squat. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have made yourself capable of running with anyone in your field -- and I don't mean you've made 30 million on your invention -- you might already be an assistant professor at a less heralded but quality state university and be seeking new horizons. Now Imagine a Month Like this Week One Your boss at university sits you down to tell you something. The assistant Provost who oversees your department is getting feelers from bigger universities. They want to know when your contract ends here. They hear you will be an excellent associate Professor. You are not shocked but afraid; this boss has been at times difficult and you cannot see her helping at all. You thank her and say it's all very interesting. You add that you are happy here after two years. She wants to talk about a small raise for next year. Week Two The assistant Provost calls you in. She really has no choice but to ease your transition, she knows your boss is difficult, that you've earned your positive reputation in your field and she wants an ally at a bigger school. She knows what she's doing --the two of you will be networked. She says that two programs will definitely approach you but you don't have to jump at the highest offer. An interview request comes in from the top 60 flagship university a few states away. The Provosts arranges the time off and you have a good trip. The college has Professors you've heard of and more facilities than you imagined. You hold off on accepting the offer though. Week Four You can't believe it. You can taste it. The second offer is from a school near one of your favorite cities and your current Provost explained that they keep Professors for a long time; or loose them to top 20s. The offer is nearly twice the state flagship. Its done. You'll ramp up and learn in the fast lane. The above is a rarity, a lottery win, just doesn't happen. But with a little charisma, personality on a microphone and talent for the scholarship which is not overdone a provost can go to bat for you and want to be in your circle as you progress. If you dream of leading, if you wish to be mentored to leadership you should observe professionals in action and when appropriate emulate them. What Ivy people cannot share with you is that if you show hints of needing them too much it's just not going to work out. They need accomplished go getters with great upside potential who stay lit on fire and see arrival at _______ University as no arrival at all -- just more complete libraries and labs that they can't wait to access. (I personally recall telling Princeton and then Harvard to please show me the libraries available to undergraduates (P) and med students (H). I was told I'd get both a tour and a set of keys to private collections. Someone had called ahead to alert them that I had associate curatotial experience with rare private collections.) Now this is Ivy. Insider Ivy. But the bloke who got hired to the great assistant Professorship will have made his way to be observed and measured by top 20 universities without the old club. A bright light stood up for him --rather with him. That saavy Provost hasn't lost him. The higher he goes the more valuable pieces they may move between them. At the Ivy level the game all new. If you are nobody's great nephew think carefully. This chap may well spend his 30s and 40s rejecting Ivy offers. His network is so easygoing between the Northwestern's, Notre Dames, and a host of top 40s that he is wise to avoid the show. Whether or not he does a final act to temporary replace an eminent at Dartmouth is Cornell while a young gun is found is immaterial to the exercise. He has proven worthy of calling the shots in his long career and Ivy was an option, though a far less independent one. Many of those who find this all an indulgent flight of fancy would opine that of course Ivy matters and that the chump I describe is a weak character. Perhaps so but hundreds upon hundreds of similarly capable assistant Professors within top 120 universities aspire to a top 60\u2013100. To them half his success in a civil work setting and a place they enjoy living defines the win. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends totally on what field/major you wish to study and/or what sort of job you wish to work for. If you wanted to become a lawyer, sure, attending an Ivy League School might make a huge difference in how easily you become a top lawyer. However, for engineering, not only are there better engineering schools than the Ivy League universities(MIT, Caltech etc), but also, in most branches of engineering, employers don\u2019t care that much about where you studied from; They would care more about what sort of projects/internships you did and or how much you know. The correlation between the reputation of an engineering school and the availability/quality of projects you work on is not so straightforward; and A LOT depends on how proactive you were in school and/or just general knowledge of your engineering major. [I studied engineering myself and so am mostly knowledgable about these majors] Other than these, even though you didn\u2019t attend any Ivy school during undergrad, you can easily attend one later for grad school if it would help your job prospects. Thus, not attending and Ivy school doesn\u2019t necessarily matter ",

For living a happy life - depends on your ego (ie if your alma mater affects the way you and your family/friends see you). For getting a tenure track job - kind of (depending on the extent to which you think new ideas come from the individual rather his-her environment). It also depends on the Ivy. Penn and Columbia seem alot less the Dead Poets ideal than Dartmouth or Brown). For making you poorer - undoubtedly. For a job in politics/ government/diplomacy - it hurts more than helps (at least to publicly announce you went to an Ivy League school). What REALLY matters is \u2014 WHY are you asking? I mean, your motivation. Your assumption that Ivies are somehow different (if not implicitly better). The implied sense of a different social \u201cface\u201d you get.

            "answer_text": "Well it depends on your immediate goals. If your have dreams in working for high finance jobs such as Investment banking analyst in top banks such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, in consulting firms such as Mckinsey right out of college etc then an Ivy League/elite college makes sense as these banks and consulting firms only recruit from ''target'' universities. In the UK for example if you want to be a successful lawyer \u2013 work in top law firms or become a barrister then you will have to be a graduate from top university \u2013 Oxbridge, LSE, UCL etc. Some sectors such as law and finance is highly prestige driven and obsessed, unfortunately. The hanker for pretige universities is truly ridiculous in consulting and finance sector. For example in the UK, a girl who did Language and Classics, ( from Oxbridge) an MA and PhD in the same ( again Oxbridge) now works at Boston Consulting Group. There are plenty of associates and partners in US who has a degrees in philosophy, poli sc etc in ''target'' universities. Now imagine someone who is say a History or Psychology grad with top grades from a State University trying to get an entry into the finance or consulting sector \u2013he/she will be laughed at. Sounds pretty pathetic \u2013 but what can you do? In contrast Canada is much more egalitarian \u2013 sure you might be respected if you say went to U of T or McGill but all things considered an English/Pol Sc graduate from McGill or U of T and an English.Pol Sc graduate from say Capilano University, or Uni of British Columbia etc will have roughly the same employment prospects \u2013 unless they have relevant credentials/work experience a humanities/social science graduate from U of T cannot expect banks and consultancies to welcome him/her with open arms \u2013 just because he/she has a degree from U of T. There are quite a few manager level employees at Mckinsey Canada who have graduate from ''non elite'' colleges such as Wilfrid Laurier University. Make that what you will. Outside of legal and financial fields, most employers can care less where you graduated from. For example if you are an engineering graduate from a State University with good grades you stand as good a chance as say a Stanford graduate at a job at Silicon Valley. Tech I have found is the least prestige obsessed field. Even then I would like to conclude, where you did undergrad in does not matter at all in the long run \u2013 seriously. Make the best of your time at whatever university you have got into, focus on getting the best grades, you will be set for life. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I think so. For sure, you will have a better alumni and network, which becomes more valuable as you get older. Also, Ivy League schools have a strong signaling effect, showing that you are probably smart and somewhat know what you are doing. In terms of education quality....you probably get better education compared to very low tier schools but it really depends. Having an excellent research faculty does not directly relate to good teaching. Unless, the costs are exorbitant attending an Ivy league school seems to be a good deal. However, if you care a little less about alumni and network, attending a great state school with a scholarship (or much lower cost) is also a great option. With advent of great MOOCs such as Coursera, EdX, and Udacity, you can supplement whatever the state school lacks in terms of programs. Also, lack of alumni and network can be also compensated by joining certain college groups (fraternity, sorority, honor societies). In terms of signaling, well, thanks God we live in the world of social media, you can show your skills online if your area of focus allows that (e.g. if you are an engineer, you can show what problems you can solve or what stuff you can build).

But is that the purpose of education? If you are a crafts man, art student, music student, and you believe you have the talent, you would want to learn from the best. Where is the best teacher? To say that firms hired the graduate of elite school because of the school name is not fair to the student. We know how many 4.0 students are rejected by Harvard. There is a meaning behind the stellar results of those admitted to Ivy league and graduated. 4.0 GPA  is an accumulation of years of dedicated hard work, aspiration and determination. More over, these school often teaches the mind as in the character of a person. I have met many of those and I found them humble and willing to help and teach others. So please do not belittle those who has achieved what is deservedly a commendable feat and trivialize the value of a good education. Now, what is intelligence? Does it equate education? Were the cave men who know how to start a fire lacking intelligence? ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays the quality of education is somehow similar in most of universities. Ivy league, and more generally super elite schools, will offer a better network through a more competitive selection. In STEM fields, there's another dimension: research. And here, the best ones are generally not Ivy league. To answer the question, I'd say it really depends. If you're in Law school or finance, attending Harvard will open you more doors than any other non-Ivy school. And statistically speaking, you tend to be more intelligent too (selection process). Similarly, if you're in CS, attending Stanford will give you more opportunities given the environment, labs and faculty there. But the coursework is not that different.What you learn, how you master a subject depends on you, your ability and motivation to learn. ",

Legitimately Blonde highlighting Reese Witherspoon is my undisputed top choice. What? It's a freakin' great! Also, clearly an absolutely precise portrayal of Harvard Graduate school. All things considered, not in the slightest degree. Harvard and the other Ivy Classes are more famous for their aggressive application forms, scholastic ability and first class graduated class. Yet, so are different colleges! Have you at any point ceased to ask why the Ivy Association universities are considered a great deal more noteworthy and tip top than other world class universities like UC Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, or some other aggressive West Drift school? Without a doubt their scholastics are similarly as trustworthy, isn't that so? Ivy Class offices couldn't be that vastly improved than other tip top colleges. Most likely? Why, at that point, are the Ivies thought about the most elite? What is it an Ivy Class training will really improve the situation you? Also, is it worth the frequently hella costly educational cost charges? Out and out, there are eight Ivy Associations: Harvard, Yale, Darker, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, UPenn and Princeton. Every ha an alternate way to deal with instruction, however every open ways to circumstances inaccessible to understudies at different universities. To start, we should think of some as outstanding Ivy Association graduated class. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question you need to answer for yourself. What it is you seek out of college? If you're meaning \u201cdoes it matter\u201d in terms of getting a job? Of course not, people all over the world are employed or succesfull, whatever that may mean to you, without an Ivy League education. This is a question that requires introspection on your part. There are very specific reasons I chose to attend an Ivy League college, and it's not just so I can get a job after. I've always wanted to push myself to the absolute limits and be the best I can, not to say this isn't possible at a different college. I am constantly humbled by my terrifyingly intelligent peers, and that pushes me to do better. I wake up and am lectured by professors who are leading the world in their respective field. Everyone here is extremely passionate about their own convictions which gives to classroom discussions that can give you an entirely new perspective on a topic that you've never even considered. I just recently had a class that argued about gender roles in Lysistrata for 2 hours and I'm sure we could've gone longer. It's this type of environment that I wanted to surround myself in to help me grow as a person and become more open minded, so when you ask, \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d For me, yes. This is an experience that I wouldn't trade anything else for. ",

I went to Michigan State University and they've been number one in the nation for Nuclear Physics (have one of few rare isotope beam facilities), Supple and Chain Management, and Secondary Education for consecutive years. Having the name of an Ivy League school will get you far and you should aim for it if there program is right for you. But you can still get the same exposure at another university. When I researching abroad with MSU, we stayed at a campus and I met people from University of Michigan, Harvard, and Duke. I presented my research at the same conferences Ivy League students did. I really wanted to go to graduate school at an Ivy League school but I realized not many professors research international food security. Also, if you really want to get in a good school, apply for international schooling as well. I'm going to McGill University in Montreal because I feel it's important for me to get out my comfort zone and study someplace new. Tuition is also more affordable (In state tuition at MSU is more expensive than the international rate at McGill). Do what's best for you! ",

Do you want to challenge your intellect? Do you want to push your boundaries? Do you want to have a degree that's much more valuable, and would give you an upper hand in job hunting? If the answer to most of these questions is a --Yes, then, I think Ivy League degrees matter. Graduating from Harvard, Stanford or University of Pennsylvania maybe a bit of a stretch in terms of grades, and also because they have the lowest acceptance ratio, but they're worth it. After all, getting a degree from one of the Top 5 colleges in the world would have an inherent value attached to it. (Ranking source: Ivy League Colleges Ranking) However, if you're getting into the college just to get a job, or if you're not financially potent to repay the loans, or if you just want to do something of your own, then I think you're stretching yourself for the wrong reasons.   A professional degree helps, but not too much. When you're out in the world, it's all about how practically sound you are, and how quickly you can get grasp of things, and how sincerely you work towards your goals.  That's my 2 cents :) ",

            "answer_text": "Does going to an Ivy league school really make that much of a difference? It depends a lot on whether you avail yourself of the extraordinary networking opportunities that the Ivies encourage. The networking is helpful to find jobs on graduation as well as for social, business and academic connections throughout life. The institutional camaraderie and pride of the Ivy experience crosses school boundaries. Even though students and graduates of the seven Ivies feel honor bound to disparage one another constantly, they actually believe that they are collectively among the elect. Yalies don\u2019t worry a lot about hiring Harvard or Princeton graduates even though they may tease them unmercifully. The thoroughly rebuttable presumption is that they\u2019re getting quality. That makes it easier to get through the door in the first place. Once you\u2019re through the door, of course, the rest is up to you. To some substantially more limited extent, an Ivy diploma invests graduates with a modest amount of cachet that may help them compete with other qualified people. In most circumstances there is a slight hiring bias in favor of Ivy graduates who are also socially and technically skilled. Life is tough, and any advantage helps. Technical and social skills are necessary conditions for success, but in a world populated by emotionally driven social animals they are far from sufficient conditions. In that context, effective networking is a principal differentiator. The Ivies teach networking. ",

The hiring manager actually told me the reason she picked out my resume was because the manager was a huge fan of ND football. The job I have now I got hired only because \u201cHarvard\u201d is on my resume. The CEO at this fairly small company wanted to say she had someone from Harvard working for her. From what I have heard from my coworkers, the only thing they talked about during my hiring process was \u201cHarvard\u201d. I was straight out of college and right now I am in grad school in the evenings so I didn't even have the knowledge from it, yet. Just the status. It makes you stand out from other resumes and hiring managers notice when someone from \u201cYale\u201d or \u201cPrinceton\u201d applied. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are 5 thoughts on this question Tons of people are successful whether or not they went to an Ivy League school.2. Is it the school or the student. Many people from ivy leagues schools are successful because they needed to be smart and driven to get into an Ivy League school. Thus those traits not the school itself make them successful later on. 3. Many that go to an Ivy League forget what it took them to get into an Ivy League school. Drive and intelligence etc etc. Thus they dot\u2019t do so well afterwards. 4. An Ivy League school can be tough on someones confidence. When u go to an ivy u are suddenly not so comparatively brilliant. For many this is very bad for confidence and not great for success. 5. In business, drive intelligence and personal skills all matter. Again on average ivy leaguers will tend to do well. But many of the best leaders and business people and everything weren\u2019t ivy leaguers. ",

            "answer_text": "You are unlikely to ever suffer because you have an Ivy League education, unless said education comes at the price of not majoring in something that is important for your post-graduation plans. For example, most (all?) Ivies do not offer an accounting major. If you plan to be an accountant after you graduate, that might be an obstacle, because employers who want to hire accountants expect their accounting hires to have learned about accounting. However, most jobs don\u2019t require a specific major, and having a degree from an Ivy confers a lot of prestige. And some firms only recruit from Ivies and peer schools. So, to sum it all up, it doesn\u2019t usually matter, in the very strong sense that relatively few careers are barred to you if you don\u2019t graduate from an Ivy. But those careers do exist (investment banking, management consulting), and going to an Ivy does generally give you a leg up. So apply if you have a realistic shot, but don\u2019t think you can\u2019t have a decent career without that particular credential. ",

I really don\u2019t care what school they went to as much as whether the work they produce makes me look good, But, if they were equally bright, wouldn\u2019t you rather work with the one that was enthusiastic and personable, and shares their views in a positive way? If people want to work with you, in many environments that determines your success. A lot of people are very successful who did not attend Ivy league law schools BTW. In law school, people don\u2019t think of Ivy League as much as Top 14 or T14. ",

Having the Ivy League name on your resume is a great stepping stone for those fresh out of school. But...

At an Ivy League school, you\u2019re unlikely to get an experience like that. I also, more recently, took a course on innovation from HBX, the Harvard Business School Extension. It was taught by Clayton Christensen. He said that HBS degrees were so expensive that their graduates could only afford to work for a big corporations, and there they spent most of their time crunching spreadsheets.

            "answer_text": "An Ivy League education can be an assist in securing the first job in your major. Of course, that means that the companies are hiring in your major course of study. Ivy League schools are in the first tier of recruited schools so on-campus interviews offer students an opportunity if they have a high Grade Point Average, and have majored in the areas of hiring interest for interviewing companies. However, don\u2019t be misled by the on-campus interviews. The recruiters are furnished with a list of openings at the entry level the management is interested in filling. The recruiters then try to select a few for on-site interviews by the people doing the actual hiring. Sometimes these on-site interviews are a bust if you don\u2019t exactly line up to the company\u2019s expectations or if the recruiter has been given the incorrect requirements of the company. I had one of the latter type on-site interviews. I traveled by train to a city southeast of Pittsburgh. My escort was a young man only recently graduated himself. We toured the manufacturing facility and then went to the office area that was essentially deserted. In fact, I saw no one except the young man and I asked pointedly with all the empty desks why they would be hiring a fresh college graduate. He said he didn\u2019t think they really were hiring and didn\u2019t understand my invitation for an on-site interview. In fact, he had me fill out an expense form and took it to accounting who wrote a check for me before the end of the interview. As far as I know the company went out of business within months. I think the on-campus interviewer must have been a service organization that was paid well in advance and not told the company\u2019s position. ",

If you do not have the work habits to do well, you may get a worse education than you would at a community college.

Choosing a marketable major and having a solid financial plan that minimizes student debt is going to get you a long way. Notes Who Needs Harvard?

Elite degrees of all kinds serve as a signalling mechanism for recruiters (whether in HR, grad school admissions, etc). Whether you go to MIT, Duke, CalTech, or Harvard, your degree is a proxy for the following traits: intelligence, work ethic, class / background, and more. More importantly, you may meet the children of incredibly powerful people in college. Many of your peers will go on to become CEOs, heads of state, etc. Social circles are incredibly important if you want to be successful; the myth of the self made (wo)man is just that-- a myth.  The network you gain from elite schools is powerful. Thanks for A2A. ",

Todorcevic, attended some subpar elementary and secondary schools, so much subpar that he was getting Cs and Ds in math for the first two years of high school. According to his recollection, he had no idea what he was supposed to do, what math was all about etc. He began to get sense about it only at the end of his high school education at which point he started to lecture other students including his teacher. And at the university, he started to regularly correct his future mentor in his own field, a sound name in mathematics. The professor wanted his master thesis to become his PhD dissertation due to its quality, but he refused. And when he defended his PhD dissertation, the faculty could not provide 3 examiners who could understand what the thesis was all about (they had to invite two professors from England to serve as examiners). Schools are overrated, talent is everything. ",

But reviewing the list of the \u201cLittle Ivies\u201d (https://www.nescac.com/about/members ) I\u2019d imagine that Tufts might be first in line if such a hypothetical expansion event occurred. ",

Penn, where I did my undergrad, has a strong business program but a weak math program (for ex). At the end of the day, what\u2019s going to define your experience and future are how you spend your four years and the opportunities you choose to pursue. Don\u2019t feel like you have to go Ivy League if another option makes more sense. There are plenty of people who don\u2019t take advantage of opportunities at schools like Penn who emerge afterward without direction and preparation for the real world. ",

Brown isn't at all like Columbia.   Don't obsess about the Ivies.  Focus on finding a school that is a good fit for you.  I think it is a worthwhile investment to go to a good school.  However, look for a school that matches your career interests, first and foremost.  Most schools discount freshmen year grades.  So a 3.0 isn't the end of the world.  Concentrate on taking the most challenging courses you can.  Don't take an Honors or A.P. class, if you are sure you can't get at least a B.  A C never looks good. ",

Selecting on the basis of cost/benefit, proximity, or campus environment often over rules heading to the northeast for an elite education at any one of eight very different colleges. The more I look at the Ivy\u2019s, most of which I\u2019ve at least visited on campus for one reason or another, the more different each of them looks from the others. If, for instance, Cornell, for it\u2019s agriculture, or Dartmouth for its combination of top academics with winter sports, has something unique to offer you as an applicant, then you should certainly apply. If you\u2019re simply wishing to hang a label on yourself, be careful. And ALWAYS apply to a rich variety of colleges where you would be happy including at least one or two where your application will for sure be accepted. It\u2019s just foolish to do anything else. ",

Too expensive? Cannot stand places full of 'stuffy, elitist' people? Go around and start to find yourself a decent community. Travel. Spend your time where debates are being held, intellectual curiosity is regarded. Read books, and discuss what you have read even only to a bedraggled homemate. Just keep your mind starving. ",

I went to McGill university, a school that is considered an Ivy league equivalent. I grew up in a low income family so I didn't have those special connections from the get go as opposed to rich kids. The school did not help me get a job though connections ( everyone was over competitive and still are today) I got a job on my own through hard work and perseverance. They also did not help me get an internship I had to get that on my own too after 2 years of searching for one the rich kids got it through parents. After I graduated nobody really cared were I graduated from. If I had to do it again I would have went to an easier school and get much better grades and party which I didn't do there because I had low grades and worried about failing all the time. ",

Look at your specific major and find the programs that are well ranked for that major (US News is a good starting point). Even then, don\u2019t think that you absolutely have to go to the very top program. You will generally find that you can get a similarly good education at the #1 school and the #20 school, and the #20 school may be cheaper and easier to get into. Another thing you can look at is which schools are most sought after by employers for your field. There are lists published for certain fields on different websites. Interestingly, those statistics often do not correlate with the rankings of the programs. ",
