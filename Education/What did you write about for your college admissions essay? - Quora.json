Anyway don't be afraid to be yourself, you gotta super be yourself especially if you as you normally are is a cool guy. Essay prompt included, yes, this is the real essay. Essay Option 4. From  game theory to Ultimate Frisbee to the great Chicago Scavenger Hunt, we  at the University of Chicago take games seriously. We bet you do, too.  Even if \"just a game,\" sport, play, and other kinds of games seem to  share at the very least an insistence that we take seriously a set of  rules entirely peculiar to the circumstance of the game. You might say,  in order to play a game we must take it seriously. Think playfully - or  play thoughtfully - about games: how they distract us or draw us into  the world, create community and competition, tease us and test us with  stakes both set apart from and meaningful to everyday life. Don't tell  us about The Big Game; rather, tell us about players and games. On  one particularly awesome Christmas in elementary school I received  Pok\u00e9mon Blue version and a GameBoy Color in Atomic Purple, which was  translucent and not at all radioactive and also the coolest plastic  casing ever devised by humans ever. I  fell in love with the game, not just because Pok\u00e9mon was the biggest  fad since sliced bread, but because the game is compelling like only the  extremely well-marketed can be. Your avatar was basically you, living  the little-kid-dream of independence, and hanging out with cool magic  animals that eventually became cooler, more magical animals. \u201cTaming  Magical Creatures That Get Bigger and More Magical\u201d remains the second  best hook for any plot ever\u2014right behind \u201cAcrobatic Italian Fights  Turtle for Love, Gold Coins, and Dubious Mushrooms.\u201dI  still play it. In fact, I\u2019m playing through the latest US-released  version, Platinum, with my wonderful, new-to-the-series girlfriend now.  It\u2019s an amazing series that can help you make bonds with people who  don\u2019t play games and with people who do, because it has things for both  of them\u2014accessible mechanics and cute creatures for newbies and an  endlessly engaging battle system and cute creatures for veterans to  video games.The  mechanics, as I\u2019ve said, are rooted in simplicity. Logic and common  knowledge are the basis of the 17-way rock-paper-scissors game that  forms the type component of the game\u2014how Pok\u00e9mon match up against each  other based on what element they represent. For example: fire melts ice,  but water beats fire. But, ice beats flying type (i.e. birds) because  birds migrate away from cold weather (this is the most ingenious one, I  think, if only because I didn\u2019t understand it until recently). Ghost  type and Normal type (Pok\u00e9mon lacking any affinity or martial skill) are  mutually ineffective against each other, because corporeal and  incorporeal things don\u2019t interact.Competitive  play constitutes its own rabbit-hole. Fansites aren\u2019t so much fansites  as they are large compendiums of data and statistics useful only in  building the most powerful team. In order to build optimal teams, you  can figure out how your team as a whole fits in the grand  rock-paper-scissors game, and then you have to build up hidden  statistics and breed the Pok\u00e9mon correctly to make sure everything turns  out to be the best it can be.If  you want to have fun with it, of course, you don\u2019t build teams that  way. Instead, you build teams of Pok\u00e9mon you like and give them moves  that sound cool and complement their readily apparent strengths and  weaknesses (type and appearance also give good impressions of the  statistical build of a Pok\u00e9mon\u2014a puffy looking pink thing will have  miserable defense but probably some compensating attribute since it\u2019s so  adorable). It\u2019s a never-ending fun-time. In  short, Pok\u00e9mon is an astonishingly well-balanced game with underlying  systems that are deceptively simple and elegant, and mechanics so honed  and intuitive that the only effective analogies end up relating it to  chess or something else more boring and traditional.To  me though, what\u2019s more interesting than the extremely good game is the  world you have to inhabit. You get to live in what is apparently a  perfect little world with no real crime problems (goofy villains can be,  and are, foiled by spirited ten year olds regularly, even when they\u2019re  very obviously dangerous terrorists with bombs and schemes for  destroying the earth), the absurdly powerful creatures wandering the  wilderness pose no threat and really are just some time for bonding away  from being your best friend, and you never eat, sleep, or tire.There\u2019s  no need for anything resembling real-world government, and what  government there is happens to be the Pok\u00e9mon League. Each town is  apparently governed, protected, and looked after in most affairs by the  Pok\u00e9mon Gym Leader, a person who has devoted themselves to working with  one type of Pok\u00e9mon, and each Gym is affiliated with the Pok\u00e9mon League.There  is free healthcare in this world, and the economy is almost entirely  governed by Pok\u00e9mon, who are used as help in heavy labor, like mining  (Rock type and Fighting type Pok\u00e9mon are invaluable for this). There is  apparently a currency, so the Pok\u00e9mon League must have some department  like the Fed that controls fiscal policy. The official unit of currency  is the Pok\u00e9dollar, which is based off of the Japanese yen\u2014the symbol for  it is derived from the symbol for the yen, and the relative buying  power of a single yen and a single Pok\u00e9dollar seem to be equal. Several  large cities run entirely on wind or solar power, but there is still  plenty of room in this magical economy for coal mining and coal power  generation, even though electricity honestly shouldn\u2019t be an issue since  it can be freely generated by Pok\u00e9mon.The  world is also incredibly tolerant. Some regions have creation myths  that vary (some regions focus on the origin of the universe, others on  the origin of land on the planet), but evidence shows they are all  right.  You can\u2019t doubt anything, because it\u2019s all real and right there.  The last two generations of Pok\u00e9mon games have dealt with people trying  to gain control of these Pok\u00e9mon.  It\u2019s actually easy to meet these  God-Pok\u00e9mon if one is inquisitive, resourceful, and talented at the  capture and raising of Pok\u00e9mon. There is literally a flute that can  summon God and you just have to find it and play it on top of a mountain  that can be hiked with ease by any spirited ten-year-old. It\u2019s  a world where there\u2019s no fighting for research grants\u2014the doctors of  what I assume is Pok\u00e9monology have enough funding to develop highly  advanced, extremely portable, self-updating computer databases\u2014and they  can hand these marvels out to spirited ten-year-olds with the hope that  these children will fulfill their life\u2019s dream for them of meeting all  the Pok\u00e9mon, because they are too old to do it themselves.It\u2019s  a world where no matter what you get to be special and helpful, and  save the day. I can see all of this now that I\u2019m not in elementary  school, of course, but I had an instinctive recognition of it back then.  The world I was playing in was happier, nicer, and cleaner.  The game  made a direct, unconscious appeal to the part of me that wanted to do  amazing things and wanted to do them right then. It\u2019s silly and  ridiculous, and in a way, it\u2019s like fantasizing about society, but no  one ever played Pok\u00e9mon to confront problems in humanity. You play it to  feel good in a feel-good world.If  someone asks me why I play Pok\u00e9mon still, I can say I play it for the  game I was telling you about earlier. Of course, I\u2019d be lying. I still  play it because I like being the very best, like no one ever was. ",

            "answer_text": "I struggled with finding a topic for my essay, but I was very pleased with the final result. My English teacher\u2019s help was invaluable. The most notable colleges I got into were RPI, WPI, Howard University, Northeastern University, and Boston University. Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. That morning, I packed a lunch and a water bottle, and stepped out of the car to greet a feverishly hot day. The muggy air clung to my skin as I trudged along the path from the barn to the field. My first task: harvesting 650 rhubarb plants. I resigned myself to a day of misery. As I knelt amongst the plants, I heard my calves cry out in protest, felt my skin pricked by the invasive flies, and the unforgiving sun against my forehead. I believed the day would never end. From a young age, my mother always tried her best to instill in my sister and I the importance of conserving food. Largely due to having grown up with the reality of food scarcity, a happy plate was an empty plate as far as my mother was concerned. Night after night, she'd entreat us to finish our dinner, often for the sake of those less fortunate, who'd gladly accept our meals. Yet many a night ended in the same manner, with me scraping vegetables into the trash. Every Sunday, I gnashed my teeth and complained when my mother would drag us to a local organic farm, at which she had a farm share. After picking up our vegetables, she'd insist that we complete our member hours. I harbored a profound distaste for the grueling work on the farm, the foul concoction of soil and sweat upon my body, and the mosquitoes and horseflies that never failed to leave my skin marked and bitten. I saw no connection between my own two hands, and the fruits of my labor; a pallet of fresh beets, newly plucked from the ground. But I'll admit, age did give me some perspective. By the time I was in eighth grade, the thought of 40% of food in the USA being wasted sickened me, in a world where 1 in 7 are food insecure. I'd learn about massive, global efforts to combat the issue, yet they seemed to be all for naught, and there seemed to be little I could do to affect change. We had member hours to complete that year. Eight, to be exact. Most years, my mother, sister, and I would split the hours to save time. However, it would seem that this year, I was to finish the hours myself. And so I found myself that day, crouched in a field on a hot summer day. And yet that day, I experienced the strangest phenomenon; time did not go by any sooner, but I ceased to perceive its passage. I began immersed in that singular task of plucking rhubarb from the ground. More than anything, the gravity of that single, earthly job became impressed upon me. The unpleasant sensations faded, replaced by the reassuring tickle of water upon the rhubarb leaves. When my mother picked me up at the end of the day, I suspect she examined my facial expression for expected signs of annoyance and frustration. If so, she'd have found none. When I returned home that day, it occurred to me that though I'd been coming to the farm for many years, I knew very little of how it was run. When I looked into it, I learned how it functioned as community supported agriculture. From tomatoes to watermelons to peppers, everything we grew was organic, and went back to the community. Every week, our members received large quantities of vegetables and fruits. The surplus was either sold at a local farmers market, or donated to the County Food Bank. When asked to recount why I spent three summers at this farm, this experience always comes to mind. It's simple, localized solutions to large problems that have the biggest impact. While I still may not always eat my vegetables, I certainly know where they come from. And that's a start. ",
