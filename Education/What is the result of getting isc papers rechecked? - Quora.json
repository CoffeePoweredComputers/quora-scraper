            "answer_text": "My Friend, Not everyone will give you the same answer, I searched for this before sending my papers for recheck. Their is no simple answer to your question , I got 72 where I expected above 90 for sure but when I asked people if I should send the paper for recheck but majority said I should not their won't be any change. But you know sometimes you have to something for satisfaction so that later on you don't regret not sending it. I thought doing something was better than doing nothing so I sent my papers for recheck. It might or might not increase but atleast I will know I tried. If you are not satisfied with your marks do send your papers for recheck. You never know what might surprise you. Edit 1- My marks were not changed. Sorry for such late response . I have not been using Quora for some time now. ",
