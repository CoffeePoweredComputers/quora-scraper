            "answer_text": "Money, but not just money. It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. Our educational system is basically funded through local property taxes. If you are in a district with a very strong tax base you have not just money, but also parents who tend to be well educated and highly involved. That\u2019s a significant advantage over districts with a much less valuable tax base. The value of your real property correlates pretty closely to class, education and other relevant factors. Pretty much all the ills of our K-12 system go back to that. We\u2019ve had many very poorly thought out innovations such as charter schools that all skip around this core matter. Charters usually make the situation worse by cannibalizing the existing lack of resources. That they end up with mostly mediocre results isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is that you are squeezing an already dry lemon and expecting more juice. A funding model that separated or compensated for the dependency on property taxes along with some basic minimums for teacher salaries, standards for things like class sizes and more capital investment would go a long, long way. The wealthier districts would still do better at the end of the process but you would see some real improvement. Finland leads the pack right now by focusing not on excellence but equity. Seems to work, but you can\u2019t have either equity or excellence when you have a funding picture based on real property on the local level. ",

            "answer_text": "What our education system lacks most is knowledge, specifically a respect for the value of knowing things and transmitting that knowledge to the next generation. Built into our educational standards, our teaching practices, and the curriculum foisted upon college Education students is a prejudice against teaching children discrete facts. Since the 1910s, educational progressives have forced an \u201ceverything but knowledge\u201d prejudice into the curriculum of American schools. The idea in the 1910s was \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter what a student knows since he can just go to the library and look it up.\u201d In the 2000s, that\u2019s become \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what a student knows because he can just go online and look it up.\u201d Those promoting the anti-knowledge philosophy today act like this is a completely new and revolutionary idea, not an idea that\u2019s been failing for close to a century. And to the degree that knowledge is tolerated within the school system, it\u2019s certainly not the job of the teacher to provide that knowledge, as this poster illustrates.  What the educational establishment directly opposes is teachers knowing things and transmitting that knowledge is not valuable. The only value comes from the teaching creating an environment where the student constructs that the knowledge from scratch.  If you really think the second way of doing things is better, let me ask you a question. If you wanted to learn Brazilian Jujitsu, would you prefer to take a class from Royce Gracie\u2026  \u2026or would you rather go in the backyard with your cousin and construct your own knowledge of grappling?  Now this anti knowledge educational establishment often tout such noble goals as critical thinking or problem solving. Here\u2019s the problem with that, something the deans of progressive education could not have known when Woodrow Wilson was president. Neuroscience has been able to find no evidence that non-domain specific critical thinking exists. Every critical thinking task is an application of knowledge task. If you don\u2019t have knowledge, you have nothing to think critically about. And you can forget about that whole \u201clook it up on the -blank-\u201d trope that\u2019s floated around in one form or another for the last century. Without knowledge firmly embedded in long term storage in the brain, a person won\u2019t know where to start looking up information or have any basis to know whether that information even makes sense. It takes knowledge for a person to even be aware of what they don\u2019t know. One of the problems with that is that a lot of \u201cprofessionals\u201d educated in educational theory lack REAL KNOWLEDGE. Once I was talking to a colleague about the movie Pearl Harbor. My colleague, who as BA and MA degrees in education, admitted to not knowing what happened at Pearl Harbor. When I tried to explain it he asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t we drop the atom bomb on Pearl Harbor?\u201d So at that point I felt obliged to explain the timeline of WWII. Then he asked me \u201cWhere do you get the picture of the little Japanese girl with her clothes burned off?\u201d He was referring to a famous picture from Vietnam. In all honesty, this individual is far from being the most ignorant professional educator I\u2019ve met. The two biggest challenges to the MOST IMPORTANT educational reform we could make are (a) the anti-knowledge educational establishment holds only it\u2019s philosophical beliefs with a religious fervor. (2) If we went to a knowledge based curriculum, you\u2019d have a lot of people with BA, MA and Ed.D degrees who lack even basic knowledge about history, science, literature and art. How can they pass on knowledge when they don\u2019t have. The prejudice against the transmission of knowledge is directly harming the reading comprehension skills of children. Knowledge is absolutely essential for reading comprehension. For example, researchers gave a difficult reading passage to 2 groups of students: advanced readers and struggling readers. You\u2019d expect the advanced readers to do better, but the reading passage was about baseball. The gifted kids weren\u2019t baseball fans, but the kids with learning disabilities were fans of the game. In this case the struggling readers did decisively better than the Brainiacs. Why? Because their background knowledge to comprehend even a difficult reading passage. And without background knowledge, even gifted learners struggled. The fact that we\u2019ve so dismissed knowledge creates a two tiered system. Middle and upper class kids are presented with knowledge out of school and succeed in school. Poor kids enter school without such knowledge and fall further behind. Our current system where knowledge is dismissed at \u201cfactoids\u201d and \u201ctrivia\u201d is directly harming our students.
