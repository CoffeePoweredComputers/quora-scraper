            "answer_text": "Yup,there is a lot in ocean all you need to find is an island that suits you. There are lot of people who didn't succeed at college education but they explore and find out the things that interest them and try to make their career in that direction. College education really sucks. There are many subjects that have only one use that is to complete credits and get degree and many people feel useless to study these subjects and hence suck at this. I want to make it clear with an example of one of my close friend. When he was in 2nd year he was having 5 arrears and cgpa less than 5,but he was excellent web developer and thus was able to complete 3 internships by the end of second year.While on the other side rest of his batchmates were not able to get an internship by the end of third year. he just focus on his skills and try to harness them and develop a lot of industrial experience . he also do freelancing and thus able to manage all his expenses and even save few. He is currently earning more than what most of freshers have package by MNC. he is currently in 4th year an has open his start up in which he manage web related problems and serve web related technologies . All I want to say is if you are not good at sitting for hours and wasting your time go out explore and find your interest and try to excel in that. I can give some suggestions but they might or might not suits you 1. Web and Android Development - Just learn from any good web course , one is at Udemy and start practicing by making projects and start freelancing by doing projects at sites like Freelancer, Upwork, if you become good at it you can make good money2. If you are good writer , then start blogging and when it become decent popular then try for google adsense.3. if you can afford to study in US then try for dev bootcamp, thay give rigorous training in web and related stuff and there average salaries that developers get is around 75000 dollars . Just explore web, try to find your interest and start working on it ",
