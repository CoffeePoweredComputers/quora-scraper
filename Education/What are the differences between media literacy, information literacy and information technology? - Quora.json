            "answer_text": "Being \u201cliterate\u201d in media use is in basic terms how much a person truly understands about the chosen form of media they most use. If you understand that news organizations do what\u2019s called \u201cagenda-setting\u201d you know that the gatekeepers of those information outlets (whether in print or online) decide what kind of messages will be delivered even up to and including how the messages are structured. If you believe them to be impartial and don\u2019t really understand the context, you are not fully media literate. Information literacy is based on content analysis. How much of what the writer is trying to say do you understand? Think about all those tests you took as a kid for scores on \u201creading comprehension.\u201d If you are very literate in your ability to analyze the meaning behind the information you receive you would possess a high degree of comprehension. In that case, distinguish between what is true and what is propaganda (as an example). Information technology is how information is managed using machine knowledge, algorithms, and software platforms that compute the information in manageable bits and bytes. It also includes the server technology and architecture infrastructure that allows different programs to communicate with each other even though some code may be wildly different across a platform. It isn\u2019t really related to communication theory in any way because it requires intervention by a third source and is generally seen as a mathematical construct. Only the first two things are communication-related theories used for public relations, marketing, and writing. Information technology is really unrelated.

            "answer_text": "It seems that Wikipedia answers are available for all these topics. To summarize, however, we can start with Information literacy. It starts with an ability to understand when information is needed, or when more- or more correct -information is needed, to solve a problem - sometimes even understanding that there is a problem. This is an essential skill in a more and more complex world. In a way Media literacy is a subset of this. It is an ability to filter and assess the value of the information coming through TV, newspapers, internet, books, etc. To do this, a person has to have a solid Information literacy capability. These two do not necessarily have nothing to do with Information technology, and both were needed much earlier in history than any computers existed. Propaganda and false news have always existed. Modern technology just makes everything so much easier to access and consume. Information technology is a wide concept referring to all (modern) technologies used for acquiring, storing, manipulating, and delivering data, ie. building information systems. The main value comes from the ability of information systems to complement data manipulation capabilities of us humans. ",
