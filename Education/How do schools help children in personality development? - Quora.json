            "answer_text": "usually, it depends on the school\u2019s faculty. if the faculty is professional then school defiantly will help to the improvement of children in personality development. but there is a question is that \u201cHow do schools help children in personality development? let see some important critical analysis. Schools are the second platform for children. The way in which their personalities would depends not only on the parental upbringing but also on the way it grows them lived in their school lives. Imparting just the bookish knowledge makes the student dumb and insecure for challenging the competitive world. Steps are being taken in some private and missionary schools, but reaching out to every corner of the country is a matter of concern. Now the question arises that what reforms can be brought about to inculcate the triggering of child personality development at school. First, one needs to realise the apparent meaning of child personality development. Personality means the set of qualities which makes a person distinct from the other. When such qualities emerge in the growing age of children, I know it as child personality development. Now when the pace of the world is advancing, it has become very crucial to make your child stand out from the rest and be unique. So how can this be achieved? The answer is simple. It has got to be worked out at the root level to bring the best out of them. Therefore, the development of a child in a way he/she becomes socially, morally, and ethically progressive is the need of the hour. How schools respond to this context matters a lot. The 2nd most important factor is that like this see below Social Skills He's got straight A's across the board. But without some healthy social skills, your youngster won't make it through his first job interview, and he'll probably be going stag when prom night rolls around. The school plays an important role in helping children learn to interact positively with their peers and teachers. They learn about healthy relationship skills and develop them further through interactions, both in the classroom and on the playground. According to Shere, \"The emotional and social maturity of a child provides the important underpinnings for child development in all other areas. When educators ignore children's emotional and social development, this can often lead to adults who are very academically gifted but who struggle in their daily lives because of lack of self-esteem and/or social skills.\" I think this is not an appropriate answer for this question but I will edit it whenever I get the right content. thank so much for reading.
