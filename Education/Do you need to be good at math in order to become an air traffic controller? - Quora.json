            "answer_text": "No, but the type of people who make good controllers are often the type of people who are pretty good at mental arithmetic and such like. Its definitely a job which requires \u201cbrain power\u201d and concentration. In ATC training, there is a little maths, but it\u2019s high school level. In operation, controllers don\u2019t use maths in their day to day work. Speed/time calculations are often cited as an example of maths being used by controllers, but with experience a controller is using memory rather than calculating. For example - a flight at a groundspeed of 300 knots will cover 5 miles in a minute, the controller will use this knowledge to predict it\u2019s future position relative to another aircraft. He/she is not really doing the arithmetic in their head, they are recalling the results from previous experience. ",

You don\u2019t need to know how to solve some calculus equation or anything like that. One of the most important attributes for an Air Traffic Controller is to have very good spatial thinking. ",

Quantitative stuff involves a numerical answer; a controller usually has no time or need for a calculator...As Max said, the big picture without any numbers, is best. Two different types of math...
