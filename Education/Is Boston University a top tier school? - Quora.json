            "answer_text": "If not top tier than right after them. It is usually somewhere around 39-42 on US News and World Reports. You will find a good mix of kids coming from a diverse background. The campus is thriving and beautiful in a world class city. Very tough to get into any of the top schools at this point, even other Boston area schools like Boston College or Northeastern, Brandeis or Tufts, and goes without saying MIT and Harvard. BU has a better reputation worldwide than most of the others, but US News and World Reports actually has Brandeis tied with BU and Boston College ahead. MIT and Harvard and Tufts are ranked higher. Based on 2021 rankings Northeastern is below at 49. But during Covid-19 Boston University is testing kids twice per week and has in person classes and seem to be doing everything in their power to keep the kids safe. Good luck to you in your decision to apply! ",
