            "answer_text": "It\u2019s rather stressful, as many have observed here. Much of the stress comes from the demands on your time outside school hours, grading tests, planning lessons and in many cases running extracurricular activities. You can find yourself very easily in a state of mind where you\u2019re constantly worried about your students\u2019 performance, even at home. The classroom itself is a major component of stress; you have no idea, unless you\u2019ve ever taught,how noisy a group of thirty 14-to-18 year-olds confined in a room can be. You have no idea how draining it is when your job is to keep them quiet and focused for 90 minutes at a time. In the summertime, when I was a kid, my mom would bring home boxes of those popsicles with the two sticks that came in a box in cherry, grape and orange. I developed a habit of sucking the juice out of the popsicle until it turned white before I started munching on it. After a day of teaching, I felt like that popsicle. The juice sucked out of me, every single day. If you work a physical job, you know what being bone-tired is, but this is different. An entire day of mostly intrapersonal conflict, fighting with kids over their conduct in class, drains you in a way you cannot imagine unless you\u2019ve done it. All day long. You have a kind of glow if you\u2019ve worked physically hard all day, a feeling of satisfaction like you\u2019ve earned the right to be at rest. If you\u2019ve taught young people all day, you feel like a sickly ghost of yourself. There were times when I sat back down at my desk after the last student had left the last class and went instantly to sleep in my chair. Politically speaking: If you\u2019re a woman, frankly, you might feel more comfortable in a school than I did. Even at the high school level, teachers are mostly women and the culture is largely feminine. If you\u2019re a man, be a coach or assistant coach of a \u201cprestige\u201d sport like football or basketball or a P.E. teacher. You can be the funny clueless jock. The coaches hang together and sit at the same table at all the faculty meetings. I was neither a woman nor a coach, and so I was basically by myself. There were moments when you got the \u201caha\u201d moment from a student and you felt you\u2019d done your job, but those weren\u2019t as plentiful as you might imagine. Sometimes the students themselves would come up to you and tell you how much you meant to them, but again, not terribly often. Mostly it was sitting with a bunch of tests you\u2019d spent five hours grading on which the median score was \u201c40\u201d and wondering whether you should just curve the tests and move forward (less work for you), or whether you should give them the score they earned and reteach and retest the material( much more work for you; in addition to all the time spent grading and making a new test, you\u2019ll fall behind in the material, plus they\u2019ll probably fail the new test as well.) Better curve the test and move on. The students won\u2019t learn any accountability, but you won\u2019t have to pull an all-nighter grading the retake and you\u2019ll be able to spend some time with your family, or have a little time to yourself if you don\u2019t have one. I spent 20 years teaching high school math, and most of that time I wished fervently to quit and do something else. I felt like I had to keep going though , especially after I married and started having kids. I also felt trapped by having to do a job that justified my college degree, even though most of the jobs I daydreamed about doing were more blue- collar in nature. Eventually I quit and trained to be a package delivery driver for a national delivery service. It\u2019s stressful, but the nature of the stress is so different and it\u2019s much more tolerable. I don\u2019t have as much time off , but free summers really didn\u2019t make up for being a shell of myself for 10 months out of the year. Society needs good, dedicated teachers who know what it\u2019s all about and want to do it anyway. God bless people who are up to the task, but it just wasn\u2019t me. I\u2019m very thankful I realized it and made a change while I still had some good working years left. ",

            "answer_text": "Teaching high school students is a pretty amazing career. It can be emotionally and physically exhausting at times, but it is worth it. I work with kids from all levels of socio economic status, intellectual and physical abilities, and maturity. I have taught children who were descendants of Mayflower pilgrims as well as students who had just arrived in this country. They are all unique and wonderful in their own rights. As a result of teaching these children, I have developed a better sense of humanity. I feel more connected to the world, to our past, present, and future. Sure, there have been students who pushed my buttons, but they have made me a better person. I have learned how to handle all kinds of frustrations, as a result. I recently saw a teacher who had mentored me when I first started out. After speaking with him for a few minutes, he said that he could tell I was having fun teaching. It is so true. I learn as much from my classes as they learn from me, even if we aren't learning the same things. They will come in and ask me about current events, whether local, national, or global. Sometimes, I am not aware yet, so I learn about what is happening. They love this. They are capable of thinking about ideas at a much deeper level than ever before. Teaching high school keeps me on my toes. I have to be ready for the myriad of problems faced by teens as they negotiate the shift from childhood to adulthood, and I need to make sure I do this respectfully. If I am dismissive of their problems, just because I know that they are typical teen problems, I will lose them. I love teaching high school because the students aren't afraid to challenge me if they think I am wrong. I have no problem offering them the opportunity to prove it. I would never want to spread misinformation. High school students are capable of so much. I love being a part of helping them discover that. ",
