            "answer_text": "8 Reasons Why Online Education is Better than Traditional TRISH SAMMER Updated on April 24, 2020 Is an online education equivalent to an on-campus education? In a lot of cases, yes. In fact, there\u2019s good evidence that online education has some significant advantages to the classroom experience\u2014and some of them may surprise you. 1. You're not bound by geography Huge strides in technology have made a college education more accessible than ever. With a computer and Internet access, the entirety of the educational world can be yours as long as you have Internet access, no matter where you live. Get Free Information For Your Degree That\u2019s hardly an exaggeration when you consider that for the past few years, highly prestigious schools, such as Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, have been offering full, non-credit courses of study online for free through something called MOOCs (which stands for massive open online course). MOOCs generally have the same professors and the same study material you\u2019d get if you were attending the university in-person. It was probably inevitable that schools would begin wanting to monetize all of the material they were providing online. In 2013, Georgia Tech became the first school to create a MOOC-based degree program. The University of Illinois followed suit two years later. Now, more than 30 brick-and-mortar schools offer MOOC-based degrees, through partnerships with tech-ed companies like Coursera, edX, and Udacity. But MOOCs are only the tip of the online-learning iceberg. Digital and traditional institutions are also perfecting more-intimate online learning options, with smaller class sizes and more one-to-one professor-to-student interactions. Online degree options abound and if you can't find the offering you want at a local university, you can probably find it at another school. So whether you\u2019re looking to earn your degree to go nab a 9-to-5, or you\u2019re looking to study the stars with the world\u2019s top astronomers, you can probably find what you\u2019re looking for online. 2. Online learning may be more engaging than classroom learning A recent article in Forbes offers some insight into the state of online learning. Researchers have begun diving into how efficient online learning is compared to classroom education. So far, the results have been promising. A study from California State University in San Bernadino found that two different sets of students\u2014one group who studied online and the other who went to class\u2014who received the same instruction from the same professor fared equally well in terms of performance. However, the study revealed that online students were less intimidated about participating, and that there was a higher-quality of interaction between students and the professor. In addition, the Forbes article notes online classes are more likely to present material in attention-grabbing, multimedia formats that may be better suited to today\u2019s students. The upshot: Educators have long known that different people take in information in different ways, but educational methods have struggled to adapt. If you're someone whose eyes glaze over during a classroom lecture, you may find that you respond better to online learning approaches. 3. Feedback is faster and more frequent Believe it or not, online learners may actually have more contact with their educators than classroom learners. Online students are generally asked to complete more-frequent assessments so that professors can monitor their competence. Because of this, learning gaps can be identified and addressed faster, rather than allowing a struggling student to slip through the cracks until exam time. Remember, this isn't just about GPAs. When you're paying thousands of dollars for an education, you don't want to hide in the back corner of the classroom. You want to ensure you understand the course material so you can apply it later. 4. Online college can be a cheaper way to earn your bachelor's or master's degree What\u2019s the biggest difference between online and traditional school? The campus, obviously. If you attend a regular college, you\u2019re probably going to spend several thousand dollars a year on room and board, as well as transportation. Online college removes all of those expenses from the equation, effectively yielding you a five-figure discount during the course of your studies. Score! 5. You may incur a lot less student loan debt In addition to not having to pay for room and board and commuting, online study may reduce your costs in another extremely significant way. Most online programs are structured around the idea that students are employed, and possibly employed full-time. Being able to continue working while going to school means that you may have to take on less student loan debt. Smaller student loans means you\u2019ll be paying less student loan interest. When you consider that most people take close to 20 years to pay off their student loan debt, reducing your total debt load is one of the most-important strategies you can adopt. Your future self will thank you. 6. You have more control over your schedule Absenteeism and scheduling conflicts are virtually removed from the online learning equation. While some programs may require participation in online lectures at certain times, those same lectures are generally archived for later reference. Because online learning is more flexible than classroom-based learning, students can work through material at their own pace. People who need more time to grasp a concept can take it. People who want to work faster may do so. Schedule flexibility is also a huge asset for people who work full-time or who have childcare responsibilities that would interfere with regular campus attendance. Just think about it\u2014the single mom whose babysitter canceled at the last minute would be out of luck with traditional learning. With online education, she can still attend class with the assurance that her child is being care for. 7. The online classroom is good preparation for a changing workforce Getting comfortable with technology is an excellent side benefit to online education. As technology advances, workforces are become increasingly distributed. Whether you\u2019re working with someone across the state or across the world, becoming adept at technology for video conferencing, messaging, aggregating information, and collaborating is a skill set that you're likely to find a need for. 8. Online learning is getting a good reputation Academics have seen the value in online education for quite some time. A 2012 study from Babson/College Board showed that 77% of academic leaders believed that online education offerings were just as good, if not better, than classroom-based educational offerings. Employers are also getting that message. A recent article in U.S. News & World Report shows that more hiring managers are seeing the value in online degrees, as long as they come from properly accredited institutions.

Our prediction about the future of online college Online college options are going to continue to increase in popularity as costs get lower (thanks to better technology) and quality of instruction continues to evolve and improve. Within the next generation, online learning will become more of a norm and less of a novelty.

            "answer_text": "Technological progress feeds on itself. Think about it; man took ages to move from a cart to a car, but just a few decades to make the transition from cars to space. This exponential growth has ensured that no aspect of our life remains untouched by technology. And so is the case with education. Today, the advent of online education has made all the information available at the click of a button. What started out as a handful of institutes or classes uploading some of their study materials or tests onto the web, has now culminated into websites offering a plethora of courses spanning across almost every subject under the sun. It\u2019s a shame though, that many remain unaware of the potential of online education and write it off as another of those technological inventions which provided the initial spark, but not the ultimate \u2018bang\u2019. Is it really so? Let\u2019s delve into online education a little bit more. Perks of Online Education Online education, like any other technology, comes with its share of perks. There\u2019s something uniquely compelling about it, which is drawing in more and more people from all around the globe. Without a doubt, the best feature of online education is the power to control the pace of your learning. It is obvious that the learning ability of individual children was not \u2018normalized\u2019 over an entire generation of kids and then re-distributed to them. Some among them are slow-learners, while others pick up stuff too quickly. Sadly, most of the schools in our country do not acknowledge this and eventually end up giving kids inferiority or superiority complexes. Freedom and Independence Online education lets you take things at your leisurely pace and \u2018learn\u2019 things rather than cram them. Besides, you are free to choose the timings of your study. If your favorite movie is coming up some afternoon, you can always do your tutorials in the morning or the next day. Also, no iron-clad rules: pauses are allowed, and so are rewinds and replays. If you don\u2019t understand something once, you can always go back and watch the same thing twice, or a multiple number of times till you get it right. There\u2019s none of the fear associated with either a short-tempered and impatient teacher/professor or a bunch of giggling classmates who\u2019ll shoot contemptible looks to you for asking to repeat a particular concept in the class. So, just sit back and immerse yourself in a truly unique learning experience. Better Study Experience Next, comes the use of animation. If used properly, it plays a huge role in accelerating and enhancing the learning process. Animation can develop your 3D imagination very easily. And there\u2019s no way a drawing on a textbook or diagram on a blackboard can be as elucidating as a simple animation. If you can imagine stuff, the animation will give wings to your thought process. All this and even more is incorporated into online education these days. This will enrich your educational experience, and entice you in the intricate details of the subject rather than bluntly give you the rude facts and superficial knowledge. Saves Travelling Time Online education does not involve any travelling. You can just sit in your home and learn. When you have the choice to study when you want, you\u2019re bound to level up in terms of your productivity. Also, there is none of the tiredness and stress that comes with travelling. In many cases, students have to leave home and move to other cities for the sake of studies. Online education ensures that you get similar quality of studies right in the comfort zone of your home. No need to go chasing the big names in education halfway around the country; they are reaching out to you via online education! Clears Doubts Instantly! Let\u2019s assume that you are preparing for a competitive examination. You get stuck in the middle of the night with a problem that twists and turns on itself, causing you to tear your hair out in frustration. What do you do now? The answer is just a chat away. Online education-based startups and companies these days hire IITians and MBBS students for doubt clearance at any level. The working of it is fairly easy: you come online on the chat interface, ask your doubts, and the other party will answer it on the chat almost immediately. Simple, isn\u2019t it? The IITians, being nocturnal creatures, will be available for help during most of the day, and throughout the night. It\u2019s imperative that doubts need to be quelled as soon as they arise. Otherwise, they\u2019ll stay in your brain, meddle with other doubts and wreak havoc on your concepts. Oh, and yes: This is NOT only for those who are preparing for competitive exams. Similar interfaces are also available for all exam-giving students, right from standard 4th to Board examinations to JEE and NEET. These \u2018chat-a-doubt\u2019 things will ensure that your questions are answered in the best way, and possibly by those whose ranks you aspire to join. Easy on the Pocket! Lastly, somewhat of a practical point: online education is also cheaper as compared to other means of education. While being a spendthrift on education does seem a downright crime, there\u2019s no harm if what is offered on a cheaper palette is of the best possible quality. And with the most sought-after schools, colleges and coaching classes turning to the internet for expanding their reach, quality hardly remains an issue. Online education is vibrant and growing in the ever-warm embrace that our country offers to technology. For all we know, it may become the next big thing thrown up in the fast-growing education field! The existing facts and figures certainly point to this happening somewhere down the line. So, people, open up your minds to the variety of options and do not swat unique ideas aside like gnats. Rather explore them, look them up and try them out; who knows what gem of an idea might come as the handiest for you? Still confused whether to go for the conventional offline coaching or the time- and money-saving online education?
