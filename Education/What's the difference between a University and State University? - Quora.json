            "answer_text": "In the United States there are private universities and public universities. The public universities usually are state (meaning, \u2018owned\u2019 and run by the particular state), but there are a few public city universities (such as City University of New York, in New York City). The qualities within private and within public/state range in quality. Top private universities include Harvard, Yale, Stanford M.I.T., Cal Tech, while top public/state universities include Universities of California-Berkeley, U of Michigan, U of Virginia, U of Texas at Austin. All top notch schools, but there are lesser private and state/public universities. The ones I just mentioned are \u2018elite\u2019 ones. I went to both an \u2018elite\u2019 state school (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and \u2018elite\u2019 private university (Northwestern University) and thought the education and competition was similar. However, the U of Wisconsin was huge, with TONS of students. If you want a small school experience, don\u2019t go to a major state school. As state universities are designed to educate the public, they are usually much larger (more students) than private universities and you\u2019ll get more \u2018normal\u2019 people. ",
