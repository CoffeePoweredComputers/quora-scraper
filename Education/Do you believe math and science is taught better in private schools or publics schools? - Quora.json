            "answer_text": "Obviously this question cannot be answered in general. If you do not fund public schools at all, teaching there will not happen, so private schools win by default. But in Poland it seems the public high schools have an edge. At higher levels, the importance of what students teach themselves, and how they motivate each other, is increasingly important. The feedback loop between teachers and students is very important in STEM, good students make for good teachers, and for a rich learning and motivational experience for everyone. The STEM talent is less correlated with wealth of the parents. So if the public school system provides for \u201ctalent-selected students\u201d schools, those are better from the private ones. Private schools have less of a pool to select from. In a private school, probably motivation to become rich can be kept high easier, among students. So such schools might (I do not know either way) provide a better environment for future lawyers and such. It is harder in the STEM fields. But note that I was writing about the high-achievers stratum. For a youth with below average talent, admission to public schools with good teachers can be (competitive admission) impossible. Private schools can provide a safe backup. ",
