            "answer_text": "Its pretty simple.Total Students = 40 Absent = 4 Students Present = 40 - 4 = 36Now Coming to calculating percentage, always remember that Numerator will always be the term whose percentage is to be found and the denominator will be the total commodity available. And the resultant is to be multiplied by 100. therefore, percentage of students present = 36/40 x 100 Simplifying the above term = 9/10 x 100 = 90% Similarly % of absent students = 4/40 x 100 = 10%.Hope it helps.
