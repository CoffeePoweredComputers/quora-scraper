            "answer_text": "If you look after the trend, it is pretty easy to predict the rank range in which you should score in order to get CSE in NITK. So before i show you the trends of year 2018 and earlier, let me tell you things that counts while deciding the cutoff for a branch- Total number of applications received for the admission in the instituteTotal number of candidates appearing for the JEE Main examNumber of B.Tech seats availableThe difficulty level of the JEE Main 2019 examPrevious years\u2019 cutoff trends.No of rounds in which counselling is to be concludedSince the toughness of question paper is kept more or less the same, after 2017 paper, so yes one can rely on the previous trends while doing the choice filling but this time exam pattern were different and also that EWS thing also gonna play a significant role here so this year\u2019s cutoff may follow the trend or can also be a trend setter. It's gonna be all new for every one. Now let's have a look over previous years cutoff, for general category. Year State OR CR No of rounds of counselling 2016 HS 329 3130 6 2016 OS 266 1246 2017 HS 306 5173 7 2017 OS 666 2340 2018 HS 928 3928 7 2018 OS 278 1767 ( I think Quora should have a table feature in its editor :p). Credit of low cutoff in 2017 goes to that years paper, simplest in the history of JEE Mains. So by the data analysis of above trend, one can easily set a bar of 1500-1700 rank for OS and 3500 rank for HS in order to get a seat in CSE branch. Ranking of NITK from 2016\u20132018 has also improved. That's all from my side, for other categories google it out. Good luck\u2026\u2026you have plenty of time. ",
