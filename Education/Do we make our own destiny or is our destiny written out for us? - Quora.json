            "answer_text": "Question: Are we fated to do or become something no matter what or do we make our own fate? God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God has enabled people to choose their own destinations. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. The Muslim scholars who teach that the fate of people had been determined before they were born and before they had any chance to do good or bad are mistaken; they ignore the basic Qur\u2019an verses like 4:147, 4:152, 6:48, 6:54, 17:15, 45:15,43:72, 16:35, 19:63, 19:76, 20:112, 34:50, 37:39, 39:41, 39:70, 40:17, 47:17, 55:60, 56:24, and 18:107 The verses teach that God does not predestine people\u2019s fate but gives them the choice either to obey and do good deeds or to rebel and do evil deeds; there is no punishment for those who choose to obey and to thank God. The Muslim scholars who teach that Islam is the only true religion are mistaken; they have been ordered to believe in what has been revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets as taught in Qur\u2019an verses 3:84, 4:136, 4:152 and 42:13 Prophets did not teach predestination. Jesus did not teach predestination or predetermination. The only exceptions are the teachings of Paul who was not educated by Jesus and who taught the distorted teachings of predestination, original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law. The teachings of predestination were taught by Paul in Romans 8 , Ephesians 1, and 1 Corinthians 2:7 The distorted teachings of predestination and election of Augustine and Calvin are not based on the teachings of Jesus but are based on the wrong teachings of Paul. Jesus did not teach that a man is justified according to God\u2019s plan or by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses. Bad scholars do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and teach the attractive ones \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy with such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11. Most Christians do not follow the strict teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018We have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9 Most Christians do not follow the strict teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most Christians believe that Jesus\u2019 death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. But Jesus, like all other prophets, taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. No sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Matthew 25:31-45, Luke 15:11-32, and Luke 6:36-37 https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-say-and-feel-about-Jesus-Christ-and-his-atonement/answer/Sabri-Shahin The wrong teachings about predestination, original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law were taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus. How can you validate my claims? The best advice is to ask God to guide us to the truth. The door is open for everyone to experience divine intervention The wise and merciful father keeps his door open for his children God has more wisdom and mercy than any wise merciful father People can communicate with God at any time Prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have urged us to ask God and taught that God answers the prayers of the obedient believer. Example verses are: Psalm 107:28-30, Psalm 18:6, Psalm 145:18, 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 58:9 Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Luke 6:27-28, James 4:2, Qur\u2019an 2:186, Qur\u2019an 40:60 Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. I have spent years wondering about what the purpose of life is. I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. I had some doubts about the teachings of a certain teacher, I have prayed to God to guide me to the truth I saw in a very clear dream that teacher in a form of a criminal prisoner, has committed evil, waiting for his trial. In another dream I saw a wolf hiding after attacking sheep; I understood that message as the bad teacher who try to mislead people by the bad teachings as Jesus explained in Matthew 7:15-20 \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d. I also remembered the Parable of the Weeds in which Jesus warned us about the enemy who insert false teachings into the scripture in Matthew 13:24-43 \u2018an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat\u2019 Pray and ask God to guide you about the teacher who claims that God does not exist; you will see him in a bad image Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who teaches that Jesus is God Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who claims that God tests us in this life and will reward us according to our obedience and good deeds Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who taught original sin, atonement, salvation not based on obedience but taught free salvation by a savior to die for our sins Again, do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. Isaiah 58:9 \u2018Then you will call, and God will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm reminded of my own article published in the English monthly, \"Gyan Vitaranam\" of Nov, 2014. Here it goes: FATE OR FREE-WILL, THAT\u2019S THE QUESTION, Life is like a game of cards. The hand you are dealt is destiny; the way you play it is free-will. Your personality, physical and mental, you are born with, and the environment, your familial, cultural and financial, you are born into, make up your fate. This is your initial deposit in the account of your life. A person is defined by the choices he makes on a day-to-day basis and by the actions he takes in response to the stimuli of the world around him. Essentially, an individual is determined by the degree to which he exercises his own free-will. There is a stillness and permanence about the past; it changes not and has solidity, like a statue cast in bronze or marble. The present is the product of the past. The past has determined the present. And the future is the product-to-be of the present. The great philosopher-poet Sri Aurobindo has a beautiful phrase for the present moment: \"the pure and virgin moment---that razor\u2019s edge of time and existence which divides the past from future\". The present is yet unlived and unspoilt, and therefore, is very much changeable. Where there is a will, there is a way. Here your free-will comes in. You can change the present the way you want, and consequently, the future too, for the future, as said earlier, is the outcome of the present. Positive thinking has an effective role to play. It has been proved that most of us have been living far below our potential. We have to analyze and assess our merits and demerits, without bias and with a clinical precision. Then we have to start developing and making optimal utility of our merits. If we move ahead with a passion and determination, none can stop us except our own negativity and habitual lethargy. Lots of folks mistake their bad management of life for destiny. But positive thinking has its own limits which our motivational speakers don\u2019t concede, at least in public. Now-a-days, their stereotypes are ubiquitous and they keep dishing out, day in and day out, their worn-out fables, parables and platitudes. Imagine a hen tied to a post with a metre-length rope. The hen is no doubt is bound and its freedom of movement is apparently curtailed. All the same, it can move as freely as it wants within the circle described by the radius of a metre. If it rues that it is fettered and becomes disheartened that it cannot move, it forgoes its freedom of movement even within that circle. Positive thinking and motivation help it to make maximum utility of the available freedom of movement. But no amount of inspirational talk can make it get beyond the circle. We can create our own destiny and enjoy living to the limits of our potential. Each of us is unique. It has been found that the average person only employs a small per cent-age of his latent abilities. He has various physical and mental resources which he habitually fails to use. You and I have such resources. Evaluate your strengths and weaknesses. Then, start building on your strengths and discover how many talents and abilities you have that you didn\u2019t even imagine you had. If once we begin putting them to optimal use, we will be changing our otherwise statuesque fate and fulfilling our possible destiny with an informed free-will, and that too, with a vengeance! This is the miracle of life, this celebration\u2014living and enjoying the good life to the limits of one\u2019s IQ and EQ! ",

            "answer_text": "From the scientific point of view everything is already decided, there is nothing that you can do, there is nothing as free will, it is a myth.  Even Bhagwad geetha and Ramana maharishi the great philosopher, saint, say everything is already done and we are merely browsing through the pages of time. There is nothing we can do. They also say, there is no doer but it is illusion that makes us think we are doing. If all these 3 sources are true, the whole world, our entire history is a joke.  We have never done anything, we were never the doers.  Ah hmmm, I don't want believe these 3 sources, they may be wrong. I may be right, I think, there may be a destiny, but we can change it any time. See there is this glass wall, I am trying to break it with a stone.It is obvious, in another few minutes I am about to throw this stone with all my power and this glass wall is about to break.  But it never happened as planned because someone came in between and took the hit, that was completely unexpected. So there are two things here.1. May be I am unable to predict the future accurately, so I falsely assume there is no destiny and I consider the reality to be dynamic, but actually it is static.  2. May be there is something dynamic which not even science and even the great philosophers can understand, which is why we can never predict anything accurately.  So the reality is dynamic. Who knows, may be the universe is playing through us and making us think \"we think\" and we \"act\" as per \"our\" thinking.  ",

            "answer_text": "I believe in both fate and that we can create our own destiny. Yes, you have free will even if your destiny is determined. God has a Divine Plan or path for you to follow. You have free will to obey or disobey. God is the perfect gentleman and will not force himself on you. Let me explain. God has a wonderful plan, for our life. What is this plan called DESTINY? A plan that will bring us peace and prosper us. However, you can fight the plan and get off course by disobedience. You have Freewill to make the choice to obey or disobey God\u2019s wisdom. You can die before your appointed Divine time. AFFIRM: Nothing can hinder, nothing can delay the manifestation of the Divine Plan of my life. I am a magnet for everything that is divinely planned.Stop wondering and start knowing. Jeremiah, an Old Testament prophet, said in Jeremiah 1:4-5: The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou comest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.Now, you may not be called to be a prophet like Jeremiah, but just like the Lord had a plan for Jeremiah's life, He has a plan in mind for you. You aren't a mistake going somewhere to happen. You haven't been placed on this earth by chance. Where and when you were born, the parents God gave you, your personality, and everything else about you was orchestrated by God for a specific purpose.Isaiah 14:27 reads, \u201cFor the LORD Almighty has planned, and who can thwart Him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?\u201d The short and the long answer to Isaiah\u2019s rhetorical questions are the same: no one.Jeremiah 29 was written to the Jews in exile, a group of people who were only seeing the low points of God\u2019s plan. Jeremiah reminded them in Jeremiah 29:11, however, that God is always watching over His people. The verse reads, \u201c\u2019For I know the plans I have for you,\u2019 declares the Lord, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u201dGod reveals just enough of the future to increase your dependence on Him. You will never get the whole Divine Plan of your life, in one sitting. You will have to rely on Him to lead you there. Psalms 138:8 the Lord will work out His plans for my life.God\u2019s plan for your life is more like a journey with important destinations and appointments but with a great deal of freedom as to the place and the route of travel.That is the essence of faith. Faith is trusting God to lead you into the future that He promised you, rather than you trying to create your own future by yourself. Faith moves mountains; fear and doubt create them.How your disobedience can bring destruction to the plan: By speaking negativity in your life, you can accidentally get off the Lord\u2019s GPS route of the Divine Plan.You can get off the path of your Divine Plan by disobedience. You can bring destruction into your life by spewing negative words into the Universe. You may not even be aware of the words that you are using. You can accidentally kill yourself by opening the door to Satan by your spoken negative words.Proverbs 18:21 teaches that Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.Job 22:28 states: You will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you;Proverbs 21:31 states: whosoever keeps his mouth and tongue (from negativity) will keep his soul from trouble.The tongue is caged between your teeth and mouth but it can escape and cause destruction. Psalm 141:3 Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips!James 3:13-18 states: Evil behavior of the tongue, comes from \u201cbitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart.\u201d There is a heart-mouth connection. Jesus said, \u201cFor his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart\u201d (Luke 6:45)Imagine this diagram: A bicycle chain connecting heart and mouth. Our mouth is driven by what preoccupies our heart. Bridling our tongue means dealing with our heart first\u2014not merely avoiding blurting out unkind words. I will give you an example of how my tongue got me in trouble. God intervened because it was not my destiny to die at that time. I should have known better but I was CARELESS with my emotions and words. August 2013. I was feeling very low. I was laid off my job. It had been at least a year since working steadily. I had short temp jobs here and there. I had not talked to no one for almost 3 days. I went for a job interview that Monday. I really wanted this job very badly. When the HR guy saw me, he told me the job had been filled. He said the temp agency made a mistake.I was driving in my car back home, crying, I said out loud, \u201cI give up, what is the use, and I feel like dying....\" Remember Life and Death are in the power of your tongue. I did not realize it at the time, but I had just cursed myself. Watch what you passionately say into the Universe. One week later I was going to Popeye\u2019s on a Sunday, and had to make a left turn, in the middle of a busy intersection,Immediately Spirit said to me, \"If you do not want to die, do not turn left until I say so. I said I want to LIVE, Spirit said wait...wait..... wait..... Just then this fool blows through the light, flying, with this big monster truck with the gigantic wheels. I would have been mushed in my little car if I had not obeyed. I could see through the window in the back of this truck. This man was driving however, his head kept going back and forth violently like he was shaking No No, No....Spirit said, \u201cHe is a man possessed. Satan just tried to kill you once again.\u201d Some Christian people do not even think Satan is a real supernatural entity. They believe in the Holy Spirit, yet they do not believe in a demonic spirit. That is strange because there is ALWAYS DUALITY on this earth realm. You will always have light and darkness, sunshine and rain, joy and pain, etc. Just like the Holy Spirit comes so can a demonic spirit come and possess a person. I have seen both Angels and demons. Later, that Saturday, I went to Longhorns to eat. I was coming out of the place and I stopped. This guy who was maybe 10 ft. away was glaring at me. I said, Ewwweeee\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with that guy\u2019s face?His face was scrunched up. It was an ugly face, like a gargoyle or a monster or animal growling. His eyes were vertical not horizontal and they were totally black.(sort of like Devil\u2019s Advocate Movie). Spirit said, \u201c That\u2019s a demon and he is here to report back that you are still alive.\u201d I guess they can sense your energy but do not know how your meat suit looks like. About 1 min. later his girlfriend walks up behind him and touches him and his face pops back to normal in 3 moves/second. I walk to the parking deck and see a man down the way and he is also starring /glaring at me. He has silver aviator glasses on and a plaid red shirt. Spirit says,\u201d That is the second one.\u201d I continue on and get in my car. ",

            "answer_text": "In human life, existence precedes essence. That is, in human consciousness, the conceptual entertainment of unrealized possibility becomes a major factor. This needs unpacking. What we are as human beings is not decided for us by God, by history, by society, by class, or by our personal past. We decide in the act of existing. We may try to flee the radical freedom and responsibility that this places upon us, but such evasion is itself an act of decision and free-will as to what we are. Moreover, there are no pre-established rules that either normatively or factually govern our existence. Each situation is unique. If we choose to apply a rule, that is the choice for which we are responsible. There is no predetermined or preordained end toward which we are directed (rigid teleology). The future is radically open, it is a line in becoming. In other words, it is the note of the Novum, the qualitatively new, which is of the essence of the future to which one is open, and the future has this openness not merely because human decisions are not predetermined, but rather because the radically new, the creative novelty, cannot be anticipated. Furthermore, the human condition is radically contingent and ambiguous. There is no preexistent plan that includes us and assign us a specific role in the scheme of things. We experience ourselves as \u201cthrown\u201d into the world. It is in this situation, marked by contingency and an open future, that we must assume our existential freedom and responsibility for ourselves, for our societies, and for our world with its non-human communities of life. Our actual conscious as well as pre-reflective experience includes making decisions among various possibilities of thought and action. That is to say, we adopt some real possibilities and abandon others. In the present we are causal agents rather than merely the products within the parameters of the past. These experiences are supported by both common sense and phenomenological evidence. If we take seriously these experiences and ideas, we can assert that there is a difference between what may happen and what does happen. That is, there are more possibilities than actualities. Some possibilities for the future are actualised, while some are not. If we accept this thesis, then we can understand our experience moment by moment as the product of the interactions between the actualities of the past and the relevant potentialities in the present. The options we are confronted with offer themselves as pure potentials, not necessities. It is the reality of multiple possibilities that requires freedom and decision making but does not determine what that decision is or will be. Our destiny is freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "What is destiny? It is not every event in a life, and it is not the final outcome of it. What it does is provide a rough draft based on the lessons our spirit has chosen. As our lives are not micromanaged, it is possible that some destined events will not transpire, and they may subsequently be replaced with a new destiny. Only some elements of destiny are set before a spirit takes a lifetime. Others are set as that life unfolds and the choices we make determine our life path. For most of us in today\u2019s world, life holds so many options that it cannot be known, prior to it, what our needs will be. Destiny does not refer to every event in our life. It always includes the lessons chosen by our spirit and usually will include some of our relationships, i.e., parents, children, or spouse. Other possibilities are a major or chronic illness, education and career choices, and any number of life challenges. Do we make our own destiny or is it written out for us? To the extent that our destiny is based on the lessons chosen by our spirit, it is our spirit who designs it, but, as noted above, that is a rough draft. In addition, the Creator adds some aspects of destiny and these will be known by our guardian. So, to some extent our destiny is written, but it is not written in ink, much less in concrete. Our spirit and guardian will attempt to influence and guide us to elements of our destiny (and the mundane events of our daily lives) but they cannot assume control of our lives. It is up to us to be alert to their efforts. We can do that by following a spiritual path that draws us closer to our spirit, including the practice of prayer, meditation, and reflection. My sources are two spirits who spoke to me through another person (not channeled). To learn about my experience with them, see my profile link to The Invisible Choir. ",

            "answer_text": "It is only destined that everyone will get the fruits of their choices and activities. Each one is allowed to create his/her own destiny in this world in this scheme of the world! God will not stop us but will even facilitate us to create our own future/destiny. First of all, before I answer this question, one needs to understand the scheme of this world and some basic concepts about God. You may read my other answers on QUORA regarding GOD. Now, let us say parents know that if they offer a chocolate, their 5-year-old son/daughter will be willing to study for somtime. Parents understand the psychology of children to some extent though they are not expert psychologists. This knowledge does not mean that parents are only making the child to do everything. They are not scuttling the free will of the child. They know how the child will behave if they do something. i.e. they understand the cause and effect to some extent and deal accordingly. So they know. Similarly, a divine intelligence, which is infinitely superior to a network to trillions of supercomputers put together, knows what all people do under all circumstances because of their nature. God did not fix their nature. Three types of souls (details in my other answers on Quora) already exist and God along with the inanimate matter already exist in this universe. Nobody created the 3 things : Souls, God, Inanimate matter. The souls act according to their nature. God knows it all and that is not forcing others to follow his will. Each soul has free will. Mahabharat says, karma se bhagya ko ham badal sakte hai. It is my own experience too. God uses inanimate matter of different types to create this universe and sends the souls to perform their roles and perfect their mental evolution, i.e. learn and become perfect according to their own nature. Each soul is responsible for his/her choices in life. God is the most liberal one and allows souls to fulfil their desires. But as they do those activities despite his warnings through his devotee, they undergo the consequences of their actions. BLOG: Wisdom: http://www.wisebee.quora.com ",

            "answer_text": "To answer your question, I draw a distinction between Destiny and Fate. The former (destiny) is decided prior to your birth/incarnation (e.g. you agree to your culture, birth gender, parents, country of birth, DOB, abilities [e.g. musical, intellectual, psychic, manual, art etc], choice of body, career, crossroad meetings, life-changing events etc). Our spirit / soul / Higher-self guides us on this. The latter (fate) are the choices and decisions we make while incarnate as human beings, with our human mind, emotions, ego, personality etc. Some events are seen as fateful i.e. unavoidable (really the word is destiny-ful?) and in reality, that can be the case e.g. life changing events i.e. we chose it before we were born, from a spiritual perspective (even though our humanness / ego really doesn\u2019t like it and argues to the contrary). I am going to add that, from the soul/spirit/Higher-self perspective, there is no judgement on whether we follow any of our destiny. We have free will. And for most of us, we distract and make decisions and choices from very human perspectives, which is part of being human ~ the human experience. Knowing your destiny is not always comfortable either because if we did know, we might consciously go out of our way to avoid the very thing we agreed to, from a spiritual perspective, prior to birth.

If you believe with certainty that we make our own fate you have to be able to explain why a 2 year old boy, several years ago while on vacation in Disney World Florida, was attacked and killed by an alligator in front of his parents. How is it that that innocent child was responsible for making his own fate? Joshua Rothman in a review of Anna Karenna sums up Tolstoys\u2019 perspective on fate this way: \u201cHe believes that we make choices, and that our sense of free will is based on something real. But he also has a deep respect for the complexity and power of our circumstances, and he considers our personalities and psychologies to be \u201ccircumstances,\u201d too. There are limits to what we can do out there in the world, and there are also limits to what we can feel, endure, know, and imagine within ourselves.\u201d Is \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d a Love Story?

            "answer_text": "Even something so small as a human being is made up of a staggering number of atoms, each of which rigidly follows a set of deterministic rules whose aggregate result determines the fate of the organism, and each of which is composed of fundamental particles which may or may not be themselves following deterministic rules. It has been said that the universe is already the most compact computer capable of determining its own fate. This makes sense: atoms are much smaller than any computing circuitry capable of modeling their behavior. Science takes constant advantage of the vast computing power of the universe by whenever possible conducting experiments rather than modeling results. It\u2019s generally easier, and always more accurate. Under these conditions, we could prove the universe was deterministic if we could predict its future accurately using a deterministic model. But none of our models are, or ever could be accurate enough to perfectly predict the future of something as complicated as a human being in society. By comparison, predicting the weather is trivial. So the preliminary answer to your question is that we don\u2019t know, and furthermore do not have, nor will ever have the computing horsepower to ascertain whether human behavior is fundamentally deterministic. But that means that to us it is not - we can never predict with any accuracy exactly what we will do, or what will happen to us, even in the very short-term future. So that\u2019s your answer: as far as we\u2019re concerned, our futures are unpredictable and therefore not fated; whether fundamentally that is true or not. So, feel free to make your own fate. ",

            "answer_text": "My sincere belief and understanding is that we both make our own destiny as well as that our destiny is also written out for us.  Destiny is a choice.  No one will obtain destiny by default. My favourite scripture is \"a garden enclosed is my beloved\".   I believe in the concept of \"a place prepared for me\".   My sincere belief is that if we come to realise and understand that we make our own destiny that is already written for us then more people would do well in life.  It does take the awakening to understand that this is true in order for us to move forward and do well. The scripture said thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee.  The word perfect means shalom in the Hebrew that it was written.  The word peace also means shalom.  This is saying that thou wilt keep him in shalom shalom whose mind is stayed on thee.  Double use of word shalom then says that well being that is well being.   What does destiny mean to those using the word.  Destiny is not a destination.Rather destiny is a condition of soul.  I figure that all healthy individuals desire to have well being as a human condition.   This well being that is well being is not by default.  One must choose this condition. After choosing this condition then one continually chooses to enter into the reality of the condition at all times.  No man lives or dies to himself.  This condition is already available to all.  It is good for one then it is good for all.  All can enter regardless.  It does not matter where you have been or where you do find yourself now.  If you are truly seeking then it is truly possible.  I am not responsible to skeptics and scoffers.  I am responsible to the sincere seeker of truth.  I desire for others to tell me the plain truth.  I speak the plain truth. I have been there done that.  I was sad and lost and forlorn and perplexed. I have felt real pain.  Do i say that i shall never again feel pain?  Not at all.  Rather i shall never again feel pain that waste.  Instead, i have learned to make my pain redemptive.    What rational person would freely choose a religious belief that makes destiny a confusion? ...\"Know ye not that Ramoth in Gilead be ours...?\"  Our destiny belongs to us and that no one can take it from us.  The right ideas / the right spiritual heritage is ours.  We just need to enter and obtain.  I think that one of the inherent characteristics of all of us as writers is that we do have the capacity to get up and go to the higher road / the higher call in life.  Writers are forever attempting to define that which is highest possible road.  That journey starts with the first basic step.  We choose to rise up to obtain the prize that is of the high calling in life.   Maybe i could write a better answer.  This question is worth me keeping it as sharp as my understanding of destiny for me and for all.  This is a universal resource that is available to one and to all.  It is the same good for me.  It it the same good for all.       Here is one example how this is lived.  A good relationship is a part of destiny.  I have resolved to have and maintain good relationships with all men.  Indeed there are some people who are uncomfortable because they would rather be selective who they relate to in life.  My commitment to other people means that i take less space for myself.  Other people have the same right to be wherever they choose to be.  It is wrong for me to be uncomfortable around other people. I am responsible to choose where i go to reduce any abnormal exposure to other people. For example, my openness to others does not mean that i would want any human being dancing and holding me any where.  This means i do not go where people behave in that manner.   I am open and available to the people when they need me.  I position myself so that they will need me in a manner that blesses my comfort zone.   I tried my best here.  Hope this answer is a blessing to all who reads it.   Enter your destiny and be bless and be made whole.  If you enter your destiny properly that could lead to you obtaining physical health and healing as well as any form of breakthrough that you need in life success in finances success in studies. Thank you for asking me to answer a delightful question. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, to answer that, let's talk about 'Determinism' and/vs 'Free will'.... Supporters of Determinism/fatalism say: Well, there are many who are born-rich while many born-poor, which affects their future. Those who suffer from incurable illnesses will never be able to live their lives like the healthy ones. Our genes decide who we are, our intelligence, our wisdom, our beauty, etc. These disasters which occur are never in our hands. Our life span is unknown to us, and it's different. We don't know who among us may suffer. There were many who were made slaves and so couldn't do anything; is that not destiny? Even, our gender is determined, our families are too. God knows what is gonna happen! So, it's all determined. Supporters of Free Will say:Well, God has given each of us two arms, two eyes, a brain, a life, and the capacity to decide freely whatever we wish. There have been many who were born poor but became rich when they used their time properly. There have been many rich who lost it all on account of being flashy. Those who exercise are the ones who are healthy. It is we who decide what do we wanna do when. We have free will. Conclusion: Well, every sensible man, by his conscience, knows that he has free will, and his voluntary actions like 'Decision making' are not like involuntary actions like 'trembling'. On the other hand, every sensible person knows that often things do not occur as we wish. So, what we have is 'Choice'.  We only get the option to choose the best possible solution, but our options are limited. It's neither complete free will, nor complete fatalism. A physically retarded person has different options but still has choice to choose from those options. \"It's a matter between two matters\", as said by one of our Holy Imams.    God and this Choice: a) Once asked about this matter, Imam Ali(a.s) said: \"I recognized God through the failure of desires and the inability of wanted things.\" b) \"Neither his profit nor his loss nor his death nor his life nor his rising is in his control.\" c) \"Neither fatalism nor free will, it's a matter between the two extremes.\" d) Imam Ali, on the explanation of \" There is no power or might accept by Allah\", says, that it means \" There is no power within us in the matter of disobeying God, except under the allowance of God. Likewise, we don't have any ability in performing good deeds except with the assistance of Allah.\" e) In another tradition, he says, \"Good is by the grace of God and evil is due to the allowance granted by God.\" ",

When can you write your own fate? \u201cYou\u201d have to be a reality in the first place. \u201cYou\u201d must have mastery over the zillion or more variables that govern \u201cwhat is\u201d at any given time. If \u201cyou\u201d had such a control, why write your own fate anyway?\u201d. Where does the concept of fate come into the picture, if you are in complete control? The concept of fate implies automatically a sense of helplessness. Do you, the OP, have any control over the internal functions of your own body? How do you function your pancreas? How do you control the sugar level in your blood? Do you have control over your thoughts? All motor functions of the body invariably start with an intent, or thought, which takes on the mask of desire, will etc. etc.? Finally what the heck is \u201cyou\u201d? If your body is on auto pilot, run by the natural laws, and your thoughts are driven by the habit patterns in memory, then what the heck is \u201cyou\u201d or where do \u201cyou\u201d come into the picture? There is no \u201cyou\u201d. What you have identified as \u201cyou\u201d is a robot driven by zillion variables. Who can predict accurately the outcome of zillion variables, most of which are not even known? \u201cYou\u201d, or what is imagined to be \u201cyou\u201d is an accident. If the apparent \u201cyou\u201d is lucky, then \u201cyou\u201d will hear words of wisdom as follows, which when it is imbued, brings peace and joy: You are the ALIVENESS behind all the perceptions, namely, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling and thinking, and this ALIVENESS is intuited to be self luminous, self evident, nameless, formless, dimension-less, non-local, non-temporal, near,dear, intimate and feels like the very core of your BEING or HEART. This intuition cannot be proved, for the ALIVENESS is an eternal SUBJECT that can never become an object of perceptions. The ancient Vedic Rishis intuited this profound TRUTH by using sound logic and reasoning and have declared with supreme confidence in their own intuition that this ALIVENESS, or as they labelled it as BRAHMAN, is the ONE and only REALITY that is causeless and is untouched by time and space and YOU are THAT BRAHMAN.

            "answer_text": "Let me answer, dividing the question into two sections and at end let me draw conclusions. What is belief called \u201ccreating our own Destiny\u201d ? Creating our own destiny means paving our own road to our dreams or goals in more sophisticated manner to meet the needs by crook or hook.The method or tools adopted in reaching destiny makes the person a real successful or meaningless successful person. Yes, every person can try or strive to create his own destiny with at most sincerity,mindfulness,dedication..etc.. helping a person to reach his destiny ideally or theoretically.But in practical life you may kick start with the notion of doing all things with the preconception of all positive vibes but at the end one may or may not reach the persons\u2019 destiny as a matter of fact. What is belief called \u201ceverything is preplanned\u201d ? Everything is preplanned can be explained in terms of getting into a conclusion that your very actions on this planet are predefined and deeds happen according to preplan created by some super natural power or may be someone more superior to that respective person. Yes most of things can be thoughts of being preplanned but only when it meets with reality, explaining the science behind that notion which is acceptable when applied to others, else the concept of \u201ceverything is preplanned\u201d does not hold sense and need not believe in it. Example where \u2018working for Destiny\u2019 and \u2018everything is preplanned\u2019 can be understood. A poor honest farmer ,who thought to improve his life by working hard in his fields . So he was determined to use great techniques and hard but well yielding practices to put forth his efforts. Working in fields, to his luck he finds some treasury in his land (which was hidden by his forefathers planning so that safely it can be useful for next generations when sincerely working in field) and eventually the news comes to the notice of government, ordering him to politely submit it to government.Respecting the decision, he returns everything to government. But mean while he never stops to strive for good yield from his land and finally helping him to improve his life. As the days passed the government after verifying the records of the wealth comes to a conclusion that wealth belong to family linage of poor farmer and ordered to return a greater amount of wealth to the farmer for his honesty.Finally farmer ends up getting great wealth in return. Morality : One must strive to reach his destiny, checking his methods or tools being used and never wait for so called preplanned\u2019 notion and get discouraged in the process of moving ahead.For a person who believes in self confidence,Honesty,sincerity..etc will never care for preplanned notions and instead preplans to work tirelessly to reach his destiny.

In Mahabharat, Karna asks Krishna- \u201cMy mother left me the moment I was born. Is it my fault I was born an illegitimate child? I did not get the education from Dhronacharya because I was considered not a Kshatriya. Parshu-Raam taught me but then gave me the curse to forget everything when he came to know I was Son of Kunthi belong to Kshatriya. A cow was accidentally hit by my arrow and its owner cursed me for no fault of mine. I was disgraced in Draupadi's Swayamvar. Even Kunthi finally told me the truth only to save her other sons. Whatever I received was through Duryodhana's charity. So how am I wrong in taking his side ???\" Krishna replies, \u201cKarna, I was born in a jail. Death was waiting for me even before my birth. The night I was born I was separated from my birth parents. From childhood, you grew up hearing the noise of swords, chariots, horses, bow, and arrows. I got only cow herd's shed, dung, and multiple attempts on my life even before I could walk! No Army, No Education. I could hear people saying I am the reason for all their problems. When all of you were being appreciated for your valour by your teachers I had not even received any education. I joined Gurukula of Rishi Sandipani only at the age of 16! You are married to a girl of your choice. I didn't get the girl I loved rather ended up marrying those who wanted me or the ones I rescued from demons. I had to move my whole community from the banks of Yamuna to far off Sea shore to save them from Jarasandh. I was called a coward for running away!! If Duryodhana wins the war you will get a lot of credit. What do I get if Dharmaraja wins the war? Only the blame for the war and all related problems... Remember one thing, Karna. Everybody has Challenges in life to face. LIFE IS NOT FAIR and EASY ON ANYBODY!!! But what is Right (Dharma) is known to your Mind (conscience). No matter how much unfairness we got, how many times we were Disgraced, how many times we Fall, what is important is how you REACTED at that time. Life's unfairness does not give you license to walk the wrong path... Always remember, Life may be tough at few points, but DESTINY is not created by the SHOES we wear but by the STEPS we take.. Thanks for reading patiently. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, according to the Vedas, destiny does exist. Whatever happens in this life is determined by previous lives, and whatever happiness and distress you are due in this life is fixed at birth. In proportion to the extent of one's religious or irreligious actions in this life, one must enjoy or suffer the corresponding reactions of his karma in the next. O best of the demigods, we can see three different varieties of life, which are due to the contamination of the three modes of nature. The living entities are thus known as peaceful, restless and foolish; as happy, unhappy or in-between; or as religious, irreligious and semireligious. We can deduce that in the next life these three kinds of material nature will similarly act. SB 6.1.45- 46 It is clear from the above verses from Srimad Bhagavatam that one life is the spring board to the next, while simultaneously delivering the results of our past life. How you react in this life to the results of your past life determines the next life. So to break that down, what it means is that this life is set, but your next life is not. So destiny acts within this life, and your activities in this life determine your destiny in the next life. So we create our own destiny and then get the opportunity to create another and then another. So while destiny exists, it is not some outside force that acts on us, it is the result of activities. Once our destiny is locked down at the end of our life, then when we take birth again, it can be changed, but not by us. We cannot meddle with the laws of material nature. If we could then no one would ever feel distressed or even stressed, never get diseases, grow old or die. This is not happening now, and never has. These experiences are forced on us and we cannot avoid them. What we can do is surrender to the master of material nature Lord Krishna and engage in His service and if necessary He can change our destiny. It\u2019s not something that we can ever check because we only live one life one time, and can never know what would have happened if we had made different choices. But on the upside we can become indifferent and detached to the experiences that our destiny deliver to us, but rising above the three modes of nature which are the delivery system for our material happiness and distress. The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self. Bg 2.45 Material happiness and distress, which let\u2019s face it is what really concerns us about destiny, can be bypassed altogether while not being changed. Happiness and distress are one of the dualities of the material world, but they only affect us if we identify as a material body. If we identify and realize our spiritual nature, then the workings of material nature won\u2019t affect us. This is the goal of self-realization, to understand the self as spirit soul, eternal servant of Krishna and so become indifferent to the attempts of destiny to deliver happiness and distress to us.

            "answer_text": "This is a question for the ages! I believe the answer is simple, but clouded by religious beliefs. I do believe in a creator. I believe that most who believe in \u2018fate\u2019 as predestined do as well\u2026 otherwise WHO did the predestining? (is that even a word?) As a believer, I am confident that our creator can see and know the future before it happens. And this is where the confusion comes in. Just because the maker can see what will be, this does not mean it was necessarily going to happen that way. Maybe the creator wants something for us, but we are not forced to comply. Let\u2019s step back just a bit and remember WHY we were created and what our creator wants. I will do my best to use only logic and be faith-neutral. If the creator wanted robots, we would be such. We easily could have been made so. And if there was no alternative to obedience, there would be no mention of (or need for) any type of punishment. Now, most of us agree that some people choose disobedience and will receive a punishment of some sort for that disobedience. Which brings me to my point: A just creator would not create a punishment for disobedience and then create us to be predestined for punishment. So it seems clear to me that we have a choice. If we can choose, then fate is only visible in the rear-view mirror. I hope this helps. Coach Loren. ",

            "answer_text": "BOTH!!! This is our quantum nature as a species that has evolved to the point of having Free Will, which is the capability to create new information through choices. Creation is a solid 3D hologram of Dark Energy (Life) playing out in a field of Dark Matter (the answer to the question, \u201cWhat happens to Matter at Absolute Zero?\u201d), exciting it into spinning and providing the information of how to form creation. Time is a datapoint on the control track, and the speed of light marks the refresh rate. It\u2019s like a long term soap opera where you have a beginning and a goal, and a loose script of how to get there. But along the way, writers add information to the story line, that is what we as humans do, we create our future with our choices. That is the evolutionary epoch we are in, the one where we learn to make the choices we will need to make in later stages of Evolution. Evolution is the reproductive process of the Multiverse itself, the Multiverse being an enormous to our perspective organism, and we are a product of that reproductive process. We all share the same mind, the Singularity, God\u2026, whatever you want to call the dimension of Dark Energy that is the repository for all the information of creation, and Broadcast Central for the show we call Reality, aka The Observable, Physical Universe. There is a script that reads like Star Trek without the space battles, but we have to choose to follow the script. The Direction written into the script is make those choices always remembering to comply with \u201cBe kind and take care of each other.\u201d However we have chosen to use a different script provided by Constantine titled Armageddon, and for nearly 2000 years now, we have been striving to fulfill it. You see, that is what is required of us to be viable as an independent Multiverse, a new quantum organism of our own. If we don\u2019t have that capacity, we die of cancer, as humanity is suffering right now, feeding voraciously off each other with no regards to the consequences. We have come to the end of this evolutionary epoch, we are in \u201cfinals week\u201d, the Multiverse needs this womb planet back for the next pregnancy. It is time for us to evolve or go extinct. The result revolves around our adoption of the Hydrogen Economy to instill people to make the kind and caring choices required. Urbanagandenergy.Org/phi101/ ",

            "answer_text": "it depends on your point of view. from a purely grammatical point of view, the question is incorrect as destiny is defined as the events that will necessarily happen in the future, implying that we have no control in it either way. i.e. if one were to ask the destiny of a person in a hundred years time, using only the dictionary definition, the person would not have a choice. i suspect that this is an overly pedantic answer to the question however, so i will elaborate: while some would say that we do have choice as we control our own lives and future, others would say that we do not and it is predicated by a deity of some description, the honest truth is that we have no way of knowing for certain. for example, if we were to assume that it is possible that we live in the matrix, or some variant thereof (a position called solipsism), then either we create our own choices and the matrix [or those running it] mould(s) the matrix to our choices. so if one were in the matrix and chose to have a sandwich, the matrix made a sandwich etc. on the other hand, if in the matrix, the controllers choose for us and force us to merely have the belief that we made a \u2018real\u2019 choice then not only would it require mind reading skills, but we would have no knowledge that it was not our choice in the first place; the controllers of the matrix would implant the desire for a sandwich into our minds and then create the sandwich in the matrix. at this point, it would not be amiss to call us mere puppets inside the matrix. the astute reader would notice that the above statements can only be observed if one is aware they are in the matrix. if one is in the matrix and unaware of it, then it is impossible to tell if we have free will or not. take the matrix to be the real world and substitute the controllers of the matrix with a deity. this is the problem we now face and the problem the main question faces: reality and the fact that for the moment at least, it is impossible to know for certain that we are not being controlled by some deity or even that one exists, just like neo did not know until he awoke from the matrix. in short the answer is that we do not know and right now, there is little we can do to change that. now, i would ask those reading a question in return: if we do not have a way to change whether we have a destiny or not and we do not know whether we do, does it really matter? the likely reaction may likely be that of course it matters; if we are not truly free, it definitely matters. however, we do not know and perhaps we will never know. should we let this consume us and search for what perhaps does not exist, second guessing ourselves and questioning reality at every step of our lives? i would say no. for now, let us accept the fact that we do not know for certain that there is destiny at all and live our lives as though we write our own destinies. if we do, then we have not lost anything and have lived our lives to the fullest and if we do not then it is the best we could do anyway. do not let depression drag you down. always follow your dreams.

            "answer_text": "This world of humanity is based on full freedom and absence of any forcible destiny. Here, you are free to do any type of work and no destiny forces you to do any specific work as said in the Gita (Na kartrutvam...). The concept of destiny exists only in the link of the specific work and the specific fruit. You have full freedom to put your finger in fire or water. No destiny forces you to put your finger in fire or water. The destiny lies only in the link between a specific work and corresponding specific fruit. It is destined that the fire burns your finger and the water keeps your finger cool. The destiny is not in the selection of the work. You have put your finger in the fire due to ignorance or ego. After burning the finger, you may say that you have put the finger in the fire due to the destiny. God has destined the specific system, which links every action with a specific fruit. After putting your finger, God is not ordering the fire to burn it. The subsequent fruit for a specific work is already destined. God or the destiny does not interfere with the choice of your selection of a specific work. Even the so called past destiny does not interfere with your works. The composition of your psychology is fixed based on your past deeds. Thus, work is responsible for the will and the will is the generator of the work. Since the composition of your psychology is already based on your past deeds and is fixed, you can treat that as destiny and in such case, destiny is guiding everything. The psychology is a specific pattern of ideas generated by the past deeds and it is called as \u2018Samskara\u2019. An idea can be changed by knowledge. Samskara is a fixed concept and the right knowledge is a group of right concepts. You have the opportunity of hearing the right knowledge since God comes to this world quite often in human form. You have the freedom to hear such divine knowledge or not to hear. You have also freedom to practice the knowledge or leave it without practice. At every step, the basic freedom is given. This human world is also the right place for testing the devotees and here also, the full freedom is protected. You are totally free to sacrifice anything or not to sacrifice anything even if God desires for it. God does not force you or threaten you or wash your brain in your sacrifice since such sacrifice is not real. God is pleased only with the real sacrifice done by the soul in the atmosphere of total freedom. In the examination hall, you are totally free to answer the question paper to any extent or even to return the white paper without writing even a word. God preaches the total concept and in the stage of implementation of it, God does not influence your mind in any way. After teaching all the right knowledge through the Gita, Krishna said that the decision to fight or not is totally left to Arjuna (yathechchasi\u2026). The basic reason is that God is not in need of anything from anybody. The sacrifice is not to satisfy God but only to uplift you. The sacrifice proves your real attachment to God and such real attachment is not in the benefit of God but it is only in your benefit. Krishna asked for the special gem from Satrajit, the father of Satyabhama. Krishna is not in need of that gem. He is the creator of that gem. Even without the help of that gem, He can create wealth. He can even stop the power of the gem to create the wealth. Krishna asked the gem from Satrajit because Satrajit cannot maintain it and will fall in trouble. Only for the welfare of Satrajit, He asked him for that gem. But, Satrajit thought that Krishna asked that gem for His personal benefit and thereby, for His personal satisfaction. Such misunderstanding made Satrajit to refuse the gem. Astrology and destiny Astrology says that the happening of good or bad incidents is due to the planets. This misunderstanding again leads the people to think that their actions are destined by the planets. Here, your actions are not destined by the planets. Your actions are only destined by your psychological set up, which is destined by your past deeds. The planet links the specific fruit for the specific action. You do something based on your Samskara. The planet gives its correspondent fruit immediately. You blame the planet for guiding you to do a specific work and this is totally wrong. A planet is only destined to give the specific result linked with your specific action. The specific work is based on your specific psychological pattern only. The horoscope gives the composition of your specific psychological pattern. Since your future actions also depend on the same pattern, future prediction can be easily given. A specific psychological pattern is always linked with a specific composition of planets representing your qualities or ideas. Therefore, there is no external destiny here other than yourself regarding your future. If the Samskara is modified with the help of the divine knowledge, the whole destiny is changed, which means your horoscope totally disappears. Every period is divided into sub periods, every sub period is again divided into further sub periods and every division involves the revolution of all the nine planets again and again. This means that human being is a mixture of both good and bad always in every step of the time. Astrology is Introduction to Philosophy Actually, the basic concept of astrology indicates that there is the existence of some unimaginable supernatural force that guides this world. Hence, astrology is an introduction for the philosophy. Without taking this basic reality, you misuse the astrology to justify yourself by linking your wrong actions to the planets. The worship of the supernatural and unimaginable planets introduces the worship of unimaginable God. But, this is again misused as the worship of the planet for not giving the bad result for the bad action done by you. If you worship God, He will preach you the right knowledge, which changes the total destiny. By your worship, God will not protect you from your sins. Therefore, in this world, the destiny is also in your hands only. There is full freedom for you to change your destiny through the right knowledge. Hence, this world of humanity is called as \u2018Karma Loka\u2019, which means that your actions decide everything and that your action is based on your psychological pattern only and not by any pre-determined external destiny. The upper worlds are called as \u2018Bhoga Lokas\u2019 because there is no freedom to perform any new action and you have no freedom at all, but for enjoying the destined results for your already recorded actions. \u2018Pravrutti\u2019 means attachment to worldly bonds. \u2018Nivrutti\u2019 is detachment of your worldly bonds for the sake of God. This world is the stage for both pravrutti and nivrutti. Full freedom up to the level of changing your destiny exists here. Your destiny is only your fixed psychological pattern generated from the past deeds and not any other external force. This pattern can be changed by the right knowledge received from God in the form of preacher. Therefore, there is every chance for changing your destiny in this world. Generally, people blame the reason for their bad actions to be some external force called as destiny in which there is no trace of their personal psychological involvement. People say, \u2018People say so\u2019. The people cannot be the authority unless the whole subject is perfectly analyzed. Even there are several misinterpretations in books written by ancestral scholars. You should not blindly take the people or the ancient books as authority without analyzing them perfectly. The Gita says that you will laugh at such authorities if you analyze the subject with sharp scientific intelligence (Buddhyaayukto\u2026). Even if the implementation is impossible, it is better to have the right knowledge, which follows the soul to the next birth so that the practical implementation can be done sometime in the future. This point looks quite good, but there is the practical danger. Just like the cooked food can be attacked by the bacteria in the atmosphere, the right knowledge is also attacked by the worldly attractions and sometimes, the right knowledge may become weaker and weaker and even may finally disappear even in the later part of this life. Therefore, it is better to implement the realized concept as early as possible like eating the cooked food immediately. ",

To what extent do our decisions matter? If I step off a cliff, I cannot just decide to float away without much better prep. I am destined to arrive at the bottom of the cliff. However, what most people are thinking of with destiny is a mysterious supernatural force that controls the events of our lives in the sense of \u201cAppointment in Samarra\u201d and a great deal of time-travel stories. There is no reason to suspect a supernatural force. The instances where we have no control of where we end up, we call those: natural laws. The picture from classical mechanics (which includes relativity) is purely deterministic. However, the emerging picture of a statistical universe, one that is inherently uncertain, leaves room for the possibility to make decisions \u2014 to choose from a range of possible futures. So far there is not enough evidence to call it for determinism/fate/destiny. Right now, our best evidence suggests that, by understanding the natural laws that bind us, we can shape our path to the future. We can have that kind of power with Nature instead of over Her. If hard determinism is true, then it makes no difference: since I have no choice but to act as though I have some control over my destiny. ",

Fate are the things that we can't help that change us as people. I think it works both ways. I've become so overwhelmed with anxiety pondering this very same question that I thought I've often felt like I wanted to tear my way out of my own skin. It was like experiencing claustrophobia from being wrapped in this existence. Like I was a 5th dimensional being incarnated into a 3rd dimensional suffering from the inability to have the freedoms I had in my higher form. Call me nuts... the negative opinions of others regarding this have never in my life been more futile than they are now. I've seen UFO. I've seen them drop in from time to time. Oh... and if anyone wants to discredit my sanity, just be prepared for what I'll have to say in return. Fate as an almighty governing entity that favors some and not others? I don't believe that one bit. I believe we are the choices we make.  ",

We all have free will and we are all able to make free choices as to what path our life will take at multiple points during that life. There are always some constraints on us - legal, physical, intellectual etc - on what we\u2019re able to do, but rare circumstances apart, every yes/no or either/or type decision in life is down to us to make. But given those constraints, your destiny or fate - where you end up in life - is solely down to you, and to you alone. All too often however, people, particularly religious people, will conflate the terms with \u2018the will of god\u2019, mentally shifting the blame for their own inaction or inability to achieve goals in life onto some invisible and imaginary entity, and in the process become convinced that \u2018X\u2019 or \u2018Y\u2019 wasn\u2019t meant for them \u201cbecause it was destined not to be\u201d or \u201cfate decreed that...\u201d. This is lazy and fallacious thinking and is nothing more than an excuse for personal failure. What you achieve in life is down to you, period. Your destiny or fate, call it what you will, is entirely in your own hands. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Atman, This is a nice question. Let's see\u2026 If you find option A (our fate is written) does not cover all the aspect of the life\u2026. Then go for option B (we write our own fate)\u2026. If believers of Option B finds that it also does not cover all aspects of life, they go for Option A\u2026. Collectively, both the options have limitations\u2026 You must have experienced this, that's why you are asking\u2026. If you are asking without experiencing their limitations in your life, my answer will not satisfy you. My simple answer is, they both are theories\u2026. Neither you have a written life, nor you write your own life\u2026.. so both options may seem to satisfy some part of life, but life too will tell you at one point both of their uselessness in explaining life events. Then what! You need another option! See this, mind is trained to have aspects, you had A, if not, then B, and now even if you accept my answer, you need another option C ? LOL, ok , I am giving you another option. You already have written your life and finished it just the way you liked\u2026. This is Option C\u2026 thats why you will disliked to be someone else other than you\u2026.. go on, look around, do you want your neighbours life fully?\u2026 No, you want to be yourself\u2026. It's the same for everyone. This is the time for you to ponder over your life, not going by option A, B or C\u2026. Does any rule can be applied to dreams! Life is the dream of the Bhraman Self\u2026 no rule can limit it. Why would you even like to have one rule book for your life even! Life is free, you are that, you/life can not be limited by any rule. Emptiness is your true essence, you are Siva-self. No karma bounds you, no rule book guides you. Happy Mahashiva Ratri ",

            "answer_text": "I think from God\u2019s point of view we are inseparable from our ancestors. So when we are born we are in the circumstances created by our ancestors all interconnected more or less. During our lifetime we have opportunity to overcome things which our ancestors who are already in spirit world couldn\u2019t overcome. This way we and they would benefit and would be able to move on in learning to love. For that to happen they give us ideas, they pressurize us, they make obstacles if they have resentments and so on. Our goal is to welcome it and to solve problems, go to higher levels. Sometimes we feel that we got stuck or that same situation comes back again and again. It means that we are not doing good with that situation and because anyway it has to be solved it will come back again and again until we manage. With help of God and our ancestors we go through different things and then face same situations with other understanding, experience to be finally able to win. Also humankind history goes in spirals because of that. As restoration of situation when Cain killed Abel in our lives there is everywhere this situation when we are together with someone: coworker or group mate or friend in a position of Cain or Abel. There is always 1 of them who\u2019s offering is accepted (boss at work likes him more and promotes) and the one who envies and tries to destroy the other (depends of his level). When Adam and Eve were born and God gave them position over archangel Lucifer who was already millions of years old he envied Adam and took over him. This attitude you can find everywhere in Adam and Eve descendants because Lucifer transferred it to Eve and Eve to Adam. What is proper attitudes of \u0410bel and Cain to be able to restore this bad situation? Cain: Hey Abel, God doesn\u2019t accept my offering for some reason, could you pass then my offering to God? Abel: Let\u2019s go to God together and offer it together. In our lives when we have such attitudes being sometimes in position of Cain and sometimes in position of Abel is the one which brings most joy to everyone. It is win-win. As a conclusion: yes we make our destiny ourselves, we make choices, but everyone is born in different circumstances depending on his ancestral lines. So for some people some things are no problem which for the other is impossible. In the end we are all coming from one couple so by helping each other overcome things we help ourselves to. ",

His wife felt so humiliated that she left him the next day. Meanwhile the professor had to validate certain university papers. Driven by his frustration, he made many fail in the exams. Because of the exam results, some of the students who failed could not attend job interviews. One of these student had lot of loans and was entirely dependent on getting the job to fix the issue. He commits suicide along with his family. One of his friend was driving a car , thinking about the misfortune. He hits a puppy by accident, whom he rescues. And that's how he met the love of his life, whom coincidentally happened to own the puppy and also daughter of the professor who farted. We don't make anything. Fate flows it's course.

Those who's gravity of life is emotions and those who's gravity of life is thinking. People living grounded around emotions are prone to surrendering attitude, worshipers, believe in faith etc and live accordingly. Belief system that destiny is written is useful for them specially in refrence to their spiritual interest. But those who's lives are grounded around thinking are prone to analysis, reasoning, logical thinking etc, for them, another belief system that we make our destiny is useful specially in refrence to their spiritual interest. What we feel that one knows one's own type is not true as in general, many of us fall under 49:51ratio and easily get influenced by both belief systems, one by another. This leads no progress and unless proved, one remains influenced by wrong belief system causing injuries. It is only diagnosis of one's right type which leads one to right drug. Thanks Q guru ",

Everything else is determined by our choices. Our choices are informed by our environment and upbringing. Let\u2019s say I give a homeless man $20.00. He could either go to a liquor store and load up, or he could polish himself up, go on a job interview, and in 20 years he will be a billionaire and give me 1/2 of his earning. Was that destiny? No. It was the outcome of a choice. Destiny is a term to make people feel comfortable with where they landed in life without having to take responsibility for their actions. ",

            "answer_text": "If we sow potato we should not expect to get onions, this is so simple to understand and thus what we sow we get. Thus we create destiny. Yet this is not so simple to understand because we work under infinite variables influencing every moment. When we say for calming mind we mean to reduce influence from unknown region that can add complexity in the whole sowing seed. It is mind eventually that is making all happen or our perception which is on a leading front to think this way or that way. Did you ever think why you think the way you do, which could be very different from many of your friends. If you think you would know there is some uniqueness in you which makes your mind flow in such direction and so everyone has some uniqueness. What I have to do is to harness my uniqueness and if we try we get the answer. Why do you think that everything is preplanned? Our mind is always being influenced from so many external vibrations, our parents and sibling, our teachers and seniors, our friends, society and the city and so on. You may be driving 2 wheeler / 4 wheeler on road, you have to follow certain traffic rules; do you follow them or break them. This way we are continuously bombarded by different regions and have to follow certain rules to be disciplined. It is when we follow a discipline life we try to follow external rules that are necessary thus there is emoting common in our self an external. When the mind id calm we have internal harmony and try to maintain external harmony. In such state one can reduce unwanted external influence to distract the mind. Only one thing is planned if you believe God is that we have got life and have to utilize most efficiently and for that we have to be engaged always in constructive thinking so are action are constructive too. This small thing itself tries to roll our activities that form the causes like sowing seed and with time ripens to give fruits sour or sweet as we have sown and we try to see as destiny. Thus it becomes to find out what all we should do to keep mind calm, to keep engaged in constructive way. It is a process and not one time activity. How to be self-disciplined you can get from many other answers in this forum. Thus we are making our destiny and have to be focused on variable we know and can control and if we do that there are divine laws that take care of us from unknown variables and add zest and energy always.

            "answer_text": "If we view our life in deeper thinking we can find it so mysterious. Hence, we have came to life without our choice, similarly we will leave it without our choice too. While in between we are not the real controller of our own body nor the environment around. For believers, it is nature to realize that an entity should be behind all what we are experiencing. In rational thinking, we may build a relative vision on this entity\u2019s capacity, capability and knowledege. Hence, it would far exceeds our capacity, capabilities and knowledge. Then it is worth to say, the creation design would have its basis of knowledge, planning, execution, mointoring & controlling, moreover, there ought be a clear purpose for the life. All those matters are clearly described, as needed at this stage of life, in the authenticated scriptures. So would a fate be predetermined, the answer came that nothing would happen without the knowledge and decision of the creator. This the lyer of authority that is owned soley by the creator. So nothing would ever happen without his knowledge. Therefore, the fate is already determined for everyone in respect to that lyer of authority & knowledge. In contrast, we have a lyer of authority that suit our knowledge and capabilities as well, but it will never reach to the same that the creator already have. So I would recommend acting between the margines given to us, listen to the creator guidance rather going in matters we cant do anything about except requesting (praying) to our true Lord, the creator, assisting us to reaching to the truth fulfilling the purpose behind our short existance in life.

I rarely will make popular choices simply because they are popular and I will not follow anyone. I though at the age of 10 had a series of dreams that were quite detailed and 10 years later, 9,000 miles away came to pass in exactly the same manner and detail. It was clearly like dejavue. I knew exactly what was about to happen and where I was going. The only way I see this possible is if I had done this before, exactly as I did in my dream and exactly as I repeated again. Because of this I feel what we think we know about time and reality is not a fact though I still go on as I would normally, fear of the unknown is not in my nature, and as I will likely never really know the truth, I will simply live the best I can until I can no longer.

If you do not like learning/schooling you are limiting you chances for a bright future.. If you commit a crime, you pave the way to make many friends in prison. Even normal people do a lot of things that determines their near future. Marrying the girl with the boobs and not the one with the brains, having 5 instead of 2 or 3 children, buying a big TV instead of investing the money, eating and drinking lots of junk food\u2026 There are lots of things we can influence but also a lot we have no control over like color of skin, gender, sexual orientation. This is true if we look at it from birth until the last breath. If there is a before and after which may influence this life time, I tend to think yes. If I only look at my family, basically with the same genetic pool I think there is a before and after. And if this is the case Karma and reincarnation is the most logical conclusion. And if this is the case, yes we create the setting for each incarnation, or at least agree to it! ",

Satan has a plan for your life the moment you are born and that is that you may never know Jesus while he destroys you physically emotionally mentally and spiritually and making us believe the life we plan is our own. God has heavenly places for all who believe in Jesus Christ but he won't make you believe in him. Although God has a master plan for your life he will not override your free will. God's plan for you goes according to knowing Jesus and being saved from Hell to live with him in heaven for eternity. Our plans, no matter how well thought out are to no profit. Jesus said \u201cWhat does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul. What can a man give in exchange for his soul\u201d Matthew 16:26. Y To answer the question God has a plan before you are born. You and the devil have a plan for your life after you are born. But your fate will be whatever you make it based on those choices you make. Choose Jesus Christ. He is the only true way. Hope this helps. Blessings. ",

The idea says that everybody can do as they want, so anything could happen. I could choose pizza tonight, or I could choose pasta, or I could choose something else. But wait- why do I choose A? Well, maybe I know that A is healthy, I like it, and I'm really craving it right now. Why do I know it's healthy? Maybe my parents or somebody else told me. Why do I care? Health will let me live longer and in some ways happier. Why do I care about that? Humans have evolved to care about these things. For each of the other reasons, we can similarity deconstruct the reasons for our decisions. However, there is also a chance that randomness is a factor. Although clearly not any of the consciousness reasons, it could be possible that many instances had some impact that would spill up to change the result. Other than this cause-and-effect and a possible randomness factor, where would some \"free will\" come in? Free will does not come from what you want to do- we don't choose this and as I previously showed, is still the cause and effect + randomness factor. Please ask if you have comments or questions, I hope I was clear in my explanation. ",

Best way to live our life is to keep doing our duty with 100% dedication and devotion without any attachment to result. If results are not favorable then work harder,use intelligence, change formula. Do as many good deeds as possible so that bad karma gets reduced. If we cannot do charity as we have no money then we can at-least share knowledge. Any good deed done without expecting anything increases our good karma. This equation which you have raised in your question is too complex for humans to comprehend. ",

There will be incidents, events and happenings during the lifetime, based on the karma. The people one gets acquainted to and the way one lives may also be driven to an extent by the past. But that's not binding on the being, if one become aware and start living consciously. How one handles and respond to each of them - events and people - is entirely up to the individual. If one follows the survival template of most humans, one will not only drown in misery but also end up piling more karma to the already larger pile, leading to more lifetimes, in which one may be born as any being - not just human. That's when, and why, people blame everything on destiny, absolving themselves of any responsibility, for their own life. That's a lifetime wasted in ignorance. Instead, if one realises that only the present moment is a reality and choose to respond - not react - to the situation, in that moment, with the best of one's abilities and, more importantly, not carry the baggage of that moment to the next, then one can effectively reduce the load of your karma pile.

The nine planets including the Asc. Are physical representatives which reflect those powers serving as transmitting centre. Jyotir Vidya deals with the planatory reflections which are coming constantly to our mother earth, but the origin of these reflections and energy pattern are not generated from those planets. Those vibrations come as cosmic radiations from ten fundamental universal sources. These centres of cosmic radiations which affect our solar system are much beyond and above the solar system. The science of Astrology deals with intra-planetory vibrations where as the science of Tantra evaluates the extra planetary cosmic sources. Hence it can be concluded that where astrology stops there Tantra begins. The dictoms and phylosophes preached by the astrologers makes human evolution as a predestined factor, where as Tantric literature proceeds beyond the theory of predestination and makes human mind atuned with the cosmic evolution guided by the supreme mother force. A Tantra sadhaka thinks himself as child before the prime mother energy and pays for the blessing of that transcendental power which change the shape of destiny. The great Devi Chakra as ruled by Dasa Mahavidya power has those capacities as to change the planetary discord because the not living entity like planets are only active through those cosmic powers. The Dasa Mahavidya science of Tantra directly deals with the ten cosmic forces and it has given the miracle how to harness those powers for a happy and full fledged life in this earth. ----- The Spiritual Magazine: Sep-Oct 1984 issue.

Humans being a species of life with much more faculties of expressing itself, this becomes well distributed over a large spectrum of, say pastimes. Humans do not have a display of commotion as such, but express their 'misgivings' in unpredictable ways, some of which are writing, singing, painting, reading, and answering questions of every genre. Of which, human destiny is a favorite one, since an answer is not easy to find. ",
