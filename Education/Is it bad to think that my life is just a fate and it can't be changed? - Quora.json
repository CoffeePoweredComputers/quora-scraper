            "answer_text": "It is true to say \u201clife happens when you are not looking\u201d. The day passes, nightfall comes and you haven't achieved anything. It is good to relax after a hard day in work but when I retired, I found myself getting lazy. I felt I was owed this time, so I could do what I wanted. That sometimes amounted to doing nothing. I decided I wasn't retired as I associated that with being at the end of my career and yet I had skills I could still use and others could still tap into. I had been choosing laziness over activity. That wasn't fate. I recognized I was becoming demotivated and depressed and losing my way. I don't believe in fate. I believe in God and He gave us freedom of choice. However, I realize that is taken away from many people due to abuse and other situations. I feel to have a rewarding life you need to know what you want and how to go about it. For instance, if you want to lose weight for health reasons, it isn't going to happen sitting watching the television all day. Set yourself a goal (I want to lose weight). Break that down into 3 stages. The final stage, Stage 3 , is where I would start. If you wanted to lose 3 stones that is your final goal. Picture being slimmer. Have you been slimmer before? You can get there again. Remember, you are doing this for your health. How long are you giving yourself to achieve this? Be realistic. I would say 6 months is reasonable. Stage 1: 2 months maximum. Weight comes off quickest at the beginning but you are also getting into a routine. Do you join a slimming club? If not, research healthy eating, enlist the help of friends, start exercising. Keep a diary to check your progress. I tend to comfort eat when I am depressed. Stage 2: Join a gym? This helped me to tone as I was losing weight. I enjoyed the social aspect of it as well. Measure yourself. As you near your goal, weight loss can slow down but you may have lost inches. Back to Stage 3. Look in the mirror more. Like what you see. Buy new clothes. Feel good about yourself. Important: Keep up the good work. The above plan can relate to many situations. For example: I need to decorate my kitchen. Stage 3: Decorate in the new year. January. 3 months from now. Why? It needs it. Woodwork is yellowing. The brilliant white has gone. It would make me happier. I would be more motivated to keep it clean. It needs some renovation. Stage : 1: Go through cupboards. Dispose of out of date foods. Defrost freezer and clean. Get rid of any cobwebs lurking in the corners and clean those hard to reach areas that don't always get your full attention. I am feeling better already! Stage 2: Move some cupboards. Plaster a wall. Re-design my kitchen. I don't want everything in the same place all of the time. Ring the changes. Now go and buy some new things after painting is complete. Colour co-ordinate or have a theme. Yay! Stage 3: Kitchen is complete. Appreciate. Enjoy. Whenever I complete a project, I keep going back to look at it. Maintain, cook and clean. Appreciate. Be proud of your achievements. But firstly, make a start!! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is bad to think so. There is no such fate. When a thing can't be explained by, it is convenient to hide under fate. Let me refer a story here. Some frogs were kept in a long glass jar. They knew that will be fried for eating. Everyone wanted to escape from the jar and started climbing but unsuccessful. They fell down as glass was smooth and slipping. But one for was keep on climbing even though it got slipped many times. Whenever slipping one step down, other frogs were kept shouting that you can't climb, come down. In spite of shoutings, the frog climbed up and escaped. When it was asked how he was successful, it said that I was deaf and when all my friends were encouraged me by jumping and waving hands. The moral is that you keep on trying and you will be successful despite others discount your efforts. Similarly put great effort and see success. ",
