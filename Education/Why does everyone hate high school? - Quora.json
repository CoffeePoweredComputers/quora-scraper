            "answer_text": "Wow, I see a lot of negativity in some answers. I\u2019d like to argue from the other perspective which may be quite unpopular. So far, I really like high school. I understand am probably an extraordinary case, but bear with me. Yes, I have to get up at 5:45 every morning and yes it sucks. Yes, I get home late (especially since doing soccer which gets done at 6:00, which is super late compared to cross country and indoor track, my other sports). Yes I have a lot of work and difficult classes (I\u2019m in the MYP/IB program which is similar in difficulty to AP classes). However, I still manage to enjoy high school. This is probably because I\u2019m an optimistic person with more or less good time management. I see high school as a chance to make friends, enjoy sports, and develop your personality. Getting up early sucks, but it means I get to see my friends earlier and hang out with them in the 30 or so minutes before school actually starts. Having a lot of work can be really stressful at times, but it can also present a game/challenge, and I love challenges. Being really busy means less time for leisure, like reading or writing or wasting time on Quora, but it also means I get to spend time doing things I love with people that I love. For example, I love cross country, and most my really good friends are from cross country. So not only can I spend time doing something I like (running), I can do it with people I like (my teammates). This even applies to out of school activities. For instance, I do venturing, which in case you don\u2019t know, is a coed youth leadership program in BSA. My crew specifically tries to do high adventure things. So on weekends I can go camping and canoeing and learn survival skills, which although may make less time for homework, it is still worth it. In fact, a lot of times things are fun precisely BECAUSE they make less time for work. It\u2019s almost like a mini retreat from school, even if it\u2019s only a 30 minute recovery run for track or a game for soccer. I\u2019m focused on things that aren\u2019t homework or grades and it allows me to relax and de-stress for a while. Be aware that what I\u2019m about to say is a generalization. Please try not to take it the wrong way. In my opinion, high school (and most other things) is only a bad if you make it bad. Obviously, if you have a tough home life or have an abusive boyfriend or your parents died in a fire or your brother committed suicide or any other terrible circumstance that I can\u2019t possibly know, this does not apply to you. I\u2019m talking about the majority of my classmates and peers who have negative views on everything. If you look at things with an open mind and positive spin, they will probably seem different. If you think \u201ctoday I will be productive\u201d instead of \u201cI have so much work\u201d or \u201cI can hang out with my friends at xyz club today\u201d instead of \u201cI have to go to xyz club today,\u201d life probably won\u2019t seem so terrible. I know that all this positive mindset stuff sounds lame, but it works. At least, for me and others like me it does. Maybe you need something different. If you do, then high school is the perfect time to figure it out because you don\u2019t have responsibilities like a family or career or debt/bills yet. If none of things sound like they work to you, I\u2019ll offer some other advice. When you get home, make a plan. If you are really stressed/bored/tired, then take a break. You probably deserve it. Eat a snack, take a nap, read a book, whatever you want. However, just be sure you set a time limit, or else you\u2019ll get carried away.After a break (or if you don\u2019t need one, straight away), pick which homework you want to start with. Depending on how much I have, I usually get the quick, easy stuff out of the way first and then move onto bigger things. This may work for you or it may not. Just try different things and see what\u2019s right.Eat, drink, and sleep. Skipping meals can make you feel more tired and more miserable then you would be normally. Actually, I\u2019m being a bit of a hypocrite since I don\u2019t eat breakfast. If you\u2019re like me and can\u2019t bring yourself to eat at 6 in the morning, pack a snack to eat in class. Also, drink lots of water. It\u2019s important to stay hydrated.Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you don\u2019t understand your math homework, you don\u2019t understand it. The answer isn\u2019t going to magically appear in front of your eyes. Ask someone to explain it.Don\u2019t be afraid to let go and take a break. I have a friend who is constantly stressing and always does way more work than needed, but she is so afraid of getting behind that she refuses to relax or take breaks, which only makes her stress more. She doesn\u2019t realize she can do less work and still get high A\u2019s, despite me and several other friends being capable of doing so.Finally, if you are one of those people who I mentioned above, the ones with terrible circumstances that this answer can\u2019t fix, try to remember that not everything is so dark. Look for the small signs of hope, like a warm day in early March or a firefly in the dark. I hope that life gets better for you and that if there is anything I can do to help, please tell me. Stay safe and stay happy people. ",

            "answer_text": "Social hierarchy based on popularity. I don't know why there's such a culture that having a lot of friends in a small selected year group is so important, and a lot of people seem to fight for their popularity to improve their social status in the school.Awful teachers. Don't get me wrong, I do have some nice teachers, but most of teachers in high school are just waiting to get paycheck at the end of the month(in private school as well). They don't want to interact with students, they don't care about what their students feel about being in the school, they don't even bother to teach, and a lot of teachers are really rude and just awful even to look at them.Rude classmates. People are forced to stay in the school until it ends, so I didn't have respect from my fellow classmates for most of the time. I live in an all girls\u2019 boarding house which has endless backstabbing and nasty behaviors. Overall, I don't feel I'm in a friendly, healthy and supportive environment even though they told me to think about the school as my home.Very boring learning experience. Learning in high school is just boring as hell, everything you do is for the exams and they don't prepare for your future.Lack of personal freedom. I remembered I was treated like a little kid when I was almost 19 in my final year of high school. It sucked so much.Bullying. In such a fit-in environment means people can pick on anyone who can't or don't want to fit in, so of course, bullying behavior is epidemic. And being bullied constantly by teachers is just a different level experience.",
