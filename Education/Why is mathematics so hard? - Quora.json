            "answer_text": "I think the other answers are good summaries of \"why people find elementary and high school-math difficult\".  Some people are bad at this type of math (which is not really math at all, but is actually just \"calculation\" or \"numeracy\").  Some people can do this type of math, but then find out that they are actually bad at REAL math when they have to learn it in university. School Maths: \"Maths\" in school is a discipline in which you learn a detailed set of protocols (step by step instructions) and then apply these protocols to a variety of situations.  This isn't *really* math: it is calculation!  I was bad at this type of math.  You can be bad at this type of math by being imprecise/not detail-oriented, having a hard time memorizing things that are structured as step-by-step instructions, having a hard time concentrating on repetitive tasks, having a hard time doing mental arithmetic, finding the subject too boring to invest any time in, having a sense of fear when studying math/expectation of failure.  I fit 100% of the above descriptions.  If you are also like me: don't be disheartened!!!  This is NOTHING like any math you would do above linear algebra or multivariable calculus!!!  Take a class in discrete mathematics (probably the easiest proof-based class, at least at my university) to test the waters and see if you are bad at mathematics or just bad at calculation!  I'm doing a PhD in applied mathematics-ish field now, so there you go! Real Maths:Real maths are much cooler than calculation!  You have to think creatively to solve problems.  In a lot of cases you need to think about how one problem \"maps\" onto another. Answers are often clever or elegant.  (There is some essay about how if schools taught music like they taught math, then you would spend 12 years learning how to transcribe musical scores and draw all the notes correctly before ever playing a single song.)  People fail at this level when they realize they aren't creative enough to come up with solutions to problems or if they struggle thinking about abstract things.  There are usually many many ways of approaching the problem, and some people can't think beyond the next few steps and often go off on a futile path.  Also, these fields tend to be poorly taught, so you have to be self motivated.  Finally, a lot of people who were the best of their class when they were taught calculation give up when they find themselves in the bottom half of the class, because they never had to work hard in math before and feel disheartened. Engineering Maths:In applied math fields, you don't need to solve any equations by hand (or at least very rarely).  You usually just let the computer do the calculation.  Instead, the important part is being able to have an intuition about equations.  This takes skills like mental estimation (guessing, not calculating), being able to understand how to describe the behavior of a system in terms of a category of equation, being able to mentally approximate the results of a model, and being able to reason about cases where your model would fail.  As a basic example: say you have a line y=ax+b.  You need to have the intuition to know that 'a' determines how fast the graph goes up and 'b' determines where the line will intersect with the axis.  People who struggle with this type of math are people who operate too mechanically, instead of taking a step back and thinking \"does this make sense\". People who are not good at visualizing graphs in their head might also struggle.   Therefore, there are different skills involved in different types of math.  If you are bad at \"school maths\" don't get disheartened!  You might still be able to become a mathematician or at least use math in your field!  Don't let calculation scare you! ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics requires an ability to study in complete isolation without getting lonely and without getting discouraged or distracted. There is a self-esteem issue, when you read something and don't understand, you feel worthless and stupid, and these blows to the ego must be shrugged off, and you just try again. It's catastrophic to the ego, because the set of stuff you can prove and other people can't is empty nearly all of the time. So irrationally inflated ego is psychologically useful, because you are going to be constantly confronting your own undeniable, quantifiable, stupidity. Irrationally inflated ego is generally associated with young males. Mathematics is also anti-rewarded by society, in that the more you study it, past a certain point, the less competent you will be at social stuff, like getting a date, because your brain will just keep getting rewired by the math, and you just get objectively smarter, and pretty soon you can't talk to anybody except other math people, because people don't understand you or find you boring, except for a small contingent of mostly young males. So by studying math, you are basically making the decision to work very hard to earn less money and be more socially awkward. So all the people who want political power just don't study it. But why would anyone study it? It's because with mathematics, there is permanent and irreversible progress--- it's been a long continuous punctuated revolution since the 1350s with no equal, except perhaps in the sciences. So you see that progress is possible in an objective way--- it is now easy to prove things that were hard or impossible even 50 years ago, and there's nothing people did 100 years ago that we don't find ridiculously easy to do today. This will go on forever. There is something else that is hard about the mathematics, which is that the pedagogy is terrible. You just can't learn it well in school, because the folks teaching you don't know the history of the field so well. There are also sticking points where mathematics contradicts intuition, and there are exactly two of these, both related: * Godel's theorem: people get discouraged by the idea that there are \"unprovable theorems\". The resolution to this is to understand the theorem, and know that it isn't saying that there are objectively \"unprovable theorems\", rather it is giving you a procedure to make axiom systems stronger, and it is perfectly reasonable to assume that all reasonable theorems become provable at some point. This is mathematician's theology--- all arithmetic conjectures will be resolved by a sufficiently large ordinal.* Continuum issues: these are the continuum hypothesis, and well-ordering the reals, and the non-measurable sets. These things are resolved by learning forcing, and by understanding the computational perspective that denies these questions having objective meaning, unlike arithmetic statements. These things were the critical issues for me. There was also some resistance to categories, but the theory there is sufficiently straightforward that you can learn it even if you hate it, and after you learn it you stop hating it. There is another issue of nonuniqueness. There are always many ways to prove something, and people have their own favorite way. So you try to prove things your own way, and you might fail, and someone else does it another way. Maybe your way is better. But sometimes people lose their own creative spark by reading too much about other people's ways. But sometimes people lose their focus by not reading other people's proofs. So who knows what's best here. Generally it's easier to learn mathematics than it has ever been, and it is much better today than 20 years ago, thanks to plentiful internet resources. In a little while it should be easy enough to make mathematical literacy (like understanding everything up to the 1950s) a reasonably universal adult skill. That will make certain progress in society, since there are certain logical fallacies, like gambling, that mathematically trained people don't make. ",
