            "answer_text": "I cannot conceive of anyone in education using the term \"education system.\" Still, languages have been making nouns into adjectives for about five thousand years or so, and English is no exception. It would be nice, and kinder to English learners, if English were to pick a standard and stick to it. Alas, English has consistently refused to do that. Many adjectives created from nouns do not change spelling and form. However, some do. Education noun became educational adjective. It is a mark of the educated to use the accepted form, so educational system it is. Note, this app has now refused to change the keyboard from letters to symbols. That is why I could not type parentheses or dashes. ",

They call it the system of education. So it must me educational system. To them education is a noun. Its adjective, educational, should go to qualify the system.Nevertheless, as Mr Lee says, it has better be a stylistic preference. ",
