            "answer_text": "this ques is asked to me many times and i always tell every one same ans , do what ever you think is right for you ask thus ques to yourself not to every one you are the only one who can decide what is right or wrong for you. In present condition PG after BDS has become compulsary that too form a good branch and good college. Mds will take approx 15 lakhx of fees if done form some private college than few lakhs more for estaishment of clinic .Dont expect any job after graduation or post graduation becouse dentistry is mainly a practice oriented field. on the other hand PSC will give you a good and reputed post according to your rank in exam but this too need a lot of hard work and dedication.3-4 years of intense studies will secure a good rank in either state psc or upsc. both the fields required hardwork and deidcation. If you want to enjoy a doctor's life go for postgraduation but it will cost both finiancially and will take time to establish. If you think you are job oriented person and want to work in public sector go for PSC. ALL THE BEST ",
