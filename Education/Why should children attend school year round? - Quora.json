            "answer_text": "The link Bob Irelan posted lays out the pros and cons to attending school year round very nicely. Other countries have year round school, and what that means is not that kids go to school without any breaks, because they do have breaks, but they don\u2019t get a long, three month vacation. They will get a week off here and there, often at the end of a term. I know several teachers, and the thing they complain about most is the \u201csummer slide\u201d, how much the kids lose (educationally, in terms of knowledge) over the summer vacation. One said that she spends nearly three months at the beginning of the school going over things from the previous year because the kids have forgotten so much over the summer, and she doesn\u2019t get to the new material until after Thanksgiving. She always says that she would prefer a year-round calendar/schedule, but follow a European model where the kids (and teachers) do get breaks, but shorter breaks, often after the end of a term, rather than getting three months off during the summer. But I can see that financially it would cause some problems for schools\u2014heating/air conditioning, utilities, and other expenses would rise because the schools would be open during the summer. And they\u2019d need to figure out how teachers can get recertified or take classes if school is in session year round (many teachers do this on their own time, during the summer). ",

            "answer_text": "there are only 180 days of school in the year. Classes are divided into 4 or 3 sessions with a certain number of days and holidays are spread out in-between the instructional days. Kids would be going to school during the summer or for part of the summer. Your children would not be going to school for the full 12 months of the year. Apparently everyone likes this. The weeks of instruction are shorter and students tend to work with that much better. Review days are less and not really needed. There are many year round schools in the USA. Canada has just started playing around with year round scheduling. There are 196 instructional days. Google: year round schools benefits. ",
