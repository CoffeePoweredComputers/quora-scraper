            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t confuse educational training with \u201cintelligence.\u201d It is not necessarily true that people with only a high school degree are not as intelligent as people with Ph.D.s in terms of raw intelligence. There are many examples of people with enormous success and high intelligence who didn\u2019t even complete college: Thomas Edison, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Abraham Lincoln, and many others, including many distinguished artists, performers, athletes, and musicians. But you confuse \u201cintelligence\u201d with \u201ctraining and accomplishment.\u201d They are in no way the same. A Ph.D. degree is not a \u201ctrophy\u201d for being smart. It is a certification for specific training to become a researcher creating new knowledge in a field. Ph.D. holders do have to work very hard to master existing knowledge in their fields, but they are not necessarily smarter than someone who didn\u2019t want to undergo that training. ",

            "answer_text": "I work out six days a week. Resistance training alternating with running. No matter what I do, I will never be a very fast runner, and as for weightlifting, it\u2019s something I do for enjoyment and health, and that\u2019s good, because I hit a muscle-building wall probably two-three years ago. I have far less muscle mass than many men who never work out, despite working hard at it. I largely endorse William Beeman's answer, but my point is this; you\u2019re talking about someone who is statistically likely to be at the low end of average intelligence and someone who is probably at least a standard deviation above that point, possibly more. You\u2019re comparing me to a competitive college runner or a competitive weightlifter. It\u2019s not a reasonable comparison. Being intelligent is a good thing, but it\u2019s not the only thing. ",
