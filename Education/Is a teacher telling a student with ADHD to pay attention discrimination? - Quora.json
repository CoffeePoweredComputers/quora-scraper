            "answer_text": "Is a teacher telling a student with ADHD to pay attention discrimination? If the teacher is embarrassing the student in front of the class by calling them out for not paying attention multiple times every day, that is a problem. It isn\u2019t discrimination, but it is offensive. Teachers do have to help kids with ADHD bring their focus back to the class and the assignment, and they may have to do that quite often. For this reason, most teachers work out ways to do that without being too embarrassing about it. They may put the ADHD student in the first row, and when they see the student mentally wandering off, they stand right in front of that student\u2019s desk, and if that isn\u2019t enough, put their hand on the student\u2019s desk. For most kids with ADHD, this will bring them back to focusing on the task at hand. If it doesn\u2019t work, the teacher might have a meeting with the student and ask them what a good way to remind them to pay attention would be, that would be most comfortable for them. Then explain to the ADHD student that the teacher will do that, but if it doesn\u2019t work, they will have to do more. In the perfect student/teacher meeting, the kid will work with the teacher to come up with an escalation scheme that works for the student. Escalation schemes work because the student doesn\u2019t want to be embarrassed, so they are more likely to respond to the lowest level of being given notice, in order to avoid the escalation. Telling a student over and over again to pay attention is not discrimination, but it is poor teaching, and something worthwhile for a parent to discuss with the teacher. Always approach teachers with respect\u2014it is the only way they are likely to respect your kid. Assume the teacher never had the \u201cescalation scheme\u201d idea explained to them, and offer to explain it to them. You never know, they might appreciate learning it, so they don\u2019t have to keep interrupting their own lessons by telling the kid to pay attention. ",

            "answer_text": "Not simply by telling them to pay attention, no.  To be discrimination you'd have to have a scenario where the teacher knows the student has ADHD and unfairly singles out the student for things they can't control, or punishes them more for certain behavior than other students who do the same things. An example scenario (made up, but similar to actual stories I've heard): Tammy has had behavior and attention problems since starting high school, and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. She has started meds, and the school has arranged a tutor and 'action plan' for her parents and teachers. This is having positive results in class and her performance is steadily improving...except in English. Tammy's English teacher doesn't believe ADHD is 'real', and thinks that Tammy's behavior is just attention-seeking.  The teacher is much harsher with Tammy than other students for things like speaking out of turn, or forgetting a reading assignment--sometimes embarrassing her in front of the class for simple mistakes.  The teacher ignores the disability provisions on the action plan (such as allowing extra time on tests/quizzes).  They refuse to give any of the accommodations in the action plan that are helping her improve in other classes, telling her that they won't 'coddle' her and that she needs to learn 'discipline'. No only that, the teacher begins to exclude Tammy (and Tammy alone) from class activities because she 'hasn't earned the privilege' of working in groups. The teacher in this scenario is targeting the student because of the student's disability. Their personal biases are what motivate their responses to Tammy way more than her actual behavior in a particular moment--and *that's* what makes it discrimination. ",
