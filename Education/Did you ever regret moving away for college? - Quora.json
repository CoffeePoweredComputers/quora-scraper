            "answer_text": "Are you kidding? It was one of the best decisions I ever made. In fact, I had no choice. When I graduated from high school. in extreme northern Minnesota, the nearest college was Bemidji State University, 112 miles away. Too close. Instead, I went to a college in Chicago, twelve hours by bus and train from my little town. I had never been to any city other than Minneapolis or Winnipeg, so this was a major transition. In addition, I had to get to know a completely different set of students. The only real disadvantage of going far away from home was the travel that I made four times a year \u2014 mostly by train and bus as the airlines had not been deregulated yet. I would leave International Falls at 4 pm and arrive in Chicago at 4 am. Although I still visit that little town at the end of the road to nowhere and have a summer cabin there, I am pleased that leaving home to go to college changed everything about the rest of my life.

It\u2019s even better when you find friends and room with them. Honestly, my biggest regret about it is money-wise. It would be really nice to live in my parents\u2019 home and not pay rent and especially not pay groceries. Plus, now that I\u2019m a little further away, if I forgot something, it\u2019s not like I can just go get it. I either have to go without or buy a new one, even though I already have one at home. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I needed to be a bit farther away from my (dysfunctional) family; I went from Minneapolis to Grinnell, Iowa, about 6 hours. There were a few breaks where it wasn\u2019t worth making the trip, like for Thanksgiving, and it was a little lonely on campus. Getting my stuff back and forth was a pain, partly since suitcases didn\u2019t have wheels yet. Overall it was much better for all of us than if I\u2019d just gone to the \u201cU\u201d and lived at home. ",
