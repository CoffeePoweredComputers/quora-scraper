            "answer_text": "I think teenagers should definitely learn to work and the value of a good job being rewarded financially. I do not think that they should give up their childhood to do what Mom and Dad should be doing, and that\u2019s supporting the family. I know at times people hit a run of bad luck and need financial help, but that should not be brought to burden the children. People don\u2019t plan ahead and save money for bad luck (I am as guilty as anyone). They live above their means and don\u2019t ever put a penny away for later. Then something unexpected happens and they are looking to their children for help. Maybe I am wrong about this and maybe I see if differently but that\u2019s not their job. Here\u2019s an example of what I deem appropriate. I have a decent house, nice vehicles and my children have generally gotten what they want through life. I am blessed to have a great job that pays fairly well and so does my wife. We did not have cable TV in our home, we used streaming services. My daughters asked if they could order satellite tv and the deal was that if they provided it for the house then I have no problems with at all. They were very happy to pay this bill monthly and both have been working hard since graduating high school. I do however sneak and pay the bill more than should though. I just hate to see their hard earned money going into something in the house, they should be saving to move out in their own and be financially sound when they do. Me and my wife will go without certain things to ensure we have enough money in savings to pay all of our bills for 3 months if need it. That way we don\u2019t burden our children. Now asking an older teenager to pay their car payment and insurance is fine if they wish to drive. If they want a new cell phone, it\u2019s great for them to save and buy it and pay for the difference in the plan price. I\u2019m not saying children can\u2019t pay some things fThey should only be paying for things that benefit them after they leave the nest. I know many peoples circumstances may be different but I am looking at it with two working parents and three children. There will be lots that disagree with me I\u2019m sure but I think our children are only young once and should be able to enjoy it, they will have to be financially responsible for their own families soon enough. Let them enjoy their childhood\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on one's family's financial circumstance. If the family is going through a financial crisis then for the teenager to take on part-time jobs while studying could help the family a lot. In worse situation where the family can no longer provide financial support for education, the young person then has to find a full-time job to support himself plus his family also. So, teenagers should only start making money for their families when the situation calls for.  In general, I think they should think about investing in themselves first, they could always make money (a lot more than part-time jobs for teenagers) later when they have got proper training & education.

They will learn to be responsible for a small amount of things they want first. By the time they are 18 if they don\u2019t go to college, and still live at home, then they should start helping with other bills. ",
