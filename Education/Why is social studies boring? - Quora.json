            "answer_text": "I will tell you how boring Social Studies was to me even with Good teachers and how it became an interesting one eventually. I was a girl who loved all subjects . Social Studies was a very interesting subject to me but it bored me at times. The only thing is that I couldn't answer many questions in History that demanded dates. I cursed many historians who was the sole reason for many wars. I couldn't also answer certain questions about Geography and about Economics. Politics too seemed as not my cup of Tea. The teachers who handled those subjects were exceptionally good but never made any change in the way we learned the subject.Thus it became a boring one. I had a ma'am who could say all dates and incidents related with INDIAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT at one stroke. All of us used to get goosebumps when that ma'am take class and she was a superb teacher. I love all my Social teachers.I used to listen well in class but I never developed a way to learn social studies with an ease. Then came a sister who seemed to be a rude woman. Her name was Sister Lucy. She was 50+ at that time. We all started hating her at the first day itself. She was too rude and her first class was utter boring. We all planned to report about her to class teacher. She used to scold all of us in various personnel and educational matters. I will give you an example: She scolded me once in front of everyone asking me why I want to let my grandfather suffer. My grandfather used to carry my brother's bag (about 10 kg) to the school. I used to accompany my friends and used to enjoy my whole trip. She once questioned me regarding this and from next day onward she made me to take the whole responsibility of my brother and then I carried both our bags. We used to get notes dictated in class by teachers. But Lucy Sister was different in all ways. She never gave us notes. We couldn't digest that at all. We all sat in her class with pin drop silence. But as time passed she became our whole class' favorite teacher. Now, I will tell you what change she made in our class. She befriended all of us with social studies text books. She took all chapters by connecting many things . She raised many questions and made us to think. Of course, this new style of teaching made us conscious at the very beginning and as time passed we thought that it was the best way. History became too easy. After taking class, she left us for combine studies and asked us to write notes by our own and made us responsible. Then she asked us to arrange all years and incidents and then learn. I was able to at-least guess the years relatively. Then about Geography. She used to explain the concepts very clearly by relating with science concepts. For example: How it rains in Kerala? The whole concept was clearer and then she asked us to watch weather news. She asked us several cases and used to discuss about the weather conditions. It made us feel that geography isn't a boring one. Coming to the case of Economics, she taught us by comparing with day to day news. She introduced Tata and Birla to us. She gave us whole freedom to ask any stupid questions. Many of us had face-palm moments in class for raising such questions because she made us how poor we were as an Indian and then she made us feel how hard we have to work on our intellectual. Then about Politics. I never ever cared about Politics until then. Even now I don't know much. But,she made us realize how important it is for us to learn about our Constitution and about the Fundamental Rights In India. She used to discuss with us about the politicians and also made us feel bad for not knowing current activities. We all started reading newspaper with utmost importance. She was a change that brought a magnificent change in me. That was the whole change she bought in our life. She made us realize many things: the need to be a real Indian. Social Studies became an easy subject then. I think Social Studies is boring only because of the way we approach that subject. If we have a good Guide, then it won't remain as boring again. Thank you so much for reading and special Thanks to DIYA Kulkarnii for asking me this beautiful question and I enjoyed writing this answer. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think the main reason that social studies can be so boring to students is that it is not made relevant to them. Most school aged young people are focused on their own social situation. That is normal; that is where they are in life. They need to find their comfort zone and where they fit in while they are constantly bombarded by commercial and peer messages telling them what that should be. In other words, students of the age that social studies becomes more complex, are at the same time expending a great deal of emotional energy just trying to survive (and hopefully succeed) in their own social situations. How could the social situations of people long ago or far away interest them when their own situation is so complex, so intense, so difficult, so all consuming?   A social studies teacher needs to help students make the connections up front between what people in other times and places did and the circumstances that led them in those directions and what today's students have do deal with in today's society.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ",
