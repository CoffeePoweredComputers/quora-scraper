            "answer_text": "It is highly demeaning\u2026to actual coyotes.  A few weeks ago, I read this book - The Line Becomes a River by Francisco Cantu (pictured on the left). Cantu was a young man just out of college who as a first generation American was highly curious about the border and so he joined the The United States Border Patrol.  The US Border Patrol is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the country. In the 234 riveting pages of the book, Cantu recounts in often graphic detail, his experiences between 2008 and 2012 when he was a Border Patrol agent.  Contrary to what the leftist media will have you to believe, BPAs are not heartless scavengers bringing down hard-working men and women only looking for a better life. In fact, most of their job involves rounding up people who are often lost in the desert, getting them to safety and then deporting them back to Mexico. In fact, it can be argued that their job SAVES thousands of Mexican lives each year.  If there is one villain that does emerge in the book, it is the coyotes - the smugglers who bring people (and drugs) into America. Coyotes often charge upwards of $4,000 for a one-way ticket into America (average annual wage in Mexico is about $10,000). The people being brought in are also asked to carry drugs with them. But payment is not where it stops.  For your $4,000 you would be getting a mystery box - being stuffed in a car, wandering across the desert, coming across in a raft - can be anything. All these journeys would last days or even weeks and you won\u2019t have little or no access to food and water during that time. In fact, just to keep your energy up, Coyotes have created caffeine tablets which will give you a boost but also dehydrate you (water is important in a desert, by the way).  But even if you go through all that and get into the country, you aren\u2019t home, yet. Coyotes will often hold their customers hostage in a safe house across the border until their family pays them a few more thousands of dollars to let them go free. If they don\u2019t pay, well, I suppose you can figure out what usually happens then.  In contrast, the coyote (animal) is just a canine found in America similar to the jackals that we have in India - they live in packs but mostly hunt alone or in pairs. Generally, they keep to themselves unless they sense prey. I would call this a far more noble existence. ",

Now, the term \u201ccoyote\u201d is also used in other parts of Mexico to refeer to lawyers or administrative representive that specialiaze in obtaining licenses, permits or other official documents. A few are only experts in fill the, innecesarily complicated, forms and search the records for lost precedents, others use shadier ways to obtain the authorizations. In Mexican traditions coyotes, the animal, have a reputation to be witty, resourcefull and somewhat irreverent, although they are dangerous predators if the circunstances allow. To be compared with a Coyote is not particulary insulting to a human bening, most of the time. ",
