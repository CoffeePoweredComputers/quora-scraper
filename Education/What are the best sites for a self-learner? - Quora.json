            "answer_text": "Just about everybody and their brother is going to mention some kind of online course platform. That seems like good advice, and for some it is. I think there is a better path. If you are a self-learner the best thing you can do is put the learning into action in a practical way. Here is how I learn things... When I was in junior high, I wanted to learn how to program computers. Actually, I wanted to make my own video games someday. So, I got a book Teach Yourself C in 21 Days and I read it. More importantly, I started writing software right away. As I got better, I kept building more things. Eventually I could make simple games like Pong.  This was in the 1990's and there wasn't Google or much in the way of good way to find a lot of this information outside of the bookstore. So I kept getting books and I kept building things.  If I were to do the same thing today, taking courses might be a decent way to learn, but I think the most important skill to a self learner is to be comfortable with the uncertainty of not knowing how to solve a problem, then going out and finding the answer on your own by building or doing whatever you are trying to achieve. If I were to pick a site for a self-learner, I would pick Google and YouTube. Between the two whenever you run into a problem you an find some direction on how to solve it.  -Brian P.S.
