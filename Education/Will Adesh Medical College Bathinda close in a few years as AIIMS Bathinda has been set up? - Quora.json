            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really think so. And there are multiple reasons for that. Medical colleges are not primary schools where students from the city only come and join. So, if a new and big one has come, the old will not get studentsMedical seats are anyways in scarcity. 15 lac students appear in NEET UG and there are only 70k seats. So, new colleges are anyways required.Even if the above two were not true, Adesh and AIIMS cater to two very different kind of markets. AIIMS has top students and is at a very low price point whereas Adesh caters to students from strong financial backgrounds and relatively low NEET scores.So, there should be no impact. Adesh, or for that matter, any medical college will shut down if its not fulfilling the conditions set forth by MCI, and that is what Adesh would have to ensure. A few students from our institute are studying at Adesh and my interaction with them says that the college is doing great and should not face any problem. ",
