            "answer_text": "Depends on a) which school board you study in and b) when you plan to take the SAT. If you study an Indian board like ICSE and want to take the SAT in the 10th, you should probably start studying soon, because the question styles will be unfamiliar and it will take a while to get used to them. However, remember that a lot of material that you need to study for the SAT will be covered in school itself especially in the 11th and 12th grades. I personally did better on the math section of my sat when I took it at the end of 11th as opposed to the beginning. In other words if you want to take the SAT in the 10th you must study now, but I would recommend taking it during your 11th and start studying later instead (especially for the math section). ",

            "answer_text": "No. Please don\u2019t start so early. The SAT is usually taken around mid-11th Grade to beginning of 12th Grade. In my opinion, it is a total overkill if you start studying for it in 9th grade. Go chill in school man, the 10th boards will kill you anyway. Why do more work than required. ",
