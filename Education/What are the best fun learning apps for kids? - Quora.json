            "answer_text": "While looking for learning apps for kids. There are two main factors that we need to consider. The actual learning imparted through the app. You will find many fun apps out there on store, which are really good when the fun part is considered, but scores very low on learning. So they end up being just another fun game. The second parameter is kids engagement in the app. Its very important that the kid remain engaged. If you have some app that is playing some rhymes only, it won\u2019t help kid in learning as much as an app that asks kids to perform some tasks. Based on the above. I love the following app. Preschool Monkey : Kids Games on the App Store  The above app has got various learning activities, best suited for 2 to 4 years old. The app is simple to use. ",
