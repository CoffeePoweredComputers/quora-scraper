            "answer_text": "hey there!! I\u2019ve been there when i was tryna prepare for the exam myself, so i think i\u2019ll be able to help you out! firstly , know that the exam is a scholarship based and questions include even ntse-kvpy level ones as well. so you need to focus on strengthening your concepts and finding strong points. since there\u2019s negative marking, be sure not to beat around the bush and end up merely guessing answers. practice sample papers and this will help you to know the difficulty level of the exam. ps: the test is written and qualified by smart brains , so before sitting for the screening test, think twice to see if you can really put in efforts and work your ass off for the next two years.all the best!!
