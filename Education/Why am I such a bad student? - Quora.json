            "answer_text": "Why aren\u2019t you studying? Seriously though, you probably aren\u2019t. I could say the more correct thing, that everybody is different and adequate in their own way and each one has their own kind of intelligence that defines them and they have developed. Which is true. I am great academically, but my book-allergic father can fix just about anything he sets his eyes on (and swears at a couple of times), while I am left stumped. Seriously, he\u2019s a joiner and makes it look easy. You know how hard it is to cut a simple bloody straight line in a lump of wood? Harder than you\u2019d think\u2026 not as hard as seeing him look at me with those disappointed eyes\u2026 But that\u2019s the whole point I\u2019m trying to make here. Each and every person has something they\u2019re good at. All you need to do is find out what it is and develop that, work at it till you can do it properly. If you\u2019re a bad student that\u2019s probably because you have no interest in what is being taught, which is understandable. Learning crap you don\u2019t care about is suffocating. And if you\u2019re a bad student that means that your energy and your mind is focused elsewhere, which isn\u2019t bad (unless your smuggling drugs into the country by stuffing chihuahuas full of cocaine\u2026 shit, I shouldn\u2019t have said that) So, from what I\u2019ve rambled on here for a few good minutes, you can see two options: Option One, scrape through understanding that you are a bad student and do whatever it is you want to do. You\u2019d be surprised how few specialists of anything there are these days. Option Two, work at it. If it takes work to do something you\u2019re already good at well, then it\u2019s gonna be a lot harder for something you aren\u2019t good at. Which will mean more work of your goal and your passion involves you learning crap you won\u2019t really need. I did science math in college and I still have no idea what the fuck logarithms are, or how I passed. But here I am,studying History at University. Becasue it is what I love. Option three, and yeah I know I said two before, but this really ain\u2019t about that; if you\u2019re not any of the above and are just whining on the Internet, then drag your head out of your arse and study, or do fractions or whatever. Fucking logarithms. Can someone please tell me what they are for? Oh yeah, if you\u2019re wondering what I was going to say when I said I could tell you\u2026 (which I just did), then cheat. You\u2019ll get caught, but cheat if you want to.Mum\u2019ll be disappointed, your classmates will hate you for it and the teacher won\u2019t let you do it again. Cheating\u2019s the brightest way to ostracism! ",

            "answer_text": "Since I was a2a, how would I know? Perhaps you are just stupid. However, I\u2019ve read and believe that life is not about one\u2019s strengths or limits, it is about achievement to the best of one\u2019s ability. With regard to learning, starting can be the hardest part of any project. Mentally or in writing divide the project into do-able elements. Then start doing one of the elements (even if just collecting the materials), that will facilitate other work on the project. Knowing the material involves committing much of the information to memory. I believe the best way to learn something is to read it, write it, and say it; the three different actions help by utilizing different areas of the brain, and doing each action in close proximity time-wise links them together and strengthens the memory. The more this is repeated, the more one is likely to remember the material. And, do some research on mnemonic techniques. Ariely (2009) wrote about research into procrastination with regard to academic courses. One class set their own deadlines for three papers at any time prior to the end of the course, one class had no deadlines, and one class was required to meet specific deadlines spacing the papers evenly across the course (\u201cdictatorial treatment\u201d). Those with dictated deadlines were found to have achieved the best grades. The problem with setting one\u2019s own deadlines was apparently a lack of objectivity in setting those personal deadlines. Although those in the second group that set reasonable and objective deadlines for themselves did as well as those with dictated deadlines. Any project usually has elements (collect materials, read the material, write, etc.). Force yourself to take the first small step, usually this leads to further effort. \u201cWell begun is half done.\u201d Benjamin Franklin Transcript of \"A simple way to break a bad habit\" http://www.quora.com/How-do-you-build-a-habit In 1949, Hebb published theorization on the neurological process of thought, and also produced theorization, later designated the Hebb repetition effect, wherein evidence concerning task learning and unlearning has been studied (as cited in Couture, Lafond, & Tremblay, 2008). Hebb's theorization centered on three postulates: 1) That neurological connections increase in proportion to their correlated synaptic activity; 2) The activity of neurons firing as a group after a triggering event tends to persist and represents that event; and, 3) Thinking consists of the sequential activation of these groups of firing neurons, or sets of cell assemblies (as cited in Klein, 1999). This process has been described as neurons that fire together wire together. The Hebb repetition effect is primarily examined through recall of numerical sequences; however, the effect has not been found to be restricted by the nature of the inputs, since it has been found to hold true for words, verbal communication, and spatial sequences (Couture et al., 2008). Subsequent advancements in biochemistry, technology, and computational algorithms have modified the understanding of the processes, but have not significantly altered Hebb\u2019s theories (Sejnowski, 2003). Gagne, Briggs, and Wager (1992) identified three empirically supported principles of learning design that improve learning and make retention more certain: 1) Contiguity: simultaneous stimulus and response; 2) Repetition; and, 3) Reinforcement: satisfaction or reward follows the act. But keep in mind the need to not over-do it, I\u2019ve read that 20 minute segments tend to work best (take a break, then resume): \u201cExperiments have shown that repetitions beyond the satiation point lead to variation, inattentiveness, fatigue, and finally to a complete disorganization; in other words to an \u2018unlearning\u2019 in the sense of inability to carry out an activity previously mastered.\u201d Kurt Lewin, 1951 References: Ariely, D.

Recalling: Try to frequently recall the main ideas of what you are learning...or try generating ideas from within yourself... 'I wonder what this means?'. 2. Testing: Use any method you can to test yourself all the time (recall, applying, asking others opinions etc.). 3. Chunking: Pretend what you are trying to learn is a song...learn to play it over and over again in your mind. In this way the information combines into a chunk you can access when needed. 4. Spacing: Your brain is like a muscle and needs a break now and again. Don't try to learn everything at once...spread the learning out over time. 5. Alternating: Practice different techniques for learning. A single approach is sub-optimal. Try writing things down, creating pictures, constructing a quiz etc. 6. Breaking: Taking breaks from a problem or a challenge allows the brain to take over and do some thinking in the background. 7. Questioning: Consider how you could explain a problem, challenge etc. in a way that a ten year old could understand? Using analogies can help. 8. Focusing: Turn off all interrupting things (phone, computer etc.) then set a timer for 20 minutes and focus on the one thing you are working on. 9. Thinking: Do the hardest thinking and problem solving early in the day when you and your mind are fresh. 10. Contrasting: Dream of where your learning is taking you (outcomes, insights, solutions, etc.) and then create a picture or words to describe that outcome. Reminding yourself periodically of the desired outcome (looking at the picture, reading the words) will motivate you to achieve greater learning. Prof. Barbara Oakley: http://www.academybridge.org/?video_listing=learn-to-learn \u201cLife is without meaning. You bring the meaning to it. The meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be. Being alive is the meaning.\u201d Joseph Campbell (1904-1987) \u201cSelf-pity is easily the most destructive of the nonpharmaceutical narcotics; it is addictive, gives momentary pleasure and separates the victim from reality.\u201d John W. Gardner \u201cThe difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack in will.\u201d Vince Lombardi \u201cExperience is not what happens to you, it\u2019s what you do with what happens to you.\u201d Aldous Huxley \u201cAll life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish, and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today. \u201d Pope Paul VI Confucious (551 BCE-479 BCE): \u201cSuccess depends upon previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to be failure.\u201d  \u201cReal knowledge is to know the extent of one\u2019s ignorance.\u201d \u201cIt does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.\u201d \u201cThe will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential \u2026 these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.\u201d \u201cThe brick walls are there for a reason. \u2026 The brick walls are there to stop the people who don\u2019t want it badly enough.\u201d Randy Pausch, Last Lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo ",
