            "answer_text": "Thanks Gufran for requesting the answer. Assuming you are in class 10th or just cleared it & looking for completing Senior Secondary form NIOS. In NIOS, class 11th & 12th(Senior Secondary) are combined. Its not separate as in CBSE or ICSE Board. So you can directly take admission & clear the Senior Secondary altogether. All The Best. Upvote & follow if you are satisfied with the answer. ",
