            "answer_text": "I think the most common practice is to use each semester grade separately. When you want a fairly accurate measurement it works better that way. Assume a student who has all A grades every semester but one and that is a B. Using semester grades accurately shows his average performance. If he gets an A on an annual basis for every year that B disappears. But it shouldn\u2019t. And if he gets a B for that year it doesn\u2019t accurately reflect that he got an A for half of one course. SO having more data points increases the validity of his GPA as a ranking measurement. ",

            "answer_text": "The GPA is calculated in the way your school calculates it. Most VT schools with year-long courses use the final course grades for the official number, but they\u2019ll calculate an unofficial one using the first semester grades instead of the full term if they need to report them to colleges. Block schedule schools naturally use the entire course grade because the entire course lasts just one semester. ",
