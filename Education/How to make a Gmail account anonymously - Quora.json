Every day we use email to communicate with our colleagues, friends, and family. Usually, we never give privacy a second thought when writing out a quick email. But, there are times when sending an email anonymously is an absolute necessity. If the information got out it would be compromising, embarrassing, or even dangerous. Chances are, you don\u2019t need to send 100% of your emails anonymously, but when the need arises you\u2019ll want to know how to do it. Below you\u2019ll learn what anonymous email is and how it works, so you can start sending your own anonymous emails. Table of contents What is Anonymous EmailHow Anonymous Email WorksAnonymous Email vs Regular EmailHow Much Does it CostHow to Create Anonymous Email AccountHow to Send Anonymous EmailOther Free AlternativesTransitioning From Current Email to Private EmailCan You Use Outlook for Anonymous Email?In ClosingWhat is Anonymous Email? In our digital world, almost every facet of our lives is out in the open. Unless you take the extra steps to protect and defend your privacy. Email is something we use every single day. We spend hours in our inboxes and often share personal information we want to keep private.  An anonymous email account is a must-have for situations like: Journalists who need to communicate privately with a sourcePeople who are concerned about privacy and feel the need to go anonymousTelling the truth, or whistleblowing, without a connection to your identityAnonymous email gives you the ability to send an email that can\u2019t trace back to you. It won\u2019t contain any personal identifying information. There are multiple methods of achieving this: Sending emails through a proxy server, so your location is invisible.Omitting personal information, like the identity of the user, the reply address, or the message time stampUsing fake contact information when creating a general email account to mask your identityStill, anonymous email accounts can be used for less than upstanding purposes. Like a hacker using an anonymous email address to send a malicious email containing a virus.  These emails will contain a link that\u2019ll install a virus or malware on the user\u2019s computer to gain sensitive information. I know you won\u2019t do this, but there can be some negative associations built into anonymous emailing. ",

            "answer_text": "Before I say anything else, it\u2019s important to clearly state that your anonymity entirely depends on your opsec. If you follow the tips I provide here but then have poor opsec, you won\u2019t be anonymous. It\u2019s important to learn about opsec and related subjects before even considering yourself \u201canonymous\u201d. That being said, here are a few simple tips. Use Tor - it\u2019s one of the best tools you can use to encrypt and anonymize your connection. You could theoretically use an alternative like I2P and be just as safe, but since we\u2019re talking about email, you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to use I2P anyway.Don\u2019t allow JavaScript - You can conveniently do this in the Tor Browser by setting the security bar to \u201csafest\u201d which would disable JavaScript. This will limit which email providers you can sign up for, but if anonymity is a concern you probably can\u2019t risk running JavaScript. If you absolutely have to use JavaScript for a good reason, like for encrypted webmail for example, then I\u2019d at least sandbox Tor Browser to mitigate any damage that could be done. In said scenario, keep your security settings on \u201cSafest\u201d and allow your providers domain in NoScript.Use a secure & anonymous operating system - In short, use Tails or Qubes + Whonix. They\u2019re two of the best options. Using Whonix on another host operating system could also work, you\u2019d just probably be less secure.Don\u2019t provide identifiable information - This doesn\u2019t just include the obvious like providing your name and such, but it includes your browser fingerprint and anything else that could identify you. Using the Tor Browser would help with the fingerprinting problem, but you also have to be careful with other identifiers such as how you type or how you use their website. Don\u2019t type in your browser, copy and paste from a text editor, and don't stand out with your usage if possible. This also ties in to your opsec which I mentioned before.Use encryption - Encrypt your emails with PGP to prevent your provider from reading your emails and further identifying you with whatever information they can scrape together from them.Use a good provider - This should also be obvious but it has to be said. Don\u2019t bother trying to be \u201canonymous\u201d in Gmail, it just won\u2019t happen. Use a reputable no logs provider which you can trust. And by trust I mean the bare minimum of trust, no matter which provider you chose, you should ultimately never trust them.",
