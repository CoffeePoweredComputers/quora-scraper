            "answer_text": "A2A. It would have been useful if you gave details about yourself. Otherwise the answer depends on a lot of other factors. TL;DR: It is not impossible, but very hard. Longer version: Typically, preparing a topic for JEE requires you to execute the following steps in order1) Go through all the concepts of that topic, and get an intuitive feel of most of them.2) Solve simpler problems, to understand how to use various concepts and formulas.3) Move to harder problems. Now working with hard problems requires considerable amount of effort and time. You need to spend 10-60 minutes for each problem you don't know how to solve. How much exact time you spend on each problem depends on what all concepts you think may be applicable. Basically, till you can think of even a single direction that may help you reach the solution, you should go on to solve the problem that way, without looking at the answer. Then, once you have solved the problem or have exhausted all possible ways you can think of, look at the solution. If your solution differs from the correct solution, you need to understand the difference, so that you know exactly when not to use your method and use the method in the solution.4) Once you have gone through all problems, you have gathered all concepts of the topic. You now need to become more comfortable with the topic, by practising the harder problems repeatedly. You can find a more detailed description of the approach in this answer of mine:Prashant Sharma's answer to Suggestions on how to get a rank below 1000 in JEE So now I think it is evident that all of this requires considerable amount of time, and I have little hope that it can be completed in 2 months for many topics. However, if you're really smart, you might just be able to squeeze all of this into 2 months. ",
