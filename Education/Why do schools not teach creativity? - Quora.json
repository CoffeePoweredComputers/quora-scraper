            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t teach creativity. It\u2019s a gift some children have. All we can do is to give opportunities for them to be creative or logical or analytical and this might turn a spark into a fire. I work in England and we are told what to teach, but not HOW to teach. I\u2019ll try to illustrate what I mean and how this affects creativity: The National Curriculum for Geography at KS1 states that children should: understand geographical similarities and differences through studying the human and physical geography of a small area of the United Kingdom, and of a small area in a contrasting non-European country. Teacher 1: Via a PowerPoint, tells the children about their town in England and then tells the children about a town in India. They might read a few bits and pieces, then fill in a worksheet and draw a picture. Teacher 2: Takes the children on a tour of their local town where they identify the human and physical features. Back in the classroom, they categorise them. They do a study of local businesses and shops and when a child suggests they do a survey, she goes with it. Some of the children in the class are from India. She speaks to their parents and they happily bring in Indian food to taste. Although they are a little shy at first, she gets them to talk about life in India and where they came from. The children share their memories too of visits to India. The classroom is transformed into an Indian marketplace selling saris, spices and jewellery. The children use what they experienced to write poetry. They watch some of the film \u201cJungle Book\u201d and talk about whether or not it\u2019s real. The teacher gives out resources and guides a web-search on animals that can be found in India. They make informative PowerPoints about Indian Animals and share them with their friends. They come to the conclusion that Rudyard Kipling was right! So, they find out more about the author and some children notice the connection between the book and the names of their leaders at Beavers (Scouts for young kids). The teacher reads a short extract of the actual book and compare it with the film. In art lessons, they are given outlines of elephants on card, different shiny papers, sequins and glue. Every elephant produced is different. They create peacocks from handprints, feathers, more sequins and lots of glue. It\u2019s messy but very colourful. They make tiger masks from paper plates. Guess which teacher I am? ",

            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s not on the BIG IMPORTANT STATE TESTS. Because the only way to see if a kid learned anything is to test them (according to the \u2018experts\u2019), teachers are forced to teach to the test, and anything that doesn\u2019t have to do with helping kids pass those thrice damned tests have to go away. So no recess in elementary schools, fewer electives, less choice about what teachers can teach in the classroom. Creativity isn\u2019t something that is easily measured in a scantron test so it\u2019s not important to a teacher whose job is on the line. ",
