            "answer_text": "Reading is a fundamentally important skill and there is no ceiling on improvement - every student and every adult can become a better reader. Every year of school - not just the years of security nearly school - should have as a goal improving students' ability to read and that's done through - instruction. Further familiarizing students with their language's literature is enriching as well - literature fiction as well as a non- fiction is a mirror held up to life. Reading literature fosters reflection on life - and lives better lived. ",
