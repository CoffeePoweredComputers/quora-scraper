            "answer_text": "I believe that it has been made clear that Jungkook is non religious. I would like to point out that this does not mean he is not Christian. When talking about a religious Christian people are usually actually referring to a Catholic. I myself am Christian and I am non religious. We don't practice any specific rituals. We pray and we may bow in certain moments. I am a fan of showing my belief through jewellery so I often wear bracelets or necklaces with crosses. Jungkook is seen on multiple occasions with one of these two options. Kookie also has been seen bowing and/or making gestures similar to those of famous Christians. On many occasions he will make references to \u201cgod.\u201d This of course could be any god so it doesn't mean he is definitely Christian but it definitely sounds like he isn't atheist. Nothing can be 100% until Jungkook confirms it so this is all speculation but if I had to guess I'd say he was a non religious Christian. ",
