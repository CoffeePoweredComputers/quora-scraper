            "answer_text": "Excellent question, first off from a practical stand point, I would say no:  Courtesy: Flickr, undermingme, distraction No, because if you have an interest in too many things. What will happen is that you will find yourself switching from subject to subject. \u201cThe man who chases two rabbits, catches neither.\u201d ~ Confucius By having interest in too many subjects, you will not be able to focus on what truly matters to you and if you are doing figuring out right now what you need to focus on, you will drift through life on autopilot wondering where all the time went. Let me give you a story of how KFC was formed. Colonel Sanders (The Founder of KFC) did not even find the company until 1930 at the age of 40, why is that? He simply did not know what he wanted, or maybe he did he just did not have a good grasp on what that was before he hit the age of 40. He hit job after job, selling various items, operating a ferry boat, dishwasher, until when he worked at a Shell station and decided to start KFC (1).  Courtesy: Wikipedia, Colonel Sanders Now you might be thinking he was still a success, but really, should it take that long to find something that you are really passionate about and then decide to make money at it? I say you can do that now. You can do that by learning how to have selective focus, like with the 5/25 technique that Warren Buffet emphasizes. Realize that the sooner you can find three things that you are really passionate about, the better and more clear life will be. Now on the other hand, if you are very young (say just starting college), it would be all right to have some interest in some subjects. For knowing what you want to do will take some time, but do that 5/25 rule that Warren Buffet emphasizes. Do you need to know the right answer to your next action? No because do any of us ever get it right? Do any of us get every decision we make spot on or perfect? No, it is completely impossible to do. Uncertainty will exist in all of us, regardless of the situation that we are in. But by putting your best foot forward in actually learning about yourself, figuring out what you really care about, knowing what you want out of life and like Nike, just doing it, Life will be a lot more crystal clear.
