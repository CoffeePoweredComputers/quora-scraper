            "answer_text": "Few worst animal parents What if your mother feed you for 12 days after you were born ,after that if she leaves you for finding herself a date. This is the heights of selfishness. Harp Seal mother comes under this category.Mothers of these Harp Seal are highly dedicated for the first twelve days.Once the feeding is over, that\u2019s it for mother-child bonding\u2014she\u2019s out of there, ready to mate again.  Unlike many other species with such abrupt weaning periods, the harp seal pup can\u2019t go on to survive on its own yet. Instead it is left stranded on the ice for the next month and a half, leaving it incredibly vulnerable to predators. The babies will lose half of their body weight during this lengthy fasting period. Finally, when they are about eight weeks old, they are ready to swim and are able to start hunting for their own food. With a childhood like this, it\u2019s no wonder that at least 30% of all pups die during their first year. 2. What if your mother leaves you in a stranger's house and she kill stranger's offspring. Now you are raised by stranger thinking you as their own offspring. They are cuckoos.They are the mother of laziness.  The cuckoo tricks other birds into raising her own youngster,freeing her up to enjoy life as a single bird. She does this by laying her eggs in the nest of another bird. 3. What if your mother gets two chocolates and give both of them to your twin and none to you. Panda mother is worse than this.Despite the fact that pandas often have twins, they almost never care for more than one cub. The mom will choose the weaker of the two babies and start ignoring him or her in favor of the stronger sibling.  4. What will your mother do if you and your sibling starts fighting? She will stop your fight. But that is not with the case of Black Eagle . Black Eagle mom often just watches the fight, even when the older, stronger chick ends up killing the younger sibling.  P.S. We(me and you) should be grateful that we were born humans and we don't have mother of these kind. @Sai Krishna (\u0938\u093e\u0908\u0902 \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923) ",
