            "answer_text": "Scholarships are given based on your profile. Universities check at these things before giving scholarships: For Canada and USA: High school gradesSAT( If submitted)Statement of purposeLetter of explanationany extra exam like euclid mathematics test which is taken by university of waterloo.If your profile is good, then chances of getting scholarship is high. There are many universities that offer scholarships to students. There are different types of scholarships: University Scholarships: University Scholarships have two types:i. Entrance scholarships: Most universities have entrance scholarships for which you will be considered as soon as you apply to the university. If your profile will be good enough, they will offer you the scholarship. ii. Application based scholarships: Now, many universities have application based scholarships as well. You will have to fill up a separate application to get the scholarship. These scholarships can be very specific like scholarships for girls who are studying computer science. 2. External scholarships: There are many external scholarships as well provided by external organisation to students studying abroad. Like Microsoft provides scholarships to international student studying computer science in USA or Canada. Apply for as many scholarships you can. This will increase the chance of getting the scholarships. That\u2019s what I did. What if you feel your profile is not exceptional ? Apply to Affordable Universities : Many international students apply to universities which are not very expensive. Some affordable universities are: Memorial University: Memorial university stands on the top of the affordable university with good ranking. It is pretty good and it is located in St.John\u2019s which is not an expensive city.The tuition of memorial is $11000/year and the cost of staying on campus is around 4500/semester which includes both food and staying. Some cheap universities in Canada are: Brandon university, Canadian Mennonite university, South Alberta institute of technology, Kings university college, Concordia university of Edmunton. You can apply in one of them. Please do not think that these universities are not good because they are cheap, they are government funded. They are pretty good too Note: I also have a YouTube channel. If you are planning to come to Canada, you can check out my channel. I upload many important videos for international students which will help you ease the process of studying abroad. Please check out my channel once.

            "answer_text": "GRE/GMAT+TOEFL/IELTS I have applied in universities in the States and have got the scholarship in 3 universities- I have a GRE of 315, TOEFL-110 and GPA-3.83/4 Syracuse-10k USD UTD-50 % for the first year of my graduate studies Drexel University-20k USD -Your GRE score plays a very important role and the higher the score the better the chances are to get the scholarship. -Your overall profile also does play an equally vital role as you have to prove it to them that you are a student who they should not miss on and you are worth every bit. But what I feel is that they shortlist on your GRE score and GPA, basically, you should have a profile which is worthy for them to fund your education. -You also have to convince the university that you don't have enough funds to sponsor your education but you are a deserving student and you will be the best choice for there university. I have seen people who are really rich and write such stories to get schoalrships but again some universities will ask you for your bank statements and other proofs as a piece of evidence for your financial status. -Getting good LOR from renowned faculties can be of great help and can boost your application when they recommend you for a scholarship. I had 2 of my faculties recommend me and they are reputed faculties of VIT which I guess did help me. -There are 3 deadlines for most if the universities i.e-Early Bird, Priority and Final. Submitting your application in the early bird will help you and will brighten your chance to get a good scholarship. -Scholarships will help you a lot for the long run as it is something to write about in your resume and also the total estimated cost of masters can come down to 40\u201350 lakhs and sometimes even lower.
