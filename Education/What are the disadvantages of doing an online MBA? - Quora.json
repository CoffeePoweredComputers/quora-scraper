            "answer_text": "There are a few significant disadvantages in doing an online MBA vs. a full-time residential MBA experience. Some of them are obvious. Some less so. Even if you are in a blended online program, your face-to-face engagement with both your classmates and the faculty will be limited to non-existent. In residential programs, the most significant learning experience any student receives is through this interaction. Truth is, much of the learning in an MBA program comes from the sharing of work experiences from other students. You will miss much of this\u2014though not all\u2014in an online environment.The more limited engagement that results in an online program also leads to another major disadvantage: the greater difficulty in creating enduring bonds with your classmates and the faculty that lets you graduate with a truly supportive and enduring network of smart, ambitious people. Yes, you will make friends in your online MBA program. But it can never be the same as spending two years with each other in a residential program.While many online MBA programs, particularly the best, offer coaching and career development services, they are not equivalent to what you would get in a residential experience where mainstream recruiters come to campus to present to and to interview students for open jobs. And the amount of one-on-one attention you would get in a residential program from coaching and mentoring programs vastly exceeds what you would tend to get in an online environment.While the stigma of an online degree is eroding, some employers may not treat your education the same way they would treat a residential experience. I think this attitude will continue to fade over time, particularly when you can explain why you chose an online option, especially if it comes from a well known school, such as IU\u2019s Kelley program, UNC, USC, Rice, or Florida.We recently did an extensive survey of alumni from the top online MBA programs to measure their satisfaction with the experience, the results are quite telling and I think you would be interested in them: Student Satisfaction In Best Online MBAs ",

            "answer_text": "Actually none. I am very glad that I did an online MBA degree which was quite productive for me. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t invest a lot of money, but I still learnt and grew a lot in my career. I am a midlevel manager in banking industry with a passion in marketing, human resources, finance and leadership especially influential leadership which rely on scientifically proven mechanics of influence. Recently, I was thinking of a way to have a proven and also internationally accredited MBA degree. I even considered the option to stop working for a year or so, and then continue my studies. Fortunately, I found an online MBA degree (International MBA Institute) based in Zurich, Switzerland. They have been accredited by USA authorities, so they can serve worldwide recognised MBA degrees. Not only for the students in EU, but worldwide. Their degree programs didn\u2019t only let me get my degree while I was professionally working, but also they filled me with a lot good lessons and techniques that I can use and apply in my pursuit of influential leadership. They provide outstanding online study material, all free of charge by the way, which helped me enhance, structure and organise my knowhow, see them in perspective within the big picture of a decent business understanding. Like a a leader I would say! ;) After some weeks of self-studying and a lot of readings in the evenings, I have successfully completed the requirements of their MBA Leadership, MBA Finance and MBA Marketing degrees. I achieved these degrees for a small fraction of other degrees out there. All these three degrees costed me for less than USD 1,300. I think one single of their degrees costs even less than USD 500 if you only have a limited budget. Starting with them is quite straight forward. Go to their home page and subscribe their \u201cBetter MBA\u201d community which deliver you your study books free of charge. Furthermore, their newsletter is the best newsletter I have seen so far which is full of interesting piece lessons, knowhow and sometimes good offers. I am only pleased to have worked with International MBA Institute. They do such a great job at super reasonable prices! Btw they have superb customer service too. Don\u2019t make a decision before checking their MBA degrees from here: http://www.mba-institute.org If you would like to start your degree right away, they accept new enrolments from the following link: http://www.mba-institute.org/Register_MBA_Certification_Program.php Good luck..
