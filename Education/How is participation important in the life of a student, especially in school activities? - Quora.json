            "answer_text": "Participation is key to success in school. Although you may think you can finish high school by participating minimally, life will teach you otherwise. When I transitioned from high school to college, I believed I enter class, take notes, and leave. For some courses, this process was accurate, but for others it was false. Certain classes, especially upper-level ones, require active participation from all students. If you do not participate, you receive a lower grade. Participating in high school is essential to future success. Irrespective of whether you attend college or start working after high school, you must show others you are engaged in what you do. This successful mindset will help in school activities, clubs, and extracurriculars because all require commitment. How else would you demonstrate your commitment other than acknowledging verbally your thoughts. You need not be Shakespeare, but you should show others you are interested. ",
