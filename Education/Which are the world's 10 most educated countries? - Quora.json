            "answer_text": "These are the 11 most educated countries in the world Harvard University Janias Tobias Werner/Shutterstock The World Economic Forum, a nonprofit foundation, has ranked the most educated countries in the world as part of its annual Global Competitiveness Report. The WEF created the index using a variety of objective and subjective measures. Each country's score, from 1 to 7, is based on factors including secondary education enrollment rate and tertiary education enrollment rate - which means the number of people who studied either at university or an equivalent, such as a nursing college. The score is also based on answers provided by business leaders from each country, to five questions including the following: In your country, how well does the education system meet the needs of a competitive economy? And: In your country, to what extent do companies invest in training and employee development? The lowest possible score is 1, and the highest is 7. European countries dominate the list, even though it is a non-European country that tops it. In particular, Scandivian countries feature heavily, partly because public expenditure in the region is generally very high. Here is a look at the full list.  11. Iceland Reykyavik, the capital of Iceland source Dennis van de Water/Shutterstock Score: 5.9 (1 is the lowest educational standard, 7 is the highest) The tiny Nordic country of Iceland has a population of 330,000. Although it ranks highly in the global index, it spends the least on educational spending of the Nordic countries.  10. New Zealand FLICKR/Lo\u00efc Lagarde Score: 5.9 New Zealand constantly ranks among the top education systems in the world. The country's education department is innovative: in September, the government outlined plans to introduce online education courses, whereby students are not required to attend school on certain days of the week.  9. Australia Shutterstock Score: 5.9 Australia is a well-educated country, and has a particularly high proportion of tertiary-educated adults. 43% of adults have trained at an institution after leaving school - that's behind only Canada, Japan, Israel, Korea, the US, and the UK.  8. United States Janias Tobias Werner/Shutterstock Score: 5.9 A large proportion of adults in America have a university education - 43%. That is the fifth highest proportion in the OECD.* *The OECD is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an intergovernmental group of 34 developed countries.  7. Norway Reuters Score: 5.9 Norway has high levels of taxation and invests heavily in education. It devotes an annual expenditure of approximately\u00a311,000 ($14,000) per pupil from primary to tertiary education - the third highest figure in the OECD.  6. Denmark Getty Score: 5.9 Denmark is the OECD country that spent the largest share of its wealth on education, with a total expenditure on educational institutions of 7.9% of its GDP. It is a major priority in the country: it was one of the few countries where education expenditure actually grew during the financial crash of 2008-2010.  5. Belgium Shutterstock Score: 6.0 In Belgium, higher education pays: unemployment rates for those with a tetiary education is just 3%. Unemployment rates are lower than the European average for every other level of education, too. Teaching is a well-paid profession in the country: teachers salaries are on average \u00a357,000 ($74,000) adjusted for purchasing power. The OECD average is \u00a339,000 ($52,000).  4. Switzerland Shutterstock Score: 6.0 A large majority of Switzerland's population has attained a full secondary education: 86% of 25-64 year olds. The country spends a lot on it: an average of \u00a312,500 ($16,000) per student per year, compared to the EU average of \u00a37,500 ($9,500).  3. Netherlands kavalenkava volha/Shutterstock Score: 6.1 The Dutch rank highly in many fields of education. A third of Dutch 25-64 year olds hold a university degree, which is significantly higher than the OECD average of 24%.  2. Finland Reuters Score: 6.2 Finland's education system is widely-acclaimed, especially since a 2010 documentary, \"Waiting for Superman,\" compared it favourably with the USA's. Teachers are selected from the top 10 percent of the country's graduates, and are required to earn a master's degree in education.  1. Singapore Flickr/aotaro Score: 6.3 Singapore's education system is the most highly-regarded in the world, but it is also famously known as a \"pressure cooker\" for its intensity and strictness. Global comparisons of maths and science ability are often topped by Singapore's school system ",

            "answer_text": "To identify the most educated countries in the world, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 countries with the highest proportions of residents aged 25 to 64 with a tertiary education in 2011. These data were included as part of the OECD\u2019s Education at a Glance 2013 report. The countries considered by the report included the 34 OECD member countries, and eight non-OECD nations. These are the 10 most educated countries in the world. Rank 1.Russian Federation > Pct. population with tertiary education: 53.5%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): n/a> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 4.9% (5th lowest)In 2011, more than half of Russia\u2019s population 25 to 64 had attained a tertiary education. Additionally, nearly 95% of adults held at least an upper-secondary qualification at that time, compared with the OECD average of 75%. Russia has, according to the OECD, a \"historically strong investment in education.\" However, recent news could tarnish Russia's well-educated image. Reports suggest widespread corruption in the education system, including cheating on standardized tests, selling of doctorates to politicians and the wealthy and fake thesis factories  2. Canada   > Pct. population with tertiary education: 51.3%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 2.3%> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 6.6% (10th highest)As of 2011, about one in four Canadian adults -- the highest proportion in the OECD -- had attained a career-oriented, skill-based education. In 2010, Canada spent $16,300 for post-secondary schooling per student annually, second only to the United States, which spent well over $20,000 per student. As a percentage of GDP, Canada spent nearly double the OECD average on the equivalent of a bachelor\u2019s degree. 3. Japan   > Pct. population with tertiary education: 46.4%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 3.0% (14th lowest)> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 5.1% (6th lowest) 4.  Israel  > Pct. population with tertiary education: 46.4%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): n/a> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 7.5% (5th highest)In Israel, 18- to 21-year-old men and 18- to 20-year-old women are required to enlist in the military.  5. United States  > Pct. population with tertiary education: 42.5%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 1.4% (the least)> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 7.3% (6th highest) 6. Korea  > Pct. population with tertiary education: 40.4%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 4.9% (6th highest)> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 7.6% (3rd highest) 7. United Kingdom  United Kingdom > Pct. population with tertiary education: 39.4%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 4.0%> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 6.5% (12th highest) 8. New Zealand  > Pct. population with tertiary education: 39.3%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 2.9%> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 7.3% (7th highest) 9. Finland  > Pct. population with tertiary education: 39.3%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 1.7%> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 6.5% (11th highest) 10.  Australia  > Pct. population with tertiary education: 38.3%> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 3.1%> Education expenditure as pct. of GDP: 6.1% (15th lowest). ",
