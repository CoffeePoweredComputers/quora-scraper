            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve taught both 1st and 2nd grade students, and what it\u2019s \u201creally like\u201d ranges from energizing to exhausting, triumphant to discouraged, appreciated to criticized. You get the idea, right? Teaching at those particular levels has some advantages\u2014most students tend to LOVE their teachers (as long as the teacher treats them with respect and kindness, anyway), most parents want to be involved (ditto previous comment), and you get to see incredible growth and development in academic and social areas. On the other hand, 1st and 2nd grade teachers tend to be the ones that identify learning problems that might not be evident at earlier ages; this can be difficult for parents to hear. In the past twenty years, I\u2019ve seen an increase in serious behavior concerns among students at these grade levels, and many teachers/school districts aren\u2019t completely prepared to provide the resources needed to help these students succeed. That\u2019s a topic for a different answer, but needs to be mentioned because you can\u2019t assume you won\u2019t deal with serious behavioral/emotional issues at any grade level. If I had to give a one sentence answer, I\u2019d say being a 1st or 2nd grade teacher was the hardest job I\u2019ve ever loved! ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t taught first or second grade, but I used to volunteer at the elementary school library. One day my daughter\u2019s first grade teacher came in, and groaned when she realized that the librarian was gone. She told me she really needed to use the toilet but she wasn\u2019t supposed to leave the class unless another teacher could take over. I assured her I could do the story time so she could leave. The children were actually well behaved for me, partially because she had them well trained and partially because I was used to reading stories to my own children. I kept asking the student\u2019s opinions so they would stay involved. But it is really much harder than that, because there is curriculum you have to teach, with assignments and grading. You have children that want to show off and others that melt down sometimes. Then there is lots of non-educational administrative work/record keeping that has to be done. But basically you have to like children that age, be willing to follow what the school district tells you to do without disregarding your own wisdom, and be able to hold it when you really need to go to the restroom.
