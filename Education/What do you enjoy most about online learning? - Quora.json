            "answer_text": "I enjoy the most about online learning is that it is extremely successful in terms of flexibility. Being a highly impatient person at times with a really high curiosity, I love setting my own pace in what I'm learning. There are some subjects I'm good at and some I'm not so good at. Anytime, anyplace learning: For sheer convenience, online learning trumps traditional learning all the way. Being able to access the learning material anytime and anyplace helps learners to better balance their work and study commitments. Flexibility: Flexible class schedules are another advantage. E-learning modules can be easily squeezed into bursts of time that you may find during the day. Carry your laptop with you and you can complete class work and assignments as you go. Easy on your pocket: Tuition fees for online courses are typically available at a fraction of the cost of the fees at a regular institution. Additionally, e-courseware and online resources reduce the cost of textbooks, and discounts may be available for deserving students. Global training: You can connect with experts in real time and get your questions answered in online forums. You can work in groups, just as you would in a regular classroom, and can interact in online meeting spaces. Class recordings: A huge advantage of online classes is that class recordings are made available for students to revisit so that they can refresh the concepts learnt during the session. Rich learning experiences: Unlike in a regular classroom, online learning modules can stimulate and engage the minds of learners with a mix of interactive visual and auditory media. Virtual field trips, video clips, and links to simulations stretch the learning experience and aid in retention. As, now there are many brands which provide online classes. I took my classes from Edu4sure. They provide a good atmosphere for there audience. ",

            "answer_text": "Being a highly impatient person at times with a really high curiosity, I love setting my own pace in what I'm learning. There are some subjects I'm good at.....and some I'm not so good at. Regardless though, with e-learning, you can adjust at any pace you want and you will learn a great deal of material.  However, what I enjoy the most about online learning is that it is extremely successful in terms of flexibility. If you wanted to learn about SQL, probability, body language, consulting, an archaeologist's dirty little secret (I learned all those things...except the last one, I swear), whatever, you can do that. Most colleges probably don't have the diversity of classes you can take as the Internet does. Also, most colleges operate on their own schedule and not on your schedule; however, for e-learning, you can choose anytime you want. If you wanted to take a class in the morning, go for it. If you wanted to take a class in the dead of night, go ahead. If you want to learn on the way back home on the bus from work, you can do that too. Nobody is stopping you! The whole learning experience can literally be in the palm of your hand. Although there is still a lot of drama circulating around about e-learning, I really believe that it is creating a promising future for all. And contrary to popular belief, there are a lot of extremely high quality programs out in the Internet these days. Sites such as Udacity, Udemy, Coursera, edX, etc. are really making strides in the education industry and may even trump university classes.  So if you want to gain the upper edge, you now have no excuse to not learn something. What are you waiting for? Take a course right now! Who knows, maybe an archaeologist's dirty little secret would be in your next job interview. ",
