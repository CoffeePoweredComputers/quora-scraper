            "answer_text": "It depends from what you mean by taking off. Many Esperantists dreamt of making their thing into the world language in replacement of English, which had already been the most widespread language as for the gross number of speakers and international business for one century and more apart from being imposed as the second language of obligatory first choice over more than half of humanity thanks to both British and American empires, as Esperanto was being introduced ; French was also considered to be the lingua franca for diplomacy and other related domains but that concerned a far more limited number of speakers by social class ; German was also of special importance for technology and science on a par with English but that was limited to central Europe and also to very special social classes ; most shady dealings that resulted into unforeseen political events had been done in English since long, especially as regards the events that would shape the advent of totalitarianism in Russia and Central Europe ; though English was the language of money, access to it and especially to an eventual editor for your works was not limited by money whereas you had to mix with the rich to practice French outside France ; people who grow nostalgic about pas French linguistic grandeur should face that reality : actually though French has suffered from much loss of prestige it has been taught to much more people that ever during its official heydays when it was appreciated mostly as a class marker so as to feel superior even to most Frenchmen who then didn\u2019t speak it neither for the most part ; the same can be said of German : you had to be among a certain established intelligentsia to be merely entitled to use it, and if you happened to have been denied any access to a university you had better chances with English, as Joseph Conrad proved : Englishdom was far more tolerant towards eccentrics then as it was not yet marred by that much political correctness. Jews for the most part strove to learn English as it was their most hoped-for passport out of their misery, since the Anglo-Saxon countries were already known and also feared by non-Jews as the land where Jewry had the definite upper hand over the rest, and since most new employment for all walks of life was offered to strangers, contrary to Germany where you had to be born into your trade to go beyond second-rank jobs. People were already mocking Zamenhoff for trying to invent a world language instead of betting on the already expanding one that was English. But he believed in his good stars and just hoped for something much better than the expansion of the British and American empires as a possible future for humanity, exactly in the same way Sri Aurobindo in India was dreaming, while founding Auroville, that his future city would eclipse both London and NYC as regards not only religious and cultural but also economic importance : if you want your enterprise to succeed, however humble, let us say a chain of popular restaurants cooking according to a certain diet, you must imagine it must ideally spread over the world. Auroville is still a small backwater provincial pilgrimage town of Southern India with a permanent population of only a few thousands and a floating one that can go up to about 50 000, it has by no means eclipsed nor Paris, nor New York nor Hollywood not even nearby Pondicherry, of which it is still considered a kind of bizarre suburb. But the Aurobindo phenomenon is not about to wane off, it caters for the various activities and likings of more than one million of persons around the world, comprising many businesses of alternative products including vanguard pharmacy, not only has it succeeded to take off for good but it is flying over our heads to stay : everybody in the media world knows more or less what kind of movement it is and has met with one member or two of that loose-defined religious community, and it shows absolutely no sign of lassitude : even though totalitarian religions such as Islam conquer more millions of believers than ever, the Aurobindo community is at the forefront of all those minority groups that harbour even more people that are scared off by the growing tide of intolerance. The same thing applies to Esperanto : it is not about to replace English or even a lesser national language as an official one for any single country however small, it has about the same number of native speakers as Auroville (a few thousands), with maybe one million using it more or less, but it is in the world to stay as it is the only artificial language to have enjoyed such a favour from so many intelligent people for so long. Both Esperanto and Auroville have a brighter future before themselves than they ever actually had even though nothing compared to their dreams. Now both things have matured : Zamenhoff is no longer being mistaken for a prophet, many of his dreams make people smile to say the least, not all his decisions as regard the language are considered to have been good or divinely inspired, people rather look for improvements this founder would have never thought of and are also critical of certain practical consequences of his too globalist ideology : the same thing as is happening with Aurobindo\u2019s reputation for saintlyhood : greater souls are yet to come.

            "answer_text": "Maybe the need for Esperanto was more felt in the period 1887-1920, when many people didn't know French (the lingua franca of the time) and when wars were sweeping this way and that through multilingual Europe. Also, the powers-that-be hadn't yet had time to develop propaganda and lies against Esperanto, because the powerful hate any initiative which, like Esperanto, propagates at the grass-roots level. \u201cEsperanto isn't needed anymore, now that we've got English.\u201d Oh yeah? Ever heard a teacher whose mother language wasn't English try to give a lecture at Cambridge? Oh, he can. But his English is usually far from perfect, and I can't imagine how many years he needed to bring it that far. English is an extremely difficult language; what is easy is the kind of \"broken English\" which a Japanese will try to use to ask his way about Paris, usually with less than adequate success. Esperanto, on the contrary, is not only a very easy language due to its regularity, its structure, and its phonology, it even helps learn more languages later on. (The hardest language you'll ever learn will be your \"first foreign one\". By starting with an easy one you make the whole job easier.) \u201cEsperanto is too euro-centric.\u201d The late Claude Piron, who used to be a translator for Chinese at the WHO before he taught psychology at La-Chaud-de-Fonds, used to say that the deep structure of Esperanto is much closer to Chinese than to any European language. His website still exists, in French and Esperanto, at Claude Piron, articles \u201cEsperanto is dead.\u201d Go tell that to the thousands of people (not always the same people) who travel every year to a different country, usually in a different continent, for the World Congress of Esperanto, which is held for one week every year, end July and/or begin August. The next edition (the 100th) will happen in Lille, France, to commemorate the first one ever, which happened in 1905 not far from there, in Boulogne-sur-Mer. (The missing numbers were during the two World Wars). But for all autocrats, Esperanto has one defect: it is subversive (because you can learn it with hardly even a teacher, and then communicate without the need for an interpreter bureaucrat). So they all put \"bad-sounding\" labels on it: for the Czars it was a language of Tolstoyan socialists; for the Nazis, a language of Jews; for the MacCarthyists, a language of Commies; for the Stalinists, a language of cosmopolitan petit-bourgeois, \u2026 See Ulrich Lins's book, in German (\u201eDie Gef\u00e4hrliche Sprache\u201c) or in Esperanto (\u00abLa dan\u011dera lingvo\u00bb). They also spread other lies about it (\u201cit's ugly\u201d \u2014 oh yeah? it has a sound system very similar to that of Italian, and go ask a fan of opera if Italian is ugly; \u201cit lacks expressiveness\u201d \u2014 it is just about as expressive as any other language, and the more so because you can build up new words with existing elements and be sure that they'll be understood; \u201cit's artificial\u201d \u2014 so is every language: all languages are human creations. Ever heard of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise? And so on.) ",
