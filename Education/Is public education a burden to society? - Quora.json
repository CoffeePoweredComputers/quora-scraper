            "answer_text": "You ask if public education is a burden to society. Is food for your family a burden to you? Of course it is, but it is also a benefit and a necessity. Without it you sicken and starve, which are greater burdens. Education is no different. Do you not benefit from being able to write your question? You did not pay for your education. Somebody else bore that burden, just as somebody else bore the burden of feeding and sheltering you, when you were young. Now, it\u2019s your turn to share the burdens of society. ",

A successful one is infinitely more so. A significant component is the ability and desire of the individual's to engage in educated, well informed discourse. Unfortunately, our reptilian brain continues to believe in the law of the jungle, that might makes right. This viewpoint perceives all problems as a nail and the solution as a hammer. An equation is not a nail, and it's solution is not a hammer. Get it? ",

It\u2019s part of our value inheritance as well.Our public education system helps provide the backbone of our economy. The alternative of only the rich and middle class getting education is net worse.Without public education there is the risk of permanent or semi-permanent underclass.",

When the government claims they are benefiting you, and demands your money, an amount they determine, you can be sure you are getting a raw deal, and public education is not an exception. ",

Without it, most people would not be able to get certain jobs, or advance at all in life. Publicly funded education serves everyone, and everyone benefits by it, because even if you did not attend a public university, those who did are better citizens and contribute to an economy that you will then enjoy.
