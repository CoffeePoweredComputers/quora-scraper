            "answer_text": "In today's world an educated guess would be from 1 to 10% per cent. Typically it's around 3%. Here in South Florida many agents are totally independent now they only sign with an agency to hold their license they pay them a monthly fee for just space which is quite reasonable. They pay all of their own expenses and I mean everything. They also do not split any commissions with the exception being another agent. When I sold real estate in Ohio many years ago are agency charge 7% typically that was shared between the buyers and sellers agencies. If the total commission was $4,000 each agent made 1000. The other two thousand was split between the two agencies. Again in South Florida if it's a very high-end property perhaps waterfront or on the intercoastal some agents will list it for 2%. The 10% commission that I mention applies to commercial real estate I think that is still mostly valid, but I am not certain as I have not sold in many years ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, the commission to sell a house is 6%. This is usually paid by the seller. The commission is split with the buyer\u2019s agent if the buyer has one. Not all agents charge 6%, however. The rate is sometimes negotiable, and there are discount agencies in some areas. ",
