            "answer_text": "Short answer: yes Longer answer: One subject does not determine the future of a child\u2019s academics, not even two. With this general knowledge in mind, you can automatically assume you will pass 4th grade. Now, I\u2019m no 4th grader, but I believe you would have to fail 2\u20134 subjects for them to prevent you from advancing to the next grade. Then again, it depends on if they are core classes like math, social studies, language arts, etc. A child always has an opportunity to improve their grades while in school, especially in elementary school, as typically failing one or more classes doesn\u2019t necessarily matter unless you are being held back. Colleges will not penalize you for getting bad grades in Elementary school/middle school, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that. If a child still seems to be failing classes in late middle school, this may be the time for change. Encourage your child and/or yourself to study, so you can improve your academics. This will benefit you in the long run, so take the extra 15 minutes and prepare for any test or quizzes you have coming up! -Logan ",
