            "answer_text": "We shouldn\u2019t. If you look up best practices for teaching, you\u2019ll find something rather disturbing: Lots of people say they have discovered best practices, but the evidence is nearly always thin, poorly replicated, and somewhat vague. Things like \u201ccommunicate with students well\u201d and \u201creflect on their teaching\u201d. What exactly do those mean? Is there a best way to do these things? Can you be a good teacher without doing these things? And what about the myriad of other factors that impact a classroom? My two cents is that there are no bad teachers, only teachers who are currently successful and teachers who are going to be successful after they get more support. How do you measure this? Student surveys, test scores, teacher interviews\u2026these will give you a vague sense of how a teacher is doing. But your answer will be, at best, \u201cbetter than average here\u201d or \u201cworse than average here\u201d. And then there\u2019s the problem that a \u201cworse than average here\u201d teacher might be amazing at another school. I work with several people like this. One has unrealistically high expectations for our school, but, were she teaching in a higher performing school, she\u2019d most likely be a much better teacher. We don\u2019t understand teaching well enough to rigorously evaluate it. We can get a general impression, but when we do, our response should be to support and help those teachers that fall in the lower half of our evaluation, not vilify or terminate them. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very difficult task given the format of public education in most of the USA. I have to generally concur with Dave Consiglio\u2019s answer that we do not currently have the tools necessary to make such evaluations in any consistent, valid, and meaningful way. There are several significant obsticals, but I will limit my discussion to some of the most significant issues. The most prevailing issue we have is that neither the nation, nor the states, have a clear and cohesive objective for what we want schools to achieve. We do have clear learning objectives (standards) but the applicability or approriateness of these standards may not be correct in many cases. One of the major problems we have is that we don\u2019t even know what the main objective of our schools is. Is the goal to build good future citizens or good future employees or ??? The prevailing method being used in most of the USA is standardized exams. The problem here is best summed up in a quip about grades: \u201cGood grades measure a students ability to get good grades.\u201d I could say the same about most standardized exams. They measure students ability to achieve high scores on these sorts of exams. That\u2019s a good thing to know about students. The disconnect is in the assumption that the effectiveness of the teacher is necessarily correlated to the ability of the student to do such things. Some of the major issues here are as follows: We usually only do these exams once per year at the end of the year. That doesn\u2019t demonstrate growth; it only demonstrates the knowledge someone has. You cannot assume they learned it because of instruction.If we did institute some reasonable pre-test system to act as a control, we would then have to make decisions about what to do with the students who demonstrate advanced levels. We could not reasonably attribute their achievements to their instruction since they already understood the material.If a student demonstrates a lack of proficiency at the end of the year, there is little reason to believe the student will be able to achieve in the next year no matter what the quality of the instruction is. If the student is unprepared to learn, then there will be little growth no matter how much a teacher tries.The exams are designed to typically measure simpler sorts of facts rather than deep connections. This leads to some gamification. It\u2019s in teachers\u2019 best interest to get students to achieve on exams which can be done easiest by memorizing terms without understanding concepts (in many cases).Together, these things help administrators, politicians, consultants etc\u2026to make easy evaluations. They don\u2019t do much to help students or teachers. The other major form of evaluation done is observations. These observations tend to happen only once or twice a year though, which doesn\u2019t provide meaningful insight. On top of that, the administrators who do these evaluations are often not even familiar with the subject matter being taught in the classroom. Once again, the whole thing becomes gamified because the evaluators use some sort of rubric so teachers just try to make sure those boxes get checked. Once again, we have a system that helps the administrators the most, the teachers the least, and the students not at all. Are there things we could do to change so these tools could evaluate teacher effectiveness more? Perhaps. But they would be big changes and would largely involve changes in our culture and whole outlook. Those things don\u2019t happen easily. I just don\u2019t think that many people care enough to make it happen. We would have to have more frequent examinations. But that would eat into instructional time. So we have to have some way to balance the two. We would have to make sure that the examinations hold consequences for students so that we aren\u2019t placing unrealistic expectations upon the students or the teachers. You can\u2019t teach a typical 10 year old algebra. That\u2019s obvious. But what\u2019s less obvious is that you can\u2019t teach a typical 15 year old algebra if the 15 year old has the mathematical abilities of a 10 year old. It doesn\u2019t matter how skillful your algebra teacher is if what the student needs to learn is elementary math. So we have to deal with the problem of proper placement. Just testing for growth isn\u2019t enough. You can pretty much assume there will be no growth if the student is improperly placed. Teachers teach classes, not individuals. Maybe we should change that too. But that change is so big, it involves altering the whole notion of a classroom and that discussion is beyond the scope of this question. Additionally, we would have to move advanced students forward and not presume that they just have fantastic teachers every year if they aren\u2019t being adequately challenged. I\u2019ve written numerous times: It\u2019s easy for a school or nation to achieve high scores if they only examine students with high aptitudes. On the more subjective end, we could institute more forms of peer evaluation. Otherwise, we would need administrators with sufficiently diverse classooms so people who taught middle school English aren\u2019t evaluating teachers instructing high school physics. This answer has become quite lengthy. I could go on, but I hope I\u2019ve illustrated some of my perspective. I\u2019m also aware that this question may have been asked due to my earlier answer about how passion and inspiration should not be used to evaluate teacher quality. I stand by that. So what should we use? We should use a combination of standardized exams and observations. But with the understanding that they are very much imperfect. We also need to separate quality from effectiveness. A high quality teacher could be very ineffective and vice-versa. I\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t evaluate teachers at all. But we should gear our evaluations towards being constructive and helpful rather than an investigation of any reason a student might be unhappy. There will always be unhappy students. Not all of them like being in school. We should be including in our evaluations of teachers some measure that indicates student interest and aptitude with the undertstanding that students who lack both are very unlikely to learn no matter what the efforts or skills of the teacher are.
