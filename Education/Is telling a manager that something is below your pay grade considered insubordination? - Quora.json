So as long it\u2019s legal, safe, I\u2019m qualified and am supplied with the necessary and appropriate PPE and tools, then I\u2019m doing it. If my boss tells me to clean the toilets and tells me where the gloves and cleaning products are, then I\u2019m one overpaid toilet cleaner! If I can\u2019t bear it, then I can always quit and find another job. To answer the question, yes, refusing to do the work assigned is insubordination unless you\u2019ve got a much better reason than \u2018it\u2019s below my dignity\u2019. ",

Why are you complaining? You\u2019ll still get paid\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll do that if you want me to. But you hired me because I have specific skills that you needed for specific jobs. Do you think that\u2019s the best use of the time you pay me for?\u201d That gives the boss a moment to think about what he needs you doing most, and hopefully he remembers someone who is in the paygrade for the thing he wants done. Even if he still tells you to do the thing, you didn\u2019t piss him off and you still get paid. ",
