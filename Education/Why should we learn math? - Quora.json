            "answer_text": "As America bemoans its woeful performance in math, we should remind ourselves why we want our kids to do well in math in the first place. Sure, we need the inventive geniuses who make our society better: someone\u2019s got to cure cancer, and build a better iPhone antenna, and develop cheap renewable energy to spare our planet. But innovation is just part of the equation. Kids need to learn math to make their own adult lives better, by making smart decisions on routine day-to-day matters. Let\u2019s explore the ways we live smarter when we grasp the numbers. 1. If kids grow up to be good at math, they\u2019ll raise kids who are good at math \u2014 because parents are children\u2019s first teachers. When parents love math and feel comfortable with it, and feel brave enough to help a child with math homework, that attitude is contagious. Those parents were once kids themselves, so let\u2019s start the cycle on the right foot, for the good of our kids and for society. 2. Teachers need to step up their game. Far more kids will learn math and enjoy it if they have great teachers. And yet we continue to accept low math standards for elementary school teachers. According to the National Council on Teacher Quality and the National Math and Science Initiative, many applicants to teacher colleges only need to get 40 percent right on the math section of entrance exams. It\u2019s hard to teach something you don\u2019t understand, and to help your students feel comfortable with the material. Inspired students require inspired teachers. 3. Changing the world takes more than just feeling good. Do we know whether our efforts to save really make a difference? How much plastic do we spare by buying bottled water with slightly smaller caps? When we buy cloth diapers, do we really know whether we\u2019re helping the environment, or whether in fact all that hot water and electricity to wash them cancels out the benefits? We should make sure we are doing good vs. just feeling good. 4. Foreseeing long-term consequences is crucial. This holds just as true for big-ticket items, like the compounding interest on debt. Whether you become a painter, a neurosurgeon or a nail-salon attendant, you will have to manage your finances, and you will survive better if you are willing to fall forward and grasp the numbers behind debt. The 2008 mortgage crisis might have been far less ugly if everyone had had that comfort level. 5. Not all deals are created equal. When people offer you a deal, that deal is probably better for them than for you, or they wouldn\u2019t offer it. Math shines a bright light on this. When you\u2019re pitched a warranty that costs one tenth as much as the product, ask yourself: has one out of every ten things in your house broken before it should have? Those who do quick back-of-the-envelope math skip most warranties, because a few replacements over time will cost little by comparison. 6. You\u2019re not a true grown-up until you know how to tip. It\u2019s incredible how many intelligent, educated adults are afraid to calculate the tip at a restaurant. It just isn\u2019t that hard to divide by five to get 20 percent for a great server, and by 6 to get 16.67 percent for someone less helpful. By the way, women in particular tend to be guilty of ducking the tip task: in my own informal study, it\u2019s running at about 87 percent. Ladies, in begging for help with the tip, we\u2019re failing to convince people \u2014 including men \u2014 that women are bright, capable, employable people. We also aren\u2019t setting a proud example for girls who look to us as their role models. 7. Simple math can help you make healthier choices. A Starbucks Frappuccino has around 430 calories. It takes four and a half hours of walking to burn that off \u2014 about half a workday. Those who run the numbers behind obesity might just skip the coffee. Same thing with sugar and the diabetes scourge: we\u2019re supposed to eat a limited amount of processed sugar a day, about 2 desserts\u2019 worth. But one can of Coke has a lot of sugar too and virtually wipes out anyone\u2019s chocolate quota for the day. If we do math, we might make different, happier choices. 8. Being penny wise, not pound foolish really is good advice. The same concept of leverage applies to saving money. If you cut your monthly coffee consumption by two-thirds, but it\u2019s only one percent of your total budget, you won\u2019t save much money. If your rent eats up half your budget, that\u2019s the one to tackle. 9. Calibrating your time will save you time. Sure, maybe you can drive 72 miles an hour instead of 68 by weaving in and out of lanes. But at that rate, you have to drive about 30 miles just to save one minute. The effort (and risk) probably aren\u2019t worth it. You could sidestep the one really long red light in your neighborhood and save just as much time that way. 10. Math allows you to figure out how valuable your time really is. Almost every parent has had to volunteer for a school fundraiser, tying bows around auction items for hours. The gala raises money and everyone feels good, but if someone counted up our hours of work, would we even crack minimum wage? Airport security lines, bad traffic merges, the DMV \u2014 they all persist because no one counts up the cost of consuming so many people\u2019s time. 11. It\u2019s important to be aware of financial realities. More than 20 percent of Americans believe winning the lottery is the most practical way for them to save large amounts of money. The fact is, if you drive five miles to a convenience store, buy a lottery ticket, and drive home, you\u2019re actually more likely to die on the trip than win the lottery. Gambling, random drawings... we need to recognize that we\u2019re spending on mere entertainment, and that money is never coming back. creds huffington post ",

            "answer_text": "Why should you study mathematics? Because math is everywhere: Want to balance your checkbook?Want to calculate how much carpet and paint you need for your living room?Want to figure out how much that loan is really going to cost you? (compound interest)Compare various mortgage options (again, compound interest)?Do your own taxes?And so forth.But it goes beyond that. Most people have no idea how much math they use in their daily life and will use in their future careers. Can\u2019t do math - forget about becoming an engineer.Can\u2019t do math - forget about studying physics in college. Hate to tell you how many wannabe physics majors who said \u201cI can do the physics but just can\u2019t handle the math\u201d. And that was in first year. Take a course in classical mechanics and consider the question \u201cIf you throw a ball into the air how high will it go?\u201d Welcome to the world of differential equations.Can\u2019t do math - forget about getting a degree in any science subject. Ditto economics.Can\u2019t do math - forget about becoming a plumber. I remember reading an article about adult training courses - always oversubscribed - after all, someone is going to show me how to turn a wrench and I\u2019m guaranteed a job at $65,000 to start. Seems those classes go well until the topic turns to the calculation of flow rates (pretty basic math) at which point half the class drops out.Same goes for being an electrician - people quit when they\u2019ve got to figure out the impedance of a series/parallel circuit.Can\u2019t do math - forget about most research jobs. After all, performing statistical analyses is something you\u2019ll have to do and if you can\u2019t understand something as basic as the difference between Type One and Type Two errors you\u2019re SOL.Can\u2019t do math - forget about many jobs at investment banks.And forget about being an actuary at an insurance company.BTW - the consequences of not understanding math can be disastrous - think about Michael Li\u2019s Gaussian Copula formula Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street That\u2019s advanced math. Really advanced stuff. But the problem isn\u2019t that the formula was wrong but was rather how it was used. Simply put, the people using the formula didn\u2019t understand what it really meant. ",
