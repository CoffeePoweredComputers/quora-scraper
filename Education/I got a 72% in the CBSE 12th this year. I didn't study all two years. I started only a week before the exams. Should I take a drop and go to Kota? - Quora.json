            "answer_text": "It would be better to opt for a decent college and plan ahead rather than dropping a year. Because you'll have only 9 to 10 months in totality. And to make sure you atleast  secure a NIT,you might have go for improvement exams and you'll lose another  2 to 3 months in that. And even if you plan to drop an year, do not go to Kota. Try finding decent coaching institutes in your city itself. I have dropped an year from Kota and realized that it is not as helpful as it seems. Because  it will take you sometime to get acquainted to the city and adjust with the hostel life. And you definitely do not have time for that. Secondly, the schedule of coaching institutes in Kota for 13th is very hectic  and leave you completely exhausted for any self study. Also since you've not prepared much for JEE in the last two years, you might not be able to cope up with the immense competition there. What i would suggest is join any decent coaching in your city and join an year long test series of any coaching of Kota with center in your city.  ",
