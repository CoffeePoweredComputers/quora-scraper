Some use it positively and some negatively, but I think these days it is used to mean the idea that the US is unique among nations and that therefore our history, motives, etc. cannot be compared to those of other nations.

Are there any other people, in any other country, that have the right and responsibility to kill tyrants when and/or where they show up? If that is not American exceptionalism, then what is? 22 million American veterans have swore oaths to the Constitution, not the government. And another 70 million armed Americans that are not veterans, but believe in the same. That exceptional. ",
