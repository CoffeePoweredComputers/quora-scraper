            "answer_text": "Hi! You have three months to prepare for your final examination which is more than enough. But you will have to manage your time efficiently and have to be completely dedicated to your studies then only the coming three months could help you. Along with time management, make a daily routine of all the subjects and plan out which all topics you'd be covering and in what order. This would give you clarity as to how you should be completing your syllabus. Follow your routine, once you've finished your syllabus once, go through it again for revision and make notes. Try maintaining notes of everything that you study. Also, don't study 24*7. Give yourself a leisure break wherein you can do activities that are not related to study because you have to rest your mind as well. Don't stress over it too much, you'll be able to complete your syllabus in time.  P.s.- If you're looking to buy any of the Class XI textbooks then check out MyPustak from where you can get them for the cheapest price delivered to your home. Hope I answered your question. All the best for your examination. ",

            "answer_text": "ok three months seems to be a plenty of time to REVISE completely class 11 but it\u2019s definitely not sufficient time to study all chapters from the very basic\u2026the best way is:- PHYSICS:- practice all the derivations ( you can solve many numericals based upon the derivation approach), keep all the formulas on your fingertips and just solve all the examples and you\u2019re all good by doing this sincerely i can guarantee you 90% marks. MATHS:- again keep all the formulas at your tips, solve all the examples and that\u2019s enough CHEMISTRY:- for organic learn all the reactions and the working of major reagents and do practice conversions for clarity and revision. for inorganic you have to mug up things smartly try to find reasons and USE PNEMONICS . for physical learn formulas and plz study mole concept deeply ITS IMPORTANT NOTE:- STRICTLY STICK TO ONE BOOK ONLY AND STILL IF YOU HAVE TIME RE REVISE ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN AND STUDY ALL SUBJECTS DAILY Thank You . Hope it helps ",
