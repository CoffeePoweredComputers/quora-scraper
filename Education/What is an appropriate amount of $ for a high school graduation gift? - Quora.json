            "answer_text": "Funny you should ask this as I have several that I am attending this weekend and next and the amount in the card will likely be different for each of my students or son's friends. I think I take the following into account when doing a gift:  How close am I with the graduate?  Is this a colleagues son/daughter who I barely know and I am being invited as a courtesy?  In that case perhaps $25 is in order.Is it a friend of my son, and my whole family is being invited to celebrate with their family?  In this case I would likely give $50.Is it one of my students who has thought enough of the influence of my teaching on their life to go to their party?  Usually I would give $50 for this, if I was close enough with the graduate to take time to attend their party.Is it a party that I have been invited to where it is celebrating the graduation of one of my \"favorites\"?  In that case I will give $100 since this is more than most people tend to give and this sends a message that the student was indeed a special person to me and my classroom.Lastly, I will often look at a student's financial situation and maybe bump them up a category if I know that the money is going to be used for college so that they can afford to continue their education.And in summation, all of this is very subjective and based on my financial situation.  Giving only $20 is fine if that is all you can afford or if your connection to the graduate is tenuous.  And in an exceptional case I might go even higher than $100 if all of the stars aligned.  But I think that for 99% of my gifts they fall between $25 and $100 :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how well you knew the child. If the child could recognize me in public and carry on a meaningful conversation, I would probably spend or give $100. If the kid doesn\u2019t know me and is probably sending me an announcement because I knew her mother in college, probably $50. She doesn\u2019t know me and I don\u2019t know her. She got my name from the neighborhood directory, I most likely will give $10 or maybe a congratulations card. ",
