            "answer_text": "It\u2019s premature to use the word \u201churt.\u201d You\u2019ve got 3 more years in which to bring the GPAa bit higher. So\u2026find out a few answers from your undergraduate advisor. Does your college offer \u201cFreshman Forgiveness\u201d? Many schools will permit a student to retake a freshman course in their summer school or sophomore year and record only the higher grade. Ask NOW because some summer sessions begin in mid-July and there might be time to retake one or two courses.Does your school offer tutoring for any courses? Sign up for it and don\u2019t wait until midterms to do so. Get tutoring in as many of your classes as possible and buckle down to the extra work and time that is required.Does your school offer mentoring by faculty members or by graduate students? Develop relationships with mentors who can give you advice. If possible, select tenured faculty as mentors: they ultimately will become those persons to whom you turn for letters of recommendation and if they\u2019ve known you for several years they can truthfully write strong letters attesting to your diligence, responsibility, intellectual curiousity, etc. Please note that if these faculty members did their advanced degrees at the institutions at which you wish to study, letters from such alumni can often tip the balance in favor of your admission to the school.Consider applying for entry-level unpaid internships at companies where you will be in an EE environment: the exposure, the contacts, will all be valuable for you.Last ditch effort: Chances are your 1st year professors graded you generously. Possibly they graded you on clear criteria that were set out in their syllabus, and the grade you received was exactly what you deserved. But sometimes professors grade on a curve. If that is the case with one of your courses, ask the professor for an appointment to review the basis on which your grade was calculated. If your attendance was excellent/perfect, if your quizzes, exams, labs, etc. would bring your grade up, request that the professor reconsider giving you the grade you actually earned, rather than the curved grade. Ask whether they would consider submitting a \u201cChange of Grade Form\u201d citing \u201ccomputational error\u201d as the reason for the slightly higher grade. Whatever you do, DON\u2019T approach the prof with some absolute bullshit like \u201cI\u2019m a straight-A student.\u201d No, you\u2019re not. Not anymore. Or \u201cI need an A to keep my: visa/scholarship/loan.\u201d If so, you should have earned the \u201cA\u201d. And you didn\u2019t. We don\u2019t give away good grades. YOU have to earn them. But we do have some discretion. We are honest, decent people. We are not out to take your tuition money (WE don\u2019t get it) and fail you. We DO want you to succeed, but YOU must earn it. IF you have, then ask the prof to reconsider. If they refuse and if the grade you earned is a close call (you earned a B but received a B-) do NOT appeal the grade to the Dean\u2019s office. If the Prof refuses and the grade you earned is substantially better than what you received (you got a B- but earned an A-) then take it to the Dean after first entreating your Prof. The Dean will NEVER force the Prof to change the grade but neither does the Proff want to appear unreasonable in the eyes of the Dean.So, here are the 5 things you ought to do. What you should NOT do is give up. You now know how hard you need to work to succeed. Do it. ",

A GPA of 3.5 is in the lower range of most top graduate schools - the average GPA is around 3.9 - so you would need a near perfect GRE scores where the GRE makes up for a low GPA. Some universities do not consider the GRE as a substitution for GPA, so you will need to check with the universities website to see how the GRE is used. If you get to where your accomplishments are evaluated, it will be your SOP supported by your LORs that makes or breaks your application when compared to the other applicants. Your accomplishments must standout if you expect to be admitted to a top university. For a discussion of how to target research groups, see James Leland Harp's post in My admissions posts ",

Just like you likely missed out on being a kid. I was obsessed with the future like you, once, and thankfully snapped out of it before I missed the present. Do do your best, my friend. Delve into your subject. Immerse yourself. But let graduate school be worried about when it\u2019s time. Stressing yourself into an ulcer will not help your grades. And you cannot spend your entire life sleeping 4 hours a week. Learn first, what your operating level is. Endevour to improve, to be sure, but don\u2019t bust your hind parts to get into a school that will kill you, or worse, ruin that which makes you YOU. ",
