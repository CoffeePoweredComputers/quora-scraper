            "answer_text": "Hi Matt. Not very many would refuse work where I did my time. Many just need some fresh air (outside grounds, rec orderly, car pool maintenance). Others look at it as more of a \u201ccontact\u201d to \u201ccontact\u201d sort of thing. Making deals cross-compound, passing contraband an so forth. I worked in the chow hall (both the front and the back) for about a year, but I had to stop when I went to medical to check out some dizziness and found out I had A-fib (missing a beat or two or three in my heart). I began the rest of my \u201ccareer\u201d as a houseman cleaning the windows in the dorm and the officer station \u201cbubble\u201d. Forty-five minutes and hardest part of the day was over. There was no physical force or retribution toward an inmate if he refused to work. There was, however, an incentive to convince them. Usually it would be time in \u201cjail\u201d and then you\u2019d be in the DR Squad (Disciplinary Report) for 2\u20133 months. SOMEBODY\u2019S got to take out the trash. If they didn\u2019t report to the squad, then they\u2019re back in jail. When you are in jail, you are out of touch with other, more profitable things. We had a P.R.I.D.E company going at Calhoun C.I. for printing, mailing, and digital imaging. The major client was the Florida School System. Calendars of events, desk covers, time-tables. Stuff like that. Prison Rehabilitative Industries and Diversified Enterprises, Inc. That\u2019s what the acronym stands for, and it was the highest paying job on the compound, usueally fetching 35 to 40 cents an hour. PRIDE Enterprises The prison system in Arizona (going back several years) used inmates as reservations agents for American Airlines. Same training as the people outside the walls, but those outside the walls were making $15/hour while the inmate made something like 50 cents an hour doing the very same work and taking the same irate passengers and travel agencies from time to time. And they answered the phone the same way. \u201cThank you for calling American Airlines. My name is Steve, how may I help you?\u201d At our P.R.I.D.E. the phone would be answered, \u201cPride services, inmate MacEwen, how may I help you?\u201d ",

Inmates in what many call \u201cSuper Max.\u201d are in there for committing some violent crime in prison or belonging to a prison gang. They should NOT be assigned to work and they should NOT be allowed to earn good time credits. They are a proven security risk to staff and other inmates. The same applies for Death Row inmates. ",

Add to that the fact that prices in the commissary are twice what they would be in a supermarket, a bag of chips every week. ",

To rent them out for cheap labor to companies is immoral. But no one wants to sit around. The best is to have a win win situation. The best would be to do significant work that really applies after prison instead of doing work that accomplishes nothing for no wages as is done now. ",

Gain time is the time off the end of their sentence which will in some cases allow them to get out earlier. Interestingly enough, depending on the State the inmate is incarcerated in. He or she will be required to work, but not get paid for it. In NY State inmates receive a small payment for the work they do. However, in Florida, the inmate is again required to work. But does not GET paid at all.. ",

For instance an inmate sentenced to thirty days in jail would only have to be in custody eighteen days and would receive twelve days of good time reduction for working from the original thirty day sentence. I'm not real familiar with state or federal time computation, but in the county I worked in good time was only given to inmates that worked. An inmate could refuse to work and they would subsequently lose all the good time sentence reduction benefits. ",
