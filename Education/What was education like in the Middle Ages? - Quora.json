            "answer_text": "It wasn't. There was no education the way we know it. Only those who would become priests were taught to read. Some selected young people were given to knights and served their new master and maybe became knights themselves. I read where King John, who signed the Magna Carta, was as functionally illiterate as the Agent Orange in the White House. (Really King John was illiterate but could put his sign as a signature. Life for the serfs was short, nasty and brutish. Kings and other mobility abused them. Raped their women as they wanted. Took foodstuffs as they wished. The Church tried to get knights to not take advantage but the priests probably were parasites to the common folk as well. \u2026on top of probably sexually abusing the young ones just like they do today. We should be glad we don't live in those times. All this was on top of the profound ignorance of the world. (Science did not exist. Life centered around the Church.) It was also called The Dark Ages for a reason. ",
