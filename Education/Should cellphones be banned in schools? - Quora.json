            "answer_text": "There are two sides to this argument. You have two answers which say they should be banned. They are disruptive. They take the focus of the students away from the what the class is doing. And if a teacher is giving a test to multiple classes then it is a simple thing to snap a photo or two of the test for your friends. Look what your statement says though. I do not know how many teachers are against cell phones for they record what they do. If I am not a good teacher or an abusive one it is no longer a child\u2019s word against the word of a teacher. Where has the kindergartner gotten their phone? Why would the parents of a child so young want them to have a phone? So they can contact them? Check to see if they are ok? Why would they be worrying about if their child is ok if they were at school? In the US schools I have taught at the decision of what should be done with cell phones is up to the individual teacher. The most practical is a teacher who has setup a charging station for all of her students\u2019 phones. They plug them in at the beginning of the class and pick them up at the end of the class. Banning phones hasn\u2019t worked. We have to battle the parents to keep their children from bringing them. Our culture has changed from phones on a wall to phones in our pocket. From having to use a computer to be on the Internet, to having it available on our phones. From a planned day - I will be here at this time and I will be - to oh I have to do this now and now this. So why not use the cell phone? If you do not have enough computers in school, have them use their phones to look up items on the internet. Create or find apps which will exercise their ability to read, do math, read about history, and do research. We need to educate out students on how to properly use the technology they have around them. Help them learn why there are areas in the network which they should not go to. Teach them how to use this technology to find out what the truth of something is. Or find where to go for help, assistance, direction, or a common place of like minds. ",

            "answer_text": "I understand why a school might want to ban cellphones. I really do. I have firsthand experience with a phone preventing me from doing my work properly. My phone just gave me a notification. Guess what I wanted to do? Not write this answer, I\u2019ll tell you that much. And while phones can prevent students from doing their work, ultimately, banning cellphones in school is a misguided and flawed tactic. The Vice Principal of San Mateo high school, a school that recently banned the usage of phones during school hours, stated, \u201cWe could walk into a variety of classrooms, and kids would be on their cellphones anywhere from 5 seconds, checking a text, to 30 to 45 minutes at a time.\u201d This indicates a deeply rooted problem inside the school\u2019s culture. If students are on their phones for an entire class period, how can you expect them to be focused without their phone? Without the modern tool of distraction, the students will revert to caveman days and fold paper airplanes, pass notes, and possibly even blow tannerite up in the locker room. Anything to avoid the misery that being productive is. Phones don\u2019t cause unproductivity. The desire to be unproductive causes people to use their phones. If the school wanted students to not be as distracted, they\u2019d hire teachers who spark excitement in their students. They\u2019d make an attempt to connect with the students at a non-superficial level. This is why banning drugs and gun control don\u2019t work. Instead of ridding society of the evils which cause undesirable behaviour, the powers at be ban said behaviour. Schools that ban phones undoubtedly possess good intentions; the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Giver hell, The komrade ",
