            "answer_text": "Hello dear! Often it is said that he/she is an average student. That doesn't mean that they are not the intelligent students. It means that the student who is scoring average marks is lacking in something, his hard work is not like that of a topper who scores 90%+. So, if I can say anything is work hard, be determined to get 90%+.Learn everything thoroughly. And the most important thing to tell is that scoring 90%+ is not an easy task. You have to work hard day and night. And you know very well that the boards are just approaching and we students have a less time to prepare for boards. So, work hard day and night. The only thing that must be in your heart and mind is to score 90%+ and nothing else. A warning : Stay away from blankets! \ud83d\ude0bRather this is the truth that happens with me, that is the warmth we get from it somehow forces us to have a good sleep. :) All the best and start your preparations now. NOW MEANS NOW!! ",

With utter dedication you can surpass the 92-93s. That will be revered. Is not tough. Believe that you can do it. And trust me, believing that you can do it is the toughest part.Try researching more on this. ",
