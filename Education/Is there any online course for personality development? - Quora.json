            "answer_text": "Do you think Personality development is something that will come to you overnight? It is a process that requires the development of specific skills, such as behavior, attitude, temperament, character, and environment in an organized manner and that could take either 1 month, 1 year or a life-long. Many people often ask me why personal development is necessary. I ask them, are you successful in your life? And when they have no answer, I tell them that it is the primary need to obtain success and happiness in life, whether it\u2019s personal or professional. For example, let\u2019s consider that you\u2019re a great team player with higher educational qualification and have all the knowledge of your field; do you think all these specialized skills alone can help you achieve your desired goals? At first, you may think it is possible, but it\u2019s not unless you learn how to manage yourself in life. You can find a number of courses available online for personality development, but would you be able to uplift your mindset. To enhance your skills, it\u2019s necessary to know yourself, things that you are capable of doing, and then you\u2019ll realize what personal development is.

No robot is yet made to recognize and respond to thoughts, feelings, emotions. So, online course may not help much. Not even app. Read at your pace. Read self help books. Understand and practice. You can improve your language skills, concentration and presentation skills through these. ",
