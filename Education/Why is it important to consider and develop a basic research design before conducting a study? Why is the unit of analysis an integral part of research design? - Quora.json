You\u2019ll end up in dilemmas, where, you\u2019ll find it difficult to choose a right topic. Even when you know what is your research field, endless possibilities pop up, if you start your research without any particular motive. Regarding why the unit of analysis is an integral part, if you wait to test your product at the very end, you won\u2019t be able to find out the mistakes easily. If you do a proper analysis in the required stages, you can confirm that the product works well, till that point of time. You can be even assured that your design is proper. Else, if there\u2019s a mistake, you can easily remodify the design. In the initial stages, debugging isn\u2019t that difficult. So, it\u2019s always good to analyze your design in every possible stages in order to successfully complete your research! ",
