            "answer_text": "Hi Dustin, Some say they\u2019ve passed with virtually no studying, so YES, it can be done! That being said, paying to test for each section can get pretty expensive, and having to retake sections gets even more expensive! There are plenty of free or very cheap resources out there, so it\u2019s not a bad idea to at least look at some of these! Again, the main reason I suggest this is because of the cost! Having to pay to retake due to not being fully prepared the first time is never fun lol. Not saying you won\u2019t pass the first time, but just think about the extra money it will cost if you have to pay to retake vs the extra time to at least check out some free resources now. It\u2019s your call though, so go with your gut! Do whatever works for you! Good luck!! ",

That said, I'm pretty confident that even though the GED test is a tad bit harder than it used to be that there are people who pass it with little or no studying. You don't need to be a genius to do well on the GED test just a descent test taker. This I know from personal experience, I still don't know how I passed the math part of the test. Lol. I hope this answers your questions :) ",

The second day of testing came, and I ensured that my blood sugar was at a reasonable level before taking the examination. I went into the testing center to take the final two exams. My lowest score was something like a 158 and my highest was 171. Neither were good, but they were enough to pass the exam and get me into community college. ",
