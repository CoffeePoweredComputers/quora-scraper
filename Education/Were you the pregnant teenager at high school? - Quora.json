            "answer_text": "As a teenager I had quite a few crushes on different boys as well as a belly which I would rub frequently. I was never pregnant (and still have never been), but people would think I would be the girl who would be the first in the class to lose their virginity or fall pregnant. There was this girl Emma and her \u201cfriend\u201d Olivia. So, Emma had a boyfriend and told Olivia that she had sex with him. A few days later, Olivia announced it to the class and Emma ran out of the classroom crying as she was mortified and felt betrayed. Emma even moved schools thereafter as a result. A couple of years later, just after completing high school, Olivia became pregnant. Emma and I were NOT pregnant and were going onto our next level of education. That is her karma for humiliating and betraying Emma. Also, less than a year after that, her Baby Daddy left her for another girl which meant Olivia must have had to raise her child alone. ",

I got married the February of my Junior (11th grade) year of highschool. Being 17 and married, most assume I was pregnant because that is how it typically went. But that wasn\u2019t the case. I\u2019ve been pregnant a total of 4 times; and each time was a planned pregnancy. My first pregnancy was conceived a month and a half before I turned 20. ",
