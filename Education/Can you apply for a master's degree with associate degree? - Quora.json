            "answer_text": "Actually, depending on the field, in the U.S. there are some programs that allow associate-grad entry to a master\u2019s program. For example, there are ADN to MSN programs in nursing and AAS to MOT programs in occupational therapy. These programs may or may not award a bachelor\u2019s degree along the way. Most require that students have a specific GPA in their bachelor-level courses before they can continue to complete the master\u2019s. If you are planning to pursue a professional master\u2019s degree like a MSN, MSW, MOT, MBA, MPH, etc. be sure you do your research for an accelerated program because you may just find one. Universities are beginning to be much more creative in their delivery to meet students\u2019 needs. ",
