            "answer_text": "Not all courses will work well online. For example, courses that have a lab component, such as chemistry, biology, etc., can\u2019t be done online. You could do the book learning part online, but not the labs, and if you\u2019re majoring in biology or chemistry, you are required to do the labs. Dance and theatre courses also present challenges online, for obvious reasons. Some colleges are suspicious of online courses and students because they think students will cheat. Guess what? Students in campus-based courses cheat too. Faculty have figured out ways to combat this, and thus online is no different. A professor who has 500 or even 50 kids in his class has no way of knowing whether his students cheated on their exams or papers, so that\u2019s no different than worrying that online students will cheat. Another challenge is resources\u2014maybe the colleges don\u2019t have as many OERs (Open Educational Resources) available to students, or maybe the articles the faculty require the students to read online means students have to pay a fee to access the articles, which means that poorer students won\u2019t take online courses because of the added fees to access journal articles and more. If the college serves a poorer community, then students probably don\u2019t have computers with the specs necessary to take online courses, and the college may not have enough Chromebooks and hot spots for everyone. Then there\u2019s course development and learning to teach online. Many don\u2019t realize that it is a skill, that teaching online is A LOT of work in addition to other duties faculty have. ",

            "answer_text": "The following reasons won't more colleges offer more online classes for students:- 1. It's too easy to cheat:-While Udacity encouraged students to help one another on the discussion boards, we weren't allowed to post answers. The honor code worked, but only because we couldn't get college credit. The incentive to cheat was very weak. Make the class count for credit, or serve as the first step to a good job, and phantom forums and answer keys will follow. Despite our best efforts, the proliferation of cheating is higher education's dirty little secret. Take away the classroom and you've made a bad situation much worse. 2. Star students can't shine:- It became immediately clear to me that even if I excelled at this course, no one would know who I was. Networking, either with my fellow students or with the professors, was virtually impossible. In traditional academe, I know my best students well enough to write recommendations describing their personalities and accomplishments in detail. Online anonymity results in references that mean virtually nothing. ",
