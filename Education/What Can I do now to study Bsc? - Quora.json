            "answer_text": "Age doesn\u2019t matter for your studies. As I think,you had choosen technical line by your own wish and it is not something imposed upon you. You were good on Physics Chem or Computer Science at your 10th/12th,how can you sure about performing good at these subjects? You already crossed two years in your Technical Degree and there are ample chances that if you choose these subjects,you will start feeling to choose another subject again after joining Bsc in Chem Phy or CS. Continuously changing subject or not giving attention to your subject is not the solution,the only solution is to give your everything to studies. Besides this,if you are really frustrated with your subject and want to do something different,try to consult to your friends and family and then decide what to do or not. Hope you will understand. All the Best! ",
