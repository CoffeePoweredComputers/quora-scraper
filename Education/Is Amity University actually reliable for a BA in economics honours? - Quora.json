It is easy to maintain the average grade pointer in amity but who cares . if you have knowledge well good if not you cant do anything after graduating from amity, you have run for best collages in india for the master or maybe go for iim , doing economics (hons) from amity jaipur i learn that you have to push yourself for work on to your subject\u2026and field .. Try to get in amity noida for economics Best of luck ",
