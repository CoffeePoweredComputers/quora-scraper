            "answer_text": "Oh boy, oh boy!!! Lots of stuff!  Let me make a list. 1. Teach students environmentally and economically beneficial behaviors, such as recycling 2. Fund faculty who are interested in researching the causes of or solutions to a given environmental problem. 3. Attract donors who are interested in #2 4. Conduct applied research on what large communities, such as universities can do to reduce their environmental footprints.  This is very unique, as governments are really the only other actors that can do this. 5. Specify their own building codes that exceed the minimum levels of energy performance specified by the locality or other body 6. Develop highly efficient district energy systems to meet their heating and power needs, and supply members of the local community. 7. Purchase environmentally friendly products for use on campus, such as 100% recycled content paper.  Universities have leverage to create new markets here. 8. Host lectures for members of the surrounding community to attend and learn about environmental issues. 9. Move their endowments into responsibly invested funds.  There is a lot of controversy surrounding this one, but it could scarcely hurt the situation. 10. Provide infrastructure for CNG or electric vehicles for use on campus. 11. Build renewable energy installations on their campuses. 12. Serve only food harvested in line with \"best practices\" in their dining halls. 13. Participate demand response programs so utilities do not have to activate less efficient generators during times of peak electrical demand. 14. Provide programs to help students and staff to invest in alternative transportation. 15. Participate in environmental remediation projects in the local community. 16. Require that students only use energy efficient appliances in their dorms. I'm sure that there are lots of other things too.  Maybe others will post answers to this questions and expand upon my list.
