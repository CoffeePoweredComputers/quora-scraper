            "answer_text": "Humanities as it\u2019s currently defined in colleges and universities is contrasted with science and social science. Humanities disciplines will include \u201cliberal arts\u201d subjects. The biggest four tend to be: HistoryPhilosophyLiteratureLanguage (modern and classical languages such as Greek and Roman)In addition, humanities departments often house disciplines which are about human speech and practice rather than the natural world or the scientific method. These would be disciplines such as law, linguistics, anthropology. Sometimes the \u201carts\u201d are lumped in with the \u201cliberal arts\u201d: theater, dance, music, painting, and so on. Humanities, by this definition, studies human beings and human behaviors; natural sciences study the natural world (and other sciences such as mathematics and logic study the abstract systems we use to study other subjects), while social sciences apply scientific methods to human behaviors. Drawing these distinctions between disciplines, however clear in might seem on paper, is notoriously difficult to do in reality. Many disciplines overlap in their focus or their methods. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that the answer might vary a little bit, but, as holder of a Bachelor of Arts in Human Sciences (Llicenciat en Humanitats, in Catalan), my fields of study were the following  Linguistics and literatureClassic culture (for us, Latin and ancient Greek)Modern languages (English for me)Philosophy (from old Greeks to Sartre, in several courses)History of Art and Aesthetics (these were the classes I loved the most and my great professor Joan Camp\u00e0s is absolutely a genius).History, from Pre-History to Contemporary History.SociologyAnthropologyEthicsPsychologyGeographyYou could also take extra credits in \"Cultural business management\", \"museology\", \"History of cinema\" and the like. It's not that we got deeply into each of these, but we got a general grasp of them all. So Humanities, at least for someone like me who also has a \"Science\" degree, are all the disciplines that aren't \"Math-related\" (more or less, heheh) that depend more on reasoning and aspects of life that aren't that scientific (more or less, there's a lot of science in disciplines such as Psychology) but help us understand our world.
