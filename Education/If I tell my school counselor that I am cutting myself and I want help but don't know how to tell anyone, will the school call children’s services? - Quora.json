            "answer_text": "I am going to give you the best answe I can. I have been in this exact position with more than one student. First, I would not call children\u2019s services especially not right away. First, I would talk with you and remind you that I am not able to keep this sort of thing confidential so I would ask if you wanted me to call your parents or if you want to tell them yourself. There is too much risk with this sort of thing to let it go on long. If you chose to tell them, I would instruct you to have them call me tomorrow, and if they don\u2019t call me by the end of school tomorrow I would have to call them. Most students do want to tell their parents. If you choose that option, I would offer to come home with you to help!. I would be able to answer questions for all of you. It is your parent\u2019s responsibility to get help for you. I could give them a list of people and places where they could seek help. Then I would talk k with you a bit further to make sure you would be ok over night. If I was not confident that you would be, I might seek assistance from our resource officer to see about Baker Acting you, but that is not usually necessary with cutters. Do see your counselor and be confident that you will receive help maybe not exactly as I described here, but something pretty close to it. I would also monitor your situation pretty closely to be sure you are getting help. If I find you are not, that is when Children\u2019s Services would enter the picture. Cutters are not suicidal. They are using physical pain in order to deal with emotional pain. A cutter could accidentally kill themself by accident so they require cleaning se monitoring ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know. You could start by asking the counselor what you do have confidentiality about. For example : you could ask in the general question and then say, \u201c If I had suicidal thoughts ( but I know I won\u2019t kill myself) or I was cutting myself or my parents used to sexually abuse me - - what would you have to report and how? What would happen then?\u201d: And if I want help but don\u2019t want to have my parents know this was going on or that I am telling someone, can you provide me with help without telling anyone? Could you help me without telling my parents?\u201d Or \u201cCan you help me tell my parents and have them help me get professional help?\u201d So I am suggesting you ask a bunch of questions including what you are concerned about. You can tell the counselor that you are intentionally not revealing what is going on with you until you know what you have confidentiality about. Adults always have confidentiality with a professional therapist or counselor and you are stuck not having that until age 18. It makes sense that you want to understand what confidentiality you do have. I am sure you will not be the first student that school counselors have had these important questions to talk about. ",
