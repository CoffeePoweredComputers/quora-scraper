            "answer_text": "When you start reading this, I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t know much about programming and you\u2019re highly curious about why you need to learn a new language when you\u2019re not aware of why you actually need it. Here I\u2019m giving you 6 reasons for you to learn a new programming language. Maybe you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t belong to a CS background.Or, you\u2019ve never learned a programming language before or you don\u2019t have any reason to learn. But you can feel the vibe around yourself and feel argued to know about programming. If so, sit back, hold on, let me take you on a journey. Here are the reasons why you should know at least one programming language. 1. To Understand Where You Spend Your 28,300 Hours We give the biggest piece of our pie to our virtual life. The whole virtual thing is made with code. To understand how things are being made, you\u2019ve to know the basic knowledge of programming. An average human being spends 28,300 hours on the internet in his/her lifespan. Don\u2019t you ever feel like you need to know at least the introduction of the whole virtual thing? I\u2019m sure the answer is big YES. There is no harm in knowing things out of your box. Programming is a box of surprises\u2026you don\u2019t know what you will get from it. 2. To Make Yours & Everyone's Life Easier Most of the tech things are made to make our lives easier. Most of us take the user\u2019s share only. But, you too can create amazing things using programming. Such as, making an automated text reply whenever you\u2019re offline. At first look, it seems a complex thing but it\u2019s not. In fact, you don\u2019t need to write every line of code, you just need to understand what line means what and how these works. Then you can easily build any program for anything you need. I made a program for Automating WhatsApp with 15 lines of Python Code which made my life easier. 3. To Create New Things if You\u2019re Creative Every machine you use, from your mobile to your electric guitar\u2026everything needs programming to be operational. Programming is blended with our life in this way. So, whatever your passion is, you can make new things using programming. I\u2019m a photographer by passion, I\u2019ve made my own portfolio website for myself using programming knowledge. From musicians to lawyers, everyone can show their creativity when they know a programming language. 4. To Make Your Resume Shinny There is no harm in adding something new in your Resume right? So, why not add programming as your extra skill? Knowing a programming language can make your CV stand out from others. It indicates that you\u2019re a person who is never afraid of learning anything out of the box and not afraid of taking any challenge. Also, it shows you\u2019re up-to-date with modern technology. 5. To Enhance Your Problem-Solving Skills Programming gives you more than just a skillset. It increases your skill of problem-solving and also helps to enhance your patience level. You may not feel in the first place, but in the future, it\u2019ll impact every section of your life. 6. For Career Opportunity and Flexibility 2020 is full of surprises. The job market is completely changing due to COVID-19. Many professions are being dissolved and people are trying to reach new opportunities to survive. So, there is no guarantee that your profession will survive for the next 30 years. It\u2019s a wise decision to keep another option open. Final Words We are afraid of what we don\u2019t understand. Starting to learn a new language can change your perspective towards programming. Maybe you can find your passion here. Or maybe you\u2019ll create your legacy. You never know. Stepping out of your comfort zone is the start of a new, fruitful beginning. ",

            "answer_text": "Because programming is the fastest way to solve almost any problem. Let's pick a problem based on the most searched question on Google. Gun Control is a serious issue, people are asking all sorts of questions on laws and reforms to curb homicide. Programming might just solve it! Thinking just off the top of my head, what if we program inexpensive single board computers to listen in for characteristic sound signatures of gunshot firings and place these \"gunshot-sensors\" all over a city? Law enforcement can instantly know if any unauthorized shooting took place and can take immediate action! This is a big deal, and a few lines of code can possibly solve this issue. Programming is certainly an extremely powerful tool. I use it all the time to solve little problems I get every day. My computer mouse started to \"bounce\" one day i.e. whenever I clicked it once, the spring inside would click it multiple times. This happens when the mouse is about to die and it was clear I had to buy a new one. But nope! I was able to write a small program that would eliminate any clicks that happened faster than a certain threshold. In a certain assessment, every week, we were assigned a book to read and had to pick the new words that we encountered and read out the meanings to the class. I simply wrote a program that would search through the entire electronic version of the book, pick out large words and download the meanings from a certain API that I would read out to the class. And these are just a few applications. Programming inherently is beautiful. The idea that just a bunch of instructions can be executed in sequence to make awesome things happen is mind-blowing. Humans are intrinsically addicted to automating, to delegating tasks that can be repeated thousands of times over, to producing abundance for as little effort as possible, and coding is just the newest (and hopefully, the most universal) way of doing it. I'm not imposing how important programming is, I'm just giving a slice of my excitement and passion for it. Nobody is required to know it, but it's certainly a really cool skill to have in one's arsenal. ",
