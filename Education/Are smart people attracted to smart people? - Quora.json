            "answer_text": "As has been pointed out, if you\u2019re a smart person you\u2019ll only be compatible with other people roughly as smart as you. But compatibility is not attraction. I don\u2019t think that smart people in general are attracted to other smart people because of their intelligence. It\u2019s an important box to check off when you do the compatibility assessment, but for many smart people, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sexy. There is, however, a personality trait that correlates reasonably well with intelligence, in that most of the people with the trait are smart or very smart (but the opposite is not true; it\u2019s not that common a trait). And if you have that trait, it\u2019s definitely sexy when someone else shares it. I call that trait eucognition, the trait of liking to think, of being more interested in the \u201clife of the mind\u201d than in \u201cactivities.\u201d [1] Most people\u2019s hobbies include the likes of travel, sports and recreation, dining, dancing, video gaming, partying, socializing. A lot of very smart people spend their weekends doing these things. Sitting around with their friends and analyzing stuff as a fun weekend activity? Seriously? However, there are people whose idea of the best possible time is to get together with a small group of friends and (for instance) watch a really good movie, and then talk about it for 90 minutes or two hours. And those 90 - 120 minutes typically consist of 30 minutes about the movie itself, with the rest of the time devoted to tangents inspired by the conversation. Personal stories get told and connected to the movie\u2019s themes (or not!) and to each other. Insightful connections are made. [2] People like that are definitely attracted to other people like that. We get pleasure from hearing and considering a cool, new idea, exactly like a foodie gets pleasure from a new dish or a skier gets pleasure from a great run down the mountain. And why are we attracted to someone? Because we can imagine engaging with them pleasurably. My memorable first meetings with women have admittedly all begun with physical attraction. But I\u2019ve struck up many conversations with women I\u2019ve found attractive, and the handful that led to something more were the ones where the conversations were electrifying in their intellectual sparks and rapport. [1] I think this is the single personality trait that most determines who you associate with, and the reason it\u2019s gone fundamentally unrecognized is that people tend to only associate with others like themselves. It\u2019s the fundamental \u201cgeek\u201d trait if we define \u201cgeek\u201d as someone who enjoys knowledge for its own sake. It\u2019s ubiquitous in science fiction fandom and widespread in other similar subcultures. [3] [2] This is in fact a description of what my friends and I have done once a week for the past 14 years, with the secret being that the movies are interlaced with watching complete runs of brilliant, thought-provoking TV series, beginning with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Several members of the \u201cBuffy Gang\u201d will upvote this! [3] [3] Yes, Quora is a community with a high incidence of eucognition. ",

            "answer_text": "I would assume that many are. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed at least \u2026..by peeping at everyone through my binoculars up here in the tree\u2026 But even as an idiot, I\u2019m attracted to smart people as well. As long as they\u2019re not too arrogant about their superior intellect, I almost always find it refreshing to speak with people who are one step ahead of me (or 30) who just know what I mean or even what I\u2019m about to say. It\u2019s comforting and comfortable. You feel understood and in good hands. But really, I think people are generally attracted to people who are either smarter than themselves or somewhere near their own level. People like those they can relate to in some way, and I think exceptionally few people are attracted to or have much interest in people they perceive to be beneath them. So rather than strictly being a question of whether intelligence is attractive to other attractive people, I think it has a lot to do with social status as well. I mean, there are plenty of intelligent people who\u2019ve fallen on hard times and are now homeless. And how many intelligent people would openly admit an attraction for them? They might if the \u201cdirty hobo\u201d somehow miraculously pulls himself up and makes a change, but an intelligent bum on the street is still a bum to most. Personally, I care most about personality and compatibility of the minds. I can overlook a scruffy face or a bad attitude as long as there\u2019s a connection and the conversation keeps flowing. And because it\u2019s so difficult to have a conversation with someone who cannot understand you, I\u2019m instinctively drawn to people who are as smart or smarter than myself. I hate repeating myself and explaining everything I say. And with the right person, there\u2019s no need for any of that. And that\u2019s why I\u2019d much rather date, say, a nerdy or bookish librarian than the hottest social media bimbo everyone keeps lusting after. The bimbo may be able to give me a \u201cgood time\u201d. But the librarian could give my life meaning. ",

            "answer_text": "Being attracted to smart people is an orientation known as sapiosexual. While I have done a lot of studying on the topics of sex and relationships, the extent to which being smart and being sapiosexual may correlate is beyond my expertise. You\u2019d have to look up the scientific studies that have been done on the subject if you hope to obtain any definitive insight therein. Therefore, I can only offer an anecdotal response. To clarify, I would consider myself to be sapiosexual and I\u2019m confident that any objective analysis of the totality of evidence would reasonably categorize me as \u201csmart\u201d in the conventional sense. Or in the academic sense at least. Let\u2019s not get into a debate about the narrow scope of what is considered intelligence and what is not in our modern western academic system. I do consider intelligence to be an attractive trait. Let\u2019s not mince words here: by \u201cattractive\u201d I mean I find it sexy. And not just general intelligence. I\u2019m drawn to people who exhibit excellence in just about any one skill, including artistic and athletic pursuits. Because it doesn\u2019t seem to be a common viewpoint, I should note here that I consider aptitude in creative and physical fields to be forms of intelligence. Paint amazing portraits? That\u2019s hot. World champion cyclist? Marry me. Can you build a ten foot cairn? I\u2019m done for. Quick wit? Smitten. To be sure, I also find my preferred sex to be physically attractive in the same conventional sense that most people seem to do. I just don't take an interest beyond the casual thought of \u201chuh\u2026 she\u2019s pretty\u201d unless there\u2019s also an indication of intelligence in general or aptitude in a specific area. Also, those signals usually override any sense of conventional attractiveness, in my experience. Now, I don\u2019t like this business of ranking people on a ten point scale one bit, but for the purposes of illustration: say you stood an impeccably dressed 5 next to a 9 dressed in a phoned-in outfit. I\u2019m most likely to be drawn to the average girl with a sense of style over the uncoordinated hottie. I won\u2019t dismiss the idea that a better-dressed woman probably looks more attractive than a worse-dressed person, but putting together a cute outfit is something I consider to take a bit of creativity and some brainpower, so if I\u2019m impressed with your attire, then I\u2019m impressed with you, and I pretty much have to be impressed in some way in order to be attracted. And that\u2019s the thing about conventional physical attractiveness - it doesn\u2019t impress me much. You don\u2019t have to do anything to be born hot. How much all this is because of how smart I may or may not be is a mystery to me. It doesn\u2019t seem to me like being attracted to intelligence or any form of excellence should be limited to the more intelligent among us. And I\u2019m sure there are plenty of brainiacs who are well satisfied with chasing airheaded hotties, to put it crudely. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll say my experience as someone with an IQ of 164, not at all. I am attracted to people not based on their intelligence, I have never met a woman with my same IQ or higher but I have met women with IQs in the 150s. The trait is not attractive one bit, it helps though since having some traits without a good IQ can make you unattractive to me. Overall I do not see that much difference between somebody with an IQ of 90 and an IQ of 140 while doing things I enjoy as part of a couple, but some people with IQs like me lead a scholarly life and enjoy a completely different type of activities than me, if that is the life you lead and the interests you carry I can see how it might hurt a relationship. There is also another factor playing a role here that is I believe more important, although Freud was insane with some of his theories I do believe that our parents play a role in what we grow up to look for in a partner, if you take that into account and the fact that IQ is statistically speaking mostly hereditary there will surely be a tendency in the form of a correlation to find attractive people with higher IQs. I'm an oddball in that my parents are not nearly as smart as I am, my mother is smart but she is no genius by my standards and my father is not even that, he is simply average. To quote Barry White: \u201cI don't want clever conversations\u2026 Don't want to work that hard\u2026 I just want some-someone to talk to.\u201d To me friendship requires an higher floor than love to the IQ of a person, I am perfectly happy just taking a stroll on the beach or watching the sunset with the woman I love without saying a word or talking about the scenery while with a friend if he starts telling me how cute is that cloud that looks like a bunny I wonder if I should take away his drink. xD Also, with friends I am only interested in what we can do and if you don't need my help I couldn't care less about your life which cuts down a whole avenue of conversation that I find wholly fascinating in a woman. The brother of one of my exes had an IQ similar to mine and he was perfectly happy in a 8 year relationship with a woman that his whole family considered dumb and not one bit of a match. He just like me didn't have genius parents. So I believe it isn't simply that smart people are attracted to smart people, simply people look mostly unknowingly for traits found in their parents in a potential partner. Of course I am talking specifically about IQs 160+ perhaps for us the scarcity leads us to make this adjustment, actually in my experience this might very well be the case because I was often told by people with IQs in the 130-150 range how they could never date X because they \u201ccouldn't talk with them\u201d which I personally think is a self-important load of crap and more often than not they didn't have any problems with an equally gifted person as long as she/he had less dissonating ideas on polarizing topics. The problem wasn't not being smart but simply making bad arguments mostly about politics coming from their political opposition. On the other hand I have never met anybody with an IQ above 160 with the same problem but that is entirely anecdotal. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is really interesting for me as I have been wondering that. First, you have got to know I have never been into a relationship before and I can count with one hand all the times I have been attracted by a guy. Since my childhood, I would be often told I am very smart for my young age. Even now, I am actually 16. People cannot help but notice how my way of thinking is very at miles away from other children's. It's kind of them to say this though I feel like I would better be called things like gregarious, coward, sad, happy. I mean real adjectives which would describe my personality. This is why I have a huge interest somehow for people who are not very smart. I know it may seem like nonsense, but I admire their carefree way of living, their self confidence like nothing bad could ever happen. When I am around them, I feel like I am around people with whom Life is going to be much funnier than alone myself. Even though we do not share the same interests, I love experiencing new things for the sake of knowledge. With them, I can leave the thinking and take the step. In addition, I think Life is about complementarity. As Humans, we have to complete each other with our inner capacities and personality. With less smart people, I can be of real use. Nevertheless, I have to admit that I often feel attracted to smarter people with whom I can have very deep and intense conversations. By attracted, I think we agree on \u201cattracted in general, not romantically\". As I said above, I love learning new things. With smart, even smarter people, I can deepen my thoughts and the universe inside me... Beside, Smart people seem soooo cool, collected whatever the situation is or however it gets. It gives me a feeling of inner security. All my friends are smart people in fact, but I also like to simply chat with less smart people. We laugh a lot. I also it comes from my INFJ nature. Maybe it really depends on the every smart people personality. Who knows ? Well, I am attracted by both people in general as with the two of them, we can either get deep and intense experiences or funny ones ",

            "answer_text": "Intelligence is a curse in a relationship.More important is the caring and consideration for each other. Relationships are not based on IQ. Never were and never will be. For convenience maybe if you are in a high profile position and need a partner for public display and appearance. For a relationship to work it just needs two people who care about each other and want to take care of each other. If IQ was the criteria then the really smart people would never have a Wife/Husband/Same Sex Partner.After all if it were not for sex then these partnerships/marriages would not be needed and we all know sex does not require intelligence. This is just not true. What is the definition of a meaningful relationship?The suggestion IQ/Intelligence is the key is ridiculous. The fact is men and women get together because they can offer many things for each other.Comfort, sex, companionship, caring, enjoying life together and so much more. \u201cMeaningful relationship and high intelligence\u201d I think we need to discuss tonights menu for the bedroom. Do you have time for this now? Last time it failed to meet my expectations since you were unable to sustain your performance long enough for me to be satisfied. How do you propose we correct this flaw in your abilities?\u201d \u201cWell you are correct, However I did achieve my goal of satisfaction so there was a high degree of success there. If we consider you did receive some stimulation and degree of excitement then the success rate you could say was well above 50% and most likely between 75\u201380%. That is a great outcome in anyone\u2019s books\u201d \u201cI accept your argument, however, at our level of intellect we should be capable of achieving close to 100% success with both parties achieving total satisfaction at the end of the passionate session.\u201d \u201cI believe you are correct. Since we are so intelligent we can work this out easily. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d \u201cOf course I do now what can you do to sustain your performance until I am fully satisfied?\u201d \u201cPerhaps some research is in order to establish suitable performance methods intended to achieve your desired outcome of satisfaction for both.\u201d \u201cYes I agree. Lets do some research to see what options we have.\u201d Girl with less intelligence (IQ below the range of this couple)\u201cLets go to bed and have some fun\u201d. \u201cGreat Idea\u201d.\u201cI so much enjoyed our love making, How about you.\u201d \u201cYes. Did I satisfy you. I was ok. Can we do it again.\u201d\u201cI just love you being with me. It makes me so happy\u201d \u201cMe too\u201d I cant wait to come home and be in your arms again every day.\u201cDid you see the news today. Never mind we can look at that later. Come here and give me a kiss and cuddle.\u201d\u201cdid you like the meal I cooked or Did you like dinner I brought home for you?\u201cYes it was my favourite. Thanks (Much value placed on remembering and recognising what pleases the partner (two way street of course)\u201d Intelligence does not make for a good relationship at all. It creates people who are analytical and judgmental with High Expectations. This is a failure waiting to happen. There are so many examples of successful relationships where one is a doctor/Professional/CEO/Wealthy Businessman/woman and the other a good looking not so intelligent girl/guy. Society and research is limited to small samples and not reliable. Any research with a limited number of people cannot be trusted to present reality. Evidence shows that in excess of 70% of Australian Filipino marriages are successful. This in itself proves the research wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "They might. But if I am allowed to elaborate the answer, keeping one attracted is a whole different set of discussion. Let's equalize being smart here to high IQ. I have met numerous of them in my life. Now let's take a sample. There's a married couple with their academics being bright. For sure, when getting to know the first time, their intelligence was what attracted each other. Days and nights they couldn't stop getting impressed on how lucky they were to find each other \u201cwhat a genius. Now this is what I call the new sexy. Unlike those with \u201conly\u201d physical attraction. Boring, low quality.\u201d No, I am not saying they were wrong to standardize their qualification of a partner through smartness, because that thing is attractive. Who can easily stop talking when there's a person to talk with about anything? About the universe? About unlimited ideas? We feel like finally there's a person understanding our ideas, while in normal days \u201cboring\u201d people can't really grasp our subjects, right? But here's the wrong. As much as they love the intelligence feature displayed by one and another, they mostly relied their judgement to live in the future as a married couple with mainly the same thing, each other's intelligence. Now that's not a so smart move. Look, intelligence, cognitive virtue, skill set to develop ideas/inventions, ain't the same as daily skill set. Let's call it that. Realistically speaking, we live in society. We don't live with ourselves, no matter how much we think we can. At one point we must meet someone to interact with and it requires more than intelligence to preserve ourselves in society. Intelligence alone is not enough. One can be intelligent and a jerk at the same time and no matter how the world still admires intelligence, such a person would get marginalized overtime for being considered unable to uplift moral standard. They would be placed only in a spot where they are good at (job, for example), but in other life aspects no one really voluntarily wills to get close to them. \u201cA smart jerk? Why letting ourselves getting dragged into a dark pit?\u201d. Intelligence is great and special, okay. But comfort can't lie. As much as infidelity is totally wrong, undeniably a lot of times their reason to cheat is because they feel comfortable with their affair partner. Everyone takes intelligent people special but the craving for comfort in heart is never a lie. Who can't stand talking to a smart person who is hard to deal and compromise with and it makes them sound hypocrite much or less, everyday? Man, I condemn infidelity, not in campaign for it. But living with such a \u201csmart\u201d partner doesn't mean it won't suffocate you. At one point, the person you are much attracted to for their smartness could be the very same person you feel sick about, gradually listening to their unshaky uncompromised intelligence while we know life isn't about relying only on IQ. On the other note, no matter how much someone feels about their partner, do not cheat. Solve the problem. If leave is the last resort, do it with honesty and dignity only after an adequate discussion conducted. Cheating is cheating and it's wrong no matter how badly you justify it. Learn to grow up and do things with dignity and honor. Now back to that couple. After knowing each other for several years, now they're on the way to divorce in less than a year of marriage. Turned out the admired partner was not so morally advance. Using the intelligence to manipulate the other, thinking the other person wouldn't realize it. Forgetting that the other person was also intelligent, one can't just get away with their manipulation. When someone is intelligent at the same time acquiring good moral, it's hard to continue the relationship with a partner who only exhibits intelligence with 0 moral. The intelligence would get ashy overtime. Good moral is always few steps ahead. Kindness brings warmth to the heart. Everyone wants to come home and hug/get hugged by someone with warmness. In relationships it's often enough to deal with intelligence only at works. When they are home they want someone to lean on who can do daily basis together as partners. Someone they can trust, whom they don't have to worry about cheating when they leave the partner alone. In fact, most of the times after a failed relationship, the very same people now want a more 'simple\u2019 partner \u201cno need to be crazily wealthy, genius, model-looking. Now as long as he/she is faithful, that's enough. I got it what I need in life.\u201d So yes a smart person could be attracted to other smart person. But it would just be temporary if they only rely on the intelligence in order to preserve the attraction. There are values and most of them are moral ones when coming to any relationship. ",

            "answer_text": "Yup. I am answering as a member of Intertel (99%) & Mensa (98%). Before I met my wife, I dated young women with no regard to intellect\u2026 and that was an issue. While these girls were sweet and attractive, to me they were just\u2026 dumb. At times, I felt more like a parent than a boyfriend. When I met my wife, her job title was Vice President of a biotech startup firm. Aside from her magnetic eyes, this really caught my attention. As we got to know each other, I was continually impressed with her capability to pull conclusions out of seemingly disparate data points and arrive at very accurate, logical conclusions. Opposite of feeling like her parent/educator, I realized I could learn from her and we could figure out the world together. I fell in love with her very quickly; I had her ring 6 months from our first meeting. My wife is nothing short of amazing and I recognize what a lucky man I am. Oh, and she's gorgeous to boot.  Edit 01/15/2020: WOW! So many upvotes and views! I am humbled :-) Also, I have been asked about her Myers-Briggs personality type\u2026 my wife is an INTJ Architect, which presents in less than 1% of the female population and is strongly correlated with the highest intelligence levels. Interestingly, I am also an INTJ Architect. So\u2026 she is truly a catch, indeed! ",

            "answer_text": "I think all the negative, sarcastic commenters are getting this totally wrong. Being \u201cgifted\u201d (in quotation marks because I hate that expression) is more similar to being autistic or just being \u201con a different frequency\u201d than the remaining 98% of the population than it is being an otherwise normal human with ~Superior Extra Intelligence~. Therefore, as children, \u201cgifted\u201d people often have a hard time making friends because we don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d normal kids and they certainly don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d us. This does get less prominent as we get older, but most \u201cgifted\u201d people will still feel this odd sense of being a little \u201coff\u201d with people in general. I have most of my experience with platonic friendships. I guess I percieve platonic companionship as a basic necessity and romantic relationships as a luxury, and I struggled with feeling very lonely and distanced for the first 12\u201313 years of my life. Then I transferred schools to the only school for gifted children here in the small country of Denmark and I formed the strong, deep bonds to the 3\u20134 people I still consider my closest friends today, 7 years later. I have a radar similar to the \u201cgaydar\u201d some people claim to have. I can just sense immediately if someone is gifted too. It\u2019s in their humor, their observations, their remarks, sometimes I can see it in people\u2019s eyes - it\u2019s like we\u2019re on a different plane of consciousness, for better or for worse. You can\u2019t become gifted no matter how hard you try, just like you can\u2019t become autistic. And trust me, you shouldn\u2019t want to. You are fine as you are. I grew up in a suburb and I believe it\u2019s easier for gifted people to make friends and fall in love in big cities, simply because they are more densely populated and have a statistically higher chance of running into other gifted people. I am in the highest 2% of the population IQ-wise and take my word: it does NOT mean I\u2019m wiser or better at studying or any of those clich\u00e9-film-traits of a gifted person. I overthink everything to a disabling extent, I can\u2019t function in the traditional academic education system, and my emotional coping abilities are immature. I\u2019m hypersensitive and have ADD traits. I perceive the world fundamentally different. But I\u2019m, like, really good at language-related skills, writing and coming up with language-based jokes. :p ",

Then I met my wife, a graduate of a trade school. She was so sweet and kind. I fell in love with her immediately and we were engaged 2 weeks later. We are married over 47 years and it has been a great marriage. She keeps asking why I married her. It was for her soul. She genuinely wants to please people. She does not have a mean bone in her body. She takes good care of me. She held down the homestead when I was away on business over 12 weeks in a year. She put up with 13 relocations and decorating 9 houses we owned. My nephew married an intelligent girl with a Masters Degree. He has a BS in computer science and yet he quits his job to move whoever his wife takes a new job. He cooks and cleans plus takes care of the kids while holding down a full time job. The girl that my wife and I shared for 30 years married a doctor. She feels that housework is beneath her so they have a housekeeper and eat out or have food delivered every day. When she stayed with us for a week or weekend, she does not know how to make a cup of coffee, cook or work a washing machine. My wife had to do all of that for her. Her husband got stuck raising her kid from a previous marriage and never had a home cooked meal from her. Say what you will, I am much happier with my wife who genuinely enjoys being the mistress of our home, and is nothing like me. Two of me would not get along well at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Smart people are attracted to interesting people regardless of their intelligence. Of course that includes many smart people, and that makes my answer partially, \u201cYes.\u201d For serious relationships I prefer women who are in my intelligence range and who are sufficiently accomplished that I can learn many things from them and enjoy talking and even arguing with them. I did have a negative experience with certifiably intelligent women. Many years ago I used my SAT scores to join Mensa with the goal of meeting intelligent women to date. Unfortunately for me, the local chapter of Mensa had some really nice and interesting women, but they were all married. The single women in that chapter and at that time were not people I enjoyed being around for long. Likely, they felt the same about me. I have since met many highly intelligent single women who are unusually good and interesting people, but high intelligence does not guarantee this. Isaac Newton is an example of a really intelligent person that few people of any intelligence would want to be around or could be attracted to. Of course his tragic childhood contributed to this, but he still wasn\u2019t an attractive person. While intelligence is an important factor for me personally in forming long term romantic relationships, it isn\u2019t much of a factor in my formation of other friendships. ",

And then i met this amazing women. She had a different outlook to life. She saw the world completely differently from what I did. She talked about her work and aspirations so passionately it would give me shivers. She would have logical strong opinions about things, and she would voice and argue about them, most of the times peacing out on no one is right. She would talk about changing the world, have plans about it. We would discuss the world and how things work, and how mountains look at night and how the sunrises are the best times of the day. She would make me feel do more in life, constantly. She makes me learn new things. She inspires me to read up new things about her work and her opinions. She would make me meet her friends, and i would be amazed to see such amazing people. and THEN she would have childish worries, that make her the cutest kid i have known. She is beautiful on top of it. She makes me feel excited about life, makes me look forward to meet her. I dont know if this is categorised as being smart. I dont even consider myself smart. But yes, i have never felt so fulfilled with anyone else. TAKE HOME MESSAGE - its really not about smart people attracting smart people. I am attracted to women who have an opinion about almost everything, can express it, work it up with logic, and argue if she feels i contest her thoughts. At the same time, she makes you feel loved and respected. It\u2019s a beautiful feeling to feel challenged and loved at the same time. It keeps my life alive. Love her to MACS0647-JD and beyond. ",

Being smart yourself means that you know that you don\u2019t know everything and can learn from others. It\u2019s a pleasure to hear even what you do know, expressed by persons you consider \u201csmart\u201d. They probably have the same or similar backgrounds. In addition, there is a certain comfort in being around people who look and act like you. On the one hand it\u2019s likely that intellectually, you share similar tastes and dislikes and can communicate them on the same level. On the other hand, you can feel safe from idiots; you will have others on your side if confronted by lesser individuals. ",

My IQ is estimated to be about 111 (tested) so I\u2019m within the average intelligence, and only a touch above. Furthermore, I have a pretty extensive education (I understand knowledge and intelligence are not the same, but both are essential to be in the realm of an intellectual. My education is a decent college and I\u2019m halfway through my BBA. So far I\u2019m exceeding in my education. my personal opinion. Being intelligent to me isn\u2019t a primary factor in who I become attractive to, but unintelligent people think below 80 IQ will raise my eyebrows. What really gets me is a person\u2019s knowledge, people that don\u2019t have the most basic knowledge or even interest in topics like biology, history, philosophy, the basic principles of economy or business. I just find these people lacking of substance, since then I\u2019m forced to find other topics of interest, that often have less to talk about. If \u201cshopping\u201d and \u201cNetflix\u201d are on a girls tinder profile I\u2019m less interested than if they put nothing at all in their bio. I value someone with the mental strength and knowledge to add value I can\u2019t attain with my perspective. So to sum it up for a person like me, exceptionally low intelligence is a turn off but not a deal breaker. Intelligence is largely unchangeable, at least in the sense that one can\u2019t add 50 points to their IQ at will. A lack of knowledge is a dealbreaker since I don\u2019t really gain new experiences or ideas from people lacking a desire for knowledge. This is a bigger deal for me since anyone can learn. ",

Enjoy attraction if it\u2019s reciprocated and don\u2019t think about it too much. Life is too short. p.s. I can\u2019t be too smart\u2026I had to look up the proper spelling of \u201creciprocated\u201d. ",

I don\u2019t like to talk too much about my IQ because doing so is considered a bit pretentious where I come from, but yes, I wanted \u2014 and found \u2014 a wife with whom I\u2019m able to have in-depth conversations about things that I know about. I\u2019m talking about marriage here, but the same is true to some extent of any relationship : communicating with somebody whose IQ is much lower than one\u2019s own requires a lot of dumbing down and leaves the person with the higher IQ feeling very lonely, with the person they are trying to relate to being unable to understand them in any meaningful way (and the person with the lower IQ, for his or her part, feels that the other party is talking over their head all the time). I got lucky, and married an incredibly intelligent woman whose father considered anything below 130 to be \u201clow IQ\u201d. I\u2019d be hard-put to name a single member of her family whose IQ appears to be below that, so I think I made a prize catch. And oh yes, it\u2019s our silver anniversary this coming November. ",

To remain smart, one must continue to learn new stuff (as the world changes) and update the old stuff as what you know becomes obsolete. It\u2019s been estimated that half of what a new college graduate learns, becomes functionally out-of-date within a decade \u2014 faster in STEM fields. How do smart people stay smart? One way is by cavorting with other smart people! Smart people are attracted to other smart people to gauge their \u201csmartness\u201d by how well they engage with others, especially other smart people. They are reaffirmed if other smart people want to be around them but, they also understand that they can learn valuable lessons from not-so-smart people as well. (Some smart people may seek to belittle others to boost their fragile egos, but by-in-large these are not really smart people.) Bottom line: one becomes smarter by being around smart people (and likewise dumber by being around dumb people). ",

She has had a very difficult life and has lots of interesting insights into life and I would say that she acquired wisdom through this difficult life. She is also very creative and an artist. Does any of this matter? No. What matters a bit is that we both have reasonbly high EQ (Emotional Intelligence) and so we are able to talk about any problems that come up. The most important thing though is that we are compatible with each other and we care and love each other a lot. That is all you need. ",

Successful women had either high hips to waist ratio, younthful appearance or neoteny (cuteness). Successful men mostly had high socio economical status (which intelligence can be a part of). I dated some very smart and some very simple girls and i can't say it made much difference to me. I ended up marrying a very sweet, caring and cute girl (neoteny FTW). She also has a high hips to waist ratio so jackpot haha. She didn't go to university, but still has an interesting point of view and we have interesting conversations everyday. ",

Assortive mating for intelligence is higher than for any other human characteristic. So yes, smart people tend to be attracted to smart people. Most of that has to do with sociocultural pressures to ensure offspring success in an ever more complex world. Things change and epigenetics will drive changes in mating strategies which could emphasize other traits, like height, and strength. ",
