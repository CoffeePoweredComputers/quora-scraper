            "answer_text": "As a victim of poor education system ( in Mongolia ) I can only speak from my experience, but other systems are not too far off too. Here are few reasons: High emphasis on grades. Grades, not every child is built the same way. School in my opinion should help a child find his or her path in life. Rather than forcing them all to chase good grades. This in turn has a tendency to discourage failing students while giving false sense of grandeur to good students.Lack of good teachers. I\u2019m not sure rest of the world. But here in Mongolia, being a teacher means low salary job that people with lack of any other career prospects do. After all, what someone who never worked in a professional field other than teaching can teach you about such fields.Lack of Motivation. Our education system has a terrible job of inspiring or motivating kids to learn. People are motivated in different ways, some want money, some want position, some want comfort, some want stress free job, some want to become athletes. But here you are more motivated to avoid failing in school rather than learning for a profession.Pressure on students. Aside from being extremely rigid, our school system gives students advanced level subjects that they have hard time understanding. While some are capable, not everyone can do math just for fun. So it creates a level of corruption where students cheat and beg for grades just to get by. Our country doesn\u2019t have a single factory you will actually need to make complicated equations, yet students are forced to memorize such stuff. Being pressured and forced rarely makes someone want to do that.High level of corruption. While having strong grade system our system is also blatantly corrupt. Teachers just give grades to students to avoid failing. This in turn discourage other more hard working students to try hard. Grades are given from anywhere from sweet talking to bribing. Students cheat at tests and sometimes teachers even help them to cheat so that they won\u2019t be left behind. As a kid I was extremely hard working, and it felt discouraging how I would study all night to get a B+, while some cheater got A+. For most kids it\u2019s not big deal, but for someone like me with poor parents, lack of mentors and very little to no future felt like getting stabbed. After all, why bother working hard if cheaters just win in life?Too long school years. Our formal education lasts 12 years. Stupid if you ask me. It would take 5 years at most to learn how to read, write, do basic math and have common sense in science. Everything else is just memorizing for a test. Unlike in Germany where kids do apprenticeships in school, and actually learn productive lessons, our education system doesn\u2019t even bother with it. 12 years is too long of a time for someone to spend time just to memorize and pass tests.Lack of home education. In general I believe kids learn more from their parents than school. In the past vocations were taught from father to son. School was only useful for learning how to read, write and do basic math. Most parents simply expect kids to do well in school and make it without realizing that they are themselves are the biggest teachers. After all, best athletes tend to come from athletic families, so are businessmen, lawyers etc. How can you direct your child to be a lawyer when you yourself have very little to no understanding of being one. I\u2019ve never had a professional doctor, lawyer or millionaire businessman in my household. So I never knew if I even want to be one. You cannot know what you want to be unless you feel it.",
