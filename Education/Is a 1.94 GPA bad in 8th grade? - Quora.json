            "answer_text": "Yes. A 1.94 GPA is bad no matter how old you are. The good news is, it\u2019s not too late for you to turn things around. If you improve your grades, you can still graduate from high school and attend college or a trade school. There\u2019s a reason your GPA is so low. Whatever that reason is, you need to fix the underlying cause so that you can get your grades up. If you have not been studying at school \u2014 if you are blowing off your classes, not paying attention in class, or not doing your homework \u2014 you need to change your study habits significantly.If you are trying your best in school but you cannot organize your studying in a way that works, you should meet with a school counselor to learn ways that you can improve your study skills.If you are doing everything you can, and your performance on tests doesn\u2019t match your understanding of the material, you should meet with a school counselor and see about getting tested to learn whether you might have an undiagnosed learning disability.If there is tension at home, or a lot of distractions that prevent you from studying effectively, you should meet with a school counselor to explore possible ways you can address the problem.",

Why did you get such a terrible grade and waste your year? Use this as motivation to not have incredibly stupid grades in the future. ",
