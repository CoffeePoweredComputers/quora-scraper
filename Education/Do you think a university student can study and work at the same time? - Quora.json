            "answer_text": "The reality is that a lot of university students study and work at the same time. I did it when I was in college in the U.S. It was stressful at times, but I needed to support myself. All of my friends at school had jobs, too. It\u2019s normal for American university students. I know this isn\u2019t universal, though. Now I live in China, where it seems to be unusual for serious university students to work or even date. I\u2019ve met quite a few people here who just graduated from college, but never had any kind of work experience unless it was just for the summer. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the major being studied. An engineering student may find working and studying more complicated than a banking student may find. Many majors have a pretty load of studies on students, where they barely manage to finish all their assignments before deadlines. Other majors are piece of cakes, where the student can easily work and study. I am studying architecture and I am suffering so much. But at the end it is worth it. There are some quick easy solutions: Try to work between terms/semestersTry to find a job that pays you per hourGood luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I did so from 2013 to 2018. I didn't study full-time though, I usually did 1/3 or 2/3 of a regular study load, while working full time. It was doable, but it did mean having less spare time for fun things. One guy I studied with managed to do a full study load while also working full time, but he was exceptionally bright. ",
