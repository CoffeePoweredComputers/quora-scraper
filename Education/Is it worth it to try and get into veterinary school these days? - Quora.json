            "answer_text": "Ask vets this question,  they best know the market for their services.  Also, many small animal vets run their own businesses even though it is getting more common for vet hospitals to be part of a chain.  Do you want to do to that? Finally, the idea of wildlife rehabilitation may be attractive to you but I would guess that it is both competitive and low paying.   Joe the puma may badly need medical care but he doesn't have a bank account or any credit.  Of course, since I don't manage a farm and don't rehabilitate injured wild animals I don't really know anything about large animal or wildlife practice.  If you are interested in these things contact someone who does. ",

            "answer_text": "You sound like a very intelligent person with some good thinking regarding your future.  Many people leap into vet school \"because they like animals\" and then get summarily weeded out.  It's tough work.  Lots of hours, difficult decisions, and as you said, the money to go to school in the first place are all very valid things to consider.Talk to your favorite veterinarian.  Ask them how they arrived at their decision to make this their career.  Ask them what they love/hate about it.  Weigh it out, and I'm sure you will find your answer. ",
