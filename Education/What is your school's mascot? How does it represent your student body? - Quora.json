            "answer_text": "My high school, a long long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, was the Rams. Or if you used the long form, the Wreckin\u2019 Rams.  The school had a statue of a ram outside, whose main purpose was to get vandalized by our crosstown rival school every year before the big football game. This is the statue minus the spraypaint:  I do not know why. Bighorn sheep are not native to south Louisiana, and the region is not especially known for sheep, goats, or any members of the artiodactyl subfamily Caprinae. As far as I can tell, all the high schools in the region were just assigned mascots that were already in use by famous professional or college sports teams\u2014our rivals included the Lions, the Bears, the Vikings, and the Spartans (and what the heck were Spartans and Vikings doing in Louisiana?) Our mascot was basically just another big furry animal with the power to hurt you. Which did describe the football team pretty well, I might add. . . My undergraduate university had a mascot that looked like this:  It actually descends from a sportswriter\u2019s article from the 1900s or thereabouts\u2014the school colors are green and blue, and the writer described the football team as \u201csurging across the field like a green wave\u201d, or something like that. From then on, Tulane University\u2019s mascot became the Green Wave. Given the region\u2019s proximity to the sea and its propensity for flooding, even before Katrina, the mascot does make sense\u2014although if you wanted to be really accurate, the mascot should be the Brown Oil Slick, not the Green Wave. The problem is that that\u2019s kind of a difficult mascot to depict so that it has a personality, although as you can see, the artist did try. It\u2019s also hard to design a wearable costume, although in my time there they did make a valiant attempt:  After I left, they eventually gave up. The costumed mascot is now Riptide, a pelican\u2014because pelicans are native to Louisiana and also appear on the state flag and university seal. The teams\u2019 name is still the Green Wave. My grad school mascot looked like this:  Although it was and is often depicted in a more ferocious and/or realistic style, like so:  The California grizzly bear was the emblem of the rebels in 1846 who fought against Mexican rule and briefly proclaimed an independent republic. It\u2019s still on the state flag, so it\u2019s fitting for California\u2019s first state university. The golden color comes from California\u2019s nickname of the Golden State, dating back to the famous gold rush of 1849. It might be a little more convincing if the last California grizzly bear hadn\u2019t been shot in 1922, and the last California grizzly in captivity hadn\u2019t died in 1911. The university where I teach now is also known as the Bears, although in this case the species is the American black bear (Ursus americanus), not the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos). Even though the mascot is depicted in purple (school colors are purple and gray, for some reason), it\u2019s still supposed to be a black bear:  The costumed mascot, known as Bruce D. Bear, is recognizably a black bear:  This is also fitting for Arkansas, which used to be known as the Bear State for its sizable population of black bears. Sadly, hunting almost completely wiped out the bear population in Arkansas\u2014although they are making a comeback now, with about 5000 black bears in the state, mostly in lowland forests and wetlands. So the bear mascot is fitting for a state university. UCA was founded as a teacher training college, and in its early days the sports teams were often referred to as the Teachers or the Pedagogues. Purely from a marketing and branding perspective, the Bear is probably a better mascot. And I suddenly realize that I\u2019ve just spent the past hour posting my CV in the form of a bunch of mascot pictures. Damn it, Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "The Vikings.  If you were to drive by the school, you would instantly see this amazing mural three stories high. Before this mural, the Class of 1967 had one up there; it has since been replaced by the Class of 2013 mural. As you can see, we kept the incorrect horns on the helmet. Anyways, this shows the amount of pride that we, as Airline Vikings, have in our school. It even goes to the point to where each sports team in the school does some form of shouting \u201cPRIDE,\u201d ironic, isn't it. The motto for that year was \u201cValor Unconquered,\u201d meaning that we have an unholy amount of courage in the face of a battle. This was shown on multiple occasions: Our principal was accused of religious proselytization because he added \u201cGod Bless You\u201d to the end of morning announcements. He practically called the offended people pitiful and walked his merry way. Amazing. This was even covered by FOX News.Everyone being okay with the courtyard being taken up by the new building so we could have extra room. As a result, everyone packs themselves in the area between the girl\u2019s and boy\u2019s gym. It made for a really cluster first week of school.Really anytime a sports team is winning or losing. We have impeccable sportsmanship.All in all, pride/courage is really what our school is about. Even though we spend a great deal of our money on Football, we still are a great school.  And just for pride\u2019s sake, this is our wrestling team logo:  I love how ornate and pleasing to the eye it is. ",
