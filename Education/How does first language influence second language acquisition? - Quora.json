            "answer_text": "Your first language, which is the native language, influences your second language learning or acquisition in one of two ways called positive language transfer or negative language transfer. This system presupposes that before you attempt to learn a second language, you have to be proficient in your own language, that is, the native language, so that you can you easily effect grammatical transfer from the native language to the second language. If, on the one hand, you are proficient in the native or first language, you will be able effect positive grammatical transfer from the first language to the second language. This system is called \u201cpositive native language transfer\u201d to the second language. If, on the other hand, you are not proficient in the first language, then, you are likely to transfer all the grammatical flaws in the first language to the second language. This system is called \u201cnegative native language transfer\u201d to the second language. Stephen Krashen, America\u2019s premier second language acquisition theorist, has proposed that, if a student, who is not proficient in the native language, is studying a second language, the teacher should keep teaching her in the native language so that she can remedy the pitfalls she has been encountering in the first language.This means that, as she continues to remedy mistakes encountered in the first language, she would be in a better position to progress satisfactorily in the second language. As a matter of fact, a student should not venture out to learn a second language until she has acquired proficiency in the first language. To do so without adequate grammatical and linguistic preparation would invite frustration leading to abject disappointment. In sum, we see that first language influence on second language acquisition or learning can be either helpful or devastating. Whereas, on the one hand, first language proficiency serves to facilitate and expedite second language learning, the lack of first language proficiency, on the other hand, inhibits second language learning.

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you acquire the second language. It is very easy to see the general purpose of your first language, wherein we acquire our first language through academic schools and standards that are constrained to our country. We do have measures to translate and make the education broader to the world, though we are accountable speaking as citizens for our knowledge in the country. This makes K-12, college in major and general education, and any graduate school very easy to read in terms of what you know and its purpose. What we know is constrained by what our researchers in each field are doing and can teach us, by what we ourselves can discover and come to know, and what has been translated from other languages into ours. This points out the conceptual separation between one language and another language, into what members are interpretable among each other, and what set of concepts are contained and represented in each language. They are speaking about sets, overlapping but not certain to be the same set of concepts that both languages can point to and represent. This means that when you acquire that second language, you can study translations from your first acquired language. This will heavily rely on the concepts you have already studied, trying to find appropriate translations and interpretations in that second language. This can only be subdued where you are fluent enough in the second language, know enough primary elements, to start learning a subject and possibly different set of concepts in that second language. That is the area I am suggesting is interesting and relevant for that second language, which only that second language can answer where it has not translated such concepts to other languages. ",
