            "answer_text": "I agree with the other Oxonians who\u2019ve responded so far. They have just as good a reputation (better in some rankings; it depends which table you look in) as Harvard, but they are very old universities and offer an altogether different experience. Put it this way, I\u2019ve been in a room full of people from American Ivy League universities, Harvard among them, and worked with them, too, and it is often the case that they (I don\u2019t know why) seem to really respect Oxbridge folks. Maybe it\u2019s the combination of the Englishness, the history and tradition of Oxford and Cambridge\u2026???? Maybe it\u2019s because they think that, to be able to have got in, because of the appalling old class system, you must be not only smart but posh and rich? I don\u2019t know. My fellow Oxonions who have gone to the States have all been snapped up in top jobs. In fact, one pretty English rose friend, who joined a US real estate company without a degree at all, is being promoted on the firm\u2019s website as having been educated \u201cat private school in England.\u201d I kid you not!!!A year or two back, I was working on an executive search project for a hugely successful young international tech company. I was hiring/interviewing for them in both London and New York. The team of which I was part was comprised totally of graduates from Oxford, Cambridge, Yale and Harvard. The CEO (who said his company needed people like ME!) had done his first degree at Yale, postgrad at Cambridge (rowing Blue) and had an adjunct professorship at INSEAD. And the lady I was working closely with, I discovered, had studied at Yale, then achieved the third highest mark at Harvard Law School. I couldn\u2019t believe it when, over a dinner one night in New York, she told me she was starting another postgrad at Columbia University - and asked ME if I\u2019d be HER mentor for the program!I was gobsmacked. She was from a very highly academic, New York Jewish professional family, too, with a huge emphasis on musical accomplishment and learning. What does one make of that? It was the hugest compliment because I have the utmost respect for Harvard. ",

            "answer_text": "When you ask such questions, you are going to get two different answers. Those who are British will argue that Oxford and Cambridge are far more prestigious.Those who are American will argue that Harvard is more prestigious.The problem is, each of these universities are intrinsic social artefacts of the respective societies in which they are located. And surely, within every country, there is a different social dynamic in which some domestic institutions might be equal to, or more often, far more prestigious than Harvard, Oxford, or Cambridge. Prestige is irrelevant if people do not know about the existence of that whose prestige is being discussed. If the most prestigious university that the typical person in Japan knows is the University of Tokyo, then you\u2019re not going to convince him that some other school in some other country/society is more prestigious. There is no standardized measure of prestige. Prestige is based on human perception, and human perception is based on the specific perspectives of the communities in which they inhabit. In other words, each community has their own specific conception of prestige. You cannot deny the fact that Oxford and Cambridge are the two most prominent and prestigious universities in the U.K. In some circles within the U.K, nobody would even care about the existence of Harvard.
