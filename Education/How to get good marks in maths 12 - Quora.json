            "answer_text": "Mathematics is a subject that every student has to study at one time or another. Some love it but if we\u2019re being honest, most people hate studying maths. The importance of math for students has never been more prominent. Following are some tips to help you achieve full marks in maths. Practice, Practice & More Practice:It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems. The more you practice answering math problems, the better you get. Review Errors:When you\u2019re practicing with difficult problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. Don\u2019t skip difficult Question:Sometimes you can get stuck trying to solve part of a maths problem and find it difficult to move on to the next stage. It\u2019s common for many students to skip this question and continue on to the next. You should avoid doing this and instead spend time trying to understand the process of solving the problem. Make Short Notes:As you study a chapter, list out the various formulas.Mathematics has specific terminology with a lot of vocabulary. I suggest you create Notes with all the concepts, terminology and definitions you need to know. You should include their meanings, some key points so you can consult them at any time and recap. Keep Up with the SyllabusUnderstanding your portions and the weightage attached to different sections. this will help you in deciding how much time to dedicate to each section. For example, if you know that there will be just a 5 marks question from a particular section, you do not have to dedicate a week practicing those sums. NCERT maths textbook. Understand all the theoretical aspects of all the concepts for each chapters; Do not just remember the formulas; understand the concept behind them and practice their derivation as well. Review previous Test papers:Use your old tests and class work to create a personal study guide for your upcoming exam. Look at the way your teacher frames questions \u2013 this is probably how they will appear on your test. Solve maximum sample papers before the examSample papers provide us with an idea of the type of questions and the pattern of the exam which you are actually going to write in the next few days. It helps you practice and learn time management skills. 10% \u2013 20% are comes from sample paper each year so that you have to solve sample paper. I have a suggestion of an application \u201cOye Exams\u201dAvailable at Google Play Store can help you to make your Board exam easy.

            "answer_text": "There's only one answer to your question. STUDY! But hey, don't study hard, study SMART! Start your studies everyday for a time that is comfortable for you. Study for atleast 3 hours at a flow. Because it takes a person at least 15-20 minutes to get in a flow of what they are studying. So studying for 3 hours is optimal. This is a very important advice: Don't refer to 3 or 4 different books. Solve only one book that'll match your level and solve it and understand it thoroughly. I guess that's all. ",
