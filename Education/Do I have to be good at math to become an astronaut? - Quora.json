            "answer_text": "It depends on whether you wanna become a scientist or an engineer. A scientist is supposed to be good at mathematics, but it\u2019s not all the case. For most research areas like physics, chemistry and artificial intelligence, mathematics is required because you have to formalize your work and figure out what to do next that would optimize your work and explore the unknown areas. When exploring the unknown areas, mathematics is a good tool to describe what that cannot be visually understood. Take AI for example, you have to be good at these equations and formulas to be able to choose the correct model, algorithms and parameters, and figure out how to tune your algorithms to better achieve your goals. Most of the time, engineers just \u201cimplement\u201d what the scientists formalize, so engineers are not required to be very good at mathematics but they are supposed to be able to understand mathematical things. If you can read the frequently used equations and formulas, deductions of your research area, you\u2019ll definitely be a good engineer in your profession. I think mathematics is not required for all astronauts, but it would help you better understand your profession and become an expert in your circle if you are good at mathematics. ",
