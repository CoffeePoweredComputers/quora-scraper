My opinion - before coming to medical I was really looking upto opt for baslp because it is a very good course but you have to consider some things before opting it : This is paramedical profession.You can't prescribe medicine like ENT specialists, however you(audiologist/speech therapist) have bigger role in assisting them and other health proffessionals.See syllabus of BASLP on google which you are going to study in this course, and if it doesn't interests you then probably this course is not suitable for you.Don't worry about future, future of BASLP is very bright in India as well as abroad as long as you are interested in it.Thank you.
