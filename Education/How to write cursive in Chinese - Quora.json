            "answer_text": "Unlike cursive writing in many European languages which can be easily learnt by elementary students, cursive in Chinese is extremely difficult and only trained calligraphy artists can even attempt to do it well. This is what we call \u8349\u66f8.  While very elegant, it is extremely difficult to write or even read, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to second language learners. Even native speakers can not understand it without training and experience in calligraphy and classical Chinese art, but if you are interested, look for Chinese Calligraphy courses and they might have something you may be interested in. A slightly easier type of cursive writing is what we call \u884c\u66f8.  While most native speakers can read it, they may or may not understand it as it is usually written in Classical Chinese instead of the Vernacular Mandarin Chinese that most people are familiar with. Even though most of us can read it, again, it is very difficult to write without experience in Classical Chinese Art and Calligraphy. ",
