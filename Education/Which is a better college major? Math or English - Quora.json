            "answer_text": "As biased as I am for STEM against humanities, I\u2019m going to have to be honest and say no. There\u2019s a theory that the better you are at one, the worse at the other, and to do any sort of maths subject you have to have a certain serious mindset that follows logical paths to their conclusion. This really does not bode well for creativity. If we look at the very best wordsmiths, we find that they can spin, out of a lexicon of only a few thousand words, flights of fancy and constructions to enchant the soul. This chap is PG Wodehouse:  he created works that are, in their subject matter, as substantial as blancmange. They shouldn\u2019t be as enthralling as they are, and yet as far as comedic writing is concerned, the twentieth century produced scant peers for him, perhaps only Oscar Wilde. The twenty-first is falling far under his bar. Wodehouse started out working in a bank as he couldn\u2019t afford university fees. He was utterly unsuited to it; he found it baffling and uncongenial. His talent for finance and the maths that goes with it were nil, but his ability to bash words into elegant sentences is undoubtably one par excellence. It\u2019s true that no work of the humanities can advance our society. But were we a strictly scientific society, we\u2019d be no society at all; we\u2019d be a collection of robots made of meat. In the past I\u2019ve publicly espoused having all the poets rounded up and shot, but the truth is we need the arts to prove we are not machines. In this way, comparing two persons on an equal level in arts and sciences (maths is a science, in fact it\u2019s the first one and is the parent of all the rest) is a fruitless act, as they are both, in their respective fields, as intellectually gifted as each other. Both deal in constructive sequences. The one seeks to unravel the nature of the universe. The other seeks to hold a mirror up to it and illuminate it for us. Both use ugly squiggles to do it. Both hammer them into burning edifices that light the way. At least they do if they\u2019re any good. ",

            "answer_text": "I would have to say that the maths would be a better major, if for no other reason than today\u2019s liberal arts have become \u201cleftist arts\u201d. Liberal arts have become nothing more than indoctrination camps run by leftists, and out the door has gone critical thinking, virtue, appreciation of the classics, etc. It was not always this bad. And it is sad to see. At least that has not happened with the math departments. At least not yet. Let us all hope. Now, assuming you can actually get a decent English education somewhere without all the leftist dogma, I would say it is up to you. What are you more interested in? What are your passions? What are your goals? What do you see yourself doing after you complete your degrees? I think an English major is more for those who just love knowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t see a lot of high-paying jobs out there for an English major, to be honest. However, you might use that to segue yourself into something more lucrative. At least with a math major, there are more lucrative possibilities available to you, depending on your level of mathematics. It will be easier to segue yourself, too. There is nothing wrong with acquiring either just for the love of it. But do be realistic about it, and look at all your options for the future. ",
