            "answer_text": "I was in Vibrant Acdemy for 2 years, 2016\u201318, and I was in P2 Batch in XI, and A2 Batch in XII, which are the 2nd topmost batch in the academy, all taught by directors, so I find myself eligible to answer this question of yours. In Vibrant, students are divided into 4 houses, N,L,G,E (may be different as I dont remember exactly). Top 150\u2013160 students get to study an the top batch P1-P2, roughly top 30\u201340 students from each house get there. So in the review tests, one has to maintain that much \u201chouse cumulative rank\u201d, before the reshufflings, to get in top batch. Rest students are given batches in their respective house only, such as N1,N2,N3,N4, strictly on ranking basis. Reshuffling is done 2\u20133 times in XI, and 1\u20132 times in XII. P1 batch comprises of 30\u201335 students,whereas P2 vomprises of 120\u2013125 students. House top batches, that is N1,G1,E1,L1 (strength 150 each) also get taught one or two subjects by directors. The name of the houses changes in XII. And P1-P2 change to A1-A2 in XII, note that P or A are not houses, just batches, students in P or A batches have their houses N,L,G,etc So thats the batch system of Vibrant Academy, and your \u201chouse cumulative rank\u201d decides your batch. One thing I would like to add, most of the time students blame teachers, or the batch, but many a times the subject requires a lot self study and practice, you can not just rely on teachers for that. And yeah Batch doesn't matters much if one is consistent in his/her studies. Hope this helps, All the best!! ",
