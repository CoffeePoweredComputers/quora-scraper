            "answer_text": "There are many good job opportunities for students who graduate with a technically-focused associates degree (from their local community college or non-profit tech focused college). Programs include areas like electrical engineering technology, mechanical engineering technology, automotive technology, IT support, and so on. Associates degrees also represent the first two years of a bachelor\u2019s degree, so some or many of these \u201ctransfer associates\u201d don\u2019t translate into specific jobs. (Example, an associates in liberal arts or general studies.) But depending on state, completing your associates at a community college enables you to transfer to the state\u2019s college and university system as a junior. ",
