            "answer_text": "To get into vet school in the US you usually need two semesters of Biology, two semesters of General Chemistry, two semesters of Organic Chemistry, one semester of Biochemsitry and Precalculus or above. Some schools have specific requirements for Animal Nutrition, Genetics, Microbiology or Public Speaking. In addition to those base requirements, you will usually need a pertinent degree. A BS in Biology or Animal Science is the most typical path. It is also possible to have completed other degrees and then taken the prerequisites, but that is the non-traditional path.  Other countries are very different. ",
