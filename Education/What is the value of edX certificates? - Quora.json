            "answer_text": "edX certificates range in price from around $50-$100. So if you are just paying for the certificate I would say definitely not worth the price. Prospective employers and anyone else will believe you when you say you have done the course and you can show a screenshot of the congratulations page when you finish the course if you need proof. I do think that in some cases paying for the certificate is worth it and that is because it also unlocks more features in the course. Some skills are hard to learn. When you pay for a certificate you also get access to more of the exams and you will have your assignments graded. This feedback is often invaluable to see if you are making progress or just following the videos. Another good way to decide if you want to invest the money is to think of how much your time is worth. Think of the money as an investment against your time, it will help you stay motivated through the harder parts of the learning curve. If the course is 48 hours over 12 weeks then $75 might be a good ideaIf you just want a quickie to gain a quick skill then take the free optionHopefully, that helps we have a longer edX review and a break down of online certificates if you are interested. One of the great things about learning online is that it is low commitment buying one certificate is not the same as taking a degree you can change your mind and start again pretty easily. If you aren\u2019t sure about the certificate start with the free option then upgrade if you love the course or want some more feedback. Good luck with whichever route you choose! ",

            "answer_text": "The worth of a course, or set of courses, is subjective. You must see some value in order to deem a course worth your time. Some, not all, examples of value include: The information in the course is important to you in your employment.The information in the course is important to your employer.The information is of interest to you.The course provides a certificate or credit that can be used to demonstrate completion or competence in the topic.My example: I am currently enrolled in a EdX philosophy course. I did well in philosophy when I was a college student. I\u2019m now nearly 69, retired and have no need for examples 1, 2 or 4 above. I AM interested in keeping my mind sharp and doing something that I enjoyed earlier in my life. So the course meets example 3 above. Since I\u2019m retired I have plenty of free time, so the course provides an activity with information that I value. Since I don\u2019t need to prove anything to an employer, having a certificate or college credit does not hold any value for me, so I do the free versions. What might be a better way to form this question is to ask: Are EdX courses valid for the value you are interested in? As an educator my opinion is that the courses are well done, provide useful information and can provide value. ",
