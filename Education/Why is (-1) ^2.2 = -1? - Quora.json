            "answer_text": "Very interesting question.For a start, exponential functions satisfy r^(x+y)=r^x*r^y and thus since (-1)^2 is 1 (-1)^2.2=(-1)^0.2. The answer depends on whether you are working in Real Or Complex Analysis. In Real Analysis, the equation x^5=-1 only has one solution -1 and thus (-1)^0.2=-1. Note, that e^x is defined by the analytic continuation of the Taylor series sum n=0 to n=infinity x^n/n! from real x to complex x and that this along with the analytical continuations of the Taylor Series of cos(x),terms of Taylor Series of e^x with even n and oscillating positive and minus signs, and sin(x),,terms of Taylor Series of e^x with odd n and oscillating positive and minus signs, can be used to show that e^(ix)=cos(x)+isin(x) and this implies that -1=e^(ipi) and 1=e^(2nipi). However, in complex analysis x^5=-1 has five solutions because -1=e^(ipi) and 1=e^(2nipi) for some integer value of n and thus x^5=e^(ipi(2n+1)) which gives x=e^(ipi(2n+1)/5) with the solutions for x=e^(ipi/5),e^(3ipi/5),-1,e^(7ipi/5),e^(9ipi/5). The question is what should (-1)^0.2 be? You want (-1)^x to be a function for it to be much more useful. Although, I guess it depends on what you are using it for because inverses,(-1)^0.2 is the inverse function of x^5 evaluated at x=-1, can also be considered as preimages mapping sets from from the image to the domain of the function and the function being injective(having a unique inverse) is not always important. If you want to define a function that will work well for (-1)^x then this would be defined as exp(xln(-1)) but ln(-1)=ipi+2nipi=ipi(2n+1) for some integer value of n which you can choose and this means (-1)^x=exp(ipi(2n+1)x). Therefore, if you choose n=2 then (-1)^0.2=exp(5ipi/5)=exp(ipi)=-1 and that also means (-1)^(2.2)=-1. However, it also follows in Real Analysis that (-1)^(1/3)=-1 for the same reasons as (-1)^0.2=-1 and with the value of n=2 then (-1)^(1/3)=exp(5ipi/3) which is not -1. Thus, it becomes clear that we can\u2019t retrieve the definition of (-1)^x from Real Analysis in Complex Analysis if we define (-1)^x as exp(xln(-1). The reason we define (-1)^x as exp(xln(-1)) is so that we can achieve the same properties for the (-1)^x function as the exponential function like r^(x+y)=r^x*r^y which I mentioned at the start and also for consistency because it doesn\u2019t really make much sense for (-1)^x and e^x to be defined in very different ways considering you\u2019ve just replaced e by -1. Therefore, the definition of (-1)^x in Complex Analysis is considered much more fundamental to Mathematics than how it is defined in Real Analysis The standard convention is to choose n=0 and this can be justified with the argument that ln(1)=2nipi and 2npi is the argument(or the angle) between the complex number and the positive real axis and for this to be consistent with the logarithm of Real Analysis where ln(1)=0 and so that you can start a rotation on the unit circle from theta=0 which makes sense if you interpret that as the angle turned through and only 1 can have an argument of 0. Then, from that if rotating to -1 is considered as turning through an angle of pi rather than -pi then the argument will be pi so that ln(-1)=ipi which is equivalent to choosing n=0. Consequently, (-1)^0.2=exp(ipi/5)=cos(pi/5)+isin(pi/5). Then, since e^(ix)=cos(x)+isin(x) this means that for real x sin(5x)=Imaginary part of ((e^(ix))^5) because e^(5ix)=(e^(ix))^5 because (r^x)^a=r^(ax) when a is an integer. The expansion of (cos(x)+isin(x))^5=(cos(x))^5+5icos(x)^4sin(x)-10cos(x)^3sin^2(x)-10i(cos(x))^2sin^3(x)+5cos(x)sin^4(x)+isin^5(x) and this leads to sin(5x)=5cos(x)^4sin(x)-10(cos(x))^2sin^3(x)+sin^5(x). Using the identity cos^2(x)+sin^2(x)=1, which can be proven using Pythagoras or even more rigorously the Taylor Series as its valid for all complex x: you get sin(5x)=5(1-sin^2(x))^2sin(x)-10(1 -sin^2(x))sin^3(x)+sin^5(x) =5sin(x)-10sin^3(x)+5sin^5(x)-10sin^3(x)+10sin^5(x)+sin^5(x) and thus you get sin(5x)=16sin^5(x)-20sin^3(x)+5sin(x)=sin(x)(16sin(x)^4\u201320sin^2(x)+5)=16sin(x)((sin(x)^2\u20135/8)-5/64) and sin(5x)=0 has solutions x=0,x=pi/5,x=2pi/5,x=-pi/5,x=-2pi/5 because sin(mpi)=0 where m is an integer as well as these values of x +2npi for any integer value of n but this only gives 5 values of sin(x) which are sin(0)=0,sin(pi/5),sin(2pi/5),sin(-pi/5)=-sin(pi/5) and sin(-2pi/5)=-sin(2pi/5). The 4 solutions for sin(x) sin(pi/5),sin(2pi/5),-sin(pi/5) and -sin(2pi/5) must be solutions of (sin(x)^2\u20135/8)^2\u20135/64=0 which implies sin^2(x)-5/8=+-sqrt(5)/8 and thus sin(x)=+-sqrt((5+-sqrt(5))/8) and since sin(pi/5) is positive and smaller than sin(2pi/5) because sin(0)=0 and sin(x) is monotone increasing for x in the range [0,pi/2] then the sin(pi/5)=sqrt((5-sqrt(5))/8))=sqrt(5-sqrt(5))/sqrt(8). Using cos(x)=sqrt(1-sin^2(x)) noting that cos(x) is positive in the range [0,pi/2] then cos(pi/5)=sqrt(1\u20135/8+sqrt(5)/8)=sqrt(3+sqrt(5))/sqrt(8). Finally, this means that (-1)^0.2=(sqrt(3+sqrt(5))+isqrt(5-sqrt(5))/sqrt(8) and thus (-1)^2.2=(sqrt(3+sqrt(5))+isqrt(5-sqrt(5))/sqrt(8) which is approximately  Note that Wolfram Alpha agrees with this result [1] Footnotes[1] Wolfram|Alpha: Making the world\u2019s knowledge computable",

            "answer_text": "Why is (-1)^2.2 = -1? Quite a challenging and interesting problem! I used a couple of pages of notepaper before I realised that there was an obvious approach I hadn't tried. And in so doing, I formed a view that I was possibly either misreading the question or in fact the question was itself incomplete. In my haste to answer the question, I made an assumption that the solution (on the right hand side of the equals sign) was not so much A solution, but the ONLY solution! With a little bit of thought it quickly became.obvious to me that it's probably the only REAL solution. In effect I had ignored the potential for COMPLEX solutions. In hindsight, an oversight I shouldn't have made! My mistake! (-1)^2.2 Let's rewrite this as: (-1)^(11/5). Let's further rewrite this as: [(-1)^11]*[(-1)^(1/5)] In the interests of clarity, (while recognising that I may be labouring a point), let's rewrite it even further as: {[(-1)^2][(-1)^2][(-1)^2][(-1)^2][(-1)^2](-1)}[(-1)^(1/5)] Recognising that (-1)^2 = 1, we can simplify this significantly to: Why does [(-1)^(1/5)] = -1 Even more clearly we now have: [(-1)^11]`(1/5) which from above equals [(-1)]^(1/5) The next question is to resolve [(-1)^1/5)] or in English, what are the 5 roots of (-1)? Clearly one root is (-1) as (-1) multiplied by itself 5 times = (-1). It is a REAL ROOT We have thereby proved that: [(-1)^2.2] = -1 or perhaps we have proved instead that the (REAL NUMBER) SOLUTION OF [(-1)^2.2] = -1 Clearly there are some Complex Number solutions as well (which we were not asked to find).
