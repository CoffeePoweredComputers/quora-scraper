            "answer_text": "I teach science to 8th graders. Some have excellent grades, some average, some below. We do a variety of assignments, including several projects that involve STEM-type design and building. Students build rockets, egg drop devices, race tracks, paper origami structures, etc. Often, students who struggle in one area of assessment (ex. written exams) will excel in other areas (project-based learning). They just might have a brain better suited to spacial problems, or problem solving, or just plain creativity.  Moral is, having \u201caverage\u201d grades does not necessarily preclude you from excelling at a profession. You may not have the grades to get into a top engineering school, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re completely cut off from a good STEM career. Not exactly science related, but my brother in law finished high school with average grades and dropped out of college (went back and finished eventually). He started working for a little start-up in OC CA stocking shelves in a little warehouse. The little company was called Paul Frank. He worked his way up and ended up a VP. Then he got an offer to work at another small clothing company just starting up, called RVCA. That went huge. He then ended up helping the son of the \u201cCabbage Patch Kids\u201d inventor start his company, making animal-themed kids helmets called Raskullz. They hit it big and got product placed in Target and Walmart stores. By every measure he\u2019s had a successful career, but his intelligence was never the kind that standardized tests measured well. Best of luck to you! ",

(http://Https://www.quora.com/Can-I-still-be-successful-if-I-had-average-grades/answer/Justina-Chua-2) was just excellent, I would only like to add that it is you who determines what does it mean to be succeful or not. It's your life, you're the one living it, and you're the only one to set expectations over it. There are a lot of fields in which your grades will not have any real matter for your success or not. Of course there are some in which you could be benefited for having good grades, but in most of the cases you can overcome it. What you need to do is to find out what your goals are, what is really important to you, and if the grades are really that important for those goals, maybe you should work really hard to get better in it, but if your goals require other abilities besides having good grades, that's what you should put your effort in.

Your detail in the question suggests you are interested in a STEM major. If so, you need to catch up. There are many millions of engineers in the world, and companies offer the best positions to applicants who have gone to good schools and earned good grades, because that is the primary evidence of success that will decide who gets hired. Finding projects and competitions is vital to establishing your name where it will be seen by companies. Seriously, you think college graduates want to be limited to Starbucks or Taco Bell? ",

I went back in my thirties, took seven years to graduate and finished with a high C average. At no point did I do any sort of significant extra curricular activities before going back to school of the types you mention. I did work in the service industry, though. And was good enough at that to be various kinds of management. I am currently, by most definitions of successful, successful. I make enough money to be in the 20%. I am married. I have one daughter with a master's degree and another that is about half way through her bachelor's. I also helped my wife get her nursing degree. So yes, average students can be successful. ",
