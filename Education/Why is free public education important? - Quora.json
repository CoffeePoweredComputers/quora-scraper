            "answer_text": "Free public education is one of the necessary foundations of a society and culture that sees justice and equality as its values and wants to implement democratic participation and human rights. Education is how our society develops us as human beings, as a gregarious learning animal. We defined by many anthropologists, historians, philosophers\u2026 as the creative animal, or the maker. I think, like the great co-operator and industrialist cotton manufacturer, Robert Owen, that we also create ourselves, and that our schooling system should help us to do this, using empathy, knowledge, reason, and active inquiry as members of a learning community that works together. The problem is we lose this aim of schools and reduce them to exams, measurable outcomes, comparisons between children, a definition of the normal child according to these results, and a national curriculum based on the exam systems we have inherited from the past\u2026 on top of using competition as motivation, and results as a motivating factor, with a sense that we are creating ourselves into marketable commodities for jobs or further education. This concept of schooling, instead of building the foundations of rights, democracy, equality, dignity based on our shared humanity, and humans as creators\u2026 produces people as consumers, as labelled as failures, as commodities, as believing schooling is only relevant to them if it is useful, as believing in this system of schooling and therefore denying children\u2019s rights, and seeing cultural and knowledge producers as a highly educated elite. As a result we spend millions on therapeutic drugs and CBT, and on schemes to promote equality and justice that tend to fail\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Horace Mann, an American leader in the education reform movement of the 1800s called education the great equalizer. School being free allows everyone to attend. It allows the poorest children an opportunity to better their situation as adults. For an economy to grow, it must have citizens with the necessary education to fill the jobs of today and the ones that will come up in the future. Companies move to places that can provide the educated workforce they need. They also leave places that cannot provide the needed workers. This is one reason why many states list in their constitutions the requirement of providing a free and appropriate public education. ",
