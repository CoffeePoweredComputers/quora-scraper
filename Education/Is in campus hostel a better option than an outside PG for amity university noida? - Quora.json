            "answer_text": "If you can afford then you should definitely stay some time in private PGs outside the college as they have less/no restrictions and great living experience. One such housing facility that i know of is Students Inn. There are a number of hostels, PGs and accomodation facilities near Amity University and the best reviews I've heard from my friends are about Students Inn housing properties. They have a lot of facilities for recreation like gym, sports, gaming zone with full security and 4 times meals. They have house keeping, laundry and ironing facilities. Also, each room had it's personal TV with Netflix and Tata sky and unlimited WiFi. I personally stayed there too for 2 months even though i lived very close to the college and the experience was amazing. I'd highly recommend Students Inn to anyone looking for luxury accommodation.
