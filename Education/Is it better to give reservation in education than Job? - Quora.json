            "answer_text": "Reservation in job or education, should be given to the poorest of the poor and the underprivileged, in order too lift them from the bottom level of life. Nation have responsibility to take care of every citizen. First priority should be for the people who suffer the most. A nation should not try to justify any other form of governance. Democracy will live only on majority view, that is not good for the nation as whole. A nation can develop democratically, only if its people are educated and matured. Democratically or otherwise, attend to the problem of the people at the lowest level. Giving reservation to a small section of the people, will not take away the responsibility of the nation. Find some way and means to involve the lowest section of the society. Percentage or otherwise, is only a political tool of appeasement. a country cannot grow with an unrealistic mechanism. ",

            "answer_text": "Reservations are Affirmative Action Against Social Discrimination. Discrimination in jobs Take for example the private sector jobs in India. In a study conducted by sending fake resumes that differ by caste surnames to open postings in Indian private sector, it was shown that when they were equally qualified Dalit resumes were rejected 33% of times.  Source: http://www.dalitstudies.org.in/download/wp/0901.pdf All the education in the world will not help if the power-to-discriminate remains in the hands of the privileged castes of India. Till 22.5% of business are run by Dalits, workforces are Dalit, interview panels are Dalit - we will have discrimination. So no, educated Dalits don\u2019t get jobs for their qualifications. This is exactly why we need affirmative action. To overcome this in the context of gender discrimination, Germany has introduced reservations for women. Read more: Germany agrees law on quotas for women on company boards - BBC News Discrimination in schools This is not going to stop even with reservation in schools - because the discrimination is there even in schools resulting in high school dropout rates there.  You can see related findings in the video and research papers.  Source: India: Marginalized Children Denied Education  Figure: Dalit children forced to wash toilets in schools. Arunthathiyar children cleaning toiletsTeachers held for forcing Dalit students to clean toilets, The demon called untouchabilityDalit girls clean school toilets in absence of sweepers in JaipurWhile providing schooling is a important welcome step, there are issues This does not happen because India was ruled by privileged caste PMs for 80+% of time and 75% of top bureaucrats come from the privileged caste. The \u2018power to discriminate\u2019 is in the hands of the privileged castes. They reduce funding to public schools that backward castes depend on, while encourage private schools they can afford to get admitted to. (Read more : New IIT, IIMs but education sees 17% cut), Increase in IIT fees caused a huge social media outcry, whereas when the education budget for schools are cut - no one bothers to create and outrage. Needless to say the ministry is headed by highest of the privileged castes.Even if new schools are opened, they will be located in the privileged castes localities - where Dalits were traditionally not allowed to enter. Resulting in many kids (especially girls) dropping out owing to intimidation. This is because the power to discriminate is the government bureaucracy which is dominated by privileged castes and will redirect resources.Even if we get them into schools with mid-day-meal and other programs, the teachers in these schools are from the privileged castes about 60\u201370% of them are known to discriminate in classrooms. One needs to understand the root of the problem. Caste discrimination causes segregation. Segregation causes illiteracy. Illiteracy causes ignorance (a feedback loop here - ignorance furthers illiteracy) Ignorance causes (lack of jobs) poverty. The root cause of the problem is that of social discrimination. That is why \u2018affirmative action\u2019 is the solution - not access to education. If you understand the reason why even in western societies, there are so less women CxOs. It is not because of lack of access to education - infact many women excel academically than men. It is because of discrimination, the lack of diversity in top. Thanks to Dr. Ambedkar we figured this out our problem and took the necessary steps to attack the root cause by providing reservations where ever there was discrimination like education, jobs and lately promotions. We should extend it to private sector and increase it to proportional representation. This is will increase the diversity and reduce the power to discriminate in the hands of the privileged castes. This is what affirmative action does. This is what happened in the state of Tamilnadu - the state has approximately 69% reservations and the state is one of the top state economically, socially, health and various other parameters. So it better to give reservation in education and jobs - private and public sector proportional to the population. ",
