            "answer_text": "Haha\u2026.I was your age when I wanted to do online learning. I still attend an online school three years later. My mom was so against online learning when I first brought it up. I made a really nice poster board and my mom wouldn\u2019t even take the time to look at it because she was so against the thought of online school. In the end, I ended up protesting and refusing to go to school (I don\u2019t recommend doing that.) That got her to sit down and listen. Try not to take it that far. Now, my mom loves it and is so happy that I attend an online school! IF I WERE U, I would sit and really think about it and make sure you are all in. Come up with a few good reasons on why it would be a good option for you. Present those when/why/where reasons to her. Over my years of trying get stuff from my parents, I have realized that you should give your parents time to think about it and make a final decision. I don\u2019t have the patience and always want an answer right away, but you should try. Gently bring it up to her every now and then. When does your current semester end at your current school? If it ends the last week of January like a lot of school in America, than this is the perfect time. Tell her how switching during the semester will hurt you academically and how if you switch school now, you will be able to start on time. IF your family has money or your family\u2019s income is low enough to get financial aid, I would tell your mom about online schools, such as Stanford\u2019s online high school. You get to learn from Stanford Professors in high school, what mom wouldn\u2019t want that? Please make sure this is truly what you want. Some things that I will miss out on and you will too are prom, high school sport teams, clubs, graduation, and senior year activities. Academically, you will feel alone! U won\u2019t know if someone else didn\u2019t do good on a quiz or if your classmates found something hard. You will feel alone! ***Online schools offer some of those activities, but barely anyone attends them. The people that do attend are the socially awkward type of people and the ones that got bullied in regular school. You will lose social skills after awhile of not attending a brick and mortar school. Sorry my grammar is awful, I am on my half broken iPhone. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, you start by doing a whole lot of research \u2026 and far beyond a Google search and a Wikihints page. You want to do some serious research into the advantages and disadvantages of self-directed learning, and the same for public education. You\u2019ll need to learn about, and compare, instructional methods and outcomes, quality of instruction, assisted learning methods, and curricula. Then you\u2019ll want some background information on the relative merits of social intelligence compared to straight \u201ctick-box\u201d learning programmes. You\u2019ll want some grounding in educational theories that indicate what type of personality attributes are best equipped for self-learning. You should also do some background reading on the quality of online resources, and how to discern the relative validity of those sources. Then you can prepare a good case for your mother, who can use that to prepare a good case for the school system to equip her to be a proctor for your self-directed learning. You may have to find a way to help resource or pay for the number of hours she will now have to dedicate, since you won\u2019t be using paid instructional staff. Does this sound like too much work? Then you\u2019ve convincingly proved that you\u2019re not cut out for self-directed learning. Grab your knapsack and head back to school. ",
