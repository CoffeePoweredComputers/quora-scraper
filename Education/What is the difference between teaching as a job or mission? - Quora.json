            "answer_text": "Teaching as a mission exists under the gloss of procedure everywhere. If you loose that sense of mission then your career will be a short one as there is no real reason to stay. Many jobs, ordinary jobs are a better choice for anyone with a degree and some motivation. There are better things to do with your life if you don\u2019t feel that teaching is important to the world, that thought changes everything. If teaching is not of central importance to you and the world you wish to live in, please do not go in to teaching. Do your MBA and stay away from children you\u2019ve no business addressing them, you have no place in a school building and by not teaching you are assisting both the profession and the world. Teaching is a very honorable profession, business people need not not apply. It\u2019s a poor business decision. ",
