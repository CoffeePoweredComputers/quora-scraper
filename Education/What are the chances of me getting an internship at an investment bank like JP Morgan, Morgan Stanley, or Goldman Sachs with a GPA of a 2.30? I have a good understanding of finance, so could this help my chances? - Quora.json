            "answer_text": "I took part a few times in screening the resumes of (lots of) undergraduates who wanted an internship to help decide who we should invite for an interview. One one occasion I noticed a resume that had some other details that sounded interesting, but the GPA was about 0.2 less than the threshold X. So I asked the HR person, how did this resume make it past the computer? I thought X was the GPA threshold. And our nice HR person explained that they know that certain schools give ridiculously low grades, so, for example, 3.1 from one school might be better than 3.9 from another school. My point is - if someone at the firm knows you and can refer you, and you have accomplishments on your resume that make your GPA irrelevant, then you have a chance. But if your resume gets screened by a computer program then it is very likely to reject you because your GPA is below some threshold. ",

            "answer_text": "This will depend on the part of the organization you are trying to join. Different divisions have different thresholds for what they will consider. Example: Investment Banking would be different from Finance would be different from Operations. They generally see low GPA as dumb or lazy so you\u2019d have a lot of explaining to do. When I interviewed for a full time position I got a lot of scrutiny because I got one C+. My GPA was above a 3.5 collectively. I ended up still getting hired, but it was a huge discussion point. You may have more flexibility in the interview, but getting that far would be the hard part in my opinion. ",
