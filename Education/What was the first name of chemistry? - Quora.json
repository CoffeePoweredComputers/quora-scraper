            "answer_text": "Etymology of chemistry - Wikipedia Do not ask questions which are easily found in wikipedia. In the history of science, the etymology of the word chemistry is debatable. It is agreed that the word derives from the word alchemy, which is a European one, derived from the Kimiya (\u06a9\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0627) Alchemy al-k\u012bmiy\u0101\u02be (\u0627\u0644\u0643\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0621). The Arabic term is derived from the Ancient Greek \u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 kh\u0113mia or \u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 kh\u0113meia. However, the ultimate origin of the root word, chem, is uncertain. ",
