            "answer_text": "Universities don\u2019t award associates degrees. An associate\u2019s degree is a two-year degree awarded by community colleges. I\u2019ve never heard of a four year school awarding associates degrees. Now, to answer your question, yes, if you have an associate\u2019s degree, you ARE a college graduate. If you are asked on a job application or during an interview, you can say that you are a college graduate because it is true; you are a college graduate, but you should go further and explain that you have an associate\u2019s from, for example, Bunker Hill Community College. Some people equate the term \u201ccollege graduate\u201d with people who have bachelors\u2019 degrees, so if you say you are a college graduate, they may assume you have a bachelor\u2019s degree, and if you don\u2019t disabuse them of this idea, then you could later be fired for lying by omission (by not telling them that your degree is an associate\u2019s degree).

            "answer_text": "The term \u201cCollege Graduate\u201d is kind of generic for graduating from college. If you graduate from a 2 year college, you are a college graduate, because you graduated from a college. I have noticed that the jobs that advertise required education, especially in the federal government, do not state the requirement as a \u201cCollege Graduate.\u201d The requirement is stated as something like, \u201cA course of study, leading to a 4 year college degree\u201d or words to that effect. If it is a job that requires a 2 year degree, \u201c2\u201d would be substituted for \u201c4.\u201d That eliminates the ambiguity of just stating that a college degree is required. By the way, furthering your education is commendable, whether it be an associate\u2019s degree, bachelor\u2019s degree, master\u2019s degree or PhD. ",
