            "answer_text": "Cannot actually say. If you are focussing on Boards for now, if it is.. CBSE Board, please focus more on Inorganic and Organic Sections. They are totally from textbook. Especially, the Biomolecules, polymers and chemistry in everyday life part. 1 question from each chapter, and easy 12 marks.  While doing crash course, focus more on important topics. To know what are the important topics in Physics, please read this: Lohit Marodia's answer to Which topics can fetch atleast 30-40 marks in Physics out of 120 in Jee Mains 2016?  For Maths, do read, Statistics, Mathematical Reasoning and Sets. Again, three very simple chapters and again 12 easy marks. Just learn formulaes for statistics. For Chemistry, focus more on inorganic and organic. I think, Physical Chemistry crash course won't help much for heavy topics. You can always read light topics such as Solutions, Solid State, Chemical Kinetics. They are easier than Ionic Equillibrium/Thermodyamics/Gaseous State. Strongly Recommended: SOLVE THE PREVIOUS IIT-JEE and AIEEE Questions. Arihant publishes a book for the same, for each subject. Please solve it. Similar questions(Ditto also) are asked in JEE Mains, and no doubt will be asked in upcoming Mains. Thanks for A2A. ",

If no, then it may be useful depending on whether your concepts are clear or not. Should you require any help, please feel free to contact me. All the Best !!! ",
