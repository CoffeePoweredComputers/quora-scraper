            "answer_text": "I am from the same region Malala belongs to, I and Malala have few teachers in common, my Mathematics\u2019 teacher (who is also my neighbor) was her teacher in school. Is she overrated?  Picture Source Well, let me put some light on the ground reality: At the time she started speaking against Taliban, they were in full control of Swat region. I\u2019ve seen it myself, Taliban controlling traffic on the roads and moving around in vehicles captured from police. All politicians and police forces of the regions had surrendered to the Taliban, those who spoke against them were either killed through suicide attacks, or grenades were thrown at their houses. One politician from the Awami National Party, six members from his family were killed on the same day. Imagine how difficult it would be for a 13 year old girl living in a very oppressed society to speak against those bloodthirsty people? My friend, Farman Nawaz (Editor in Border Pakistan) has put it very beautifully in his essay - Noble Prize Winner\u2019s Fate in Pakistan: Malala is the girl who stood alone against the people against whom today Pakistani army has started military operation which is appreciated by all the sections of Pakistan and the main political parties. What Malala has done single handedly is even today impossible for those leaders behind whom support of millions of people is present. Now, the question is why did she speak, if the powerful men in the society were acting like scared rats? She thought her childhood and being a girl (which the Muslims claim to not touch during a war) will save her from the atrocities of Taliban. Her only concern was her father. Because, he was a grown up man and would receive open threats on the radio from the Taliban\u2019s leaders. Those days Taliban would behead the captured police and army personnels in open places and hang their bodies in the bazaars. It was like a rule of jungle, there was no one to question the atrocities of those monsters. In a situation like this, if a 13 years old girl speaks in the media against them, what do you think of her ? I think that girl deserves every medal of bravery and courage. I think that girl deserves the highest award that exists in the world. I think that girl deserves the highest fame, which no one has ever got. Two years later, she was shot on the head. She narrowly escaped death. And was flown from Swat on military\u2019s helicopter. Her enemies are now 1000X more than before she was shot, she can\u2019t even come to her hometown/country because of the nationwide hatred against her. How absolutely pathetic? That\u2019s the glimpse of her struggles in Swat, which I\u2019m a witness of\u2026 Now, you tell me: Is she overrated? UPDATE: As most of you are asking about the area situation now: In a few months after the insurgency started, Pakistan\u2019s army launched an Operation Rah-e-Rast and crushed them all in a month, few were successful in fleeing the region, most of them were either killed or captured. Army would have done this earlier, but due to some political reasons action was delayed. When things got out of control, Army packed up to the valley and fucked them all. Especially, SSG Commandos of Pakistan\u2019s Army played a vital role in this operation.

            "answer_text": "Of the 3 girls shot, Malala was the only one airlifted on a private plane for cutting edge treatment in Birmingham while the other two girls, Shazia Ramzan who was shot twice in the arm and Kainat Riaz who was shot in the hand both still continue their education in same school and didn't have any chance to get the same level of treatment as Malala got. Malala has been residing in UK since her treatment, she never publicly acknowledged her home city \"SWAT Valley\" and neither speaks of the army doctors who saved her life. The questions which raise doubt about Malala : How can you get a nobel peace prize for promoting girls education in a country you no longer live in?How do the celebrities only support the cause of Malala ? She has been meeting up and getting support from celebrities like Madonna, Justin Biber, Jon Strwet, Irana Shyk etc. She even gets chance to meet Obama, Justin Trudeau, Hillary Clinton etcShe never speaks for the children in Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and neither gives them any support. Thousands of children have been killed in the recent war against ISIS and Israel led war in Gaza.She never speaks against the drone war in Pakistani tribal region, there are reports that over 160 children have been killed since the start of the drone attacks.Abdul Sattar Edhi contributed to the Pakistani society throughout his life. He along with his wife established free hospitals and free schools but did not get any Nobel Price or ever was nominated for it.This one is bit hard to say but how can\u2019t we see any gun shot injury ? Also her recovery was so fast it casts doubt about the whole story of Taliban shooting her.Thousands of other women in Pakistan are doing even greater work for humanity and even dying for their causes, so why Malala?There seems to be greater conspiracy in Malala story or it might be that the West is obsessed with Malala as she stood up against Taliban. What about thousands or millions of children who died in recent US led wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Vietnam \u2026. don\u2019t they deserve the same prestige ? ",
