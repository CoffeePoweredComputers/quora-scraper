            "answer_text": "This question is a little unclear to me, but I hope the answer's in here (if not, I'll edit accordingly). When you calculate the variance of a sample, ie you do 1/n*SUM((x_i-samplemean)^2), you can use this as an estimate for the variance of a population. However, you'll find that this estimate is biased to be a bit too small. This makes sense, as in a sample, you're not as likely to get the far extreme values (that's how I understand it, anyway).Through some expectation calculations, you find that multiplying that previous estimate by n/(n-1) corrects for this bias, and in doing so, this reduces to the more commonly used estimator for population variance, 1/(n-1)*SUM((x_i-samplemean)^2) ",
