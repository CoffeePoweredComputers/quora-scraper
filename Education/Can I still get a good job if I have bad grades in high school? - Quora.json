            "answer_text": "It really depends what you mean by \u201cgood job\u201d. Will you ge able to find work\u2026.yes. Will you be able to earn enough to live on\u2026..yes. Will you get raises and progress in the company that employs you\u2026.maybe. Will you reach a salary ceiling at a relatively low level\u2026.probably. Will you advance in the company and work you way up into a better and higher paying job\u2026.probably not, or if you do, it will take many, many years. The skills learned in HS are so fundamental that they apply to virtually every job, everywhere. Simple math, simply grammar, vocabulary, syntax, a basic understanding of science and society. These are not just academic subjects, they are the basis of survival in a modern society - much as hunting and tracking skills were essential to our caveman origins. There will always be a need for manual labor and unskilled workers and you will always be able to get a job as a dishwasher or a gardener or a ditch digger but you will also forever be stuck in the economic category of the poor or the lower middle class with a peak lifetime cap on your annual salary of perhaps $30,000 or $40,000 after many years of experience. That\u2019s about $25/hr in wages. For a long time you will work at minimum wage and it will grow very slowly over the years. If that is what you want and you are satisfied with it, then you got no worries. If you want more out of life, you\u2019ll have to find the motivation and the effort needed to learn the basics - and get your GED. If you want a life of comfort and plenty, you\u2019ll need to find the spark and internal mental inspiration that will drive you to learn the basics and then go on to learn the more technical or detailed skills (from a college or technical school) that will give you a shot at the better jobs at higher pay. There is one alternative that I can offer and even recommend. Go into the military. They will educate you, give you a good job and if you are not a total screw up, you will advance in rank and pay. It also offers one of the best retirement plans that there is after a shorter working career than most other jobs. Someone that joins at 18 or 19 can actually retire with a livable income at an age of under 40. You then get out with 20+ yrs of experience, a lifetime income and are young enough to start a whole new career doing something similar or completely different. I got drafted during Viet Nam and it totally sucked for the first 2 years but then I began to advance in rank and stopped doing the sh*t jobs and it got a lot better. They even sent my back to college, paid for everything and made me an officer. I retired at 45 yrs old as a full Commander (O-5) and three college degrees, and now have a nice pension + free medical for life. I started a second career as a consultant and did another 20 yrs at that - ending up with a very comfortable retirement in which I have everything I want - 3 cars, 3 houses and a farm, a boat, an RV and an airplane (ultralight) and I sent (and paid for) my kids to go to college. It\u2019s worth considering. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re worried about failing high school, but if it\u2019s due to your temperament or circumstances, maybe you should look into alternative routes. (If it\u2019s because you\u2019re lazy and/or stupid, I can\u2019t help you.) Maybe you should first ask yourself whether a high school education, or a university education, will really help you get a good job in the future. The basic premise is that school prepares you for the future. You learn the basic skills you will need, and also how to play the game - you show up on time, do as you are told, get along with the people around you, complete the work assigned and produce the \u201coutput\u201d required. Eventually they give you a certificate saying that you\u2019re fit to be hired and you spend the next forty years playing the game, except that this time you have to do useful work and the output required is some product or service that pleases your customers. They give your organisation some money because they\u2019re happy with what you created, and this enables the organisation to continue existing and pay you a salary. Interestingly, fifty years ago the Fortune 500 list of companies was more or less static. It didn\u2019t change much. These days, companies disappear all the time. They either fail or get taken over, and in both cases this means people get fired. The rate of change on the Fortune 500 is accelerating too. Within organisations, automation is bringing into question the whole concept of useful work. For example, this article makes a pretty convincing case for the end of a lot of the so-called \u201cknowledge jobs\u201d that school is supposed to equip you for. Manufacturing is already no place to spend your future, driving jobs are on the way out. Everything from doctoring to lawyering and teaching is also facing enormous changes in the coming decade or two. Assuming that you manage to find some useful work to do that isn\u2019t being automated, you already know about outsourcing, right? Instead of keeping someone on salary, even during the non-busy times, you just pay them when they work. There is no security or stability, whatever kind of work you do. To get these jobs - or \u201cgigs\u201d - you need to compete with pretty much everyone in the world. I am a teacher, and I am in competition with low-cost labour from eg the Philippines, as well as retired professionals in top US cities. They have paid off their mortgages, but now they find their pensions have been slashed due to the financial crisis a few years ago and they need some extra income. They\u2019re highly qualified, but working for peanuts because that\u2019s what the market will pay. And it\u2019s worth noting that a great deal of time and bandwidth is being devoted to the question of \u201chow do I manage young people\u201d by the people who run businesses today. There is a common perception that the next generation is basically useless, can\u2019t contribute, etc. I\u2019m not saying that this is a fair assessment, just that there is obviously some gap in understanding between the generation doing he hiring and the generation wanting to be hired. To prepare you for this world, someone with a relatively secure income and limited understanding of life in the real world has to create a syllabus. And they have to envision the skills and knowledge you will need ten years in the future. Think about that. Ten years ago, the world was on the brink of an unprecedented financial crisis that nobody knew was coming. Nobody was seriously considering the possibility that the next president of the USA would be a black man. The mobile phone industry was dominated by a company called Nokia, and experts were united in laughing at rumours that Apple was going to enter the market. Facebook was a startup, just for students at certain colleges, and 3d printing was unheard of. Russia\u2019s military was no threat to anyone, and Al-Qaeda was on the ropes. How much do you think your teachers know about the future? What can they predict? What can they teach you that will be of use ten years from now? Nobody uses a pen any more. Who will type when speech-to-text can do the job perfectly? Why exactly will you need mathematics? Does anyone use that stuff today? I\u2019m an old-school true believer in the intrinsic value of basic skills like reading, writing, critical thinking and numeracy. But even if they are useful in the future, is school the only place to obtain them? Can you do better for yourself elsewhere? Most jobs, most work, are not advertised. Positions are filled as the result of recommendations. It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know. If you have a portfolio of work done, satisfied customers telling their friends about you, then you will get more work. Nobody actually cares about your certificates, if you can get the job done. The certifications exist as a proxy, they state that you\u2019re competent if you don\u2019t have any history to prove it. Once you have the history, the paperwork fades into the background. Obviously you need to pick a direction, and then you need to start accumulating not only the skills and knowledge you need, but also the connections. THE MOST important skill is networking. You need to make friends with people who can help you, and start building a reputation. You can start just by doing work on taskrabbit, upwork, italki, or any other online platform that suits you and keeps a record of your work and customer feedback. If you\u2019re interested in software, get on github and start building. Learn to do the work, build your reputation, and all you have to do then is compete with everyone else in the world. A certificate might give you a small advantage, but it might also be a distraction from the real business of your life. Hope this helps. Unfortunately, nobody really has the answer to this. You might try looking up Seth Godin\u2019s blog and signing up to his newsletter. He has a lot to say about school! ",

            "answer_text": "If you learn a trade or profession, and excell at it, your school grades will mean nothing. I got average grades, but had some good-paying jobs. In 1970, I was making over $14/hr starting pay. In 1976, I worked about 6 or less hour days, at $100/day, which wasn't bad. I've made up to $150/hr working on high-current power supplies, because I am good at it, but am now retired. I've seen instances I could have made over $1000/hr, while undercutting someone else's price, but that repair wasn't needed. It was a few cheap parts, instead, and I wouldn't cheat my customer. He wouldn't have known, if I had, but he appreciated me saving him almost $36,000, plus a week or more down-time, plus lost production. All this is with a high school diploma. I had a semester of college, just to take a course I wanted. I should have just bought the book, and skipped the course. Whatever you do, be the best, at least in your local area. ",

Of the many things we learn in high school, one of them is to persist in tacking difficult and boring tasks and subjects, and dealing with them successfully. It's one of the qualities that employers look for in employees, because most work is routine, not exciting, and needs persistence because it's important to the company. If you're still in high school, it's not too late to turn things around.  If you've graduated, head for a communuty college and make a record for yourself, so you can either land a job from there, or go on to a four year college and get a degree, setting you on the course for a career.

It frustrated me because I saw such potential. One of those students lost his life at 20 in a drunk driving accident. If you are sabotaging your own future, it might be time to regroup and think about what's important to you.
