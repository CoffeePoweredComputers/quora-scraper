            "answer_text": "Catholicism has its roots in the historical Jesus and the Bible, although some of its branches are not based on these. Ancient Israel and Christianity. The Bible constantly stresses the importance of followers of God to be the light of the world to those that surround them. This means not to become defiled by the wicked practices of the world but rather to lead them to God, and to God\u2019s Law and holiness, in love, by example. Christianity. The New Testament section of the Bible emphasizes this even more but makes it clear that this is primarily a spiritual battle not a physical one. Jesus\u2019s teachings demonstrated the importance of loving your neighbor, even praying for your enemies. It also makes it clear that despite all of the good Christians can and will do ultimately the world will still become so corrupt that Christians will suffer for following Jesus in opposition to the sinful standards and desires of the world. A new world order will eventually happen, the antichrist will rise, the majority of the world will follow him, and the world will be led into a period of serious tribulation. Catholicism, in many respects, has lost some of its focus on these essential teachings of the Bible. Since the fourth century onwards they have evolved and taken on many quasi or non-biblical views and stances of what it means to be the representatives of the Kingdom of God. They have become an official physical, earthly (and in the past military) and political institution. They have become less like a spiritual institution and more like an earthly one. As such, they have adapted with the times because of this. Like any other nation, business, organization or tribe, you need to adapt to survive and maintain relevancy. The problem with this. Your initial assumption was that Catholicism was doing it right. I\u2019m going to concede half of that and then with the other half tell you it is an error of the Roman Catholic Church. We are still in a spiritual battle not an earthly one. God\u2019s Kingdom is a spiritual one not a physical one. Surviving and adapting and blending \u201cin the world\u201d when we already know that the world is evil is not a good thing! Now onto Islam. Whereas Biblical Christianity is rooted in Jesus and the Bible, and Catholicism is rooted in these but with many of its later branches entangled with the world, Islam is rooted in the the person of Muhammad and the Quran. Unlike Christianity, Muhammad was told that it is not primary a spiritual battle with Satan but a physical battle in the world. The goal of Islam was to not blend into the world but to conquer it and force it into living under submission to Allah. Muhammad taught that the entire world would eventually be under the rule of the Islamic caliphate. There are a few people trying to change Islam from the inside but they\u2019ve got a serious uphill battle. Islam at its core, and based upon the last 9 years of Muhammad\u2019s life of military jihad, and most of its history since then, all point to it being unchangeable. At its core, Islam was not meant to be in submission to the ways of the world but to force the world to be in submission to the ways of Allah. Many of the ways one may wish for Islam to evolve, accept, and adapt to society are antithetical to its very foundation. It must oppose all of it in order to be obedient to the Quran and to follow in the ways of Muhammad. Putting this all together. According to Biblical Christianity \u201cthe world\u201d (norms of society) is going to get worse as we get closer to the end times and the great tribulation. The ways of the world will continue to become more ungodly. True Christians are to fight a spiritual battle and not be defiled by the world around us. There are parts of the church that will allow the world to change them as they give in to societal pressure. These parts will be swept up into the destruction. There are parts of the world that will persecute Christians who do not submit to their standards. We can already see this happening at a harsh level in Communist and Islamic countries, and in a political one in western countries. If Catholicism continues to evolve and adapt with the world it will be swept into its evil ways and many of its adherents will face God\u2019s Judgment. If Islam continues to press forward (and all signs point to that it will) then it will not only be a significant part of the chaos and destruction in the world it may actually be the very system that the antichrist comes out of and leads the tribulation. Eventually, there will be a clash between the systems of worldly ungodliness and the system of Islam which has an outer form of godliness but is not actually from God. Both will hate Christians (and Israel) and persecute them. If mainstream Islam ever adapts in the way that Catholicism has then it means that the end is getting close. The adaptation is only temporary though, a means to an end. It will accomplish the goal of uniting all \u201cof the world\u201d together. We see this already with the alliance of the political Left and the feminists with Islam. While these parties are diametrically opposed (with literally nothing in common) they have come together to stand against the conservative Christian voice. The only ones not included will be the conservative Christians who remain outside of, and undefined by, the rest of the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Three-part answer: Catholicism still has its challenges. To condemn all birth control (and not just abortion, which is more understandable) is to threaten the future quality of life for human beings, as we already have too many people on this planet.Many Islamic nations are advanced, moderate, and looking toward the future. For example, one of the fans of my books is a young woman grad student in Turkey, who studies nuclear physics.But radical, fundamentalist Islam, in my opinion, suffers from an incorrect perception. They look at history and view Islam as the superior civilization 1,000 years ago. I agree. But then they ask, how did we fall behind the West? And they conclude \u201cIt must be because we\u2019ve fallen away from the Pure Islam.\u201d Their reaction, then, is to want to return to the Islam of the 7th or 8th Century.In contrast, I know of no Catholic who wants to turn the clock back 1300 years. The values that Catholics embrace \u2014 and any Christian or Catholic will tell you this \u2014 are eternal and are not lost over time. There was a problem with Science, but now the Church accepts Galileo\u2019s view\u2026 that the Bible was not created as a science textbook and therefore does not need to be accurate as to, say, whether the sun moves around the Earth.
