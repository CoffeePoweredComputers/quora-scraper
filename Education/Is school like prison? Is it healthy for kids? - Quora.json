            "answer_text": "Honestly, yes schools are like prisons and no they aren\u2019t healthy for kids. Here\u2019s several reasons why schools are like prisons: No freedom - In school, you have lots of rules. Come to class. Don\u2019t be late. 5 minutes to socialize and handle your business between classes. No fighting. No having sex or making love. No this and no that. No talking when the teacher is talking in class. You have to stay in an area throughout the day. It drives you crazy doing the same routine day by day. Much like a prison. Did i forget to mention how similar it looks?  Crimes - In both schools and prisons, there\u2019s lots of people who break the rules. That\u2019s because they mix in the good students with the bad ones. It\u2019s common to see fights and people get jumped in school. Saw one girl get targeted and had a guy defend her. Some get hit with improvised weapons. Some people around the schools i went to were killed in gang-related incidents or beefs. Yes, there are gangsters in school. Some sell and do drugs or other stuff. I had one girl offer to give me a blowjob for a fake buck lol. I saw a group of kids smoking weed out in the open. If you don\u2019t buddy up, you\u2019re likely to be a target for bullies. Security guards and police are constantly patrolling the areas. Sounds like a prison doesn\u2019t it? Corruption - Many school officials are very unfair and cruel to the students. There\u2019s alot of racism and abuse in the system. Class expectations are high and if you don\u2019t meet them, you could get punished. Teachers can verbally humiliate and abuse students without consequence. If you get parents or higher ups to confront them, they\u2019ll just lie by saying they were trying to help you succeed. When people of color become the majority, the school\u2019s funds are cut whereas the whites live in rich schools. Whites are often encouraged to take AP classes compared to minorities. People of color are more likely to be punished for breaking rules and expelled than whites. Much like prisons.  Enslavement - Schools basically enslave you to standardized education. It\u2019s bad in the long run because you\u2019re not learning how to be a productive citizen. Most subjects are useless when it comes to finding employment, finances, cooking, relationships, etc.  We ought to do away with schools in favor of new forms of education. The current school system is enslaving people rather than freeing them. ",

            "answer_text": "My children attending high school tell me that school is like prison. There is a cop whose entire job is to patrol the high school.Once school is in session, the campus is on lockdown. No one can enter or leave without permission.If administration thinks a student is a drug user or seller, teachers can open his or her locker and rifle through it.There are mandatory, random drug tests.Students need permission to do use the toilet, to visit the nurse, to do anything outside the classroom. There are video cameras everywhere, including on school buses.It is not ideal. Nevertheless, there are plenty of kids (not my own children, of course!) who would break drug, alcohol, truancy, dress code, even gun laws at school -- if they knew they could get away with it. High school kids do all kinds of stupid shit. For instance, because kids on ADHD meds sometimes sell their pills to friends, it's now forbidden for high schoolers (in our district anyway) to have ANY medications on their person at school. It is not uncommon to have pregnant girls attending high school. Kids steal science equipment. Bullies use the school bus as a platform for terrorizing their peers. Young lovers have other agendas on the bus. (Ugh.) In short, a significant percentage of public high school kids cause and get into trouble. So having tough codes-of-conduct is practically necessary.    I grew up in different times, the good old days, when there were fewer rules. Nevertheless, in the 1970's, our school district had to install an iron fence around the campus -- to keep kids from randomly leaving. And despite having an \"open campus\" which allowed for off-campus lunch breaks, we still called the place \"a prison.\" Kids regularly stole bicycles from the bike rack.Kids smoked cigarettes in the bathrooms between classes.Kids smoked pot in cars and in the parking lot over the lunch hour. Kids frequently went to class stoned.Kids sold bags of pot and other commodities in the quad.Fairly regularly, certain kids would overdose at school and require an ambulance.The upshot is this: in general, many kids aged 14-18 are a hard-to-handle bunch of individuals. To prevent problems with the law and with parents, high school administrators n the U.S. must run highly secure and supervised environments. ",
