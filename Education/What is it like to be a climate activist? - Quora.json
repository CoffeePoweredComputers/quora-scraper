            "answer_text": "i am also a climate activist,but hardly anyone is listining.My assessment is climate change is a curse of God on a sinful humanity who refuses reform,and continues the path of misguidance and error.Climate change signals the end of the world as Humans cannot withstand Global warming which is increasing every year.Heat of the Sun is rising year after year making our life and climate on this planet unbearable and impossible to continue.Added to it,Rising sea levels,disappearence of many species of flora and fauna from planet earth,shrinking of magnetic field below the earth, frequent forest fires,strange virus and diseases which threaten to wipe humanity,etc etc are all open signs of approaching end.in these circumstances none can do anything except to cry to our lord God for help.

            "answer_text": "The day-to-day life of an activist is quite varied, which is one of the things I love about it. I\u2019d start the day with a media round-up \u2013 what are the issues of the day, and what we need to respond to. Then it could be into meetings with your team about campaign strategy, or collaborating with other organisations. There\u2019s usually quite a bit of policy and research work you need be across, which could take up the afternoon, along with meetings (lots of meetings) with stakeholders like government departments, lawyers and politicians. A lot of our work is about building power within the community so that decisions makers have to listen. This includes organising lots of activities. ",
