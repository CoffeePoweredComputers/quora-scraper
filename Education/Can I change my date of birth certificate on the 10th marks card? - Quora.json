            "answer_text": "Please allow me to disagree with previous answer. The DOB on 10th certificate is toughest to change subject to some exceptions. if you apply within 3 years of your passing out 10th exam for a change of DOB on the matriculation certificate, the court will entertain your plea and chances are high that court will issue appropriate directions to the Board to rectify the error. If, however, it is beyond 3 years, it is really hard to get the DOB change on the certificate. You can get an affidavit made, do Gazette notification but none of this will be good enough to get the DOB changed in 10th certificate. There are judgments on the same laying down when the DOB can be changed and when it cant be and will not be. THere have to be compelling reasons that can justify why you did not take appropriate action for rectification of DOB. You just can\u2019t get after few years of your 10th and ask the Board to change the DOB. ",

You can change your date of birth by signing an affidavit wherein you swear before the court that your date of birth is so and so and if what you have stated is proved to be false you will be held responsible for misrepresentation of facts and will be punishable by the court of law. The copy of this affidavit can be submitted along with any other certificate that has an incorrect date of birth. ",

The date of birth given there is not having any evidentiary value like a birth certificate. If you have a birth certificate, which is the prime document regarding details of the birth, you can apply for change in the date of birth on the certificate. However, the procedure would depend on the board and the state government ",
