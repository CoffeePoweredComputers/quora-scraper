            "answer_text": "Of course. There is always room for improvement. Just because you did bad in high school doesn't mean that you will continue to do poorly on academics. It doesn't have to be even a community college that you have to apply to, there are more than 5000 universities in US. Just apply to the ones that you like, if you get admitted well congrats in advance. However, do keep in mind that going to a community college for 2 years to get your associates degree would definitely help you to get into your top choice schools such as Harvard maybe? Especially if you do very good in community college, no one can stop you. Just keep something in mind, don't let anything distract you, I am assuming there was at least one factor that caused you to write this question here. So whether it is bullying, low income, family, friend, boy/girlfriend, don't and don't ever let anything distract you. Not to brag, I went to one of the top universities and I am currently in the top #10 med school in US. I think I am in this position right now because I never ever had a girlfriend to distract me, never had a bad friend, always had good relationship with my high school teachers/ professors, involved myself into many activities and community service along with internships. So just to keep it short, just dedicate yourself to education until you are 24, then live and eat the fruits that you deserved in your professional life. I wish you the best of professional careers out there:) ",

            "answer_text": "Probably. But it may depend on the state you\u2019re in, so you\u2019ll want to do some homework first. But I know people who have done it. If you maintain a good average in community college for two years, you should be able to transfer to a at least a state university for your junior/senior years, and graduate with a university diploma. Not to mention the money you\u2019ll save, compared to starting in university from your freshman year. The homework is getting in touch with the admissions department at your community college and ask them what they think of your plan, and how well their credits transfer. Probably some will not, but as long as you get the admission that\u2019s what\u2019s important. After you think you have some answers, check with the admissions department of the university you\u2019re interested in, and run it by them to confirm what grade you\u2019d need for admission, and what experience students have had transferring credits from your community college. High School guidance counselors can sometimes pain college admissions officers as trying to shoot down every application that crosses their desk, but that\u2019s not really true. I think you\u2019ll find them to be happy to help you get the info you need. Once you put your plan in place, the rest is just a matter of working your butt off. ",
