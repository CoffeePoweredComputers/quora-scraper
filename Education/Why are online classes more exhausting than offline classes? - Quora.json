            "answer_text": "When discussing topics on education, it\u2019s hard to forget the issue of whether online education is better than offline for students. But if you were to analyze these two modes of learning, what will be your opinion? Do you think online education is better? What are your reasons? Some scholars may opine that traditional learning is better for students because it helps them get a feel of a robust learning process. However, many undergraduates think online learning is better. This can be seen from the fact that most of them perform better when they study online for a degree and come out with good grades as opposed to those who prefer offline education. Both online and offline education have their merits and demerits. However, an excellent way to understand these two modes of acquiring knowledge is to know the difference between online and offline learning. WHY ONLINE LEARNING IS MORE EFFECTIVE A higher retention rate It\u2019s easier for a student to forget what was taught in class, especially when such classes clashes with other commitments and the student has to attend reluctantly. But it\u2019s not same with e-learning. This is because the student can control how much material they take in and easily log out when they feel exhausted or tired. According to a study conducted by the Research Institute of America, it was concluded that e-learning has successfully increased the student's retention rate from 25% to 60%. Convenience The year 2019 saw the average student turning to e-platforms for learning as opposed to the traditional method of education. Also, many organizations that want to encourage their staff to undergo further training or acquire new skill find solace in e-learning platforms, which gives them more control and a custom way of accessing training portals and materials. Students who are searching for academic research papers for sale can easily find help online. And these resources can be accessed with a smaller budget as opposed to offline education. There are more reasons why students prefer online training, aside from the issue of convenience. Find them below. It requires less time and less commitment too. Learning in the traditional classroom setting requires a lot of time and commitment. This includes the time you need to wait for lectures to begin and get back and forth to class. Many students, especially those working part-time, find solace in e-learning because it allows them to be in control and dictate the amount of time they can allot to a course. Students are assessed frequently This can reduce the number of distractions and help students focus more on their study . When you enroll for a course online, assessment can become a regular thing alongside short tests and tutoring. It goes a long way to improve student engagement. Online vs. offline education: What is the difference The primary difference between both of them is the location. Offline learning requires each student to be present at the training location irrespective of where they are coming from. Thus, students will have to decide whether to stay on campus or rent an apartment close to school. But with online learning, the case is different. College students can gain access to classes, training, and assignments from any location. All they need to do is log in on the internet from anywhere in the world and participate in the class. The degree of flexibility is another difference that is worthy of mention. Online learning brings a lot of flexibility in terms of time scale. Your tutor can offer support via a chat system or email. But with offline learning, academic assistance is usually restricted to office hours, which does not provide much flexibility to the student. We are not saying that there are no benefits associated with offline learning \u2013 it offers more benefits, when it comes to doing research, assignments, and writing essays as well as other school activities that determine your grade. There are plenty of reasons why many students and workers prefer e-learning to offline education. We have discussed some of them. We hope you can make informed decisions from this information. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, It's true that online classes are exhausting students as well as teachers. No one is happy with this but we don't have any other option. In offline classes, we have our mates with whom we could talk in case their is any confusion regarding questions aksed by teacher or any particular topic. But in offline classes, due to network issues sometimes students are not able to hear what teacher is asking. Voice break is the major reason which is very annoying. In offline classes, students used to respond well in comparison with online classes. All students believe that offline classes was better as there was a time limit say 4 hours but in this online classes teacher used to extend classes and take their classes on weekends too, which is not a good idea.
