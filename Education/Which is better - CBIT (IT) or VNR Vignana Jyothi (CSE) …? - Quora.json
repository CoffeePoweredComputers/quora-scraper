            "answer_text": "Don't bother about placements.! I repeat \u201cDon't bother about placements\" Make a detailed study about both the branches and try knowing which one you'll fit better into. Both colleges provide excellent opportunities for placements. All you have to do is you must stick to your goals to succeed. Upto my knowledge, both options have equal potential for success. But, considering all factors, I will suggest you CSE in VNR. Ask me if you have any further queries. All the best. ",
