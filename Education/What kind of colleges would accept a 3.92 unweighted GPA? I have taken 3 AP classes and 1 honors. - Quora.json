            "answer_text": "I hope this helps. First off congratulations on your hard work (and some great stats). If you continue in college you\u2019ll probably get into a top 20 grad program too. You didn\u2019t mention it here but your SAT will also be a major factor followed by some great extracurricular activities and leadership. The good news is that you will probably get admitted into several top schools ranked 10\u201350 especially if you have a commensurate SAT/ACT. The ivys and Stanford will focus more on your intangibles which wasn\u2019t mentioned including leadership, charity, unique and especially national level accomplishments they are rare and unique. Most don\u2019t know this secret (don\u2019t tell anyone) but you\u2019ll definitely want to include several amazing UC schools when applying since these schools feast on kids with your gpa as gpa first schools. With a 3.92 unweighted gpa, top UC campuses including UC Davis, Irvine, Santa Barbara and San Diego will usually accept you with a 1500 SAT or close (UCLA actively recruits straight A students and reject almost anyone not at 4.0/4.0 unless your a special admit The UC are always grade first schools by charter where they have to admit top 8% of California students and the philosophy travels to out of state for grades being significant and most people don\u2019t know that. With those grades, please do apply to some of the best top 50 schools anywhere. phenom schools like Duke, NYU, Notre Dame, Georgetown, Northwestern, Vandy Wash st lousy (I mean louey-it ain\u2019t lousy I visited it and loved it) will carefully consider you especially with a 1500\u20131550 Sat. Usc admits 11% but would be a great choice if you have some Great activities and leadership. It\u2019s tough to get into USC but if your all around are as good as your grades you\u2019ll get a great look too and possible a scholarship which about 8% do and many are very generous. Also to help determine if you in the intial sweet spot or running, be sure to focus in on the 25th percentile for gpa and sat score at each school you are interested in\u2026 if your a special admits \u2014like a first time in family college student or not English speaking at home and on the 75th percentile demarcation if not as per admission experts to stand a reasonable chance. Do some homework and it gives you an idea and definitely not a guarantee of admittance. For the Ivys and hotspots like Stanford, MIT and CalTech, you\u2019ll typically also need a perfect SAT or maybe 1560. It will also help to get into this group if you have a national title nationally renowned extracurriculars and then you\u2019ll have 4\u20138% chance. These are the toughest schools to get because they focus on quality students gpa but also want \u201coff the chart\u201d SAT scores and world class activities and volunteering. State titles frequently are great for others but might not be your \u201cspike\u201d as some refer to the idea of being special. Good luck on a great academic career thus far and the best news of all is\u2026scholarship possibilities. Also some kids do get rejected from many of the top 40 so be sure to apply to some amazing schools ranked 40-100, some other schools that you truly admire and with a top SAT score, I believe that you\u2019ll get many scholarship offers as well due to a great careers. Keep up the hard work. And lots of continued success. ",
