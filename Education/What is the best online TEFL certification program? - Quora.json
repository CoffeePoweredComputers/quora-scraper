            "answer_text": "That depends. Here\u2019s something to think about: What\u2019s your favorite restaurant? Now compare that to McDonald\u2019s which is popular. Which is best? \"Regardless of how you measure 'best' (elegance, deluxeness, impact, profitability, ROI, meaningfulness, memorability), it's almost never present in the thing that is the most popular.\" - Seth Godin So\u2026 As far as TEFL courses go who knows because the average person has only taken one course if that. I\u2019ve taken 2 courses (a TESOL and a TEFL) and created my own. It depends on who you are going to teach. From my point of view the best TEFL is going to prepare you to do your job, be focused on teaching the students who you teach (adults or kids) and be similar to your job. Your point of view is probably a little different though. From your point of view you are just starting so you are thinking about getting a job and less about the teaching. I understand why you think that way, but I would focus on the learning and not the job because you\u2019ll get a job that\u2019s the easy part. The hard part is the teaching. The best \u201conline\u201d TEFL course is probably going to use multi-media and simulate actually being in a classroom. It\u2019s going to be engaging and interactive. It won\u2019t be a boring text-based course (like the cheap course on Groupon that I took) and it won\u2019t be a passive experience. The best online course is going to take you into the classrooms where you will be teaching.It\u2019s going to include a lot of video because people don\u2019t remember text they remember video, but I am not talking about lecture videos.It will prepare you to teach the students you are going to teach. For example, if you are going to teach kindergarteners don\u2019t take a course focused on teaching adults. Most courses like CELTA actually focus more on teaching adults.It probably won\u2019t be cheap because a cheap course will be automated and there won\u2019t be any tutors or feedback.It\u2019s going to teach you real tools that you can put into action in the classroom not theory.It\u2019s probably going to offer feedback/help on lesson plans and assignments. They\u2019ll be communication with a real human. Best Online TEFL Course For How To Actually Teach English To Kids In Asia Online courses are not for everyone as some say they are \u201cuseless\u201d. But that depends on you and the course. If you have ADHD, ADD or are a traditional learner you probably won\u2019t do very well. You have to be a self-directed learner. Here are 7 different viewpoints in regards to TEFL courses You\u2019ll find examples of all of these here in this thread and throughout the web. So it might be a good idea to keep these in mind when you read through the answers here or elsewhere on the web in your search for the best course. CELTA snobs are dogmatic. Example 1, example 2The affiliate marketer makes money by referrals. There are a lot of them responding to this question. Example 1, example 2, example 3The direct marketer owns or works for a company. Example 1, example 2, example 3The cheapo recommends the cheapest.
