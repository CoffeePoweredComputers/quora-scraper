            "answer_text": "It really depends on many factors. If you didn\u2019t do well in high school and your standardized test scores are marginal, you might consider attending a community college and transferring into a four year university in your home state. Many public universities have a transfer policy and program in place for students from community colleges in their states. Of course this assumes you improve as a student in community college. If you are thinking about getting into a top school as a transfer student, you should consider the odds first. In 2014\u201315, Cornell had 4,117 transfer applicants. It accepted 766 or 19%. In contrast Harvard had transfer acceptance rates of less than 1%. So if you are considering transferring into an Ivy League school, you might want to look at Cornell. Brown University - 1832 transfer applicants 2016\u201317 | 96 accepted (5%) Harvard - 1432 transfer applicants 2015\u201316 | 13 accepted (1%) Yale - 1160 transfer applicants 2016\u201317 | 28 accepted (3%) As you can see, your chance of transferring into an Ivy League school from another college or university are much lower than the normal admit rates for these schools. So you should probably just look for a college or university where you plan to spend four years to six years getting your degree. If you have to transfer because you don\u2019t like the school or your academic interests change and you want to attend a school with an academic offering stronger than the school you are attending, then consider the transfer option. But don\u2019t think that you have a better chance of transferring into a school that you don\u2019t think you can get in as a regular decision admit. ",

            "answer_text": "The question makes no sense. To be considered a transfer student you need to be already a college student :-) All states have a path that allows good graduates of community students to transfer to their state university. It is not considered an \u201ceasier\u201d way. It allows for a college education at a reduced cost. It also provides another opportunity to those who did not feel doing the work while in high school to prove that they can do college-level work. CC graduates rarely transfer to top private schools.

            "answer_text": "Depends on the school. Top private schools are basically impossible to transfer to. Harvard has an acceptance rate of below 1%. Princeton doesn\u2019t accept transfer students. On the other hand top public schools like Berkeley are required to accept a large number of transfer students from California community colleges. ",
