            "answer_text": "I believe that the phrase \u2018Learning by doing\u2019 was initially said by Dewey, who embraced the cognitivist philosophy that students learn best from a hands on approach to learning, through interacting with their environment. Another key element to learning by doing is idea that learning can occur from experiences. Whilst it is true that experience can be 'converted' into learning, the process is not always automatic. The process of 'conversion' is brought about by 2 key qualities. 1. The significance of the experience and 2. Reflection In adopting these two qualities the student embraces an 'active' role in the learning. The form of the 'activity' does not necessarily, although it may, involve any movement on the student\u2019s behalf, but there is an expectation that the student consciously engages with the experience. This 'engagement' might also be likened to what Rogers; a founder of the humanistic theory of learning; also called 'learning by doing'. Thus, by placing the emphasis for learning within student centred strategies, and by using the student's own experience(s) the learning becomes more meaningful. ",
