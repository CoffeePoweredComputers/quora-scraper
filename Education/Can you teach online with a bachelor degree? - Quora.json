            "answer_text": "It depends upon the course and college or other educational entity. Most colleges want the same credentials they seek for traditional teaching on campus for accreditation purposes, e.g. Masters or Doctorate. On the other hand, you may find many opportunities to teach online at non-accredited colleges or in courses in which post-grad qualifications are not an issue such as K-12, certification, test prep, personal enrichment, etc. Check with your local school district about Adult Education opportunities which might be taught online. Also check your local community college for Community Education courses taught online. It depends upon the level, but online instruction can be a bit difficult to break into without experience. At any level, prospective employers will want to see a course syllabus or require one which must be used which is usually the same as the one used for traditional courses on campus. ",

            "answer_text": "You can teach through the high school level. You can teach vocational and certain professional courses. You generally need at least a Masters degree to teach at the Associate Degree (community college) level. Four year colleges prefer you have a doctorate and evidence of research. Whether the course is offered on the ground or online is irrelevant. Some arts degrees are terminal at the Masters level and this degree as well as experience are expected. ",

But, in general, there are few teaching options for someone with a bachelor's degree unless that degree is in teacher education. Even then there are state licensure tests that you need to pass. ",
