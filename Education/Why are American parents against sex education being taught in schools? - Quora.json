            "answer_text": "As I understand it, it\u2019s usually people with very conservative attitudes towards sex. They have varying reasons such as the kids being taught about sex too young, or the sex education is overly graphic, or the kids are getting too much information. Whatever the reason, it seems that (like Paul mentioned) the people against sex ed in school aren\u2019t teaching at home either. So the goal seem to be to keep the kids ignorant about sex as long as possible. This is about as bad an idea as I could imagine. As Caitlin mentioned, what we need is better, more consistent sex education. We need to be telling kids the things that they need to know. Abstinence is fine and dandy, but the kids should still be educated on how everything works, the ways to stay safe, and ALL the possible consequences of having sex. Not just basic knowledge of STD\u2019s and pregnancy's but how these things can change your life. Half the country uses scare tactics that don\u2019t work, abstinence programs that leave kids clueless, and stupid misinformation campaigns attempting to convince kids not to have sex without providing any useful education on the matter. People need to just relax and start giving kids consistent, accurate information. I\u2019d be surprised if better sex ed classes in schools didn\u2019t lower the teen pregnancy rates all by itself.

            "answer_text": "American parents against sex education at schools? Maybe I\u2019m just out of the loop or I don\u2019t pay enough attention to what happens in the most conservative parts of America, but from my knowledge that really isn\u2019t much of a thing, in fact, I hear American\u2019s screaming that schools need better sex education more than not having any at all. While I can understand some conservative parts of the states may want to do that, that can\u2019t be said for most of America. We want better sex education for our youth in schools, not taking it out entirely. ",
