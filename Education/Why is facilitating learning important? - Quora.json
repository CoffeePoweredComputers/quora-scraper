            "answer_text": "A facilitator is the guide by your side not the sage on the stage. As a facilitator your job is to carry out a plan in the form of an outline to lead learners to a desired outcome. A facilitator is usually a subject matter expert. They generally have the real world experience to get learners to a desired learning outcome. Unfacilitated learning would be a \u201cfree for all\u201d with little or nothing accomplished. A team driven learning experience is still facilitated. Learners emerge as leaders and therefore facilitation is occurring. A facilitator will ideally follow a prescribed body of knowledge. Facilitators can design and develop learning material called courseware, but some facilitators are not ideal developers whereas they are extremely good at facilitation. The ideal facilitator recognizes their strengths and leverages others to realize their goals. Learners may carry out one or more activities. Conclusions may be drawn that learners can take back to their practice - whether that practice is work or life outside of the class. A facilitator will guide learners through mistakes they may make. They will ideally reinforce the group experience and minimize embarrassment to the learner. Learners may draw conclusions. A good facilitator draws out the experience of adult learners so that the group benefits from their professional and life experiences. Experiential learner through self and others is among the best outcomes from good facilitation. Facilitators are ethical, grasp adult learner concepts and theories, leverage their own experiences and can vary from the prescribed learning to meet group and individual needs. Good facilitators entertain learners. Research shows that mind, body and emotional inputs result in the best learning. Learning is reflexive, that is the evolved learner is able to derive learning from their own behavior. They recognize opportunities to learn from their own successes and failures and from their own experiences. A solid facilitator helps to guide learners as far along in this reflexive process as they are able. Mature learners reflecting and perhaps passing on their experience. Learners will some experience growing from that experience and then bringing it into their practice. Learners with little experience intuiting from other experiences, outside experiences as well as logic, reason and common sense and bringing these into their practice. ",
