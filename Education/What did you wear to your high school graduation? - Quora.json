I didn\u2019t go to my graduation because I had moved to another state and been in college for a year by the time I graduated from high school. My son went to his and wore white shirt, black dress pants, black shoes and socks\u2014that was the required uniform for everyone. Girls could wear black skirts but high heels were frowned upon and considered unsafe. it took about as long to find a parking spot and then to locate him afterwards as it did for the 800 students to walk across the stage. My daughter decided just to skip the ceremony after that hassle\u2014neither went to their college graduation ceremonies. ",
