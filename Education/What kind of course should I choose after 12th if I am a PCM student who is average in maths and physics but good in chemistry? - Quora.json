            "answer_text": "I suggest not to do Btech in this case . You can go for defence servies or you can do BCA since it is the era of computers . Or you could go for BSC . Chemistry teachers are less these days so you can do BSC . After BSC you can go in research or teaching profession. BA is also an option. BArch or architecute is a good option but it requires interest in maths. My choice would ne BCA or BSC. ",
