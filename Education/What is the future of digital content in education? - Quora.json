            "answer_text": "Digitization In Education.  What is digitization?  According to Wikipedia: As the name itself shows, The process of converting information into a digital format in which the information is organized into bits. Latest technologies in education New teaching and learning methods are emerging each year as technology in education is continuously upgrading. And it helps in improving both student and teacher development. Here are some new technologies in education. 1. Augmented and virtual reality.  We all want new technologies in our day to day life. Every teaching staff progressively using Augmented reality to implement virtual content on printed materials to increase understanding after the success of Pokemon Go when we understood the role of augmented reality in education. Virtual reality allows students using e-learning platforms on mobile devices to interact with study material directly. The virtual lab is an effective method of interactive learning through which students can communicate with experimental apparatus and experience live learning. 2. Cloud-based technology  It offers a solution to students who concern about losing their documents of a school class or any important certificate. So as far as cloud-based technology has grown up; Assignments, projects, content related documents can be stored on the cloud safely. Google Drive is a cloud-based technology which is used by teachers to share information with students for presentations, exams, project, assignments, etc. Cloud-based labs include study materials in the form of videos, texts, etc. And they also provide live sessions with teachers. 3. 3D pr The 3D printer is a must-have in classrooms and so that students can print out 3D models for various purposes like for project presentations or for their study purpose etc. That will helps students to create a model first to check the perfection of the same even before making the original. Students will learn best through interaction and are better than reading textbooks and listening to lectures. Also, each and every student will do their task or assignment with enjoyment. Advantages of Digitization in education One of the best advantages of having computer-supported instruction in the classroom is that the computer can serve as a trainer. The use of paperwork in the classroom can be minimized by new technology like this. Lecturers can only help students in the learning process to a certain level and only during school periods. Computers and other related forms of digital technology permit the student to continue their studies at home at any time and can act as a teacher for the students who are falling behind. New technology also allows students to advance at their own speed as they learn. The main benefit that people claim is that technology, especially the internet, allows for equality within learning education. Disadvantages of Digitization in education The online learning can't be a good alternative in classroom studies, because it makes lack of personal interaction and connection in between teacher to student and student to student. As everything is now available online, students are not giving proper attention to their studying habits also becoming lazy. As laptops, computers, mobile phones completely replaced the usage of paper and books, its leads to extinct of good handwriting. Also, the students who can't get a mobile or laptop due to their poor condition, so they are not able to access even the more common technologies such as a computer on a regular basis.

            "answer_text": "Here are 9 Trends I would point to for 2014 and beyond: More flipped classroomsMore self generated content (project based learning) & digital portfoliosMore digital collaboration between students (assuming its encouraged and/or allowed)More e-reading and digital content being created & used (also more interactive & immersive)Big data, big data, big data (big analytics too of course)More devices bought by schools (but this may squeeze budgets in the short term).  More data & more feedback loops.  Hopefully better data and better feedback loops.Hopefully better training of teachers & perhaps ongoing coaching via portable devices.  (in terms of the later, there isn't much cost savings I wouldn't think given at least how coaching works at least with employees on staff--plus the value of face to face coaching may make up for any cost savings)E-tutoring through digital devices.Peer to peer learning with digital and through digital.More on trends in K-12 technology: 5 K-12 Technology Trends to Watch in 2013 ",
