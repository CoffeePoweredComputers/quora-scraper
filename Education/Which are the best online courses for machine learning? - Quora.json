            "answer_text": "One can simply define machine learning as the process by which machines learn and analyze data independently without human intervention. However, to reach that autonomous level of programming, it requires intensive human expertise in training the machines and programming them to utilize their artificial intelligence. And that effort can only be provided by certified individuals. Could you be one of them? Definitely! Upskilling oneself in any given field has now become a pretty straightforward process. Yet, choosing the exact portal that can propel you in your desired direction can be quite an uphill task. But before diving deeper, it is always preferable to straighten out the fundamental knowledge. Like everything related to the Computer Science field, machine learning to requires a basic familiarity with languages like Python, C++, and R Henry Harvin provides courses on Machine Learning with R and Machine Learning with Python and also Data Science with R and Python. Known for starting from scratch and building up to a substantial amount of knowledge, Henry Harvin\u2019s Data Science course could be the perfect fit for any beginner. Don\u2019t just take my word for it, research and analyze all the data, and be your own data scientist. Stanford University offers an online course on machine learning. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas. IBM also offers a course on machine learning with python. In this course, you will be reviewing two main components: First, you will be learning about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. Second, you will get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. ",
