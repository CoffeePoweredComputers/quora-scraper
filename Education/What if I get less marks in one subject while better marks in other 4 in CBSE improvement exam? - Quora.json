            "answer_text": "Hey.! Thanks for A2A. Whatever marks you get after CBSE improvement, your final result will have the best of the two. For example, if you scored 87 in your actual board exams and 80 in your improvements, then your final marksheet will include 87, (not the one you get in improvement). Similarly, if you score 90 in your actual board exam and 92 in your improvements your final marks will be 92. So all in all, the best among the two contributes to the final result of yours. ",
