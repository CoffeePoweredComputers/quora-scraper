            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with some facts. In elite institutions, those with very selective admissions, SAT scores are very poor predictors of grades (which we\u2019ll roughly say means performance). The main reason for that is what statisticians call restriction of range. In an extreme hypothetical case when all the students have SATs between 1500 and 1600 (old 2 part tests) grades are going to depend less on SAT scores \u2014 everybody is smart \u2014 and more on motivation and other factors. A lazy 1600 kid will do worse than a motivated 1500 one. In schools with less selective admissions SAT scores do a reasonable job of predicting grades. Kids who score say 1100 really are less likely to do well than those who score 1500 although even there other factors may be more important. However, this prediction business is complicated. Generally kids with higher SAT scores major in harder disciplines or at least those with tougher grading standards \u2014 typically sciences and engineering. At my last institution psychology majors had significantly lower average SAT scores than physics majors. So a low scoring psychology major (who is one of higher scores psych majors) might make a better grade than a higher scoring kid taking physics courses on the assumption that grading is tougher in physics -- likely true but I don\u2019t have evidence. I once did a study and found that the best predictor of grades is a required (and fairly tough) psychology stat course was by far SAT math scores, but that was in a discipline with relatively more variability in SAT scores. I would also caution that grades may not be the best criterion to use. I\u2019ve had lots of B students whom I thought learned more and used their knowledge more wisely that some drudges who made As. So maybe whether SATs predict grades isn\u2019t the best way to think about SATs although I can\u2019t offer a better easily measured criterion than grades. Truth of the matter is that SAT scores are moderately useful at many places, even those with some selective admissions. For selective institutions I suspect SAT scores work as an initial way to weed out students who are not going to be selected. When I was on an admissions committee at a selective place, SAT scores were not especially important for those students who were clearly qualified and lots of kids with near perfect SAT scores were not admitted. Since you now have a pool of really bright potential admitees, other factors become far more important. For that reason many elite schools are moving toward not requiring them, especially since they do disadvantage minority kids and provide fodder for conservatives who want to argue that black kid who scored 1200 got admitted over an Asian kid who scored 1600. But at the end of the day the minority kid graduates and otherwise does well. and may turn out to contribute more to the general intellectual and social atmosphere than the one who got rejected. There\u2019s a lot that goes into admissions, and SAT scores are usually not the most important once kids with really low scores have been eliminated from the pool. And just to add a bit of cynicism, most elite schools admit some students with relatively lower, substantially lower, SAT scores \u2014 they\u2019re called athletes. And guess what? They mostly graduate and do well in life. Of course they also have tremendous academic support, much better than what \u201cordinary\u201d students get, and often major in courses designed specifically for jocks. That said, for \u201cbottom-liners\u201d studies have consistency shown that college athletes who graduate make more money than non-athletes on average, even taking pro sports out of the equation. Isn\u2019t life interesting. ",
