            "answer_text": "It largely depends upon if you had PCM or PCMB in 10+2. Since you have graduated in medical & clinical laboratory technologies (am I correct?) and seem to have liked it, do stick to the field you are in. Research in this field comes from developing methodologies for solving a particular assay, estimation, quantitation of say biomarkers present in bio-fluids. A case in point being- a reseacher in metabolomics looking for a new automated assay method for a metabolite at the branching point of reverse TCA cycle in a disease condition. Another example, early disease prediction by DNA Fingerprinting, which again is within the domain of medical technology. In brief, you have to develop academic career in analytical chemistry & biochemistry at PG level, to start with, to meet your aspiration. You have to positively realize the career limitation and channelization your MCLT has unknowingly brought in. Therefore you have to make the best with what you have. Go in to have some work experience in large Corporate group of hospitals eg Apollo, Fortis, Narayan Hridulaya etc. After that go on for some PG course of a good University. Trust me, you have bright career so long you stick to your skill based graduation as your pathfinder. ",
