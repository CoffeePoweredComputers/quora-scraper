The probability of a failure is (1-p), often denoted as q Additional properties mean = npVariance = npqMode = (n+1)pIf (n+1)p is an integer, mode is 2 numbers: (n+1)p and (n+1)p - 1If p = 0 mode = 0If p = 1 mode = nProbability that X is a certain number x[math]P(X=x) = {n \\choose x}p^x q^{(n-x)}[/math]There are a couple more properties which you can easily find with a simple Google search ",
