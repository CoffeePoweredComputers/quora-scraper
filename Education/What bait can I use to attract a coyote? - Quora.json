            "answer_text": "Baiting in some areas/states is unlawful-1st determine what's legal. Then, if it's legal, you can use bacon grease as a scent, and usually anything that will attract carrion, like old donuts, leftover scrap meat, cooking grease from any meat. Something which has a \"Food Smell\" usually does better, then you can enhance it with visual bait-predator lures, etc. Always check legality before doing anything like this. ",
