            "answer_text": "This question is clearly ableist/audist and assumes that Deaf kids need to have things explained to them. (Laughs) I was born Deaf and I figured out I was Deaf all on my own. My hearing parents never needed to explain to me that I was Deaf. The earliest memory I can remember is knowing signed language would work for me. I was only 2 1/2 years old then. My next earliest memory was around age five or six when I realized that Deaf people and hearing people had different culture and many of their values conflicted with each other. Your details are also ableist because it assumes that one must be totally abled in order to have a \u201csocial development.\u201d (It\u2019s also audist because it assumes that one has to be hearing or act like a hearing person in order to have a \u2018normal\u2019 social development. FYI\u2026there are all kinds of normal, and HEARING isn\u2019t the only kind of normal or even the best kind of normal. With Deaf children, all that is needed is for their parents to SIGN and have signed conversations with them. Visually accessible language is critical\u2026once Deaf children have that, then they are able to receive their education, develop cognitively, develop socially, and do everything they want to do. Withhold signed language from a Deaf child\u2026you\u2019re talking about language deprivation, problems with social development, communication issues, and so forth. As for blind children\u2026they have different needs than Deaf children (why did you lump us together, OP?!). I\u2019m not an expert on blindness so I will leave it to other blind Quorans to answer that part. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never had to do this, but I have a fun experience that I can share with you. My ASL teacher showed us this story about Deaf children. There once was a six year old boy who was born completely deaf, he and his mom lived together. His friends come over all of the time, even though they can\u2019t communicate very well, they still have fun together. The little boy asks his mom if he can go over to his friends house to hang out with him, she says yes. He\u2019s really excited and goes running over to his house and knocks on the other boys door. The boy opens it with his mother standing near by, all of the sudden, all the Deaf boy sees is the other boy and his moms lips moving, he runs home, astonished by his new discovery. \u201cMOM, MOM, did you know that people communicate with their mouths?!!?? How do they do that, it seems really hard?\u201d His mom then smiles and explains to him that people can communicate differently than they do, similar to how Hearing people explain that Deaf people communicate differently than we do. The Deaf child isn\u2019t impacted negatively by the lack of English yet, he can function normally, and still has friends. The hard part comes when he starts growing up and faces discrimination because of his language. I think something similar occurs with blindness, but I\u2019m not sure. ",

I will note that I have several Deaf friends with Deaf children, and no one has ever mentioned \u201cOh, tonight we\u2019re telling him he\u2019d Deaf.\u201d I don\u2019t think it works like that. Children grow up realizing that people are not identical, that they may have blue eyes and blonde hair, and someone else may have brown eyes and red hair, and just accept it. I doubt that a Deaf child needs a \u201cconcept of Deafness\u201d to develop a Deaf identity anymore than a little girl needs a \u201cconcept of female\u201d to develop an identity as a girl, or an African-American child needs a \u201cconcept of race\u201d to develop an identity as an African-American person. I can tell you that there is a book called Deaf Like Me, and the title comes from the ability of a pretty young child who was able (enabled, when her parents decided that oralism was not for them, and their daughter would learn ASL, as would they) to tell her parents that some adults she just met were \u201cDeaf, like me.\u201d ",
