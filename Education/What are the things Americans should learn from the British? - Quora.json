The horrific exploitation of the colonies of the British Empire are one thing, but as bad as that is, they were as bad on their own people. At least in the US, you can rise by your own ability and effort whereas, many aspire to rise, and do rise, but the class structure in the UK is disgusting. We have our own Blue Bloods and they have power, but we\u2019ve a big country and can get away from them in in most of the country, they ain\u2019t shit. ",

            "answer_text": "How Brits pay taxes \u2026\u2026..much simpler and no filing required for the majority of tax payers . The only change \u2026.refund or payment is because your situation changes in the tax year , you can tell them right away , in which case the adjustment is made there and then and your tax code will change .Or you can wait until April and do it then . Now the problem with that is that many Americans like that tax refund every year, which has its drawbacks if you owe the IRS money and cant send them the money right away \u2026..the IRS penalties and interest are high . Which is fucked up because every year the US government gets an interest free loan from tax payers . There is a way round that that entails paying employees monthly . Your bills are monthly, and making every month four weeks gives you 13 pay checks in a year \u2026\u2026. It will never happen \u2026\u2026\u2026 ",
