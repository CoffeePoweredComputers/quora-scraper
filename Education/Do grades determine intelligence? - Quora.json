            "answer_text": "No. A fixation on tracking our growth and capabilities using a standardized grading scale gets implanted in us at an early age. By the time we reach adulthood, many people simply accept this as the only method to gauge what we can accomplish. That\u2019s a huge problem \u2013 because grades and intelligence are two very different things. There\u2019s a popular quote that\u2019s floated around the internet for years. \u201cIf you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.\u201d Unfortunately, the way we evaluate peoples\u2019 skills and abilities makes about as much sense as judging a fish by its climbing ability. Reasons your grades do not define your intelligence 1.) Grades don\u2019t necessarily reflect your abilities. You might know the lessons covered in class, but still be unable to translate that into performance once it\u2019s up for a grade. For example, a lot of people suffer from test anxiety. That can make it difficult to succeed \u2013 no matter how well you understand the material. If you\u2019re stressed or anxious, your brain will want to do a thousand things other than complete a complex assignment. So don\u2019t be surprised if a person underperforms on a task; maybe they are too stressed to focus. 2.) Grades are less important than comprehension. If you study to memorize material for a test\u2026well\u2026congrats, you\u2019ve learned to take that test. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve learned the material, though. Facts and stats simply spilled onto a page without much context or need for deeper problem solving. This approach cannot accurately measure abilities. In fact, you might as well just play a game of Simon. 3.) You can\u2019t always quantify your strengths. As humans, we\u2019re a lot more than just numbers on a page. Each of us has an incredible variety of different strengths and talents. The abilities typically measured by grades only cover a set range of them. Intelligence is just one of countless variables that will impact your grades. 4.) There are different kinds of intelligence. Imagine you have three people: aphysicist, an expert historian, and amaster artist. Each one is brilliant in their own.But if you measure them according to the skillsets of the other two, they might all look unremarkable when you grade their papers. It\u2019s just like that quote we talked about earlier. 5.) Your passion matters more. Intelligence refers to one\u2019s ability to learn to understand, and apply knowledge and skills. But it doesn\u2019t count for much if you don\u2019t have the drive to do any of those things. If you\u2019re studying something you don\u2019t care about, you\u2019re not likely to invest much energy in trying to comprehend it. Thus, a person with passion that pushes them forward is more likely to come out ahead of someone who might be a genius, but who isn\u2019t motivated. That\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t be dedicating time and energy to some things you don\u2019t really care about. But if you can identify what you are passionate about, you can learn to follow paths that will play to your strengths rather than your weaknesses. 6.) Intelligence can still change. By engaging in exercises to train your mind over time you can boost your intelligence and shape your own reality. Bottom Line No one system could ever define your overall intelligence. This realization goes two ways: just as grades don\u2019t dictate your intelligence, your intelligence also does not dictate your grades. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. Intelligent people may get good grades, or they may not. Not all classes are based on logic or intelligence. More importantly not all teachers can deal with smart kids. I used to \u201cskip\u201d steps and not \u201cshow my work\u201d all of the time in my math class. My teach gave me a D on a test when I got 100% of the answers correct. The next test I was pissed, so on the back I drew a brain and write \u201cI figured it out in my head because I am not stupid like you.\u201d It didn\u2019t go well for me that day. I won\u2019t fling out all of my dirty laundry, but in many ways that teach was a contribute to why I had a hard time with school instead of getting a free ride to any school I wanted. In the end, people with Genius level IQs actually have a higher drop out rate than normal peeps. I believe my personal experience reflects a lot of the reasons why, and most of them are solvable. The biggest two reasons I see, could be easily solved by investing a little money or time or even a little effort on teachers. Boredom: We need to challenge students that exceed the normal students, not ignore them. This is something I have seen some improvement on over the past two decades, but it not enough.Outcast (don\u2019t fit in): If we take the smarter kids and put them in \u201csmart schools\u201d they will fit in better, they will challenge each other, have teachers that are trained specifically on dealing with smart kids. Unfortunately for the US, we are so caught up in ideas like no child left behind instead of ideas like, promote the geniuses for a better future. As such we devote more money to those with learning issues and ignore those who can actually change the world. I am not saying we should not help out all children, but instead of neglecting the bright students, we need to push them to be even better. As such we need to restructure our education system, moving smart children into focused schools where they can excel without the pressures put on by normal students. Yes they need to learn how to deal with normal people, but that is what college is for. When even the normal kids are focused on learning (well some anyways). This is in no way to suggest we should detract money from those in need, we need to really fund education properly or become an obsolete country. We should double our education budget. Instead we get a majority party that wants to reduce public education to a joke, with short sighted views. With resources such as Perry Preschool Study - HighScope we have all of the evidence needed to show that spending a little on education today will have huge gains for the future (Especially in reduced crime).

            "answer_text": "No. Let me repeat that, No. There are many factors which are significantly more important for the grades than intelligence.  Time and Discipline. The hours one puts in studying a subject is the most important piece. In my experience, whoever studies more is the one who gets the better grades.Motivation. I experienced that whenever I have a good reason to get a top grade \u2014 i.e. not just an ego-boost \u2014 I can deliver. Furthermore, if I like the thing I am studying, my brain automatically makes it easier for me to understand that subject.Concentration. Can you avoid distractions? Are you worrying about your private life? Is your neighbor beating on the wall? Focusing is also a skill. The people who can concentrate more generally produce much higher results.Cheating. I do not mean cheating in the general sense. But most exams require you to know how to take the exam. Some people understand the subject fundamentally yet still are unable to write the exam properly. To get absolutely top grades, you need to be also trained.Familiarity with the material. This is generally ignored. Having experience with, say, physics will enable you to understand and study further topics much easier even if they are not directly linked to the previous topics you learned. That is because you already developed intuition for the subject.Of course, intelligence is linked to some of these. You can argue that a more intelligent person will learn how to \u201ccheat\u201d easier or that he or she might be more focused than a less intelligent person. I am not denying that there is a correlation between grades and intelligence but it\u2019s not necessarily a causation nor do \u201cgrades determine intelligence\u201d. Aside from these, I am familiar with many top graders in Cambridge and back in my high school and people whom I find brilliant. In my experience, these brilliant people often do not achieve top grades \u2014 this is, of course, linked to several factors. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026. I don't think so. Let's take an instance. You 're a brilliant student with all-round skills. Another student, let's assume that's I, who knows only physics/maths/art/sport. ( your choice to choose the subject for me.) You will try to be the best in every subject. You will learn all the books of the course and your session will be over. Congrats! You've got the best grades. Now, what did I do in that time? Being the best only in my preferred and most favorite subject, i spent my time studying and imagining all about it. I gave 50%,both my time and hard work to my subject and the rest 50% to other subjects and other chorus or work. I got not-so-good result. This scenario went on for many years. After schooling, You don't know what to do now. You think of the field you\u2019re best at. After an year or two(it may take a lot more time) of thinking and trying different things, you still don't get to the result. With the guidance of your parents, you get admitted to a college or university of your parent's wish. You don't get along well there because that's not what you would have thought to do. But still for your parents, you do that. After that, you find a job with your degree and some other things. Or You give civil services exams or government exams and get enrolled into government jobs. (That's what most of the Indian parents want their child to do this ensure the rest of their life). After 10 years You are watching news and get astonished seeing me on the television. I have become a famous personality. (Well I know that's too much serialistic but isn't it interesting.) Now, you are flashing your memory 10 years back. Thinking about me. I, with a wavy future in front of my eyes, but a stable mind with my best ability, got enrolled in making a history and not with my school grades. I didnot choose the regular and ordinary path. Instead,I chose an adventurous path. Getting ahead by taking some risks. And I finally did what I wanted to. Moral: Until you take risks and do something, you are not intelligent. Just reading and learning your coursebooks doesn't make you intelligent. It's you yourself who identifies the area of intelligence inside you. Taking the knowledge from everywhere is not really worth. Grades and exams have no connection with your intelligence. Do whatever you like. Don\u2019t cram up with your course books. Bringing a good result is a child's play. A little practice and you too can top the class! But does it defines someone's intelligence? No.. Not at all. Every one is intelligent but in different fields. Someone's intelligent in science, someone in math, someone in art,or the other in sports. If you try to be intelligent in every of the above mentioned subjects( and more), you 'll get dumb in your best subject. And that's one of the major cons of our grading system and our parent's thinking system. They link the grades of exams with our intelligence. ",

            "answer_text": "OK, that is a very good question. The biggest misconception about marks and intelligence is that they are equivalent to each other: if you have one then you must have the other. Unfortunately, they are not. Grades measure your performance in school, while intelligence measures your performance in life in general.You might know yourself that in school, you are given the material then tested on it. But in life, you are given the test first. Your challenge in school is to mentally ingest as much knowledge as possible to excel on tests. Your challenge in life is to find the right information, look at big pictures, and take the steps you think are right. Your good grade on a test measures your success in school, while the positive impact on your life resulting from a decision you've made measures your success in life. The reason why you were left thinking for a little bit is because you started to realize the difference between school and life. Yes, there is quite a difference! College resembles real life more than K1-12. That is why most students find it challenging to adjust. Like I mentioned before that finding the right information is a common challenge in life, but some of the knowledge you gather in school will serve you later. It will not serve you in all circumstances, however. You have to get out there and learn the hard way sometimes. To sum it up: Intelligence is a broad measurement of performance that includes good grades, but they are not the only thing. Those peers of yours that claim you are not smart are mistaken. you are smart because you have found a way to excel at what you want, in this case it is school. It is the desire to succeed that drives you in the direction of success in any of your endeavors. ",

People think it does. It is more blind discipline.Work ethic doesn't prove an employer any you are useful, if you have dick for brains, you get the interview based on your grades, but not the job.I've seen my fair share of CVs in my life. If I've seen one trend over the last few years is that I see more people with higher grades than ever before, but more dick for brain than I've ever seen. Sometimes this stupidity hurts. This is why we have interviews, so I can filter that out.. Ultimately, I don't see much value in a A* university degree, nor in tens of certificates. When I see 20 graduates in an assessment centre, it's easy to tell which ones got there by wasting hours in the library and which ones got there by sheer intellect.  Obviously when you hire a team of graduates, you do pick one of the blind work ethic like a horse graduates. Because sometimes you want to hang out with people who aren't that bright, just to see how the other half lives. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer - Grades DO NOT determine intelligence. From your question, I understand that you are not satisfied with a math test that you attempted. And, based on this you have reached a deep dilemma whether your grades will determine intelligence. Grade of a particular test only tells how well you performed with the set of questions that were asked and at that particular time. So, a person who achieves the highest grade in a test is not guaranteed to reach the same grade if a different set of questions are posed. So, how can one say that grades determine intelligence? My God! The two are unrelated things. You are still in high school, and you have got lot of examinations to pass through (academically or otherwise). And in the course, you, like every other human will face failures and hardships too. But, you should look at them as points of learning and move on to the next examination with improved zeal. More importantly, you have written that you have a liking for mathematics. I would advise you to focus on learning the subject rather than grades. If you put your 100% efforts, everything will fall in place. This does not mean that I am asking you to ignore grades and move on. You must try to get good grades too. Its unfortunate that in this competitive world, your collective grades show your sincerity of efforts. All the best! ",

You sit for some coffee and there\u2019s a crossword, being the smart little stud that you are, you think to yourself: \u2014I\u2019ll solve this shit in my mind and THEN I\u2019ll write it in one fell swoop. Logically, the crossword falls over to your dazzling performance. This is certainly no match for you. Life has to have some meaningful challenges around. It is fitting then to play around with every-day activities while adding entertaining small twists. You write words in reverse order, read them backwards, forwards, mirrored, and else. School, needless to say, is NO challenge for you. Exams last no-time, homework gets solved in class, explanations need to be given once. You help the teacher explaining things to your classmates. Exam time approaches, and you\u2019re more than ready: you were BORN ready. The date is due this afternoon and you feel you don\u2019t need to study. YOU KNOW YOU\u2019RE RIGHT, and the Universe knows too. Anyways, life is good, you\u2019re good, everything\u2019s ok. You are playing your crosswords-without-ink game when the TV in the background says: \u2014BREAKING NEWS. Structural damage on main highway bridge. Casualties in the dozens. The last word in the crossword gets written and you raise your eyes to the TV. \u2014What the fuck is mom\u2019s car doing right there? OH MY GOD. NO. A picture of a car with enormous amounts of debris on top of it appears. The license plate is your mom\u2019s. Paramedics and rescuers are all over the place. You\u2019re smart, you know there\u2019s no way she\u2019s alive. Yet you find excuses, you desperately try to believe this isn't real, that it is a bad joke, a bad dream. A nightmare. Now your mom is dead and you've got an exam to take in about two hours. How can you possibly perform well? No sane person will ALLOW you to take that exam in the first place. Replace personal tragedy with malnutrition, depression, anxiety, child abuse and more; and you\u2019ll definitely see why someone can under-perform a test because of external influences. ",

Study a lot, cheat, get your grades curved, or a combination of those 3 makes up 95% of the people in the education system. Likewise do all the doggie points that have nothing to do with your knowledge like show up to class and turn in homework assignments. Alternatively if you\u2019re intuitively intelligent, you can study very little, none at all sometimes, and merely go to class. A lot of the time this will actually cause intelligent individuals to not want to waste time with doggie points like showing up to class or turning in homework. The problem is there\u2019s no way to tell which is which and who got there in what way. If you want proof that getting top grades doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re intelligent look up one of the Reps from New York named Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (yes a US congresswoman). She has a degree in economics and international relations cum laude. That means she got a high GPA. She doesn\u2019t know the definition of unemployment and she thinks you fund programs by printing money. World class economist. ",

Intelligence is far too nebulous and complex for something as one-dimensional as grades to accurately determine. It wouldn\u2019t even be accurate to say that grades measure how hard you work. Grades measure how well someone has grasped a given set of concepts. They reflect your understanding (and potentially your weaknesses). That being said, I\u2019m just as annoyed by the claim \u201cSchool is just about memorization, not learning. Grades don\u2019t determine intelligence\u201d as I am by the 4.0 cult. It seems that people who consider themselves intelligent but aren\u2019t doing well in school say this to convince themselves that they\u2019re smart. You may be very smart even if you\u2019re failing chemistry*, I get that. But you\u2019re conflating intelligence with understanding. Intelligence is broadly defined as the capacity for reasoning and learning, not the act of understanding itself. *I\u2019m almost failing chemistry, which is why I used it as an example.

Getting good grades in school isn\u2019t necessarily based on intelligence in the traditional sense, but rather a measure of knowing what teachers want, or knowing the system. From personal experience, some of my peers are rather bright, slick even, but they don\u2019t get good grades merely because they can\u2019t be arsed to put in the effort. Thus, bringing me to my next point, good grades are also a measure of studiousness. There are three types of people that thrive in school, which I have concluded from my years of high school, ones that are intelligent, ones that work hard, ones that are intelligent and work hard. Now, like I\u2019ve mentioned before, some intelligent people undermine hard work. This would relate to the type of education a high school offers, some require influxes of work to be done, others require just enough to test the character of the student. There is no definite answer to your question as there are many factors to be considered, but hopefully this gives you somewhat of an opinion from a current high school student. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure about the the past (in context to Indian education system); but, grades certainly do not determine intelligence anymore. The reason being privatisation of education system! The private schools/institutions are far too generous in giving marks to their students. I know that in most of the private schools teachers are forced to give marks far too generously as the management want good results. I have seen answer sheets of many students (10th class, board examination), many of them won't even pass if the marks were given on merits; but, the instruction comes to the teachers through principal (by management) that they should ignore mistakes of students and if they have written anything in answer sheets, they should be given marks (even if they have written wordings of a song for an answer)! Now, if they were to be evuated like we were in government schools, most of them won't even pass (I am not talking about all private school as there are some really good private schools as well, but majority of the private schools now are not worth it); but, in private schools, these students are pushed to around 60\u201370% marks and the one who would have got 60\u201370% marks (with fair evaluation) are pushed into Ninties. Privatisation of educational institutions has done more bad than good to education in general. The pressure is on teachers to come up with good results, they are asked to allow students to cheat or help them in examination as schools want better results to get more admission in the next session. We are playing with the future of these kids who are made to believe that they are best and are fooled by benevolently higher grades given to them, in believing that they know everything. I think we seriously need to look into the education industry before it is too late. ",

If you are trying your best and getting B and C grades it bodes well for your work ethic. I got B's and C's in school, went to college later in life and graduated with a 3.74. A dedicated person who works to his potential can be very knowledgeable is his/her field, or life in general. Don't be ashamed of B's and C's. You are probably a teacher's dream.

But, people who don't know you will assume that bad grades mean you aren't smart, or aren't disciplined, or that you are lazy.  Whatever the actual reasons, bad grades will likely reduce your opportunities.  Similarly, good grades may get strangers to give you a little more attention.  That doesn't guarantee success, but it's an extra opportunity. And more of life than we'd like to admit depends on whether you have more or fewer opportunities. ",

Not everybody otherwise intelligent applies themselves to scholarly pursuits, though. So there may be considerable dissonance between one\u2019s measures of intelligence and measures of scholarship. Then there is memory. Memory is the ability to recall things you have seen before. Some people are very good at memorizing. But memory is not the same as intelligence. Though memory alone can help one achieve better grades, it doesn\u2019t necessarily help one figure out something new. So, no, grades do not determine intelligence, and often intelligent people don\u2019t make good grades \u2014 for many reasons, such as lack of interest, lack of respect for the scholarly environment, other interests, and such.

So when I look at your question, I want to say that grades have something to do with intelligence. As an efficient and effective student, you invariably need your intelligence to: grasp the importance of your own personal future, by understanding your own current problems, and your plans to deal with them, while traversing the academic trajectory;explore ways to acquire and practise proven study tools and productivity hacks to help resolve your own problems, but more importantly, to enable you to navigate your academic journey with ease, expediency and ace;select the right tools and strategies to work in your student life, so as to attain eventually good grades in school, but more importantly, to put yourself in a robust position to have more educational options in your favour;In nut shell, your academic success hinges on your intelligent and diligent efforts.

My friends in physics would dispute this, claiming that no amount of hard work will cover up a lack of sheer brainpower, but most areas are more about hard work than brainpower. I had a professor challenge the class of the calculus class I took as part of a graduate degree challenge us: get a 93% average on all work and you could skip the final.  I went out and bought a second calc. book and did all of the problems in both the text and in a second book and was one of two students in a class of 40 to meet the standard.  And it had nothing to do with my math intelligence.  I just worked. Given the choice between talent and tenacity, I believe that tenacity always wins. ",

Yes , they do matter but they are NOT the \u201conly\u201d creteria to judge your intellectual level. You need to be conceptually cleared with the subject. Maybe at times you are not able to give your 100 percent. This can be due to lack of confidence or some other reason. Its okay to score low at times. But try to figure out where are YOU lacking . Making mistakes in the school tests make you learn that you don't have to make the same mistake again in the final exams. Don't feel guilty rather figure it out and work on it. If it is the time problem, then try to have mock tests. Increase your practice. And never fear from a question specially in maths. Its all the same . Study to learn first and then to score. Grades gonna vary but concept is forever. So, focus more on the concept first and then find why can't u score. ",

He is also known to have a near perfect photographic memory. ",

Some of those facets are very useful for school work (and different facets will be more useful for different courses).  For example, most theories of intelligence would include various aspects of memory as part of intelligence and having a good memory is certainly useful for school. However, schoolwork also reflects: 1) How much you study2) How well you study3) Whether teachers like you4) Penmanship and so on. And (depending on your definition of intelligence) some aspects of intelligence may not be related to grades (or, at least, only weakly related). ",

Ended up the course luckily, by barely scoring passing marks in each semester by the grace of God and his friends. But what my dad always did was, he kept gaining practical knowledge at every stage of his life. He knew very well how to handle people and persuade them for a favor. He kept getting better at it. Though he couldn\u2019t understand Technical terms, he was very strong in understanding human terms. He knew very well how to get his job done. He developed a very strong sense of logic. He did struggle initially but today he handles the HR division of his company and works very hard and passionately. He counsels people who find themselves mentally disturbed, and helps them to lead a wonderful life. One day the topper of his diploma batch, met him and shockingly he was still struggling to stand firm in this competitive world. Hence grades do not define a person\u2019s intelligence. Every man is born with certain talents and strengths, he who discovers them succeed. To discover our talent you need to work hard and smart. ",

So tell me from where I got the Grades? Mom: Your Grades were not so good OK! Me: Mom Grades don't matter. That is the intelligence of a person which is going to shape their future and Thomas Edison said,\u201d Tomorrow is my exam, but I don't care because a single sheet of paper cannot decide my future.\u201d Mom: Leave it. You just know how to talk all day! As you can see I tried a lot to explain my mom but what all she wants from me is just good grades. Your marks can't explain how intelligent you are!

I am talking about school papers and not competitions like rmo etc. School papers are designed in such a way that one can complete the whole paper if he/she has prepared well. But what is bygones be bygones. Don\u2019t be dejected about it. Everybody commits mistakes. But the real crux lies in how one is able to learn from these mistakes and improve oneself. If you keep on learning and improving on whatever silly mistakes you do in school exam, a time would come when you become nearly perfect and then you would clear exams like jee etc and become successful.

If you really want to be said intelligent then develop something which would help people in their daily life, something exceptional and very helpful then you will be praised as intelligent for years.

Yes and No both are the answer for you, because if you have already started to think from your high schooling about ups and downs in your grades or points than you seems to be in trouble. Please don't think much about grades. It will only leads you in comparison. This comparison will further take you into the ocean of fears. No matter how much grades you achieve, your mind can never be satisfied and keep on comparing it. And there is no end of comparison so my personal suggestion is don't mess with this grades or points or marks in your studies. Just focus over your favourite subjects, the subject you love to study work hard over it. Only two factors about grades in academics I am describing here. The grades will help only external people to indicate the level of your intellect.The grades will not help you to define at which level exactly your intellect stands.Now it's upto you which factor of grades you focus most importantly.

So, a student that gets all \u201cA\u201ds all the time might well be tested for Gifted services. More likely is the result of nationwide achievement test results, those are also a part of the determination of need for services. You must score at the 95th percentile or higher on an accepted nationwide normed test in two or more areas (say, Reading and Math) as well as score at the 97th percentile on an ability test (either 128 or 130, dependent on the test used) as well as have a NEED for services to be placed in Gifted services.
