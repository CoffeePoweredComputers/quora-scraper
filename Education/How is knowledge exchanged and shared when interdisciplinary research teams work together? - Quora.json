            "answer_text": "The researchers identified patterns by conducting intensive fieldwork on three interdisciplinary collaborative projects at a German university. The studies included different methods to investigate both the cognitions and the interactions of the members of the interdisciplinary teams. \"Using the cognitive mapping method, the participants were able to show how the ideas and knowledge of the team members were being shared in collaborative exchange and integrated into a common knowledge structure.\" \"The first, which they refer to as the \"theory-method interdisciplinary collaboration pattern,\" involves one party providing a theoretical understanding, and the other offering methods for collecting and analysing the data. The second, which was called the \"technical interdisciplinary collaborative pattern,\" is characterised by the exchange of learning tools such as algorithms and technical know-how to solve a shared research question.\" For instance, they found that interdisciplinary teams can save time and money if they agree on goals, communication rules and research tools in a kick-off meeting. They also need to discuss the understanding of their basic concepts -- which is usually different! Further on in the course of the project, it is helpful to explicitly agree on the way in which research results are to be integrated.\" ",

Her book, Work at the Boundaries of Science: iInformation and the Interdisciplinary Research Process, describes an extensive research project she did observing scientists working across several disciplines on their research for a major project. Of course, the technology has changed since the 2001 publication date, but what is important about her study is what she finds out about how the scientists think about and compensate for the difficulties of working across disciplinary boundaries. She is now a professor in the University of Washington Information School. Here is a more recent review she and colleagues did on the research that is available on scholarly research practices. https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/library/2009/2009-02.pdf ",

            "answer_text": "I am a strong believer that the opportunity for breakthroughs is optimized at the intersection of disciplines. Why is that? Successful researchers are naturally curious and creating an environment where social interactions occur easily allows individuals to venture into topics that they might otherwise miss. For example, the Computer Science building at Stanford was designed to provide community spaces for researchers to meet informally. Another building, the Center for Integrated Systems was designed to house researchers in both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. This was expanded later to include space for researchers in many disciplines to share the expensive equipment in that facility under an NSF program. The result was an explosion of new ideas. Good researchers cannot resist talking with each other about their research and that eureka moment occurs when a new insight is realized. ",

For interdisciplinary research to happen you need capable team leaders who will organize their team members and assign tasks. There is appropriate communication software on both sides and it is used to exchange and share knowledge in a regular fashion. When your interdisciplinary research project gets finalized the teams might organize a joint event to release the outcomes and if the results are of interest to general public, members of the public will be invited as well as journalists.

This works best when the participants have tremendous mutual respect for each other and are willing to step well beyond the traditional bounds of their respective fields. They have to be willing to be a bit vulnerable, share data, ideas, codes, techniques, and CREDIT. You have to be willing to be challenged and pushed and return this to the group in a fair and respectful way.
