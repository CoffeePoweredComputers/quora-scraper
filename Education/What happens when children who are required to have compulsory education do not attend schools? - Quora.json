            "answer_text": "It depends on what kind of homes they have. On the one end of the spectrum you have a child who lives in a disfunctional abusive environment, where the lack of schooling is on a list of things that are neglected. Education is on the bottom of that list, with things like a full tummy and security taking priority. Then on the other end of the spectrum you have families, who realized that the system is not the best thing they can give their child, and that children do not need to be spoon fed in order to learn. So they decide to take on the responsibility to educate their children themselves, by means of homeschooling. Unfortunately these two groups overlap in some cases. Let's assume that the government does not have hidden agendas and are not corrupt, then the government who tries to enforce school attendance probably wants to target the first group. Unfortunately they tend to group them together with the second group. That is a huge problem. So back to the question : what happens to these children who does not attend school? Well studies have been clear that outcomes are positive in general for homeschooled children, in terms of career success and performance with regards to tertiary education. Studies have also shown that the level of education of the parents of these children has very little bearing on these outcomes. Studies have also been clear as to the long-term negative impact of growing up in an abusive environment. So it's not so much about where you teach them. It's more about how you empower them to learn for themselves, by creating an environment that is conducive to learning. ",
