            "answer_text": "Vibrant academy fall under the good coaching institutes of kota. Comparing with all other institute the level of the study material is quite difficult for JEE Mains. Let's talk subject wise. Physics:- extremely hard from mains point of view I will not suggest you to prefer vibrant study material for physics.But if you are in vibrant academy then physics class notes are sufficient for your JEE mains but take care for some board related topics (i.e logic gates and semiconductor) Maths:- maths being fantastic for the vibrant but again the study material is nt at all preferable.Chemistry:- yes!! It is the subject that I can say you can prefer specially for organic chemistry (it's been Very good)Expect block system you can totally depend on vibrant chemistry study material. This is all my experience being two years in vibrant academy. Best of luck for JEE Mains. Hopefully you get it. ",
