            "answer_text": "I have a different idea for you. Instead of breaking up, how about setting each other free. Allow each of you to live your lives, and have normal experiences that happen in senior year of high school, and going away to college. Let go of the expectations of trying to maintain a monogamous relationship.  Right now, you are too young to be committing to a lifetime with anyone. And let's be honest, the younger you marry, the more likely you are to divorce. The average age for marriage for men in N. America is ~29 yrs old. Do you honestly think it is feasible to date exclusively for the next <however long> - until you are ready to commit and marry? As someone who has been in and is currently in a LDR, there has to be some definition. LDR is for people who have a timeline when they will be together. Otherwise, you're just penpals/Skype buddies. Relationships need shared experience, common growth, time to talk and settle issues. All this is not very achievable with a teenager heading off to their first truly adult experience. Your vistas are going to change exponentially.  There is other problem you felt important to mention. You say your parents don't want you to stay with this girl. I think this is very pertinent. This is especially true if your parents have been there for you, and have demonstrated that they are reliable guides in your life. OTOH, if your parents have social issues in their lives, and have shown themselves to be close minded, and unhelpful, take their objections with a grain of salt.  People underestimate how much fitting into their partner's family can be an indication of overall relationship success. If your parents are reliable, social and understanding people, they probably see some problem with your relationship that you are blind to, from inexperience. This is completely normal. Life is about learning from experience. Young love is a defining experience. If you trust them, you need to seriously consider their objections. They may not be the final say, but take action under advisement. My vote would be for setting each other free. And who knows? Some time in the future you may find that you reconnect with her, and both of you love the new and improved adult versions of each other. At that time, you'll have a much better shot at a successful relationship.    ",

            "answer_text": "The exact same thing happened with me and my current girlfriend when I was a senior in high school. She was a senior as well and I was the first person that she had ever gone out with. In fact, I was also her first kiss.  We had both graduated and while she was going to Baylor University for nursing I was growing frustrated with not getting a big enough scholarship to go to college myself. Her family was paying her whole way while mine couldn't afford to help me out at all. The entire time however, she was driving from Waco to Austin every chance she could get to come see me. This must have angered her parents and grandmother, because the began to tell her to cheat on me.  I then went to the Marine Corps, and got hurt, so instead of taking only 3 months to finish boot camp it took me 9 months. During the time I was hurt, I received multiple letters from her. One letter nearly destroyed me. The beginning of the letter told me how she had been asked out on a date by another man. I was sure it was a Dear John letter and almost stopped reading it. Fortunately I didn't. She ended the letter by telling me that she could never be with someone else and she loved me. She was forbidden by her parents to come to California to see me graduate because of her schooling. She dropped out a short time later. She also took every opportunity to see me that she could while I was in the Marine Corps. After my first deployment I proposed to her and she accepted. We were married a short time later.  We have now been happily married for 12 years. It might not happen the same way with you, but please don't break up with her just because of distance and your parents think is best for you. They think it is small time, and it might be, but only you know that for sure. You never know what could come of it.     ",
