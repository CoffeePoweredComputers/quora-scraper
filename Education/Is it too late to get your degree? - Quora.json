            "answer_text": "look at it realistically, you have 45 years to work, today some work 35 years. Can you pay off your education and make a couple of million at the very least in 35 years with all the downturns, floods, hurricanes, pandemics, taking in your relatives in old age, helping pay your kids\u2019 education, buying a house and a couple of cars, and still come out a head? If you start out late to get your degree you will more than likely get lost in the shuffle. One of the reasons is today employees do teamwork in hiring and if you\u2019re older you won\u2019t get hired because of them. ",

Possibly, you may be able to be more successful, going out on your own after getting any qualifications to enter a vocation. Start your own business. Then maybe with your new credentials and your past experience you could be successful in your efforts. I believe you can find some real life stories on individuals who have followed this path. ",

No my degrees were not from other high prestige schools, and the last one I got was in 1991. Maybe more to your point, there was a young woman who worked in our HR department in systems analysis. She was not qualified for promotion because she had not attended college. I mean no credits. I encouraged her to try online degree programs and within a year following that conversation she had enrolled in southern New Hampshire university. A month ago she completed her Bachelors and is going forward for her masters. please be aware to stay away from for profit colleges. Hiring managers don\u2019t take those degrees seriously. There are plenty of regular non profit universities like penn state that offer complete programs on line. hope that encourages you! ",

At some point, they decided to go ahead and go to school and get a degree. It depends on what it means for you to get a degree, how much time and money are you willing to spend to pursue this degree, your family and labor situation. Just keep in mind that there is no age limit to pursue your dreams. ",

If this is something that your brain and heart are set to do\u2014\u2014-do it! Don\u2019t let the age issue interfere. Yes, you\u2019ll be older than the other students and maybe older than the instructors and professors but don\u2019t let that dissuade you. You will enjoy the learning process much better than the young crowd and you may learn considerable more once you get into the studying routine.
