            "answer_text": "Look on FPGA : sizes rises, prices falls. Huge FPGA/SSRAM arrays inserted in modern fastest PCI-X slots, can expand your computing system with ability to make hardware customer-defined computer system to solve specified tasks at gate level (like specialized processors). Modern top FPGAs includes dedicated CPU core embedded into each chip, in result you have arrays of CPU+FPGA+SSRAM nodes, can be interconnected into Transputer system. Mixing this FPGA boards with GPU computing boards like NVidia Tesla, will give you power computing system, also able to control fast processes in industrial automation with complex algorithms, if your FPGA boards will have external signal connectors.

            "answer_text": "The search is on for a new semi conductor material to replace silicon. Once that is found the speed of processors in PCs will start advancing again beyond 4GHz. I understand that Intel\u2019s ambition is eventually to have 40 core processors inside home PCs. There are already some very expensive processors with 18 cores. ",
