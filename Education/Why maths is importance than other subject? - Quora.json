            "answer_text": "Mathematics is like the sunlight illuminating the objects of the earth For example if you go to quantum physics you will need the calculus to explain the laws , same is in astrophysics etc. In electrical as well as in electronics engineering the matrix computation and laplace is used as well as some amount of complex analysis for impediece triangle and etc. In civil engineering and architecture most wonderful part of geometry is used in 3d views to imagine things and sketch things with engineering graphics as elementary tool and some software toolbox like Matlab and solid works etc. In computer science and engineering we use more of discrete mathematics and linear algebra to explain things and compute the algorithm . More over now in biology and life sciences and etc with genetic and all people are coming with mathematics with the explanation. In graph sketching the algebraic equations are being used to predict the nature of asymtodes , continuity and differentiability in the manner. Last but not the least Statistics and Probability theory is being used in data science , machine learning , AI etc in modern research of Computer science and engineering. ",
