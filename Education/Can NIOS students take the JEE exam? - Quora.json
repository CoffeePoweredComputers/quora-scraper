            "answer_text": "Yes you can NIOS has full credibility as that of any other higher and secondary education board in the country. Infact you can apply for jee as well as Neet which was not possible earlier for students (2014 & 2015 situation). That being said you can also apply for manipal, SRM, Comedk etc . Also a list of institution taking NIOS students has been prepared and uploaded on its website which is legit and no one can deny you the admission. Look for institution not mentioned ,in this case or example Amity is a major private instituton which didn't accept my form as I was a NIOS student. I was filling for the exam form for amity in 2016. Rest be assured every govt institution accepts NIOS. ",
