            "answer_text": "I studied in Ukraine General medicine, so it was cheap compared to other countries, all USSR countries are cheap, so it will be around 10000 to 12000 $ per year divided as 4000 or 4200$ for school fees and then 400 to 700 for one month with apartment rent included( and this will depend on your lifestyle, i.e if you smoke, drink, join sport club etc..). this for english speaking students, however for Russian speaking student, the university fees is cheaper by 400$, and actually will depend on which city will you study.but if you are planning to study in the English language, I recommend to use secondary source since teacher there are not that good in English, I used Dr najeeb for physiology only because his videos are soooooo long, Lecturio for all other subjects with Qbank and was the best, Armando youtube channel for some topics, he has short and great explanation videos, and osmosis is also a good source.Also, I have some of my friends studied at Belarus and Russia, they say that it was cheap for them also. I heard about Lithuania and Poland ( i recommend them because they are from the EU countries). so try to go to those countries ",
