            "answer_text": "Through my observations and experience in the software industry, Masters degree for a software developer is only beneficial if you do it immediately after your bachelors. The reason why I say this is because in the software development world, experience and projects trumps masters degrees. A hiring manager will usually choose a developer with a bachelors and 5 years experience then a person with a Masters with 0 years experience. You can fact check me on this, but also, money wise, on average a professional with the same amount of experience who holds a bscs vs a professional with a masters of cs get paid virtually the same. The difference is no more then 10 - 20 k. It usually costs around 20k to obtain a Masters. Now, in the software industry, it is pretty challenging to get a job straight out of school because managers usually want developers with experience. There are way more mid-level/senior level jobs then junior level. This is when the masters degree comes in handy, if you have a masters degree with 0 experience, you will get the job much much easier then someone with no experience and a bachelors.....and you will get a much bigger starting salary with someone with just a bachelors....but as the years go buy, the bachelor degree holder can catch the master degree holder in pay pretty swiftly.So to answer your question, \"What should you do after your BSCS ?\" A) If you want to make money right away, start applying for jobs and try your best to get that first project. b) If money isn't important to you and you want to learn more in school, you can continue with a Masters and get a bigger starting salary 2 -3 years later. c) You can go for PHD if you want to teach in acadamia /research.d) stay home do nothing but play video games, eat and drink all day. Hope this helps, but what ever you choose you are in a win win situation. You already have a BsCS, which is the most sought after degree in the USA and world, you will one day be rich regardless.
