            "answer_text": "Too many to name. Essentially all the trail blazing pioneers pre-20th C. had no formal education in their area of physics because they discovered or brainstormed it! Isaac Newton, the most famous physicist, earned a BA from Cambridge, and a poor student by then institution standards of attendance and contribution.  Science, prior to WWI that saw the merger of government and science (to design ways and equipment for mass human slaughter) into Big Science, was the hobby of affluent old or middle age men who spent their own money and formed into exclusive, self-gloating private clubs. Through and after WWI to this day, science is a commercial endeavor funded by other people's money. The assembly line bestowal of PhDs is an insulting travesty. Who are all these people with PhDs in physics and what have they achieved in head-to-head valuation with pioneers like Newton? The plethora of PhDs and MScs has devalued the distinctions to almost nil worth.  To turn the question around, I would argue that all but a few of PhD and MSc recipients, of presumed formal education background, really have no learned formal scientific education to speak of, as all they do is blow other people's money toward no substantive achievement.  Many, as Retraction Watch illustrates, lie and cheat and steal their way to perceived personal fame and fortune, all from the efforts of the true pioneers who had interest or time for paper diplomas. Educated physicists, referring to the present, is an oxymoron. Many of the good ones have resigned to authoring books on how decrepit physics has become.  ",

            "answer_text": "Michael Faraday   This was a man I felt \"could hear the song of nature\". Despite having no formal training, he became one of the most prominent scientists in history.  Growing up poor, he could only receive the very basic of education. However, it was his apprenticeship with a bookbinder that changed his life forever. The access he had to the numerous books that were sent to his shop allowed him to educate himself on various fields of knowledge. But it was electricity that truly piqued his interest. Armed with the knowledge he had accrued throughout the years, he would attend lectures at the Royal Institution, particularly those by Sir Humphry Davy. He eventually ended up as Sir Davy's assistant, giving him access to funds to conduct experimental studies into electricity. Eventually, after many years of research, he became the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution. Whilst the term physicist was not quite invented during his time, it would not be farfetched to call him one of the fathers of Electromagnetism, birthing this area of physics from the insights provided by his numerous experimental studies. Most notable is his discovery of the laws of induction, represented succinctly by James Clerk Maxwell in one of his equations :   This was aptly named the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation. I can safely tell you that every physics student would be VERY FAMILIAR with this equation. I'll end this with a little quote from Ernest Rutherford (one of the finest physicists of his era):  \"When we consider the magnitude and extent of his discoveries and their influence on the progress of science and of industry, there is no honour too great to pay to the memory of Faraday, one of the greatest scientific discoverers of all time\" And he started out as a bookbinder. Without going to school. Do you feel small? I do. ",
