We do not accept WES evaluations or even those provided by universities that are otherwise accredited by the national engineering accreditation authority, the CEAB. If you\u2019re looking into applying for any of the many regulated professions, check with them first to determine what their evaluation process is. ",

You need to go to your university and ask for copies of your transcripts (sealed in University envelope or any other) and send those to WES to evaluate or ask University people to send them to WES. I guess that is what I understand. All the best for your endeavors :-) Cheers ",
