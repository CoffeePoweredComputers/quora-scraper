            "answer_text": "What are your long-term goals? The biggest waste of money is blindly attending college not knowing where you are trying to go. When you use the generic \u201cA humanities degree\u201d, it sounds like you haven\u2019t picked a degree. Many of the jobs that \u201ca humanities degree\u201d can fill are lower paying, and that\u2019s partly because those degrees are less rigorous than the STEM degrees are. English literature degrees, although enriching your life, will not enrich your bank account much. History is a wonderful field to study and read about, but what job does it lead to (that you want)? But if you have a passion for social work, then a humanities degree is the way to go. Just don\u2019t be bitter when somebody else makes more money than you later. One of the unfortunate truths about college is that we are treating them as if they are job-prep locations when that is not their primary role. If you just want to get a job, you might even be better off going to a community college or learning a trade. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are drawn to the humanities? No, not at all. In the 21st century, the US economy has created zero net jobs for those with a high school education or less. About half the new jobs just require general college level skills, like writing, research, analysis, communication, team work, and so on. A humanities degree is the sort of degree that gives you these sort of college level skills. ",
