            "answer_text": "Mechanics is to the physical world, as arithmetic to the world of mathematics. I'm not sure why it is difficult for you, but for the students I taught, some had problems from two root causes: Delegating mechanics to the theoretical. For this group, what they read in textbooks is an academic pursuit, a paper exercise. They create an artificial separation between mechanics and the physical realm. Most eventually make the connection, and can move on quite quickly, but this group gets left further and further behind. To resolve this, I would recommend actively \u201cseeing physics\u201d. Relate velocity, acceleration, force, friction to your personal experience. How does friction feel like under your feet? What is the acceleration of that roller coaster you just rode? If you're speeding along at 60mph in a 40mph zone and suddenly see cop 50 yards away, do you have time to bring your speed down to legal limits?Another group sees mechanics = mathematics. One sub group here is usually already having trouble with math, so mechanics is just another name for a current problem. Another sub group here tries to solve mechanics problems as purely mathematics, but gets the wrong answers because they fail to understand the mechanical problem first. For the second sub group, you need a tutor to help you understand each concept fully, before you formulate the problem. For the first group, don't be afraid - the mathematics in mechanics is the basic arithmetic you've already learned in elementary school (mostly +-\u00d7\u00f7 and Order of Operations), so you've had a lot of time practising. If you're still having problems, do get some help.Hope this helps you in some way. ",

            "answer_text": "As Jacky Tan mentioned in his answer, Mechanics might be difficult for you due to a rather theoretical approach. Mechanics was hard for me as well, although I can say that it is my strongest subject now, and say so comfortably. To understand mechanics well, and the questions associated with it, you have to first understand where, and how the laws of mechanics are applied. The 3 laws of motion, law of conservation of energy, and the rotational equivalents too. The easiest way to approach a problem in mechanics, is by the use of Free-body Diagrams (FBD). Break up the whole system into individual bodies, and represent the forces acting on each body, with directions. You\u2019ll then be able to understand it easily, and visualization becomes a lot easier! Also, get a good book for studying Mechanics. A personal favourite is Statics, and Dynamics, by Meriam & Kraige. Another good book is Mechanics by R.C. Hibbeler. Good luck! ",
