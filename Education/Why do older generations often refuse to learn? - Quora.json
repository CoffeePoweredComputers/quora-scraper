            "answer_text": "With some I feel it is a matter of ego. They think they already know all that is important. Others may feel that things are just too confusing and complicated now and may be afraid of looking foolish. But there are so many of the older generation that are going back to college, traveling to foreign countries or even learning new ways of earning money. I have to say though in my experience, it is the younger generations that refuse to learn from the experience and wisdom of us oldsters. Instead of heeding much needed advice from someone who has been there and done that and may know an easier way, they seem to take it as criticism of their actions. ",
