            "answer_text": "Hmm. Did you have a particular area that caught your interest? Maybe get a job in the field for a year or two and think about it before coming back to school. And by \u201cin the field\u201d I mean, work at some agriculturally related position. It doesn\u2019t have to necessarily have to literally be in the field. Again, did a particular area catch your interest? See if you can get a job in that field. If you liked horticulture, go work for a greenhouse or a florist. If you are stumped, go talk to your adviser or a professor you might be particularly close with. They might have an insight into what you might be good at doing and interested in. ",
