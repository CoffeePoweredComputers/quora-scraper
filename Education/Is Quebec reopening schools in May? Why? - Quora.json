            "answer_text": "Yes, Quebec is opening its schools in May. In my opinion, this is a foolhardy move and they will see a second wave of COVID in the fall. Fir all their differences, the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois do not follow rules any better than Albertans. it appears that Quebec is willing to put its students and teachers at risk because they want to get their economy going again. Children aren\u2019t immune to COVID, and they can be carriers expspecially when mixing with other children. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, May the 11th. It only applies to elementary schools. It's controversial here, but in the arguments in favor of it are that: Children seem to have a lot more immunity, they are a very low risk populationChildren don't seem to be a vector of contagionThis would liberate the parents, allowing for some economic recovery (some parents refused to work from home during the quarantine because they had no one to take care of children)Education and socialization of childrenIt is also optionnal for every parent to opt out of school until September Classrooms will be limited to like 10 children\u2026 Security equipment will be provided to teachers\u2026. But the teachers union is currently asking for more equipement and guarantees of supply\u2026 Now I'm only repeating my understanding of the situation, if you disagree with the return to school don't blame it on me!
