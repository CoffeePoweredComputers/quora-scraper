            "answer_text": "The gothic style is popular because it looks traditional and serious. Archaic typography and embossed stamps lend a feeling of authenticity to the document, and make it look more imposing and official when framed and hung on a wall. After all that work and money, degree recipients also tend to prefer a piece of paper that looks nicer than the participation certificates handed out to elementary schoolers. The only way to check if a degree is real is to contact the university directly. That's why a number of employers require a certified transcript directly from the university before finalizing their hires. This is also why Universities bother to revoke past degrees in certain circumstances. Yes, the recipient still has the piece of paper, but any future employers in the field will discover what happened when they call to verify the degree information or cannot get a transcript.  ",

            "answer_text": "In Bonn Germany I received even two certificates for my diplom, a standard boring one in german language to give to the employer and another one in latin with some nice art and font that was handed to me during graduates ceremony.  I'm not sure I should upload a copy of my certificate so I'll skip this part. As to know whether a certificate is real or not, there as mentioned here you can call the university and ask them. But there is even a faster method which is to google the person's name on the university website. Most departments will at least list the names and thesis topics of those who graduated from their respective working groups. Not all departments do that, but if they do then it is a faster method than calling the university ",
