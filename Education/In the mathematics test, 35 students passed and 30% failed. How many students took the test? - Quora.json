            "answer_text": "Have it in mind that the total number of students that sat for the exams represent 100%. This therefore means that if 30% of the students failed then the percentage that passed the exams was 70%. This is gotten by taking the fulll percentage which is 100% subtract the 30% who failed the exams. Ask yourself the question that if 70% represents the 35 students that passed the exams then what would be represented by100%? Take 100% multiplied by the 35 and then divide by 70%. this gives you 50 as the answer which represents the number of students that sat for the exams. The number of students who failed the exams therefore becomes 15. ",
