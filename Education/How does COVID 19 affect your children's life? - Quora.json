Breath droplets from someone asymptomatic/sick with the disease without knowning it. It could\u2019ve also been passed through a surface but that\u2019s less likely.In worst case scenario, the COVID stage of it isn\u2019t what ends up doing the damage, its the inflammatory part after its passed that has been showing up in children. It\u2019s rare but can still happen.Overall kids typically have a high recovery rate from this. The younger you are the less likely you\u2019ll experience severe side effects. However it\u2019s not 0% so it\u2019s best to try to avoid catching it at all cost",

My 5 year old son has really impressed me by \"competing\" with his big sister while she's doing her year 5 maths and getting them correct.They recon I'm a better teacher than the ones in school because I give them really interesting assignment such as making bread from scratch.We have an enclosed garden so they can still get out into the fresh air and get some fresh air.As I normally work away through the week, they're also getting to see Dad every day while I work from home.
