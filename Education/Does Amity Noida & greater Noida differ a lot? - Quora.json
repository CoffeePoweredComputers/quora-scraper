            "answer_text": "I have been in both the campuses and in some points they do differ. If we come to travelling part Noida campus is easily reachable from Okhla Bird Metro station ( Pink Line ) following with 20\u20b9 auto. Whereas Greater Noida campus is extremely far and will consume most of your time as firstly getting on metro and reaching to Botanical garden metro station ( blue line ) then getting govt. bus till pari chowk ( 23\u201353\u20b9 ) and then by auto charging 20\u20b9 per head.Coming to most important part in college is placements. Noida campus is the hub for the placements in entire Amity Universe in India. Students from Amity Gurgaon, Greater Noida, Delhi, Jaipur, Gwalior visit Noida campus for placements.You'll find emple of places where you can spend your day, whether it is Mall of India, Sector 37 Market, Atta Market, etc. Coming to Greater Noida campus you won't be able to have such hangouts.Studies also differ in both the campuses. Noida being the centre of Amity Universe. More faculties are there as compared to the other campus. It is preferred that one must take in Noida Campus all the above reasons.",

So it's still under way in many ways. Amity Noida campus has been past it\u2019s initial status of \u201cNew\u201d university, it has much stable system of structure (most of the mechanical faculty are still arrogant, much like their students of their department), and have much wider range of expertise than any other of their campuses. I would suggest your priorities should be focusing on Amity Noida Campus. ",
