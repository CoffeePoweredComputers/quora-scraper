            "answer_text": "If I understand the question correctly, you are asking about the realization that teaching is more than job. Okay, the first day you are there and you have 30 kids (young adults for me teaching HS) staring at you with the \u201cAlright, you better know your shit!\u201d face. And as you begin to speak, you see their subtle movements (slight head nods, attentive eyes, or other acknowledgements), sort of like looking out on a calm, distant ocean surface, and seeing the water slightly undulate. Oh, if you are good, you have them literally hanging on the words, gestures and expressions. It\u2019s at this time that you realize, \u201cI am responsible for them. And the other 85 I see later today.\u201d Pride pumps within you. A sense of duty encompasses you. And then\u2026\u2026. The bell rings, the next group begins to fall in. You are still amped from period 1. You begin your exact same approach, and BOOM! Shit falls apart. They don\u2019t respond. Sidebars everywhere. And you struggle to find out what went wrong. Nothing! Kids are kids, but they are not all the SAME kids. One minute you believe you are destined to teach, and the next, you retrace your entire life to figure out what karmetic forces led you to this purgatory! Perspective is everything. In reality, it is a job that one trains and is paid for. Ideally, a mission of sorts. But one has to be careful. In order to be considered a mission or any other hyperbolic term (at least for me) one must be aligned to the purposes, objectives and means by which the mission is to be carried out (I will refrain from details here, but you can always post a separate inQuory). Teaching is a great job to have, and profession to pursue, for the right people. I would just be mindful holding too tightly to that ideal, as it may not be the reality that exists. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "If a prospective teacher realized that teaching is a mission/vocation, they might react in a variety of ways. It would depend on their initial expectations. Here is what happened to me in 1975 : I wanted to become a high school English teacher, I was 21. I loved fiction, film, drama and literature. My students could barely read, had severe learning problems and trouble concentrating on the subject matter. They were the academic and social dregs of the school I was assigned to. At this time in this place (Dutchess County NY) there was no such thing as special education and my 15 and 16 year old students had been promoted year after year without mastering the basic content of the subject. At the age of 16 they would be permitted to drop out of school without graduating and all of this class was headed in that direction. I was totally overwhelmed by the task assigned to me and shocked that these students were such inferior performers. Then I realized I could never teach them how to read so I wanted to share with them my love of literature, talk about great themes and issues, get them to consider classic moral dilemmas. However I was under the supervision of a superior and I was not permitted to find appropriate content. Instead I was i to make do with Charles Dickens , \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201d It was a challenge to have these teens relate to language and the context Victorian England. Why would they ever be interested? I wish I could tell you that good intentions triumphed over adversity. Somehow time passed and the fiasco ended, I remember very little except my frustration and disappointment. I felt that I needed to learn how to help these students and it had nothing to do with either Dickens or any of the education courses which were required. I did pass the courses and gain my credentials but I never walked into a classroom as a teacher again. Eventually I returned to this puzzle and pursued a career in social work which would have been the correct training to begin to help my class in 1975. ",
