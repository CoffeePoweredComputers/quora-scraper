            "answer_text": "Now THIS is a great question. I was requested to answer this one so my apologies for the late reply. IR in university definitely requires both critical thinking and psychology experience. However, right away I\u2019d say you should take HL Philosophy. If you\u2019re genuine when you say you \u2018love philosophy\u2019 then you should take it. Think about it this way. You can benefit when it comes to TOK. TOK is basically like baby philosophy. If you took Philosophy HL then you\u2019d basically be taking TOK too. I like to think of TOK as Ab Initio Philosophy. Definitely do Philosophy then. Kill two birds with one stone. While everyone else is trying to develop critical thinking skills, you\u2019ll be way ahead and will be able to do so much better because you\u2019re being taught actual philosophy. As for psychology, I think if you like psychology enough in university then you can take it as an extra course for credits and put it on your CV when you go for a career that\u2019s IR related. HOWEVER. The most important thing before you go deciding to take philosophy over psychology is to check with your top choice and second choice university/college what their subject requirements are for IR. That\u2019s probably the easiest way to pick between the two. If you need psychology for university, then go with that. Vice versa if it\u2019s philosophy. So to recap. Prioritize your choosing this way: See which subjects your universities/colleges want for their International Relations courses. If they require one over the other then your choice is made for you.If they don\u2019t specify which ones you need and you already meet the other subject requirements, take Philosophy HL because you\u2019ll benefit when it comes to TOK.Take Psychology as a an extra course in University if you\u2019re still interested in it by thenGood question. Hope my answer helped out! ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest going for HL Philosophy since you are interested in taking IR. Philosophy will come to your advantage by helping you develop your arguments and critically evaluating and challenging the political, economic and cultural relations. Also, political philosophy might be beneficial to your degree. Since you mentioned about not handling biology, I wouldn\u2019t suggest on doing IB psychology because there is a lot biology like neuroscience and the brain. ",
