            "answer_text": "If you get a good job and do it well it does not make much difference until you have to fill out an employment application. There are vice-presidents of companies who got where they are by performance, not education. I know a guy how came back to school because he applied for a dishwashing job and the other guy graduated high school. Then there are the HR departments that only work with the BA, BS degree pile because it is much easier to find quality people there than in the no degree pile even if the job does not need any education. The theory is a graduate will be more reliable than a dropout. Like the others have said, If you act educated how people will know you are not? Your closest five best friends are probably very similar to you. If they are graduates and you fit in, who cares. There are circles where you do not fit unless you have a Ph.D. Ask Howard on the Big Bang Theory. ",

            "answer_text": "People generally assume that the people they meet are basically just like them, in general. If they are high school graduates, they assume that you are a high school graduate. If you speak well\u2014or as well as they speak\u2014they tend to assume you have the same level of education as they do. If you don\u2019t make it an issue, they will usually not even ask. However, that\u2019s for casual conversation. In conversations where your social and economic statuses are important, they will ask questions that indirectly explores the question. People interested in dating, for example, will look for security, common goals, common experiences, similar backgrounds, your living situation (dwelling), etc. If you are working, people don\u2019t usually talk about education either. They talk about the job and assume you have graduated. ",
