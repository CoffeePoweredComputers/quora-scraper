            "answer_text": "I argue no. For example, would you consider economics or physics to be branches of mathematics? Why wouldn\u2019t you? I mean, they both incorporate mathematics to explain their theories as well as predict results. But I argue that just because they USE mathematics in their practice does not entail that they ARE a branch of mathematics themselves. Now this question leads to a much deeper question as to \u201cWhat exactly is mathematics?\u201d Is it a study of how numbers behave? Is it a language of the universe that we are discovering? The answer is vague and controversial but aside from that, we understand the general gist of mathematics when we hear the term. From a pure mathematics perspective, the mathematics done have no relation to the external world in which we live in. There is no practical application (at the moment) that pure mathematicians seek from their work. If pure mathematics, as its name suggests, embodies what is mathematics, then this would exclude fields such as physics, economics, statistics, etc. (applied mathematics) When we use mathematics in statistics, it is used as a tool to describe something. For example, when we flip a coin, assuming that it\u2019s a fair coin, we say that the probability of getting heads, P(Heads) = 0.5. The 0.5 value is dictated by the condition that we placed on it, which is the probability that the coin tossed will be heads when it lands. The 0.5 has no value in itself in the field of statistics unless it describes something. In addition, perhaps it would suffice to say that: P(Heads) = half Half is a bit odd and imprecise, wouldn\u2019t you agree? Half of what? Half of 2? Half of a coin? Half a donut? That\u2019s where the mathematics comes in. The use of P(Heads) = 0.5 is used as a tool of measurement and precision. In addition, when we argue that something is \u201clikely\u201d, it\u2019s a bit vague and relative. What does it mean for an event to \u201clikely\u201d occur? 60%? 95%? That\u2019s for a statistician to determine as opposed to a mathematician. ",

            "answer_text": "Statistics is not mathematics. This is a common misconception of common people who have not studied enough mathematics in at least undergraduate level and mostly have therefore seen the numerical and arithmetic approaches of mathematics. Mathematics however, is a study of different types of structures, which are essentially abstract and therefore most of the modern and advanced mathematics is mostly unrelated to anytypes of calculation, however advanced that underlying tactics maybe. Statistics, on the other hand, is a study of guessing. It is true that the standing pillars of statistics are largely probability theory, numerical analysis and algorithms; but other than the probability theory, which is actually a very deep section of modern mathematics, none of the other portions are part of what one should call advanced mathematics. Algorithms and numerical approximations are, for the fact, used in number of other subjects, such as economics, theoretical computer science, information theory and others. So, statistics is itself a vast subject which essentially uses a lot of mathematics but is not maths par say. Also, if you want to say it is mathematics, well you can very well try to answer, what is in nature that isn't mathematics? ",
