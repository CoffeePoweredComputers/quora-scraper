            "answer_text": "According to US News & World Report, Williams College, the second institution founded in Massachusetts, is usually ranked as the best college in the United States. Finally founded in 1793, Harvard had successfully blocked its existence for nearly a half-century by arguing to the King that Massachusetts only needed one institution of higher learning. In comparison with the institution at the eastern end of Route 2, Williams was long known for its isolation and rural character, for educating the sons of farmers as well as elites, and for having a more rough and direct character. Critics preferred to charge it with housing too many \u201ccountry bumpkins.\u201d By the end of the 19th century, Williams had become a preferred destination for the East Coast\u2019s protestant elites, altering this image somewhat, with the frequent criticism that it had far too many \u201cnice boys\u201d (perhaps a nicer way of saying \u201cmomma\u2019s boys.\u201d Thoreau once opined of Williams, \u201cIt would be no small advantage if every college were thus located at the base of a mountain[.] Melville felt similarly. During the graduation ceremony at Harvard, the student body gathers in two lines and applauds their professors as they march through. At Williams, the professor gather in two lines, and applaud their students\u2019 achievements\u2014 past, and to come. Williams in the 21st century, has evolved from the regional institution of fifty years ago, into an international institution with a broad curriculum and co-ordinate programs with a variety of institutions, leading to almost any career path. Approx. 10% of the student body comes from abroad, with as many students matriculating students hailing from California as Massachusetts. Williams meets the full financial need of all admitted students, with net costs that are, on average, nearly $5,000 less per-year less than median costs at peers, and the full cost of attendance met for a significant portion of the student body. The College has undertaken significant initiatives to increase the economic diversity and inclusion of the student body, and no student should not apply to Williams due to financial need. Just the opposite. ",
