            "answer_text": "First off, save your money. Some people will recommend buying books. SAT books are ridiculously high-priced, because they know kids will buy them thinking they\u2019re the only way to study for the SAT. Perhaps you enjoy reading and working from a book, in which case you can disregard the rest of this answer. But if you don\u2019t want to spend money and do want to get a personalized study plan, I highly recommend Khan Academy. I linked my Khan account with my College Board account, so that I could get tailored study plans to work on what I missed most on the PSAT. I also opted to get daily reminders to do 10 SAT practice questions. Admittedly I didn\u2019t do the practice every day, but they were helpful nonetheless. Khan Academy has its own, full practice SAT tests as well as videos explaining key math concepts (not sure about English), and full explanations for practice-test answers (both math and English). If you like pencil and paper, then I\u2019d recommend printing off a few of the CollegeBoard\u2019s practice tests (here) as well. Take some Khan practice tests a night or two before the big day and you\u2019ll do great! I got a 1210 on my PSAT, but after studying on Khan I got a 1550 on my first test then 1560 on my next (1590 superscore). No, I\u2019m not being paid! I just highly recommend Khan Academy. Best of luck to you! ",
