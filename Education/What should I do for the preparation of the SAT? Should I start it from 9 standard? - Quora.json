            "answer_text": "Preparation for SAT from class 9 is way too early. It would be ideal if you started your preparation after your class 10th board exams. Believe me, you don't need more than 6 months of sincere preparation to get a good score. Take it from one who got a 1510 on it and prepared from April to October. As of now, what you can do is pay attention to your Maths and English classes in school as these are the subjects tested in the SAT. Even though maths questions in the SAT are extremely easy compared to your school examinations, English is relatively very difficult. Also, class 9 would be the best time to enhance your extracurricular activities as colleges would look at your achievements in both academics and extracurriculars. So yeah, as of now, focus on your academics and extracurriculars in class 9th and 10th. Worry about the SAT later, even though I see no harm if you research more about the SAT on Google or Quora in your free time. If you have anymore questions, ask in the comments. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Mehar,To prepare for the SAT- you must ideally look at the College Board - SAT, AP, and College Planning Tools to understand the topics for SAT. Going further, you need to plan your preparation for both the topics- English and Math. Yes, 9th standard, is essentially the right time to begin the prep. Please get in touch with LeverageEdu for more details, or write to me. One tip- SAT Prep from 9th grade and give more than 12 mocks before you give the SAT is the right way . ",
