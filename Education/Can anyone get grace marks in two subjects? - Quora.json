            "answer_text": "Yes, you can but it also depends on the school principal and the reputation of the student such as his participation in cocircular activities, sports, debate etc and if the student is consistently performing and just by exception he/she needs marks for passing then obviously you can get grace marks. Incase student is failing the subject by just 1 or 2 marks if person (examiner) thinks that no harm should be done just by 1 or 2 marks then examiner gives the grace marks. Note : I am answering this question because my father is a Maharashtra board examiner from last 7 yrs. ",
