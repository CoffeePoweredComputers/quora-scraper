            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you mean as many as you can each quarter/semester, and the answer is probably not - at least until you get acclimated to the amount of studying you\u2019ll need to maintain decent grades. Most colleges charge a flat tuition rate for what they consider a \u201cfull\u201d load of classes - last time I checked it was typically 12 credit hours - and you can enroll in others (usually with a maximum limit) at no additional cost. And, of course, taking more than the full load can allow you to graduate as much as a year earlier than the expected four years. But worth it? Again, probably not, unless you\u2019re hell bent to make it out of college in record time (and/or at perhaps a little less cost). You\u2019ll have little or no free time, be under tremendous stress and - trust me on this one - are likely to be totally burned out when it comes to formal education by the time you earn your degree. So unless you\u2019ve got an overriding motive, don\u2019t do it. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are going to school without working, do yourself a favor and take no more than 4\u20135 classes per semester. Especially if one of them is a writing or a language class. You can get away with 5 if they\u2019re all lower division classes. No more than 4 upper division classes per semester. I\u2019ve watched too many students crash and burn because they thought they could take the same course load regardless of what they were taking. Don\u2019t do that to yourself. If you can, save one fun lower division course for your last semester. Don\u2019t be afraid to go to your program advisor. They\u2019re there to help you. If you find you\u2019ve lost your way in a class, gotten behind, or just don\u2019t understand part of the course, don\u2019t be afraid to talk to your professor. They have open hours just for that purpose. ",
