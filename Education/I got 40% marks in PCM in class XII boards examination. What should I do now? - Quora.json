            "answer_text": "Firstly, don't worry at all that your career is doomed or some thing like that. You can still do very well in your career, just that you have to be wise in your decision making. Clearing boards witth that percentage means you aren't good enough for science. So change your stream, take commerce or arts and give boards next year as a private candidate. Take commerce if you find it genuinely exciting even a bit, and if you don't find any interest take arts. Now, these are streams way lighter than science so with 1/4th of effort, you can easily score over 90% in boards next year. Try that, and you'll get admission in fairly good colleges, which will be good in the long run. And then ofcourse based on your abilities, what you like dislike, you can go for varieties of career from MBA and working in corporates, professorship, or govt jobs whatever you like. Just don't do the mistake of sticking with science/engineering etc. Besides, if you score good enough in arts/commerce next year you can also try for pursuing media science, mass communication from good colleges such a Apeejay Mass communication Delhi, Indian institute of Mass communication etc. Trust me, if you put genuine efforts your career in such field would be highly rewarding.
