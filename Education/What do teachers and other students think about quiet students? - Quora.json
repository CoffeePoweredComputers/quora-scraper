            "answer_text": "I wonder what they're thinking right now. I wonder when they're going to start participating. Why doesn\u2019t (they) just open (their) mouth and start talking? This class would be so much more interesting with their input. What am I going to do about this kid? What am I going to say to their parents? How do I explain this to their parents? Maybe if I sat down with their parents and\u2026 no, I don't want to put too much pressure on them. Mom or Dad would probably blame it on the kid. I'll just let them know about it. Maybe if I focus on something they like\u2026 Gosh this is frustrating. Maybe I'll just let them be. They'll come around\u2026. It\u2019s been months! When is there going to be a breakthrough? Oh my gosh their voice is beautiful! Where have you been hiding this past year? I'm a second language teacher and it's terribly frustrating when a student doesn't talk for months, but I know they'll come along, eventually. Rushing just makes things slower. ",

            "answer_text": "There are different scenarios: The teachers would normally think that that student is introverted and not really out-spoken. If this student doesn\u2019t ask questions in class or make contributions, the teacher could think that he/she fully understand the concept taught or doesn't understand but is shy to ask in class. For students, there are many instances of verbal bullying from classmates who don\u2019t appreciate the introverted character. Students also tend to pull away from quiet students as they see them as \u201cboring\u201d and no fun, even if this is not true. Teachers would also want to see that student privately and ask some questions concerning the emotional and physical health of the student. Sometimes having a quiet student can make teachers think that that student is not following, suffering depression, anxiety, family problems etc and would need urgent attention, students could also think the same. But getting to know anyone that is quiet is something very good and it makes you know what lies beneath, some people could be quiet by nature but sometimes it is as a result of circumstance. ",
