            "answer_text": "If you are asking if the teacher can see the actual work, even if you haven't yet submitted it, the answer is yes, if your copy was generated in Google Classroom. When a teacher creates an assignment with an existing document from Google Drive, there are three options. The teacher can set it so that 1) the student can edit the Google document, 2)the student can view the Google document, or 3) Google Classroom will make a copy of the document for the student. If the teacher selects option 3, Google makes a copy of the original. When it does this, it adds your name to it and links it to your account, but your teacher is also linked to it. When your teacher goes into Classroom and clicks on your assignment, he or she can see your edit history, when you last worked on it, and all the work you have done so far. It is also possible to see if you have added collaborators. This is actually helpful, because I have had students who did the work but forgot to hit \u201cTurn In\u201d and would have lost credit if there had been no way to verify that the work was done on time. I can also see if there are students getting behind or struggling before the due date, so I can offer assistance early. ",
