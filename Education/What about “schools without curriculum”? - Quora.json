            "answer_text": "Without a curriculum, it\u2019s almost like being hired for a job with no job description. Your first day of work, you ask your boss, \u201cWhere do I sit, what specific tasks do you want me to start doing, and how will I know when I\u2019ve completed my task to your satisfaction.\u201d Your boss says, \u201cWell, sit wherever you want. Start with whatever you want and I\u2019ll tell you if I\u2019m not satisfied. . .sometime.\u201d A curriculum is a directive from the school district to the teachers which defines expectations for a specific subject and/or grade. A curriculum will define the scope (what and how much is to be taught) and the sequence (the order in which it is to be taught) of each subject for each grade. The teacher has a certain amount of latitude (sometimes a tremendous amount of latitude) in deciding the manner in which material is to be taught. As the student progresses to the next grade, a certain amount of mastery is assumed so that the curriculum can move forward with the next segment to be taught. There are a very few private schools whose curriculum is so vague as to be non-existent. That might work while the student attends that particular school. But college/life is not like that. Employment situations are not like that. Most people do better if they understand what is expected of them and how they will be \u201cgraded\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Curricula is an artifact of the 130 year old system of education. It represents what someone wants to do to you versus learning , something you do for yourself. If used as a guide instead of a mandate curriculum will support a child\u2019s learning journey. There is always a curricula, it\u2019s the use and application that changes. Schools without curriculum have rejected the mandate and focus instead on adapting the isolated silos of academic disciplines on an individual \u2018s learning strengths. ",
