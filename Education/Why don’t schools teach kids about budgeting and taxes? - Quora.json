            "answer_text": "If I had a dollar for every parent who complained about schools not teaching things parents really should be teaching\u2026 Do you not have a budget you can show to your child? Do you not pay taxes? What is going on in your household? But I digress. Lots of schools do teach basic finances, believe it or not. If nothing else, finance is not an uncommon elective. If they don't\u2026 well, how bad is it? Lots of education, for good or for bad, is being shifted to the expectations of individual learning. Your average school wants to prepare you for a career, not adulting. Personally, I have little issue with that. Ideally, budgeting and taxes could easily be taught in the home. Hopefully the family has a decent budget and a sense for taxes, as I initially ranted. I know, I know, not every household is so with it. But budgeting, taxes\u2026 these are fairly commonly taught online, in communities. Schools have a lot to teach. Some things get left behind. Doesn't mean you can't still learn things. ",

            "answer_text": "They do in the U.S. They do it in units in various classes, at age appropriate times all through the grade sequence, they do it with stand alone electives. I am so weary of the charges that schools don\u2019t teach finance, or civics, or any number of things that ARE taught\u2014-and all one has to do is read the course and curriculum descriptions put out by the local schools. Having taught some personal finance, including budgeting, taxes, bank accounts, investments, etc. in the last few years, I can attest to the difficulty of getting high school students to believe the effort is worthwhile. The classes/skills about which people express such indignation over their perceived absence may go by a wide variety of titles, but they are being offered\u2014-and often people on social media demand to know why their kids\u2019 time is being wasted with whatever class, including budgeting and taxes, that they do not need. A better question would be \u2018Why do students resist learning about budgeting and taxes?\u201d ",
