            "answer_text": "My friend , The question whose answer you seek is actually relative. The subjects may vary from university to university. Being a chemistry graduate from the University of Kerala I can say that the subjects are actually multi-dimensional. You will have to study complementary subjects such as Physics and Mathematics ,English as a compulsory language and a complementary language along with your core subject (Chemistry in this case) upto the first four semsters. Your labs will start from the fourth semester onwards. In the fifth and sixth semesters you\u2019ll have only the core subjects along with the labs, with the only exemption in the fifth semester that, in this semester you\u2019ll have to choose an optional subject as well.
