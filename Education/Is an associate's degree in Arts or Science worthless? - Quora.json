            "answer_text": " Pretty much. Your competition for a job has a four year degree. Why would they hire you? There is a \u201ctrick\u201d to making community college pay off. Follow along for a minute. A half century ago only seven percent of high school graduates went on to college (four-year). In post-WW II America our economy was booming while the economies of many European and Asian countries were--only slowly--being rebuilt. The \u201cLaw of Supply and Demand\u201d strongly favored the freshly minted college graduate. Today, when forty-five percent go on to college, college grads with a bachelor\u2019s degree are \u201ca dime a dozen.\u201d Following the Great Recession of 2008 we were slogging through the longest and slowest recovery since the Great Depression. The economy is picking up now, but in the last ten years we haven\u2019t seen one year of 3% GDP growth. There just aren\u2019t anywhere near enough suitable jobs for the army of high school graduates choosing to go to four-year colleges and major in stuff like Psychology, The Beatles, or Anthropology. College is a competition for a few good jobs, and many are going to lose. Depending on which study you believe 40\u201350% of four-year college graduates end up under employed. I like this study because it is recent, May 2018, and it breaks the data down by major. Underemployment: The Long-Term Impact on Careers The trick to making a success out of community college is finding just exactly the right, marketable skill, and getting the appropriate certifications and, possibly, an associate\u2019s degree. Dr. Kevin Fleming, \u201c(RE)Defining the Goal: The True Path to Career Readiness in the 21st Century,\u201d explains where the jobs are: \u201cThe true ratio of jobs in our economy is 1:2:7. For every occupation that requires a master\u2019s degree or more, two professional jobs require a university degree, and there are over a half a dozen jobs requiring a 1-year certificate or a 2-year degree, and each of these technicians is in very high-skilled areas in high demand.\u201d Visit the local community colleges and find a marketable, technical certification that interests you. Hopefully you can pursue this full time. If your financial aid doesn\u2019t allow that, do your best and go part time. Earn that certification and get a better job. Now layer that certification and get an Associate\u2019s degree. Now you can get an even better job with an employer who has a tuition benefit, which could allow you to continue your education for free. I live two miles from a community college. One of my favorite programs there leads to an Associate\u2019s Degree certifying graduates to install and maintain robots. The maximum cost to earn this degree would be $10,000 however some of the classes are free\u2014government grants. The jobs are full time with benefits--$25/hour. There is one serious problem\u2014very little interest. The class sizes run 3-4 students. Potential employers are \u201ctearing their hair out.\u201d They can\u2019t fill their jobs. There is a mechatronics program at Gateway Community and Technical College in Northern Kentucky. The technology is incredible. The state and local industries have invested millions. They have the capacity to train 200. They graduated 27 students last spring\u2014no interest. Local industries are not happy. PS Here are two more ideas of how to get a good job without four years of college: Apprenticeships This avenue is very well developed in Europe. In the US you are going to have to do some digging to find the opportunities. Apprenticeship in Ohio Based on 2015 data the average salary for an elevator technician (five year apprenticeship) is $77K. You could be making $77K at age 23 with no student debt. Your biggest problem in life would be paying huge amounts of Federal income tax. Thomas B Walsh's answer to How do I become a plumber? Visit your local John Deere dealer. They offer apprenticeships for technicians. On-the-job-training There are opportunities out there for on-the-job-training. Here\u2019s the best one I have found: Ophthalmology I had to have a couple eye surgeries two years ago. My ophthalmologist hires young people off the street and pays them while they learn and get certified. There are three levels of certification\u2014the highest paying $70K. I talked to a lot of these young folks as a patient. They just didn\u2019t seem that ambitious. The opportunity is there, but they don\u2019t seem that interested about moving up. ",

            "answer_text": "OK, so the truth of the matter is that an AAS degree in an in-demand field (like medical imaging) is much more valuable than an AS or AA. However, not all jobs that require AAS degrees have much demand; I had a student with an AAS in engineering technology who couldn\u2019t find work\u2026 so he went back to school for a BS in CS, and found that almost nothing transferred, as it would have if he had an AA or AS. Principally, these degrees are for transfer prep, but many students stop at the associate\u2019s degree either temporarily or permanently. Take a look at these data:  Unemployment rates and earnings by educational attainment Sure, the associate\u2019s degree salaries are pushed up by careers like medical imaging, and the difference between an associate\u2019s degree and a bachelor\u2019s degree is larger than that between a high school diploma and an associate\u2019s degree, but ~$120 more per week is equivalent to ~$6,000 per year. Not too shabby. Just be cautious; many people frame transferring to a four-year school as being easy, but in some heavily sequenced majors, you may spend many more years in school than you expected.
