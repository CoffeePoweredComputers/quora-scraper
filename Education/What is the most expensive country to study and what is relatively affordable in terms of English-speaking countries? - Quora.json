            "answer_text": "It actually does depends on so many things like your course, the value of the degree, opportunities in that country etc. I did my own fair share of research before deciding UK as my choice. I'll be talking about masters here. So in terms of tuition fees and living costs etc, I'd vote Australia as the most expensive destination to study among the Anglophone countries. You need to shell out at least  $ 35,000 in total. Masters in Australia is usually  2 years. The only good thing about Australia is that they're ready to give you 2 years work permit to look for jobs. The next guy in the list is United States which is expensive as well. I'm pretty sure it costs atleast $26000 to study in an average university in the US. If you're trying for the IVY league, forget about them unless you've got scholarship or you've got deep pockets. Even US gives you job opportunities for 2 years perhaps. Even Canada costs pretty much the same, but their pathway to PR is easy. The next in the list is UK. Masters is 1 year, no need of GRE( Required for US and Canada depending on your course), so the fees are somewhat cheaper. Expect to pay anywhere between \u00a38000 to \u00a314000 depending on the university. British and the American universities are highly reputed compared to others. But the best bet according to me is studying in continental Europe in countries like Netherlands/Germany/Sweden where the fees are low(sometimes even free) and they have courses offered in English. These universities are also highly reputed. I didn't go for Europe because not all of them had the course of my choice. It depends on you. ",
