            "answer_text": "It totally depends upon course to course generally under grad courses start like BCOM (H) , BBA , Journalism etc start from first week of August. It also depends upon the counselling for ex if you get admission through first counselling then your session will start from first week of August if you get admission in 2 nd counselling then your session will start from some where in September but that doesn't effect the examination part. Also there is an advantage for first counselling people as they can even change their college after taking admission in the first counselling process. If they are getting better college in 2 nd counselling process. But also there is a condition that once you withdraw from a college you won't be able to apply for it again. I hope this helps. ",

And of u r getting selected in 2nd or Spot Counselling then it might extend till September 2nd week. But the date of admission doesn't affect the examination dates, if end session are to be held in December they will be conducted then only. I hope my answer was satisfactory. Thanks ",
