            "answer_text": "Online courses have become an undeniably famous learning alternative for undergrads. Almost 1 out of 3 understudies in the United States take classes on the web, and more than 3 million are taken a crack at solely online projects, as per the National Center for Education Statistics.  Notwithstanding, another paper named \"Does Online Education Live Up to Its Promise? A Look at the Evidence and Implications for Federal Policy\" contends that understudies joined up with online classes have lower reviews and bombed classes in higher numbers than understudies taking customary eye to eye courses. The paper, composed by George Mason University teacher Spiros Protopsaltis and Urban Institute individual Sandy Baum, proposes that online courses are perhaps less useful to understudies, particularly those with more vulnerable scholastic foundations, than conventional courses. The creators utilized different public investigations to break down the scholarly achievement paces of online understudies across different areas of advanced education, including junior college and four-year, for-benefit online projects. One investigation from the Washington State Community College System assessed information from more than 51,000 understudies at 34 junior colleges and specialized schools and presumed that understudies joined up with online courses were less inclined to finish a degree than the individuals who took less online courses. Also, male understudies and dark understudies especially battled in online courses, as per the examination. At four-year, revenue driven schools, taking an online course diminished the likelihood of an understudy getting An evaluation in the class by more than 12 percent, as per a 2017 paper distributed in the American Economic Review and highlighted in this examination. Understudies taking on the web courses were likewise more probable than understudies took a crack at face to face classes to drop out of school. Baum and Protopsaltis recommend that the possible entanglement in online instruction is the absence of up close and personal cooperation among understudies and instructors. In-person correspondence is natural for rousing and helping understudies see course material, as per the paper. The creators additionally contends that the outcomes gathered from the different examinations show the requirement for better guideline on online training and online organizations. Online courses should require more inventive eye to eye connection among teachers and understudies so as to decrease helpless understudy results that accompany an exorbitant cost tag.

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I think online classes are causing students to get lower grades. But it makes sense because: It\u2019s pretty hard to focus on a computer screen when it\u2019s something you don\u2019t normally enjoy anyway. Especially since you can be distracted and the teacher can\u2019t even tell you to focus.You also don\u2019t really feel motivated to do your work. You just feel lazy, being at home doing work on a computer.So yes, online school is causing poorer grades, but it isn\u2019t the teachers\u2019 fault. Most kids have a short attention span anyway and school isn\u2019t something entertaining. I know lots of people that were A students or had pretty good grades who now have low grades or are even failing. I\u2019ve always been an A/B student with mostly A\u2019s, but ever since online started I\u2019ve been getting B\u2019s more often. But yeah, online is hard. This whole pandemic situation is complicated. But all we can do is wear our masks and hope it\u2019s over soon\u2026 Jada :) ",

            "answer_text": "Good Evening, To answer your question, Yes, they are causing poorer grades in online classes as the online classes are not that effective and it doesn\u2019t give you the study vibe. And because of poor internet connection or any mechanical problem, they would miss their classes and also it would interrupt the online classes. Because of online classes, students don\u2019t take the responsibility to do their work properly. Being in the house for more than 3 or 4 months it would give them the feeling of being lazy and they would face some problems. And also because of being lazy, they would refuse to study and end up doing everything in the last min. Corona has changed the whole world and now it\u2019s ruling the world. Let's hope that The CORONA VIRUS should go and bring back the world to normal. Thank you. ",
