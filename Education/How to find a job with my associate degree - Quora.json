For example the CC close to my home in the suburbs has a robotics program. Many of the classes are free\u2014government grants. The class size is 3\u20134 students. (All the \u201csmart kids\u201d are taking The History of Rock and Roll at a four year college downtown. Their job expectation is making lattes.) I forgot the good part. Many of the prospective employers have a tuition benefit. You could complete your bachelor\u2019s degree for free. This is not glamorous. There is no football team. It is definitely not cool. It is just low risk and affordable. BUT three or four years from now you will be driving in your (used) Lexis with your hot girlfriend to the airport to fly to the College National Championship game at some warm location. Your old high school buddies will be working at a part time job at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods for $8.50/hour trying to figure out how to pay off their student loans. (You don\u2019t like robots? I have a better opportunity at a CC in northern Kentucky.) The idea that you need a degree from a four year college to get a decent job is a &&^%* myth. There is a HUGE mismatch between the skills obtained at a four year college and the skills required at many of the well-paying jobs available in today\u2019s economy. CC\u2019s are filling that gap.

            "answer_text": "It depends on which industry you're going into and how big your ambitions are. If you have excellent transferable skills (e.g. communication [written and verbal], relationship management, attention to detail, etc.), you could land a \u201cgood\u201d entry-level job. If you want stability and just want to stay in the same spot, you can work hard to get incremental salary increases or move into a better paying position afterward a longer period of time. You'd be considered a strong & steady performer, but staying in an entry-level role for more than 4+ years would raise some eyebrows if you ever become unemployed. If you are looking to get a leadership role in the future, an associate\u2019s degree will not suffice in most companies\u2026unless you\u2019re an anomaly like the 20/30-something year olds running billion dollar companies. However, if you are fortunate, you could complete an associate\u2019s degree and then find a job at a company with excellent benefits who can pay for you to complete another degree. If the cost of education means you can really only afford a 2-year degree, spend those years wisely and build your network, whether that be speaking to your professors regularly and asking them to introduce you to people in the industry, building a strong LinkedIn profile and meeting people you admire for coffee, etc. P.S. If your communication and relationship skills aren't very good, you will REALLY need to figure that out and hone those to succeed in the long run. Good luck :) ",

James made a great point in that if you get an associate\u2019s in a technical field, you do have a better chance. For a lot of jobs, a master\u2019s is the new bachelor\u2019s. I have two associates, a bachelors and a masters and the student loans to prove every step of the way. But even with a masters it\u2019s hard to get jobs. The biggest paradox is of course the experience paradox. Where you can\u2019t get a job without an experience and you can\u2019t get experience without a job. If you\u2019re not getting an associates in a technical field, then you need to focus on a bachelors. I would suggest, if you can afford it, doing some unpaid internships in your desired field. That will help you get your some experience but also a deeper understanding of the necessary qualifications for that field. BUT and there is always a BUT, you should also just ignore me and anyone else and just apply for jobs. You might find a great gig with your associates. You won\u2019t know until you try. Just be sure to have a backup for if it doesn\u2019t work. ",

But if you plan to transfer sooner than later, a full AS degree is better.You can also get business-related degrees. Some pay as well as four-year degrees (English majors don't get paid as well as many people who work in a skilled trade). Here are some related answers that went into some detail on the advantages and benefits of an AS degree. Is an associate's degree in engineering worth anything?Should trade schools be promoted as much as four year colleges?Why is community college stigmatized? My parents\u2019 friends, who are decent people, think I'm a failure for attending community college. What's honestly wrong with community college?",

Sometimes we even forget the companies we had sent it out to and then one of them calls for an interview and we have to actually go and research what that company does. Out of about 50 applications, we would get about 3-4 calls for an interview. Of course, you need to read requirements for he job and then apply.
