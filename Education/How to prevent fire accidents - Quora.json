            "answer_text": "You could prevent fire accidents by being proactive. Beginning with the end in mind is important. Space Design - Space to be designed to adhere to all the safety norms, easy accessibility, multiple egress paths, well defined assembly point.Fire Detection System - Having a good fire detection system will help with early warning and also preventing any possible fire. It will also let the staff know when to evacuate reducing possible cause for injury or accident incase of a fire.Fire Suppression & Extinguishing System - Having fire suppression like Halon, FM 200 & extinguishing systems like Hydrants & sprinklers help in putting off or fighting the fire if it does occur. Most systems are automatic and can douse the fire with minimal human intervention.Regular Safety Checks - Having regular checks of the space to ensure pathways are clear, there are no unwanted material is stored, lose connections are addressed & inflammable material are immediately removed helps prevent occurrence of fire. A periodic check of equipment helps ensure all run optimally and reduce the chances of a fire.Training - Regular training in safety is important to reiterate the steps to follow while carrying out the work and reduce injury or accidents. It also increases awareness & improves response time incase of an emergency minimizing the impact.",

            "answer_text": "Fire needs three components to survive - fuel, heat, and oxygen. Remove any one of those three things and the fire will die out. Put water on it, smother it with a blanket or other item that will remove oxygen, or remove all fuel. There is also AFFF, which is very effective, and often used by firefighters on certain types of fires. Referred to as A triple F, it means aqueous film forming foam. It\u2019s water with additives usually made from animal by products, and it adheres to the fuel, cutting off the oxygen and cooling the heat. ",

But unfortunately, this part is often overlooked when constructing a house, office, shop, or any other building - walls of any structure are now more allied with IT security than physical safety. Here is a list of basic fire safety tips that can help prevent fire completely from the beginning: Do not smoke or not to allow smoking in your home, because smoking supplies, like lighters and cigarette butts, are the leading cause of home fire deaths.Do clean and repair of heating equipment like chimneys and heater filters, from time to time.Make sure to keep your belongings at least three feet away from flammable items such as heating elements or flamesEnsure not to leave candles unattended.",

The only way to control fire is to make sure that the fire is restricted to a certain area and the heat is used for the intended purpose only and not anything else. Most homes have a kitchen where food is prepared; the oven on which food is boiled, fried, or roasted, is designed in such a way that the fire heats up the bottom of the pot, pan, vessel, or kettle - and not spread throughout the house.  Controlled fire.

His reply is out-dated and dangerous under current knowledge. This is fairly recent, so he may not be aware of it. But, having been a ARFF back in the heyday of AFFF, and having used many gallons of it for firefighting and other things - like stripping wax off of the apparatus room floor - AFFF is a PFAS and a carcinogenic. Those of us who working in the Air Force (and other, particularly aircraft-related) fire departments over most of the past 50 years have probably been doused, washed by or in, or used AFFF. See: DOD Funds Firefighting Foam Research for a PFAS-Free Alternative for more information. ",
