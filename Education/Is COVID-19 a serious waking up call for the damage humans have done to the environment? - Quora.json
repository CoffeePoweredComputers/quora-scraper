            "answer_text": "I am not giving any open licence to human beings to perform unnatural activities and pollute this planet and the universe. The role of human activities in upsetting global order is very marginal. The most popular \u2018Evolution Theory\u2019 has it that: a part broke away from the Sun, which became earth; after millions of years of sunshine/heat and rains, earth cooled down; oceans and land came into being; life appeared; many catastrophe and calamities struck the earth; etc. Thus, catastrophe and calamities are NOT NEW to earth and universe, rather they are routine. Experts say that we are living during what will be later refered to as one of the largest extinction events in Earth's history. Earth has, during the pre-historic period, already undergone five mass extinctions (Big Five mass extinctions), viz. End Ordovician (444 million years ago), Late Devonian (375 million years ago), End Permian (251 million years ago), End Triassic (200 million years ago) and End Cretaceous (66 million years ago). Each of these mass extinctions took place over a period of around 50,000 years (500 centuries). Every creature takes birth (sprouts/ germinates) only when a suitable environmental condition is present and continue to lead a healthy life till such condition is available. This environmental conditions (especially for human beings) are (i) air, (ii) water, (iii) nutritious food (oral food and also inputs through other sensory organs); (iv) sunshine (sunlight & open body contact with surrounding environment). He should perform (v) locomotion (structured exercise or any other type of body movement), (vi) take adequate time for rest/sleep, (vii) maintain mental equilibrium (by self-education and logical thinking, etc.) and (viii) keep away from devitalizing agents like alcohol, stimulants, poisons, accident prone jobs/ activities, etc. Appearance of newer and newer species of creatures with superior qualities/ abilities from time to time is a reality \u2013 and their becoming extinct is also a reality. For that to happen, it is mandatory to have changes in the environmental conditions. The living beings has a peculiar characteristics/ phenomena in them, viz. life - which controls, directs & accomplishes the \u201clife processes\u201d of nutrition, self-growth, responding & adapting to (external) stimuli, self-repair/ maintenance/ renovation. When perpetual and radical changes occur on earth and in the universe, many species change and adapt themselves to such changes by externally changing the life style habits and intrinsically passing on the acquired wisdom as hereditary. Clear evidences show that many diseases of epidemic/ pandemic proportions could also be over-come by effective adaptations, over a period of time (generations); but immediate (medical/treatment) intervention had proved to be counter-productive in such cases and aided the mass extinction. Adaptation is an apparently designed feature of an organism evolved by natural selection over numerous generations to solve the problems of survival & reproduction faced by the organism\u2019s ancestors. Despite its limitations, it is a very useful and powerful tool by which creatures sustain the evolution process. Evolution and adaptations always remain a tough challenge and hard reality for the creatures on this earth, but that fact is, perhaps the ultimate guiding motive for changes & improvement for them. Those species which follow the rules of nature to the maximum possible extent can maintain better health and make better adaptations more aptly and suitably to over come the difficulties owing to catastrophe and calamities including the global warming/climate change. Following the rules of nature and adopting such a lifestyle would, certainly result into prolonging the mass extinction span. That would also reduce generation & emission of pollutants & toxins, thus making/ maintaining a lesser harmful/hostile environment. Researchers right now taking years to find vaccine and/or medicine, is part of their profession \u2013 finding a vaccine or remedy (medicine or other drugless applications) does not have bearing on human being (or any other spice) going extinct.
