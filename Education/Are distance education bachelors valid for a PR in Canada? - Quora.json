            "answer_text": "I dont think so.. Its valid because i applied transcript for my wife for her Masters distance education and it was not considered at all. However, it depends on what kind of course and which University you have done with. Better to obtain transcript and apply. But dont consider any score while calculating CRS. If you get few points, that will be a bonus. Hope this helps ! Nitin ",

It totally depends on which University did you pursue bachelors from, and where are you getting the ECA from. IQAS tends to be more lenient than WES. Get you ECA done and you\u2019ll have your answer. You won\u2019t be able to get a confirmation from anywhere else. Good Luck! ",
