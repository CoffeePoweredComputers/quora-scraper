            "answer_text": "It's not likely that you can - any discussion of homework would need a big push from parents to start it off. Are there any open-minded administrators at your school who have an open door policy for students? Without that a student cannot access the people who have the power to initiate change in the school. You - and/or the parents who support this discussion - might start by asking for a school website - on which all the evening's homework is required to be listed. Is there any school policy regarding homework? Usually not. An enlightened school would have policy about homework. How much is too much? Some schools say - 20 minutes per subject but don't enforce it in any way - and don't stop to calculate that 20 minutes per 7 subjects is 140 minutes - over two hours right there. Teachers should do their own homework - teachers' estimates of how long their homework takes is not based on any hands-on experience with the homework. Long-term projects can come from several subjects - at the same time and be due on the same day - and are often assigned on top of the nightly homework. It's not likely a school will stop giving homework - but if articulate parents take it up and make reasonable requests - a website and clear policies around homework - that could eventually happen. This book is worth reading - The Homework Myth - it summarizes the research on homework. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you a student, parent, or teacher? Are you sure it would be the best thing for everyone involved if the school stopped giving homework? Are you taking the long view or the short view? Are you motivated by what\u2019s good for you or by what feels good? Once you\u2019ve answered those questions, if you still want to change the school\u2019s policy on homework, you probably want to see if there are others who feel as you do, and you, as a group, make a proposal to the powers that be.

            "answer_text": "Talk to the school board, bring research that shows effectiveness of homework. Get other parents on board. Homework has an extremely low affect size for student achievement. To be useful teachers need effective and immediate feedback. Also they need to be prepared to be able to do it correctly while at home, otherwise they simply rehearse the wrong way to do it. Most schools homework policy is entrenched in the philosophical stance of the administration. The chances of you changing their mind is very low. ",

Maybe if you wrote 75 essays and titled them the Homeworkist Papers, defending a homework-less based doctrine? You would write in conjunction with the other two greatest writers at your school, but one would get sick and stop, while the other holds up his end barely. Meanwhile you write 51. Anybody see what I\u2019m getting at? No? Fine I\u2019ll go back to geeking out alone. ",

Its quite close to what will be expected of you in the workplace. Your homework is a direct representation of your pride in your work, your knowledge and understanding of your work and what you consider to be a good enough effort when you hand it in and say \u2018im done\u2019. It tells lots about you, how carefully you researched, presented, performed. If your homework is sloppy, what does that say about you? Its a reflection of you in many ways. It is a challenge. Are you one to shrink away from a challenge? ",
