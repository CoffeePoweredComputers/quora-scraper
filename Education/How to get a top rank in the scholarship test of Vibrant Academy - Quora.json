Questions are not going to be a part of syllabus that you have studied till now , I'm not including people who have already done foundation courses. Only you are going to get batches on basis of your performance in ent.exam which you can easily upgrade in your 1st reshuffling test,if you work well. Now even if you care for exam then try to solve \u2018foundation books for IIT' and some mental ability problems which will definately help you. Bit of advice in addition , don't bother yourself much about ent.exam becoz its just a part of formality,focus on how to carry yourself for 1\u20132years in kota . That's it Stay calm, Good Bye. ",
