            "answer_text": "From high school through senior year of college, I continuously applied for scholarships. Here's how I found scholarships: 1. Scholarships in your community: Google for scholarships in your community (for example, I'm from Boulder, Colorado. I searched \"Scholarships in Boulder Colorado\" and \"Scholarships in Denver.\"). Your local bank branch may have a scholarship fund.2. Gender/ethnicity-specific scholarships: The Hispanic Scholarship Fund (Hispanic Scholarship Fund) is one of the best examples for sites that gather ethnicity-specific scholarships. 3. Your college: Many of the scholarships I received happened after I got into college. I went to the financial aid/scholarship page and applied to every scholarship I qualified for. 4. Degree-specific scholarships: I was a recipient of the Financial Executives International's scholarship, which was open for students studying business. I specifically searched for scholarships that were aimed towards business students. Googling \"scholarship for psychology students\" may come up with good results.5. Pageants: If you're a woman, pageants are a fun way to earn scholarship money. Here are two that I had a great experience with: Distinguished Young Women (Distinguished Young Women) scholarship. I won over $5,000 in scholarships + lots of free stuff.Miss America (Miss America : Welcome): I won several thousand dollars from the program.Bottom LineThe scholarships that I had the most success receiving were very specific or local to me. Many of the scholarships I applied for and won were not well-publicized or well-known. I had to really dig for them! I never had any success in receiving scholarships from those publicized on those major scholarship sites or scholarships that were very general/everyone qualifies for. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are a ton of scholarship websites out there and it\u2019s hard to know which ones are legit and which are well-cloaked scams. So, I put together a list of websites I\u2019ve personally used and vetted (mostly as a recent grad student). Below is a list of my favorites: 1. JLV College Consulting (Best for Grad Students) JLV College Consulting is the top pick on this list. The site is updated frequently and has tons of different types of scholarships featured. A great part about the website is that in addition to grouping the 1000s of scholarships it features by category (minority, international, athlete), it also lists scholarships by (monthly) deadline, which helps applicants stay organized. This site is useful for a variety of potential recipients including grad students, undergrads, and international students. JLV College Consulting is run by the founder, Jessica, who has over ten years of experience in higher education and has served as an admission officer and director. 2. Fastweb Fastweb hosts more than 1.5 million scholarships and boasts having $3.4 billion in funding available to students. To access scholarships, users must create a profile through which the site helps you find scholarship matches. Maintaining a profile also allows you to organize and build a list of scholarships through Fastweb, and track which scholarships you\u2019re not interested and which you have already completed. The site also features a database of helpful articles that walks you through the college admissions process as well as a page with \u201cdeals\u201d from companies like Dell, Spotify, and Tom\u2019s that are only available to college students. 3. Scholarships.com Scholarships(dot)com hosts one of the largest scholarship databases out there and is updated on a daily basis. According to the site, Scholarships.com has over 2.7 million scholarship and grant opportunities worth more than $19 billion available to students to apply for. Users can browse scholarships by category, or make a personal profile, which will help you find the opportunities that are the closest match. 4. Scholars4dev (Best for International Students) Scholars4dev, short for Scholarships for Development, is an updated listing of international scholarships specifically for people from developing countries, people who would like to pursue development-related fields, and people who seek global and national development through further education. You can subscribe to the scholars4dev bi-weekly newsletter to get updates on the latest scholarship listings and tips on how to complete scholarship applications. 5. Alpha Kappa Alpha Educational Foundation (Great for Minority Students) The Alpha Kappa Alpha Educational Advancement Foundation, or EAF, is the philanthropic arm of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc, an organization founded in 1908 as means to create a support network for Black women. EAF\u2019s mission is to support lifelong learning by providing scholarships, fellowships, and community grants. The deadline for EAF funding applications is April 15 of each year for undergraduate students, and August 15th for graduate students and community assistance grants. Endowed scholarships maintain a rolling deadline. In 2016, the EAF distributed over $500,000 to over 3000 undergrads and grad students to attend colleges, including HBCUs. And while the AKA Sorority, Inc was founded as an organization to support Black women, the EAF provides funding for students regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. 6. Human Rights Commission (Great for LGBTQ Students and Allies) The Human Rights Commission, or HRC, is the nation\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights organization, and maintains a list of scholarships, fellowships, and grants for LGBTQ and allied students at both the undergraduate and graduate level. HRC\u2019s scholarships list allows users to find scholarships by state and school, making it easier for users to find funding opportunities that are a close match. ",
