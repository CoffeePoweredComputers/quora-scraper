            "answer_text": "History is a great topic for the aspiring journalist, because you learn a lot of valuable skills and knowledge, as well as being aware of context when you report on the world around you. Studying history allows you to practice analysing primary sources, reference correctly, have an awareness of significance, develop empathy, critically evaluating various perspectives, the ability to problem solve and so much more. Also you learn how to construct an argument. All these are valuable assets for a journalist. To be a serious practitioner of your craft, you have to be a life-long learner and an omnivorous reader. But the number one trait to be a journalist is curiosity! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are asking about what you should study in university, the best answer is: Any field that you find fascinating (not sort of interesting) and that is characterised by intellectual rigor in research. Look at your professors as people who add to the public record, and study their mehods of research. (Which is usually a lot more fun than scholarly writing, which with rare exceptions can be greatly improved. Yes, I\u2019ve done that too.) The rest of the answer depends on what kind of journalist you want to be. At different times you will need different technical skills. The most important are reading, observattion and writing: You need to be good at all of them, and you will need to study the practitioners you admire to understand their techniques. You also need to develop visual skills, even if you are mainly a writer. I don\u2019t mean that you must become a great photographer, sound recorder or videographer, just that you need adequate skills if you have no one to do it with you. In terms of subjects, I strongly advise that you first decide what areas of life and activity you find interesting. This will change over time, and it will change as you become fascinated by different people and what they do. Learn the history of their work and their field so you can speak with them on a more equal basis. In a general sense, every journalistt should have a working knowledge of libel law, and the law and economics of the sectors in which they work, including legislation and regulation. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to work in sectors you care about. Otherwise you will feel bored and overwhelmed. Do all journalists do this? No. The great ones do, however. Study the great ones and ask yourself how they achieved their results. Thus you will develop a toolkit. Hope that helps and good luck. ",
