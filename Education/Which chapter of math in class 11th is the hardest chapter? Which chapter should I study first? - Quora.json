Now I want to tell about whole 11 book- chapters. Sets, Relation and function:- They are quite easy chapter. Also remember set has high weight age.Trigonometry:- It is quite lengthy and tough chapter lots of identity to rember and have high weight age.PMI has two of three type question.5- 8 chapter need practise but they are quite easy.9 -10 chapter are quite lengthy and lots of efforts are required to make them easy .11-12 quite easy.13 - Efforts are required to understand the chapter then it is quite easy chapter.14-16 chapter are easy only lots of calculation are involed in chapter 15.All the best for 1 1 maths work hard for understanding the concepts and if you had any problem then contact me I will help you.

            "answer_text": "You know start with Relations and Functions. Then proceed with intermediate chapters like Trigonometric Functions and their Graphs. I personally am referring to Rd Sharma as prescribed by our school,and to say honestly the grouping of trigonometry chap. Into sum and difference of angles,transformation formulae really helps to differentiate between the subclasses of the sums. Then as the trigonometry equations ends,(not in 2020 syllabus),proceed straight to complex numbers and linear inequations with special focus on wavy curves.This few chapters must be completed fast,within a span of a month or less. One should then either adopt one of the two techniques,depending on your supplementary classes for jee or any other: 1.Start Straight Line and Circle iff the sup. Class touches it or is gonna start. 2.Start AP and Gp and n,n^2,n^3,method of differences iff the sup. Classes is gonna start it. Believe me it is gonna be non synchronous if staright lines & circle and algebra is done in both places. However,if you are not enrolled for any supp classes: 1.Start Straight line and circles first, and make time for seeing different ap gp sums each day.I think Hp is not there in cbse curricula. 2.Conversely,you can also start ap and gp chapters, and go through your class 10 straight line if you are from icse,believe me it will help a lot. Lastly touch the conics and permutation and combination for the ends.Keeping enough time for probability after p and c. Conics is very simplified in CBSE curricula especially for ellipse and parabola.So,I guess wont be an issue. For IAT aspirants,I suggest going through Complex numbers thoroughly and also through Theory of Equations,under quadrtic expressions. Pls dont leave out the chapters that are not there in 2020 due to pandemic,like binomial theorem and mathematical induction. Binomial theorem is used in nook and corner of physics and also in deriving expressions of gravity at an altitude of h height above or d depth below thr http://ground.So the expansion may be spontaneously required. Try some sums out often from those two. About Class 12,perhaps it would be in other answers of mine. Thank you and stay nice everyone. P.s-many chap. I did not specify,they should be done in as per your school sequence. ",
