            "answer_text": "As of with work ethic So far this is the case, and it\u2019s usually the case so far. That doesn\u2019t mean it happens all the time and it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to change it. Procrastination, or choosing not to do the work. Trouble attending to studying for even a minute, or choosing not to attend to it. Avoiding studying, and choosing not to listen to lectures. Not putting in sufficient effort towards studying or learning. Relying too much on other peoples help or other people working on something with me. As of with Learning Doesn\u2019t happen all the time and only talking about what happened so far. It also varies form subject to subject, concept to concept, unit to unit. In fact, stuff listed actually only happens rarely. But it happens often enough for me to list it( even if it only happens rarely). It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen again in the future, or tommorow. Trouble transferring information from short term store to long term store. Trouble grasping certain concepts or picking the information up from the textbook. Trouble retaining or understanding information from lectures. Trouble with abstract thinking or problem solving. Not getting the information to stick very well. As of with motivation As with external motivation, I mean caring about it for some reason or the other. I do care about it somewhat, but not enough to say that I\u2019m motivated. Also not enough to make me feel that I care. So far, external motivation doesn\u2019t come to me, especially when it comes to academics. I rely on just doing it, even if I have no reason to do it at all or I don\u2019t feel that I care about academics. . So far I was in the Junior year of high school; I literally did not learn anything well Freshman year or Sophomore year. In fact, I actually did not actually learn anything at all. Although Freshman year I got mostly A\u2019s and Sophomore year I got mostly B\u2019s. My grades are getting worse and worse over years and the comments from my teachers in general are getting worse and worse. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to turn around. All of the reason\u2019t listed above correspond to the reason why I\u2019m in the bottom half of my school in terms of learning and performance. But the biggest reason is my lack of sufficient effort; all the other reasons are negligible. ",

            "answer_text": "Biggest Weakness. I do say my inability to memorize. I used to go over the text. I used to solve problems. I understood them perfectly at that time but I never bothered to commit these to my memory. Whatever one may say, you cannot derive all results at all time. You cannot derive a result you don\u2019t even remember properly. You may remember something like this was something but you can be never be sure. Memorization helps us in gaining familiarity and gain a better understanding of the small but not so trivial details. When you get familiar with the contents you are able to score better in exams and understand more advanced content with ease. It\u2019s just like the alphabets or the multiplication table. You cannot always refer to a table for writing down new words or multiplying small numbers. Something must be committed to the brain. When one thinks and tries to find out a new problem (in general life as well, not related to academics only) one starts of from something he knows about. It opens new avenues for you to develop your solutions along. You cannot think about those things you don\u2019t know about. You can not pin down on a \u201csmall trivial looking detail\u201d if you no clue about it\u2019s existence. For example, a shoulder pain may mean nothing significant for a non-medical professional but for a medic it maybe a danger signs for heart related issues. The single reason he was able to think along these lines was because he \u201cknew\u201d about them. One can say that one need not memorize, he will eventually get the hang of it through experience. That\u2019s true but it will take a lot of time to accumulate such experiences. Nothing beats experience but having gained more familiarity with it will certainly help his case and will entrench the thing firmly in his memory. Remembering, something exactly can mean a life and death situation for a surgeon in an operation theater. Though, normal life won\u2019t be so challenging but I hope I make a point. I am not propagating rote learning neither are memorization and understanding the same thing. Thinking is crucial, it distinguishes us as human. But you cannot think about something you are not familiar with. Memorizing is just the first step to gain familiarity which in turn establishes a solid foundation for further interaction with the content. Memorization will just ease and shorten the process for a better understanding. It can be a pain to memorize (even for a pro) but repeated problem solving and further engagement with the content will make it part of your memory and just like the multiplication table, you can recall them with ease. A straight forward example from a +2 student life, if you are not thorough with mechanics, it certainly will be a pain later. As, you will have to refer or derive the results for specific trajectories in other Physics Courses. Same applies for integration and differentiation. One need not memorize everything but on the other hand should not desist from memorizing things that are required to be committed to memory. How much should you commit to memory and how much you can derive from that knowledge is entirely up to you. This will improve your understanding of the subject matter, boost your confidence and certainly your grades. ",
