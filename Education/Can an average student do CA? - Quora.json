            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Sanchit Khandelwal I am writing an answer after a very long time after CA final results and I am really sorry for not replying to all your messages and your A2A\u2019s as I was very much occupied studying for interviews and giving them. Sorry again. Now, the entry level to CA requires you to pass in 12th and if you are planning to pursue after graduation too, there is minimum percentage criteria for Commerce and Non-Commerce graduates who can directly enter into CA intermediate. So usually everyone is eligible for CA. I have been an average student all my life. So, I think I can help you with this. I had scored just a little above 80% in my 10th and in 12th. So, you can figure out that I definitely wasn\u2019t a very bright student. I managed to do just okay ! Now, what you do in these 5 years post entering into CA course is of utmost importance. For an average student like me I did have to take a lot of efforts and hardwork consistently throughout these years. You will meet different kinds of people during your CA journey. Someone being talented throughout, but unable to clear, someone just average but managing to clear, someone addicted to the social media but even then being talented they aren\u2019t able to clear. I would like to give some advice to all the CA aspirants that I learned through my mistakes made during my journey. Identify your weakness:I used a basic blackberry phone for 5 years. I know its hard to believe but I have done it. People thing that\u2019s too much but I have my reasons. There are people I know so talented but being on social media and still passing throughout in 1st attempt and securing ranks too. Hands down, they are amazing. Back in 11th std I was an addict to facebook and whatsapp. I knew that getting out of this addiction was very important before I started with my CA journey. After a lot of guidance and counselling from my family and teachers. I achieved it. Gave up all my social media handles. In this millennial generation which is so much dominated by social media, you can say, I have been sober for 5 years now. Even now, after one month of results I still am not there on facebook or instagram. But, yes, I will soon be there too. Now, as my mom puts it, I deserve a little fun too :) 2. Optimistic Outlook: Anything that you do, always be positive about it. Trust me, it helps a lot ! Always know that the glass is half full. I have never been entirely sure after giving exams at all three levels that I will pass. Why ? Because I failed in believing myself and that I can make it through. This attitude of mine did not help me. How much ever positivity my family gave me, I could only keep worrying until the result actually came. This happens with all. Try and be positive during studies and don\u2019t worry about the outcome. 3. Know your Priorities: Firstly to all my friends who I met just once a year, thanks for understanding and supporting in my journey. This might happen when you quit media for a long time, everyone will ask you \u201cAb contact kaise rakhenge\u201d If they really are your friends and they want to be with you they will always call you or come to meet you personally. My priority was set. Becoming a CA at the age of 21. That\u2019s it. I prioritized anything and everything that came my way. My family and studies were only on my mind ! In crux, I just want to tell you all, irrespective of being average/below or above average, Just believe in yourself, work towards your aim and rest will follow !

            "answer_text": "Certainly!  I am a CA final student And in my opinion, Average Students do it easier than people of high intelligence. Because when someone possesses high intellectual abilities, he/she is in habit of questioning everything he reads or is told. That kind of habits will irritate you all through CA journey. Because when you pay attention to what and why you're being taught something, a lot of material in CA course(not all of it, some of it is pretty good in building superb understanding about the subject) is outdated, vague, impractical in real world and a lot of suggested answers by institute to exam questions don't make sense at all.  But thats not all it, Let's say you fail in some exam(Just saying), you will naturally want to know what mistakes did you make while writing the exam. So you'll request the certified copies of your answersheet and  when you see your answer matches word to word with the answer in the institute provided material and you are still rewarded a zero. Then after a little banging your head in the wall, you further read your answersheet. Then you see they haven't even counted the marks right(even when you applied for both revaluation and certified copies for the subject, and what you're holding in your hands is supposed to be a \"revalued answersheet\"), you do more banging, you know why, even though its plain careless of them and ICAI doesn't give a shit even when its your life and career is on stake, you still cannot challenge them in court. Because they get you signed an agreement while you request for certified copies and revaluation that says you accept whatever marks institute awards you as final and restricts you from going to court. So in this case a person who is in habit of being good at academics being rewarded good marks for the answers he writes in the exam and thinks \"right answers=good marks\" will simply break down. He shall be puzzled, angry and maybe depressed also because his his basic founding assumption about the exam that exam is just a way of testing your knowledge, will simply be attacked.  On the other hand an average student who is used to getting average or less than average marks, is simply okay with failing and knows from experience that life simply is not fair and he will better understand that the best thing to do is just go on.   So CA exams and answer sheet evaluation system of ICAI is so careless, stupid, oblivious and unheeding about the amount of academic intelligence that you posess that it really doesnt matter whether you are an average or above Average student or anything of the sort. Its just like firing in the sky in night time, someone may hit the bird in the first time(plain luck), others will have to be persistent and keep trying! So of you're are clear that CA is the only way you see for reaching where ever you want to reach(be clear about the area you want to work, cause they're are many and they require different courses of action), Just go for it. How good were you at studies previously is no deciding factor and in fact, its it is out if equation when it comes to passing CA exams. Your principle( in articleship period) shall anyway throw whatever image you carry of yourself as a student out of the window :p.  So you can do it, but make sure if you're determined to do it. :)  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, who is average, who is not, this can be decided only after the exams, right? Isn\u2019t that the reason why we have exams in the first place? Reminds me of the lines from the famous movie \u20183 Idiots\u2019, \u201cConfusion hi confusion hai, solution kuch pata nahi. Solution jo mila jo saala, question ka kuch pata nahi\u201d (There is so much confusion as we don\u2019t know the solution yet. And when we discovered the solution, we forgot the question itself.)  In today\u2019s world, we think so much ahead of what is required that we often tend to forget the very purpose for which we are doing things. It\u2019s like we are all on some autopilot mode or lost in a vicious circle. The exam itself is a filter to decide who is average and who is good enough. Exams exist to allow only the apt ones to get through and pursue the benefits of those exams. Again, failing doesn\u2019t mean you are an average person, it means you are average only in that particular field of work or knowledge. It\u2019s been three years into student counselling for me and believe me, one of the most difficult situations that I face regularly is to explain to the students how they are wrongly choosing their career based on their marks in the past rather than their choice for the future. Decide whether you want to pursue a Career as a Chartered Accountant or not and then bring in the required efforts if you wish to be. Don\u2019t think about marks in the past and rank yourself whether eligible or not. This is not a Government scheme where you need to be eligible. You are eligible for, the very moment you choose to. With better efforts, you can always do better in exams than your performance in the past. It is more about the field of study whether it keeps your interest and the will power to achieve it, rather than being an average or a low-grade student. I have seen many outstanding students at school level who have consistently failed in CA exams and many average students succeeding in the same. Conclusion You decide your interests and your career. Let the exams decide your mean, median and mode. ",

Unlike other opinions. my opinion is chance for success to average or below average person in ca course is less than 50%.to make it 70% or above you have to do lot of hard work and you nshould know your strengths and weaknesses. Coming to my details I completed CA recently.if anybody ask me whether it is easy for doing ca course for average students or for below average students. I can tell(since I am also an avg student in my school days) it's very difficult thing. Here,you have to face many challenges specially you should build confidence yourself and when you are entering into ca journey most of the people may suggest or may come to opinion that you won't complete ca. so,from starting of ca course to till completion you should have self confidence. it plays crucial role in your success.while you perusing you may face many criticisms and disappointments and corporate politics because of your struggling and some people may do fun on your strugglings. So,be prepare for all challenges and you alone should fight for your ultimate goal .no body will stay with you when your in failure side and also if you fail in one attempt you have to study with your juniors and your juniors become your batch mates and they may clear earlier than you and they may become your seniors and when years passing without success some times you may get fear that you took wrong decision by joining into ca and you may feel inside that whether to quite or continue ca course. so if you want to clear ca course be prepare your self to face these challenges\u2026\u2026but believe me if your ready to face all these challanges and ready to give your 100% efforts towards goal you will clear Ca definitely.

Tough and easy are all mind games if you can control your mind then for you my friend nothing is tough in this whole world . A good student , an average student and a below average student they all are human beings after all, the only difference between these three are the mindset they carry , their approach towards their studies. The good student always thinks of scoring good marks and he/she works for the same with a plan in their mind. An average student too thinks of scoring good marks but he/she fails to plan and finally they end up scoring average marks. A below average student always thinks about passing and sometimes they succeed but sometimes they fail too . So its our thinking that controls us if you can aim high and plan accordingly then anyone can do anything they want to. The only eligiblity for pursuing CA is that one should have passed his/her higher secondary examination. So , a good student, an average student and a bleow average student,all three are eligible for becoming a \u201cChartered Accountant\u201d. The only thing that matters is our mindset and our thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "As being an average student i think i am a right person to comment upon this: In class 10th I had scored only 80 % and in 12th only 70% marks.After 12th exam immediately i had started for preparation of CA - CPT by self and cleared it in 1st attempt.Then i started preparing for intermediate group 1 and then I got failed in May 2018 and everyone criticized that you cleared cpt with luck and a person also said ki y 70 percent wale ca exams pass karenge. At that time I didn\u2019t cared much about them.In NOV -18 i passed CA INTER Group 2 and in MAY-19 CA INTER Group 1.Basically you consider yourself as an average student only because you are happy with whatever you have and it\u2019s a point of comfort zone where one seems to be direction less. We should always have a can do attitude with an appropriate plan . Personal Insight : When i first started reading Income Tax Act till 2 to 3 revision i was not even able to come to right solution to a problem but i took that subject as a challenge and targeted a exemption in it and got it in reality too . There is a idiom in Sanskrit : \u2018\u0915\u0930\u0924 -\u0915\u0930\u0924 \u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u091c\u0921\u093c\u092e\u0924\u093f \u0939\u094b\u0924 \u0938\u0941\u091c\u093e\u0928\u0964 Thanks Regards : Ansh Gupta ",

Is it possible for a paralyzed boy to become a Yog Guru? -We have witnessed the rise of Baba Ramdev. Is it possible for a agriculturists to become a CEO of Software company? But Jyothi Reddy made it possible. So at the end we can see, if we want to conquer something big then we have to build up courage and determination. Anyone can do whatever they want to do, but finally it depends on their emotions and determination behind their goals. And once you are part of this process you no longer an average student.

            "answer_text": "CA is not for candidates who are not ready for relentless pursuit. Whether you are a topper in your school or back bencher, does not make any difference, provided you are passionate about becoming a Chartered Accountant, and are ready to relentlessly pursue the same till the Goal of becoming a Chartered Accountant is achieved. I have seen average student at a school getting All India rank in CA, and topper in the school failing in CA! The difference comes in the strength of your pursuit and good practical exposure. Kindly note that your studies for CA and your article ship are complementary. Unlike schools and colleges, where you are tested on your knowledge, a professional course like CA tests your application of mind. This is precisely where a budding Chartered Accountant with very good exposure in his article ship scores ahead. He gets trained on real time issues, which helps him to clear his CA examinations relatively easier. Similarly, his studies for CA examinations facilitates him to perform better in article ship. In this process, you will realize the synergy benefits of in depth knowledge and practical application of the same, between your CA studies and practical training under article ship. ",

Conclusion- 1 Never bring thought in your mind that you are Average - This will really make you Average. 2 Build Confidence- Everyday write in a copy 10-times that I am intelligent. 3 Never keep option to quit open.

If a so called ordinary average student put extra ordinary efforts then yes even he can crack CA. There is no big deal in Cracking CA if you are ready to give your 100 percent. I know live example of a girl who was not so good in studies. As you said she was an average student but one day she vowed that she want to crack CA. She put all the efforts she can. One and half year of hard work and burning mid night oil, she managed to achieve her dream. She Cracked all modules. After completing her article ship she finally got herself enrolled as CA. So even a average student can crack CA. Regards Dhruv Garg, Advocate ",

No students is average or brilliant it's matter that average students put average efforts while preparing for exams as compare to brilliant Students. CA courses do not demands from you that you must be a school or university topper. My teacher during CA course use to quote a beautiful line that\u201dif concept is clear,CA prefix is near\u201d, hence with little hard work and basic intelligence an average students can also clear CA course with flying colours. So friend don't hesitate to go for CA courses only because you are average students in past,dont judge your future potential with yours past few failure. So All the best for your career. ",

Maybe because i never took any coaching or i was distracted whatever the case may be.. But by the God's grace i cleared my ipcc exams in May 2018 and then started coaching and all and by the mid March 2019 i completed my coaching and started preparing for my exams which is to be held in May 2019 .. ON 13TH AUGUST I CLEARED CA FINAL Group 1.. Hoping to be CA in Nov 19 exams\u2026 You can do it if you have that self believe and passion.. ",

Many people who first thought that they are everage but when they tried they cleared in 1st attempt. It is not about how hard the subjects are, it is all about how hard working and determined you are to clear it. I have seen toppers not clearing the exams. But a student who is disciplined and determined definitely cracks it. If you're thinking to crack it just go for it and put this average student thought in dustbin. Anyone can do it but with continuous efforts. All the best!! ",

Work for it and one day your signature will be more valued. For me and for all who loves this profession thinks, CA as a Can-do Attitude .

If you are not interested in commerce then you might not clear CA but that doesn't mean that you are average\u2026may be you are good in maths, physics etc. And can clear IIT exams.
