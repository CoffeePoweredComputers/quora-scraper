            "answer_text": "I would say that Jaipuria Noida would be a good option. They have got good faculties which have atleast 15\u201320 years of industry exposure and maximum of them having a PhD degree. The course curriculum is very practical and student centric. It helps learn those skills by going in the field, be it in the form of industrial visits, live projects or the summer internship. The placement scenerio is also good with many good and well known brands coming to the campus this year. The average package of the 2016\u201318 batch is 6.2 lakhs. Moreover Amazon came this year offering a package of 15.5 lakhs and Lanark group also came offering a package of 16 lakhs. ",
