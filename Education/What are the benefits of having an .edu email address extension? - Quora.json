            "answer_text": "There are certain services that you can get for educational purposes only, if you have a .edu email address. One example I know of is LucidChart; with a .edu address, you basically get everything for free; I think this is true for BitBucket, too. You can also get free software from companies like JetBrains. It is very unethical to use these tools/services for professional purposes, however. This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s technically wrong but considered accepted practice. If you are using something in a professional context, you (or your employer) should be willing to pay. Abusing this system makes it harder for companies to justify these free services for academia, and we don\u2019t have the money. I was (somewhat accidentally) shut off from a service recently at a time when it created a big problem and some embarrassment; they admitted that it was their fault and it shouldn\u2019t have happened, so I have no wish to shame them, but when I see people abuse things, I get frustrated for good reason. When I was a part-time student and full time worker, I started using IDEA, the IDE from JetBrains for my academic work. It was a huge advantage and actually helped me manage my RSI. I did not use my education copy for work, though; I was able to get my employer to pay for it, but if they weren\u2019t willing, I would have paid. ",
