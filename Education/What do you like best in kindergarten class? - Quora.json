My teacher says not to say stupid, but she can\u2019t see this. Stupid stupid stupid! My favorite part of kindergarten is maybe silent reading time. I\u2019m way ahead of my class, because my mom taught me how to read when I was 3! I love books and reading, a lot a lot a lot. My mom doesn\u2019t allow me to watch TV, she says books are better and TV makes me a grump. I don\u2019t think so. ",
