            "answer_text": "It is great that you are taking initiative about your own education and school experience! It is correct to acknowledge that your accelerated academic program was not an accident, but a plan that your parents and teachers invested time and attention into \u2014 because they thought you and the society could benefit from the extra education. You too put work into mastering all that material! I would certainly start by discussing this with your parents, especially what academic plans they have, what sort of post secondary studies, etc. And consider the goals you have too. After that, everyone should consider the best use of your high school years, the best way to prepare for the college you want to get into or your future career. Are Advanced Placement courses, I.B. programs internships, or dual enrollment opportunities available in your new school or anywhere else in your community? Perhaps you could look into being a foreign exchange student. The important thing, however, is for you to consider your own goals and to have that talk with your parents! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I was in this situation in high school too. First, talk to your guidance counselor to see if you can skip a prerequisite and move up to a higher-level class. If that doesn\u2019t work (it usually doesn\u2019t), talk to the teacher teaching the higher-level class and talk to them about skipping into their class. See if you can take a test to show your knowledge. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can talk to your parents to see if they can talk to the counselors to convince them that you already know the material. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a difficult process. I took AP Calc BC in 10th grade, and I had the same issue getting into the class. I talked to the teacher teaching the class, and eventually she let me sit in on a mock AP Calc AB exam, and I think I got a high enough score that she talked to the guidance counselor, finally letting me take Calc BC.
