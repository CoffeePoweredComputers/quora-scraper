            "answer_text": "Hi Emma. I hope you and your family are doing okay during this time of upheaval. This is an event in history that will be discussed in the next generation of textbooks used by students all over the world and you are experiencing it first hand - in a way, that\u2019s an amazing thing to think about - we are living history. I am going to give you my view on your situation. I taught for 28 years, so this is from a teacher\u2019s perspective or point of view. The assignments I give during an emergency are ones that will be done in conditions I cannot control. Some students will have calm, quiet places to work, with parents who are willing and able to help their kids with harder assignments. Some students are on grade level, able to handle challenging work on their own, while other students may not have the ability to do independent study at that level. Some students live in noisy, chaotic households, without anyone who can help them with tougher concepts. Some students may have to take on other responsibilities such as taking care of the home or younger siblings while their parent or parents continue to work. As the teacher, I have to consider all of these things when I give assignments. My recommendation for you - do the work assigned, then go beyond. This is your opportunity to learn more about the things that interest you. Maybe there were topics you discovered this year that really caught your interest, but then you had to go on to other things. Find out more about them. Get your parents to help you find good information on the internet to learn more. Maybe there were skills in math or science that you didn\u2019t feel you completely mastered. Find practice pages on the internet you can complete on your own to strengthen those skills. Create a diary for yourself and document your take on what is happening in the world right now. In years to come, you can look back and rediscover the person you are right now (and it will be great to share with your kids who will be learning about these times in their own history books). Read, read, read, then read some more. The more you read, the better you are able to read - and reading well is a skill that will help you in every subject you learn. I know this is a time with worries and uncertainty, and it can be frightening sometimes. Find the good things - the things to enjoy and to cherish, and try not to worry about those things that are beyond your control right now. The world is on pause, so just do what you can to help your family to stay safe and have some fun with them as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me share a story with you. This is a true story that actually happened. At the time I worked as computer technician. I was paid very fairly for my work. At the same job site we had a front desk and a receptionist. Long story short she could not meet her job description and was fairly dismissed after much retraining and second chances and opportunities to learn. I had great respect for my boss\u2019 handling of the whole situation. She was compassionate and wise all around. She tried to be a good leader. The employee for won\u2019t or can\u2019t couldn\u2019t match up to what she needed. She made the right, tough and fair choices at every point in the whole ordeal. Then she made a decision that I will never understand and never ever ever complain about. She decided that while looking for a new employee the computer technicians would take turns manning the receptionist desk. Think about what a computer technician makes versus what a receptionist makes. So that means instead of busting my hump opening up computers, swapping parts, dealing with customers, and generally earning my pay-grade. I got to sit at a desk and say hello for one day out of the week. I like to challenge myself, I like to keep learning new things. I like to push myself to be the best at what I do. The situation was out of my control. I took the easy work and enjoyed it. It was my favorite day of the week. So I guess my advice is don\u2019t be afraid to take it easy in a temporary professional situation. It isn\u2019t something you can control. Think of it as a temporary break and enjoy it. It will not last. Next school year you will be back to school or at least have a teacher prepared to challenge you while using distance learning. IT GETS BETTER. Hang in there. ",
