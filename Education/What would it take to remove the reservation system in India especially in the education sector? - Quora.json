            "answer_text": "The only solution to this is for the general class people to rise. Reservation is a policy of govt and can't be changed until and unless the general category people get into the parliament and change these flawed police's either making reservations completely on economical basis or either by completely abolishing it. But perhaps the big question is that will the general category people mostly involved in their own house hold chores financial problems and other burden rise for this fight. India is a great country and we all have great passionate leaders among us. All we need is just a spark & support from general category to unite all those who are against reservation and contest election. The purpose of writing this solution is my attempt to involve all those fed up from this flawed reservation policies to unite and fight against this injustice. Jai hind ",
