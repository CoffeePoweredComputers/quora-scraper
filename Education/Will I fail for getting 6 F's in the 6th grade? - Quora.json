            "answer_text": "Greetings, \u201cFailure\u201d is relative. In the United States, public school students are subject to social promotion. This controversial policy elevates students through middle school to the next higher grade regardless of academic achievement. Once students get to high school, students must at least pass required courses and earn enough other elective credits in order to graduate. Public school students who regularly attend classes, complete most of the assignments, pass some of the tests, and not make trouble for staff will be rewarded with high grades. Students must work very hard in order to fail elementary and middle school classes. Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",
