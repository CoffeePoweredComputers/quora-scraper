            "answer_text": "Dear, I think you are asking about maintaining your PR status, because, an eligible person can apply and obtain a Canadian PR even if he or she stays outside, say in any country around the globe. So, if you are asking about how much time you must stay in Canada to maintain your status, then there is a basic residency requirement set by the IRCC which is mandatory for every PR holder. As per the requirement, the duration is a minimum of 2 years, i.e. 730 days. Remember, you must be physically present in the country for the mentioned period within a total 5-year duration. Though, these 730 days need not be in a continuation. A lot of people also ask whether the days spent abroad is counted toward their permanent resident status or not? So, it majorly depends on the purpose of travel and with whom you travel. The time you spend outside Canada can be counted toward your status if you meet anyone the following conditions: If you are working outside the country: You must work full-time for a Canadian organization, or federal, territorial or provincial government. If you are traveling with your spouse or common-law partner: Your spouse or common-law partner must be a citizen or a PR holder working outside the country on a full-time basis for Canadian organization, or federal, territorial or provincial government If you are a dependent child and traveling with your parent: Your parent must be a citizen or a permanent resident working outside the country on a regular basis for Canadian organization, or federal, territorial or provincial government If any other pops-up in your mind with reference to your permanent residency card, expiration date, etc. you can always talk to our team of advisors at Canada PR Avenue.

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t actually need to stay in Canada to get Permanent Residence. Even outlanders can apply. To maintain your status as a permanent resident, you need to land before your COPR (Confirmation of Permanent Residence) expires, which is usually 1 year after you passed your medical. You also need to stay 2 years in Canada out of a 5-year period to maintain your PR status. To apply for citizenship, you must be present in Canada for 3 years out of five years (the rule has recently been changed from four years out of 6 years and is to be applied soon from fall onward). The number of days you need to be present in Canada in each calendar year was 183 days earlier. It might change when the rule is implemented. ",

During this time period, you can make friends, can marry and explore the vibrant country. Well, there is no need to stay in Canada to get a PR. When you apply for Canada PR from India, and get the COPR, you can move to Canada by meeting your health and character requirements. Post landing into Canada, you just need to apply for a PR Visa card that you get within a week or so. Post getting the PR Visa card in Canada, you have the freedom to live, work and study anywhere in Canada for a period of 5 years. So, there is no need to stay in Canada to get a PR as all the work is done from your home country only, as there is no such requirement. Also, you can apply for Canadian Citizenship post living in Canada for 3 years. I hope this information might be helpful! Good Luck! ",

I am sure that the IRCC is not looking to trap new immigrants here through its immigration system. As a PR, you are free to come and go as you wish. Of course, once you receive your PR card (which takes about 60 days to process), you can enter Canada freely, without needing to apply for the PRTD.
