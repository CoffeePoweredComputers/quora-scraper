            "answer_text": "Because they have an issue with separating knowledge from their ego\u2019s and emotionality. Both illicit a strong response when we absorb information, this creates biases, because their knowledge stems from a collective position, it\u2019s similar to an identity, in this scenario this identity is associated with negative connotations. People will naturally use that identity and apply that to specific subsets, an entire macrocosm/outgroups, it\u2019s a typical association fallacy and a converse error. Knowledge, should be observed and studied neutrally. Applying emotional connection or experiences to it from your own predetermined position simply distorts it. ",
