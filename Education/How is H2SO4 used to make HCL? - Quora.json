            "answer_text": "Add BaCl2 to dilute H2SO4. There will be 2 cations and 2 anions in the solution (we are ignoring OH- from water), out of which the combination of BaSO4 is insoluble and will precipitate. BaCl2(aq) + H2SO4(aq) \u2192 BaSO4(aq) + HCl(aq) The problem is that you need the exact amount of BaCl2 to precipitate out exactly all the sulfate ions, no more no less and there will not be any indicators usable since the phone remains low throughout the reaction. Add too much BaCl2 and you have a BaCl2/HCl mixture. Add too little BaCl2 and you have a H2SO4/HCl mixture. ",

            "answer_text": "Trap the evolved HCl gas in water. Do NOT mix water into concentrated sulfuric acid. It will over heat and spray hot sulfuric acid and boiling water all over the place. The rule is always slowly add acid to an excess of water. Mixing your aqueous sulfuric acid with water then adding NaCl will not give you HCl. It will give you a solution of protons, chloride ions, SO42-, and HSO4-. The HCl will be totally dissociated. If you want just H+ and Cl-, the BaCl2 method will work as described. ",
