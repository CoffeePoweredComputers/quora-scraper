            "answer_text": "sexist: characterized by or showing prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex. You\u2019re asking if it is okay for a person tasked with teaching students to show prejudice or to discriminate against a subset of those students? No, it is not okay. A teacher\u2019s duty is to help the students to reach the learning goals of the course. It is their duty to do that for all of the students. A teacher must not make that process more difficult for a subset of students because of the teacher\u2019s own attitudes. That is simply wrong behavior. As a student, if you sign up to take a class, you have the right to be treated equally with the other students and the right to only be judged for your performance according to the objectives of the class. If a teacher cannot treat all of their students with the respect they deserve, that teacher needs to be removed from their position. ",
