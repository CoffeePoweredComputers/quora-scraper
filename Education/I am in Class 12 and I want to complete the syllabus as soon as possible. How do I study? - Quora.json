            "answer_text": "The best way to complete the syllabus as soon as possible is to start early. I\u2019ll give you my example when I was in class 12. I started studying it from June. By October end before Diwali Celebrations, I covered the whole syllabus at least once. This really helped me covering the syllabus again and revising it at least 2 times before the exams. If you have joined private tutors or coaching classes, then ask the faculty about the course timeline beforehand. Its really important to set the timelines for very subject and strictly adhere to the same. Also, there have been many cases when schools do not provide good teachers for a particular subject or do not put much focus on their curriculum. It\u2019s important to ignore the classes and do not waste your precious time in the school. Yes, I am saying to skip classes in the case of poor teachers. Don\u2019t bother about the attendance as it\u2019ll be taken care of. It will really help you for long term and develop the habit of self study. ",

            "answer_text": "well,It is never a good idea to complete whole syllbus before time.it will pressurise you for worthless outcome. TO SCORE VERY GOOD MARKS YOU JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW BASICS RULES.. 1.ask ur tacher to suggest u good books. ( remember It is books which can make u topper or failure so be very choosy.) 2.follow good time table. (Find ur prime time and study weak subjects in it.) 3.The most important thing is revision. (Pay special attention to it). 4. TOPPERS FORMULA =( It is always better to read one book 10 times than 10 books 1 time.) 5. wake up in the morning. Do yoga,meditations. Maintain a dairy and write ur plan,feelings,ideas. And do not disclose it to any body. 6.solve past year papers. if the above mentioned rule doesn't work,then try never failing LAW OF ATTRACTION. (It will certainly help u to achieve what u want.). ",
