            "answer_text": "You Don\u2019t Have To Make An Affidavit, Newspaper Ad,Press Notification or Identification Certificate from gazetted Officer. This QUORA Question is about MARK-SHEET (Mark Statement). So let me give the correct instruction. I request others to delete their answer as there is too much misinformation (and nonsensical copy pastes) Download the form from http://cbse.nic.in/faq/dupform.pdf . Fill it up and dont forget to mention the amount you made a DD for. Make a demand draft from any Bank. The amount to be paid depends on how old your marksheets are. You can check it here: http://cbse.nic.in/faq/notice%20of%20fee%20revision_2016.pdf. (I lost my mark-sheet from 2001, so i had to pay Rs1000. But for most of you, who gave exams between 2014 to 2019, it will costs only Rs250) . The DD should be made in favor of SECRETARY CBSE and then mention the Regional Office. Mail the Form and the DD photocopy to your CBSE Regional Office , as mentioned in the last page of your application form. Extra info for people who passed before 2001 If you mark sheet is from 2001 and before, then you have to send your documents and pay your demand draft to CBSE Regional Office, Ajmer Todarmal Marg, Ajmer. 305001 (Rajasthan) This is because really really old documents are handled by this office only. Other regional offices no longer handle really old documents. ",
