            "answer_text": "Both the colleges are somewhat of the same standards. I\u2019ll suggest you to consider proximity as the main channel for choosing between the two. In terms of facilities both the colleges are at par though PGDAV enjoys a better theatre culture. Also PGDAV has a location advantage being in Lajpat Nagar and the overall crowd their too is better when compared to Satyavati College. But if you are into politics then I\u2019ll like to tell you that it is one of the most politically active colleges in the whole Delhi University. ",
