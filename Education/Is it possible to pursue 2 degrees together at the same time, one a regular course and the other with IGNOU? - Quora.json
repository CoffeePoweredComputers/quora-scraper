            "answer_text": "Of course, you can do. I don\u2019t know about regular universities. But, pursuing a degree from IGNOU is not a piece of cake. If you are going to take admission in IGNOU, you have to be aware of some of the things like it is distance education. Only counseling sessions will be provided, you have to prepare yourself for your exams. Exams are quite tough to pass. You can skip your theory classes but attendance in practical sessions is mandatory. If you only want a degree to show, then choose some simpler programs. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Strict Nooo. You can\u2019t do two degree courses at the same time even if you do one from regular and other from distance. As per UGC Rules, its illegal to do two courses at the same time but yes, you can do certificate course with any degree course. Its better to do one course at a time to perform well on that subject otherwise you can\u2019t manage to get enough marks in both of the course. I hope you get your answer ",
