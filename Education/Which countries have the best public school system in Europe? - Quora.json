            "answer_text": "++ Supposedly Finland\u2019s is best. I know only what YouTube reported about Finnish education. That is: 1 Only three hours a day. 2 After comes lunch then going home. 3 No homework. If Finland makes that work, it has achieved a marvel. My questions then are: -How does one prepare for higher education in science, technology, or more academic subjects like ancient civilisations? -How long does Finnish higher education take? -How thorough is it? It seems Finns who never studied before university would need more than just three years to get up-to-speed with studying (a form of independent learning), then to finish an UG degree. Maybe that YouTube was propaganda. If so, truth would be welcome. Any remarks, explaining how three hours (weekdays, barring holidays and feast days) are enough to learn all one needs to tackle independent study at university, are most welcome. ",
