            "answer_text": "I do average in school lol and have maintained this average for years and years. My attitude is what makes it most of the time because I'm the one who understands situations for what they are. For example if we are given homework I understand that it's there to help me improve and not just for school at home. I tend to be lazy but I have the \u201cthere's a task to be done so I'm going to do it\" attitude. Practically it lies in practise and revision of what you've learnt for that day even if you understand well. So that's going home every day and revising the work you did in class for every subject you had that day. It sounds lame I know but it's a small price to pay for your future. I heard this from one of the top students in my school who was the sister of my friend and decided to try it and believe it or not it really helps lol. Another thing is getting enough sleep, eating well and time management which is cliche but still true because you can't work hard on a body ready to crash. Lastly listen in class attentively. In grade 7 my English teacher told me that if we simply listened in class we could get at least 60\u201370% of the work in our mind and all we need to do is once again go home and practise which I believe strongly in and do to this day. Listening in class is all you need to do for a basic understanding or maybe even good understanding of the topic and it has helped me so much. It's not easy to do believe me with all your nonsense classmates but at the end of the day it's their future they're ruining and your future that you're preserving and this is something that motivates me to just listen in class. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Paying attention, and learning more than is necessary. Here are some additional tips for studying: 1) The best way to learn, is to teach someone else what you are trying to learn. This is maybe the most time consuming method, but it delivers the highest comprehension level and best long term retention. 2) Create tests for the subject: Creating tests is a good way to study, but you have to be taught how to do this first. There are different levels of learning and most students stick with memorization. Their \u201cdifficult\u201d questions are picky, using unnecessary details. I showed students examples of the difference between a memorization, knowledge application and problem solving question. 3) Condense the information into the briefest form you can and still recall what it is about: You should be reading and doing homework on a regular basis. One day before the exams you should be reviewing your notes to refresh what you already know. Take a small 3 X 5 card and write down everything you think you should know for the exam, but do not know. Once it is full that is about all the learning you will be able to do and still remember it tomorrow. 4) Convert data that must be memorized into visuals: Create images based on the words/phrases you are memorizing. My daughter had this book with picture images of all the state capitals. Her favorite was a hairless (nude) hamster boarding a Concorde jet for Concorde, New Hampshire. 5) Look for what is ironic or humorous when you read long passages. This makes it easier to remember.
