            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t last forever. They may, but they might as well not. If I\u2019m being honest, out of the people I was in the same year with in high school, I talk to precisely two of them. Out of like.. 50+ people. Okay, three people tops, and I\u2019d consider them friends. Everyone else\u2026 nah. But then, it\u2019s not like we got along that well in school, either. Out of the people I knew while in high school but didn\u2019t go to school together with, I\u2019m friends with 6 out of 10+. Sure, if I met some of them we\u2019d catch up and chat and have a good time.. but we don\u2019t seek out each others company. It\u2019s a bit of a shame, but then that\u2019s life. You drift apart and that\u2019s okay. You meet new people. However, you will meet more people of like mind when you attend university. I still hang out with my coursemates and I consider them friends for life, on par with a friend I met in kindergarten and still consider one of my closest friends. That\u2019s how highly I value those connections; way higher than any high school era friendship. Maybe it\u2019s because high school was merely a pit stop for me, it wasn\u2019t anything special to write home about but university was. But don\u2019t expect them to last until death. It\u2019s a rare thing. ",

            "answer_text": "They are often only possible in the specific environment of high school. This means the friendship can only survive in school. Worse, some of these friendships are only a result of having no better option. Meaning that sports jock your friends with in art, will immediately ditch you for his actual friends in gym. And the final one, is that most won\u2019t last. High schooler\u2019s are at a point in their lives where they change the most which makes good friends better, and everyone one else a stranger or enemy. ",
