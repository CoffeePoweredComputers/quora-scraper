If they are different, I don\u2019t think it would be considered cheating. I think it would be more of a study guide or materials for studying, but you should check with your school/university to see how legal it is. ",

Many universities even make previous exams available to students so that they can get a sense of how the questions will be structured and so on. If, for whatever reason, you\u2019re not meant to have access to the past exams and you obtain this, then it\u2019s cheating. ",
