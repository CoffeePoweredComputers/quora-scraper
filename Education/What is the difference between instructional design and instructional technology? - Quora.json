            "answer_text": "Instructional design is how you put together your curriculum. The scope is exactly what topics you will cover in the class; the sequence is the order in which the topics will be covered and how they are to be delivered; also how long will be spent on each topic and how understanding will be assessed. Instructional technology is a means of delivery, i.e., app-based delivery (think Duolingo), web-based delivery, other computer/phone delivery methods. Of course there are many other means of delivery such as direct instruction, reading (textbooks and living books), project-based learning, solving puzzles, etc. ",
