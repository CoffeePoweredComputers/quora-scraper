            "answer_text": "It really depends on how your parents think of grades, and how much they trust you.  Do you feel like your parents trust you with your grades, i.e. do they give you freedom on studying? Do they consider 'grades' to be an important aspect of life? Have you been getting straight A's all the time that a 'B' can be seen as a disaster?  My school reports consist of a commitment grade (scale of 1-5), and an actual grade (A*-E). My mother cares about the actual grade A LOT, but even when it falls, if my commitment grade is good enough, she doesn't say much. She did, though, ask me about how I feel about the grade, and whether I've put enough effort in. Perhaps, if you did put enough effort and your parents know that you did, they may be content with what you have.  After all, these grades are for you. Please, even IF (and a BIG 'If') your parents say harsh things, do not feel discouraged. Grades aren't everything. But from my experience, grades and effort has a positive correlation. The harder you work, the better grades you will achieve. Good luck!  ",

            "answer_text": "Oh I will tell you this you will be getting alot of pressure from them: I was a straight A student in elementary school but where I'm from the difficulty gap between elementary and middle school is just absurd( In other countries(Developed Ones) which ive seen Test papers and exam papers from middle school are for my region elementary level) I went to the same school most of I relatives and my parents attended but as the years passed difficulty grew. My parents, expecting me to score all As saw average scores on the report card which I was fine with because I could always try better to not make the same mistakes. So gradually my grades improved bit by bit eventually my parents decided to enroll me in studies on my weakest subjects, so I ended up doing studies 6 times a week but my grades on my other subjects started to fall. But remember the grades are for YOU and you alone, look at your past Test papers and see where you went wrong. ",
