            "answer_text": "This happened to me once. I knew whom had stolen the answers to a test in history class. He was my teammate and sometime friend. He shared this list with the 25 other people in class, but I did not take a copy of it. I had already studied for that test, and felt pretty confident about my command of the material, and I liked this teacher. I took the test and score in the low 90\u2019s %. I had the lowest score in class. The next day the rest of the class had near perfect scores. The teacher was so mad he was red in the face and made some wild threats. The teacher figured out the theft and my lower score stood out. He seemed to know I knew about the prank. He accused me of the crime thinking that I was the clever mastermind of the caper, and that I had somehow figured out how to steal, and distribute the answers, while purposefully getting some wrong to through him off the trail. The class was quiet that day. I remained seated after class in the empty classroom as they all went to lunch. I pulled out blank papers and answered in essay form the top 10 questions I could remember from the test. I used long paragraphs to show a detailed knowledge of the questions. The bell rang as the next class filed in just as I finished. I packed up my bag and handed the pages to the teacher on my way out to my next class. I never \u201cratted out\u201d my friends and class mates. As far as I know, there was never any action taken against anyone in class for cheating. I loved history, so I enjoyed the class and didn\u2019t lose any friends. That teacher became a regular fan our our team and was at every game for the next two seasons. Demonstrate your innocence. Good Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, try to explain yourself. Really try to grab the teacher\u2019s attention in such a way that he/she listens to you. Now while doing that, the two most important things are your tone and you expressions. Remember you must always bow down to your elders ( out of politeness). So during your self-defense period, you should NEVER raise your voice, and talk in a calm, soothing way. Try it. In this way, your reputation for rude behavior will eventually fade away. Next is, let the teacher finish his scolding. It is a very good nature to always let a person finish his speech. I mean don\u2019t you get angry when you\u2019re in the middle of a conversation and someone\u2019s just interrupting you from time to time? On the other hand, if you do so, then what it will benefit you yourself in the end. See, imagine the teacher yelling at you angrily in front of the whole staff, teachers,students, EVERYONE. After that, when you start to explain the whole actual story, right from the very beginning till the end, describing every single detail (so that you can manipulate everyone into thinking that you\u2019re telling the truth), the teacher will realize his mistake and eventually become embarassed in the end. Pretty clever huh? Ik. I\u2019m sorry kids if I am being a bad influence on you, but Quora asked! You\u2019re welcome. ",
