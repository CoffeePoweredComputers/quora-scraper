            "answer_text": "Schools and universities throughout the country recognize the value of incorporating an e-Learning platform into their arsenal of educational tools. Such tools help expand the reach of education beyond the doors of the school by granting students, teachers, and parents easy access to classroom material.It is no surprise that schools would seek to bring technology into the classroom. The problem many educators face is choosing between the many available platforms to identify which is the best choice for their setting. With this blog, I hope to eliminate some of the confusion surrounding this important decision.BlackboardAs one of the oldest e-Learning platforms, Blackboard has the distinction of reaching every aspect of the educational experience for millions of online learners, instructors and educators around the Globe. Blackboard has several functions which instructors and students find invaluable, such as instructor-students and student to student interaction through the dynamic use of discussion threads.Asynchronous discussion boards, blogs, and e\u2013mail are an important aspect of each version of blackboard. Blackboard also features upgraded assessment tools as part of the grade function boards. Students can attach files and images to discussion and assignment threads, which increases the ease-of-use of the learning platform.Pros: Blackboard\u2019s hierarchical structure produces a textual approach to teaching and learning.The class roster feature has two additional communication tools that allow all participants to manage a list of class members. This feature includes links to student\u2019s homepages and e\u2013mail addresses, which helps streamline communication regardless of student location.Search and communication functions allow students to find study material based on their preferred learning styles, which enhances the learning experience for the end-user.Cons: Instructors and students have little control over how they wish to structure their online learning experience.In the default view user\u2019s replies are not listed unless the user is in tree view or expand all, which can complicate discussions that occur over multiple discussion threads.The grading system is convenient, but it completely decontextualizes student-student and student-instructor messages. This means that during the grading process, only communications from an individual student are visible and therefore the message may be lost.E-CollegeE-College is the widely popular learning portal dedicated to professional students, teachers, educators and corporations worldwide. It provides a virtual learning environment that is easy-to-use and adapts easily to suit the needs of professionals. E-college manages, develops and hosts eLearning software applications and support services for institutions, colleges and universities. Educators use the e-College learning management system to deliver a professional online course to students via live video conference hosted by faculty. As educators, students and instructor explore the site, they will come across various programs that will help them achieve their personal and professional goals.Pros: E-College requires less software and hardware because it provides a learning and teaching environment via the Cloud.Complete academic support services and professional development training is available through this platform.e-College boasts a high quality set of assessment and analytics tools to allow educators and students to quantify the learning experience.Cons: The back, forward, and refresh buttons are disabled in this platform, making it difficult to switch between units.The discussion threads are complex- students sometimes have difficulty selecting appropriate discussion threads for class discussions.Uploading and downloading large files is affected by factors such as user connection speed and the time of day. This can be problematic in situations where class materials have a strict deadline that coincides with times where many users are online.CaptivateAdobe Captivate is a part of the adobe eLearning suite. It has become one of the most popular and widely used e-Learning platforms among students and educators worldwide. Captivate\u2019s learning tools allow users to develop any type of e-Learning course without any prior technical knowledge. Adobe Captivate has a wide range of features such as customizable skins, multimedia support, and audio synchronization, just to name a few. It allows for users to produce output files in a wide range of file formats such as AVI, which can be used for both web and LMS delivery.Pros: Easy drag and drop component allows educators make learning fun through the use of drag and drop e-Learning modules, games, quizzes. This \u2018gamification\u2019 is cross-browser and cross-operating system compatible, which means that users can easily access these features from anywhere- even from an iPad or mobile device.Captivate features HTML5 support for Microsoft Power Point which allows users to add text, animation, and shape into Adobe Captivate.Educators can publish Captivate projects for both Web and Learning Management Systems. If a project contains audio and text, the program can compile the information in one SWF file that is supported by all video publishing sites.Cons: The program does not have the ability to allow users to save customized interaction themes.There are no updates available for advanced action functionality.Captivate is unable to send large files, which means alternative means of delivery must be used for large or bulky files. This is an inconvenience for faculty and students using the Captivate learning platform to transmit class documents.ArticulateArticulate is another highly popular eLearning tool for delivering effective e-Learning solutions. It allows users to create high quality e-Learning software quickly and easily. Articulate\u2019s rapid e-Learning solutions supports Microsoft PowerPoint add-ons for its all functions.

The use of such devices for e-Learning purposes must be taken into account when developing or choosing the platform that best suits the needs of the learning environment. There are many advantages to developing platforms that are compatible with mobile devices.Users can easily access the learning application on their mobile device at any time, even when desktop devices are not available.Users can use their smartphone devices as supportive educational tools and can access articles, essays and other academic items.

These gadgets help increase the productivity of the student and help them find a learning style that suits their needs.What is SCORM Compliance and Why is it Important?SCORM is the collection of technical standard and specification for web based eLearning software products.
