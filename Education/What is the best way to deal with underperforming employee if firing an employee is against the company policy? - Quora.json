            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a wonderful question. Thank you for asking. As an HR Practitioner with over 18 years of experience, what I normally suggest in such scenarios is as follows \u2013 Find out if he was always a non-performer or he has become a non-performer in recent times. If he has become a poor or a non-performer in recent times then speak to his workplace friends and team members. Find out recent changes in his life and in his team. Is there is a new boss? Have there been changes in his role or team structure? In recent times, has there been any death or birth in his family? Did he get married recently? Or, maybe if he is involved in some extramarital affair? [Yes, an organisation must not interfere in the personal life of an employee, however, if his personal issues are affecting his performance and workplace productivity, then the organisation must look into every possible dimension]. Usually, the reasons for the sudden drop in performance can be attributed to harassment (at a workplace or at home), bullying, loss of loved ones, and change in lifestyle (increased consumption of alcohol, drugs, etc). Take the help of a counsellor. Try to find out the problem area. Through this you will be able to find if the problem is with his SKILLS (maybe he doesn\u2019t have right skills to do the job), ATTITUDE (unwillingness to do the work), new DRASTIC CHANGES at workplace (change of boss, change in role and responsibilities, new lifestyle) and PSYCHOLOGICAL (maybe something is not right in his family, sudden death or birth in family, etc that bothers him all the time). If there is an issue with his skills then get him trained to acquire necessary skills and competencies. If the issue is with his Boss (harassment, bullying, etc.) then speak to him and get it sorted. Or, maybe, put him into a role that compliments his skills. If there is a psychological issue, provide him counselings help or maybe take the help of a psychotherapist. If it is a behavioural issue or an attitude problem, take the help of a behavioural coach or performance coach. In spite of all the above, if he doesn\u2019t improve, then you can take some punitive measures, e.g. stop his increments. Terminating his employment on the basis of poor performance might be against the policy of the company, but he can always resign. If in spite of all the help, if he is unwilling to improve his performance then, of course, one can create circumstances for him to resign on his own. ",

            "answer_text": "People underperform for a few reasons: They are working on the wrong things.They lack motivation.They lack the skill to do the job.They are simply not competent.#1, doing the wrong work, is on the manager: it's your job to make sure your people work on the right things. #2, motivation, means that the employee doesn't see how their work is helping them meet their individual goals. In addition to money, most people are looking for purpose, autonomy and mastery.[1] They want their work to mean something, they want to be free to do it without hassle, and they want to be good at it. Figure out what they want and why they aren't getting it. Then fix that. #3, lacking skill, is a training issue. Send them to courses, pair them with a mentor, and give them assignments that grow their skill progressively over time. Alternately, move them into a role that leverages skills they already have. #4, incompetence, is what's left when you've ruled out everything else. There's nothing you can really do about it. You should look at your hiring practices to figure out how this person got hired in the first place. But look very hard at 1\u20133 before concluding someone is incompetent - it's much less common than people think. Footnotes[1] Page on .drive",
