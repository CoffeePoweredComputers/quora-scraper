            "answer_text": "An anonymous question to me, a person who doesn't have and will never have children.  Here is my hypothetical answer: During the first two years of life: I would engage with my child a lot.  No nanny.   It would mostly be body on body engagement.  I would alternate a stroller with one of the baby carrywrap things and encourage the father to do as well.    On her first birthday:  I would put her into a baby carrier backpack and go on a hike, hopefully it would be Spring or Fall.  Daddy would do the ascent, I'd do the descent.  By this time, I would have started a small collection of toys that engaged her senses and imagination; ones that would last a couple of years.     The terrible twos:  Play dates time! I would start her on one or two classes or activities to begin socializing with other toddlers.   I would probably learn about and implement a lot of time outs! No way, Not Nice, Go take a time out!!!! Conversations would likely take form, and the questions?  CAN'T WAIT FOR THE QUESTIONS!!! I have treated friends' 2-3 year olds as little adults, I wonder if I would with mine.  I dunno.  Three, four, five: Time for me to listen.  What does she gravitate toward? What does she love?  How does she see?  Encourage all of that.  I would start one activity that she loved: music lessons, dance, sports, whatever she liked.  Art would always be part of our activities. I guess the best way to bring up a girl child is to show her as much of the world as you can.   Let her engage and see it through H E R own eyes, not yours or theirs! ",

            "answer_text": "The basic difference between girls n boys is emotional expressions n dealings. Awareness about physical sense, mental planes n emotional intelligence is essential. Girls must be brought up respecting their own gender with all the strengths n weaknesses, to understand that what ever intelligence or aptitude they are naturally blessed with, must be utilised. Girls must be brought up with realistically positive self image. To understand the environment where they are being brought up and the essential social intelligence is an important factor. Last but not least the worldly wisdom is incomplete if girls do not know about boys and the nature's of boys n girls. The knowledge of important matters are possible only through good books. Therefore bringing up girls with good emotional support and sensitivity is an essential strategy. As the girls grow in age, at various developmental stages, the influencers also increase. Hence,a strong personality at every stage is what needs to be developed.This is possible only through good environment, good interaction or good interpersonal interaction and good resources to learn from.
