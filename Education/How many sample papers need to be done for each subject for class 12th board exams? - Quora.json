            "answer_text": "The best answer to this question is that it depends on your capacity and time management skills for a question paper and your strength on that particular subject. But for your help,Sample papers are to be tried only for developing your confidence and to increase your time management skills.The more you solve the more confidence you gain. So first you should be very confident in your topics before trying on sample papers.During the exam time say if you get 2\u20133 days off then you should plan for efficient utilisation of those days let me tell you my personal experience during my days. During the Feb month I was revising my twelfth topics and had daily tests which made me remember my subjects very easily. During the March month before the two days of exam just revise the topics in the NCERT book by reading it line by line and master the book on the first study holiday then on the other holidays start to do question paper.One sample paper for about 2 hrs and correct it by yourself and check out how much you score.Once you did a paper then check your mistakes and try to correct it by referring etc..Once you did it your confidence will be boosted a little.On a whole 4\u20135 sample paper will fetch you a handful of marks.Further if you are more strong in your subjects then you can easily cross 10 sample papers and get good marks(above 90% easily). All the best for your exams.. ",
