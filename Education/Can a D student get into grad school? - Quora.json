            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re a D student you probably didn\u2019t graduate from college. Most accredited colleges in the US require a cumulative GPA of 2.000 or greater to graduate. An undergraduate degree is almost always a requirement to get into grad school. Exceptions to this are things like a longtime demonstrated world-class proficiency in some subject of interest. More to the point for the average \u2018D student\u2019 is the idea that college performance falls off fairly quickly in terms of relative importance in admission criteria for grad school. If you graduated in May and are applying for September admission, forget about it. If, on the other hand, you graduated ten years ago and have ten years of good work experience with increasing levels of responsibility to show, it\u2019s much more likely you can get in. There are two things to consider here. First, pick a local state university rather than a flagship university with a worldwide reputation. The flagship schools have more applicants with perfect records than they can admit, so they are unlikely to go out of their way for a nonstandard applicant. Second, you have got to take the personal initiative to get past the first thing the admissions office will do, which is to see if you meet the GPA requirement and look no further if you don\u2019t, This may take the form of talking to someone in the department you\u2019re thinking of applying to so that the department can make sure your application gets a full evaluation.

            "answer_text": "A2A. Can a D student get into grad school? If you are talking about D, 1.0 on a 4.0 scale where a C, 2.0, is necessary for a bachelor\u2019s degree, then no, because a bachelor\u2019s degree is required for admissions. If you are talking about a student with a bachelor\u2019s degree where the student\u2019s GPA is D, 1.0, then may be because some graduate school have program that only require a bachelor\u2019s degree.

The best thing you can do is either try for another degree and get better grades, or retake the classes you did poorly in. You can get excellent advice from the admissions advisors at any major university. They will help you understand what you might need to do next. ",

As all bachelors require at least an average or satisfactory performance, and imply you have not met minimum requirements in college. As a job, it suggests you have not mastered the material for the average college student, and that your overall or major work can improve. Overall, it implies you are not ready for graduate work in the same major or field. And that you can improve the grades in the courses, where you have received lower quality assessments. It\u2019s better to improve lower graded courses, work in an experience, or somehow balance the lower quality. As that study of the material will carry with you implicitly, and effect studies where you must apply the basic principles, methods, or facts there. ",
