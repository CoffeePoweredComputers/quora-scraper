            "answer_text": "LOng answer here. Currently, It\u2019s 9:04 when I\u2019m writing this. I had to find this question because I\u2019m very very excited to share this experience \u2013 The First Competetive Exam of my life. Well, so a little back story. I was in class 8th when I came to know about NTSE, it sounded really cool but yeah like other kids I didn\u2019t give it much attention thereafter. Then in class 9th, we used to have many seminars by different coaching institutes. But still, I just used to dream about preparing for it and ended up doing nothing till September, class 10th. #The fire of NTSE came in me because of less time, that is, in fact, proportional to more pressure . Accompanying this all, we still used to have seminars but I wasn't interested in joining any coaching as i don't really go to any and the fees of course. (I don't go to private coaching either just cause I like self-study moreover, its 10th baby!) But this, one seminar caught me and my whole heart. They told us about their weekends classes. Well by then, I really wanted to prepare for NTSE and thought that that would help. One of my friends accompanied this all with me. This was in fact, the best time for me in 2019. I had to travel with City buses and know what - this is total ADVENTURE!!! Yes. I saw different kinds of people,and the rush for coachings s well. Maan the male compartment, ugh what to talk about. ITs jam Packed!!. Oh yeah so back to weekend classes. Well so I had to invest 2 hours of traveling but I don't have much work apart from studying and common household work so it was all okay, And that too just for 2 days a week so absolutely fine! #I'm good at physics and maths and my weak subjects are chemistry and social, specifically history. Science and maths are from NCERT but for social, I prepared from MP board Books. I used to read the social book daily and do some MAT series question. At first, Series took a lot of time but gradually my speed increased. MAT is actually easy but hard. You need to think but differently. Maths for me is no issue. All my physics concepts were clear but the thing was the chapters, Eye and the mirrors were not yet started in school so I just tried to read and understand by myself. Yes, coaching helped but they didn't use to cover the basics, if you don't know basics, for me say, lenses then I don't know what is going in class. The same case with trigonometry but I ended up being really great at it. Bio, for me, is simple but I hate the plant reproduction part. I didn't even try' to read it. This was indeed, very boring, unlike human reproduction. #Plus I solved many papers from different states as well. Well but social! The MP board book had a total of 19 chapters in all (2 are omitted) I, on 1 October decided that I'll do I chapter a day. It was all fine till day 15 and the fire faded away. Chem is a disaster for me. First of all, because our teacher at school is not-so-good plus I have a lesser interest in it compared to other subjects. #Fast forward to the night before I had done Maths, except Statistics. I thought of just taking a look at formulas before the exam but ended up not doing so.For social had read the whole book.In bio, I had done everything except plant reproduction.Physics was easy for me but still, I gave NCERT the last readingChem- Now the interesting part comes! Well, as I said earlier.I am weak in this subject and I decided not to study it. But you don't know what happens next buddy!It was 9.30 pm when I was texting my best friend. He asked me about my preparations. I said \"Zitna pada hai ootna zindabaad\" he \"Are maan thats the spirit\" me \" But yaar chem nhi kara\" he \"last 2 chap\" me \"ha vahi\" he \" toh kar na\" me\" abhi? you think i can change my result in 3 hours\" he\"YES YOU CAN WAIT IM CALLING YOUUUUUUU\" me \"okay\" he\"HUh but mummy call pe mausi se baat kar rhi hai, jab tak baat kar rhi.....\" me\" all fine chillll\" I wasn't serious about it but he actually called me at 10. He explained nicely both chapters in just 1 hour 10 m. (Yes he's a chem pro. If you need to study just tell me so then ill tell him to teach you!). Long story short : \"There's a girl called carbon. Oosko sabse lena hai , par dena nhi hai. Sab ossski lene pe lage rehte hai. See 1 carbon 4 bando ko ek saath chalati hai kyoki ooske paas 4 bando ke liye jagah hai.....\" This was interesting.SEE yes I COMPLETED Two CHEMISTRY CHAPTERS THE NIGHT BEFORE EXAM AND OFCOURSE NAILED THE CHEMISTRY PARTY> all thanks to him. He was an eye-opener as well as a good teacher for me. #FIINAL DAY DAy : 3 Nov, Exam Day I reached the center just at the reporting time. This was the first time me attempting a competitive exam. The sealed questions papers, removing shoes out of the classroom, showing admit card, signing the question paper were all-new for me! They even made me sign the cover of the question paper! This was something I had never experienced before. I had 2 ball pens with me, the only friend of mine there. The MAT paper was to be started aT 10. I completed the MAT paper in 1 hr, no joke. That was easy I thought of getting 95 in it. So I spent the next hour looking at the clouds through the window. The next thing was recess, I had no idea about it! but my dad and sister got there just to give me the lunch box. They went, and I had no friends over there. Well, It was a hard time being alone in the recess but yes I ended up making friends there as well! The next exam was on the SAT. It started at 1.30. Now the things were quite familiar. The signing, seal at the booklet, I was getting familiar you see. But no joke this paper, especially history was scary for me. I started serial wise. Physics, Chemistry, BIO, History, Eco, politics, geography and maths. But, when I started the paper, bio seemed to be-not-so-easy. It was title as BOTANY and not Bio that meant, no humans! The fact that I left plant reproduction and now this! ugh. Next was History. the questions were confusing, or I hadn't prepared that deeply, I can't say. I left the social part and went to Maths, it was easy. Back again to HISTORY. The questions that were the MCQs in the MP board were the only ones I did right as I guess. I was sure that social did a thing to my result. I expected 60 in Sat. # Fast forward to 8 Pm: Me checking the answer key. MATI got 91/100 yes, it was easy and I could've scored more but that's fine as well. Plus When comparing MPs paper to other states, we are nothing in the competition. SATGot 67/100. I messed the whole botany and history Presently, I am regretting that I didn't go through the plant part. History was all okay, I think the questions were way deeper than they should have been. But yeah this is what it is. Let's see if the cutoff is low and I get selected. But overall pretty satisfied. I've gotten 158/200 and pretty satisfied. I don't care if I get selected but I'm thankful to myself for attempting this exam and having some of the best experiences in life. #A message to all those juniors. Please, please give this exam. No matter if you prepare for it not. Just give this a try. Everything will be new. Don't be lazy at registration, yes its a bit of a boring process but if your school does it for you then that's great. Please start doing MAT daily. It's very interesting. Don't leave the plant part, please I know the human part is more interesting but maybe plant is what gives you marks! Social, don't be daydreamer like me! and yes please buy the state board book. It's just more than helpful and gives you a vast idea about your own country, unlike the NCERT course. Overall. This is all I have to say. Thank You Shubhratri 10:22PM ",

            "answer_text": "As an average CBSE class 10 student NTSE was a new experience for me! My whole preparation process for this was very different from that of my general school exams. To be honest, I had prepared for it very hard by not attending my school for 10 days. But on the day of exam my nervousness ruined everything! I marked 4 to 5 questions each paper (MAT and SAT) wrong on my OMR sheet. I also find a few questions quite hard and time consuming. For me personally maths, biology and sst was easy but mental ability, physics and chemistry was extremely hard! Due to some reasons I was unable to check my answers but I know it very well that I was not going to clear this as the expected cutoff is too high \ud83d\ude23. So, overall my NTSE did not went well:'( Thanks a lot for reading. ",
