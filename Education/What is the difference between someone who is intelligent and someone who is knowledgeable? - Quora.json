            "answer_text": "Let me tell you an example for that. Everyone knows Sir Isaac Newton. Hadn't that apple fell on his head that day, we wouldn't be worrying about our weights now(I know, it's a bad joke). Ok that's not our concern, now that he had made several discoveries and inventions(?) which apparently made a new branch in physics called as Newtonian physics. He was honoured as \u201cSIR\u201d. He is a greatest of greatest physicist of all the time. But something happened in his life to prove that even a great scientist can't be intelligent enough at all times(Please don't berate me for telling this). Sir Newton was absolute pet lover and indeed he was having few dogs and cats (referred from the blogs). There was this particular cat which was pregnant when he was working on something in Cambridge university. Out of his love towards this cat, he summoned his carpenter and made a hole on the door for the cat to come and go. After the cat gave birth to kittens, he summoned his Carpenter again and made another small hole next to the previous one on the same door. When his friends asked the reason for that, he told the big one is for the mother cat and the small one is for the kittens. Funny isn't it? The kittens can also come through the same hole which was made for it's mother. This incident explains your question. Knowledge is something like a repository in your brain, where you can store millions and millions of data whereas intelligence is something like a RAM in your computer - \u201cHow well you can react to any situation\u201d. We can never label any person as intelligent-less people or intelligent people. It depends on the situation they are put in. Whereas knowledge we can certainly judge depends on the \u201cstuff\u201d they possess. So its not possible to tell that someone is having only one of these traits - \u201cALWAYS\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone can be knowledgeable, reading everything and anything can get you there. Knowledge is merely the acumilation of information, even the practical applications of this information, but it is still just information. Knowledge can be merely the hard drive or sponge that absorbs and stores information. Intelligence is being able to put this information to use, to apply this information to real risks in a clear, productive and effective way. To be able distinguish what information is useful for any particular application and what is not. To be able to adjust this knowledge or what is known to better fit an application or be more efficient. Intelligence is often where the knowledge begins. To identify one from another one only need ask a question then ask them to apply this information to a task. One will go to it and complete the task, the others knowledge will theoretical and depending on actual abilities, he will be unsure, much like an toddler learning to walk. Then you have those who are Intelligent, knowledgeable, and smart. They possess the potential, the information and now can apply it to any situation at hand. I see someone who is smart as someone who thinks outside the box and can take limited knowledge, limited intelligence, and make it work, takes the most limited resources and optimize there effect. ",
