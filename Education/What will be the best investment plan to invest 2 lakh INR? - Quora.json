            "answer_text": "The isn\u2019t a straight forward question because the right answer will vary from person to person. You have multiple options you can consider mainly using your risk appetite and your expectations. Types of investments include interest bearing instruments (fixed deposits, debt funds, etc), equities, etc. Equities over the long-term have historically given superior returns compared to interest bearing instruments however there is always risk associated with equities. And if you want to invest in equities, you should only consider investing via mutual funds. There are many types of equity mutual funds out there and if you want to minimize your risk then you can consider investing in a balanced mutual fund. A balanced mutual fund invests in both equities and interest bearing instruments and tries to maintain a balance to reduce risk. Nonetheless, anything that involves equities is always exposed to more risk compared to interest bearing instruments. Using this, you\u2019ll have to decide what will be best for you. Do not take this as investment advice but if I had 2 lakh rupees to invest and if I wanted to invest for minimum 5 years or preferably for 10 years or more than I would focus on equity mutual funds. But this is only because I am willing to take risks associated with the stock market, specially short-term risks. Also I would never invest in equities using a lump-sum amount. I always use a SIP to invest in equity funds. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Manoj, If your investment horizon is short, and you have a low risk appetite and would need liquidity, Invest in Fixed Deposit, Liquid Funds or Ultra Short Term Funds. And if you want to go with Long term and have a high risk appetite: You can consider Mutual Funds. If you are beginner in mutual funds, start with Balanced or Large cap funds. At current market levels, when markets are scaling new highs and valuations are stretched, go via STP (Systematic Transfer Plan) route. You can park 2 lakhs in liquid fund and opt for STP to equity oriented fund. I would reiterate, the underlying factor of any investment depends on your investment horizon, risk appetite and return expectations. All the best! ",
