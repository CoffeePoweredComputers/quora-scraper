            "answer_text": "It is depend on how you are doing CA through CPT or direct entry. If you are through direct entry then Yes doing Bcom benefit CA to some extent. But if you are through CPT rout then NO doing Bcom will not benefit CA. rather doing CA will benefit Bcom. I am through CPT route and when I cleared CPT with 100 marks in 2nd attempt with self study I left bcom for IPCC as there was no one to guide me it was my decision. When I joined classes for IPCC i saw that more than 90% students were pursuing Bcom but I was dedicated to only IPCC. What I was thinking that time is I don't need Bcom degree to earn money my knowledge is enough for me to earn money i don't wanted to do it just because of degree and back up plan. With my dedication i cleared IPCC group 1 in first attempt thought I failed to clear both group. But my best friend failed in both group though he has got very good marks in CPT. Main reson he told me that his Bcom exam. Bcom exam comes just before 1 month of IPCC exam. If those 15 days of Bcom exam he could have given to his weak subject then there was chance that he could have cleared it but his father forced him to give Bcom exam though he don't wanted to give. You need to set priority in your life. Don't follow croud instead create your own identity in croud. If you need Back up plan go for Bcom. If you believe in yourself then give 100% to CA Course. If you need both then set priority and give time. At the end you are the creator of your own journey. It is your choice. Thanks\u2026.. ",
