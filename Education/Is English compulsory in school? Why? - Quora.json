            "answer_text": "In school, especially in schools requiring the English language for other subjects or in an English speaking country, it in quintessential to be able to express yourself in English fluently and hence, English is compulsory. The reason for this is that expressing yourself is an important skill in life as one constantly has to communicate with other people. If you are not sure how to express your thoughts/wants/ideas, then you aren\u2019t able to engage in effective communication. This also applies to learning English as a foreign language. Currently, English is the most common language to speak in the world (with 101 countries). Even though the Mandarin and Spanish speaking population exceeds those speaking English, it is incredibly difficult to communicate with many people in a foreign country, if you don\u2019t speak English. English provides opportunities to speak to many different people across the world and can stabilise your future. The more time you invest in being fluent (which can be time spent in school), the easier communication gets, and provides more opportunities. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll speak for my school in Spain. English is compulsory, yeah, but up to a certain grade (9th grade, 3\u00ba ESO, Year 10 GCSE \u2026) This is because of how the schooling system works here, in 3\u00ba ESO, (its\u2019 equivalents are inside the brackets above) we can choose between the scientific or social path, which gets narrower as you make your way up. In these choosings, you can choose several subjects. If you wanted to avoid English for instance you could choose French as a primary language and ICT for instance. The only thing you can\u2019t do is not choose any language, if you were wondering. I did so by 4\u00ba ESO because I found the level too easy and was getting bored, so I decided to improve in French, and it really worked! So, to answer your question, it isn\u2019t compulsory by the upper half of our secondary school system. Greetings! ",
