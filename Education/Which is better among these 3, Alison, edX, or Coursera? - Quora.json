            "answer_text": "A2A. Which is better among these 3, Alison, edX, or Coursera? To determine better, I would need to have the exact same course offered by all the MOOC platform to compare, something that I have not found. I personally use Coursera and edX that are college courses offered by some of the finest universities in the world. Alison is similar to Udacity that offer courses that they developed. In short, you are not comparing the right MOOC platforms to each other. Moreover, they are in different product spaces with very little overlap. The way you would choose one over the other is by looking at the courses they offer. If one does not offer a particular course does not mean it is worse that other platforms. ",
