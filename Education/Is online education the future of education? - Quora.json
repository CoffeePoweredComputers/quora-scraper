            "answer_text": "This type of education has grown over the last few years and has experienced mainstream acceptance. With an online class, you get to control your learning environment, which ultimately helps you develop a deeper understanding of your degree course. Right now, the Coronavirus pandemic is forcing global experimentation with remote teaching. There are many indicators that this crisis is going to transform many aspects of life. Education could be one of them if remote teaching proves to be a success. Right now, over 98.5% of the student population are stuck at their homes and as a result, there has been a spiky growth in the online education industry. Various already established platforms like Edu4Sure, UDx, Coursera, Udemy, EDx and many more already have been establishing their market share over the past few years and grown to provide top-grade education taught by professionals through online portals. And many more are emerging in this booming market.  Let us look into a few reasons why online education is the future: Online Learning Begins From Preschool to CollegeOnline has replaced some homeschooling systems. Parents can now relax and let the screen teach their home-schooled children. Not only that, if a child is slow at a certain subject, say maths or reading, but there are also a lot of online resources to help them catch up during their free time. Therefore, there are a lot of online courses for all levels of education. Online supplementary learning materials have also been developed for all levels of education. In this regard, you can get courses fitting your needs including online certificate programs, online college courses, and online degree programs. Online Education Brings A Lot Of Flexibility To The Learning TableMost students prefer the screen to live learning. First, to enrol in any enrol school in the world, you do not need to go through the rigorous process of acquiring visas and other travel documents. Indeed, when you start lessons, you can learn from wherever you are. As such, regardless of your family commitments, you are still eligible for learning. It simply involves scheduling lessons around your free time. As such, the system works well for working students or committed mums who have to juggle parenting and school or work and school. In a live class, you have to sit through the whole lesson until the teacher is through with the class. With e-courses, working people can work at their own pace and at their own convenient time taking breaks, as is fitting. Some Online Systems Have a Live TeacherWorth noting is that some online systems have a live teacher, and therefore, students can still learn difficult subjects and be guided by the teacher. There are a lot of online language courses involving a teacher and students who are both online. The good thing is that both the teacher and student can operate from any location of the world that has a good internet connection. The teacher is also able to provide lessons to students who are located all over the globe without requiring a visa and other travel arrangements to do so. Online Education is CheaperThe overall cost of online education is much cheaper than live classroom teaching. First, some lessons are automated eliminating the need for live instruction, secondly, visa and travel arrangements are eliminated from the equation. You can even do a large number of free online courses. That way, you can find out if you have an aptitude for a subject before actually spending any money on learning it. An Unlimited Number of Students Can Be EnrolledMany more students can be enrolled in an online class than in a live class. Though the teacher may still have to incorporate live online lessons as part of the curriculum requirements to their students who may be spread across the globe, most of the lessons are automated allowing the students to self-learn using a screen. The work of the teacher is therefore reduced to preparing the lesson plans and placing them online and marking and checking the progress of the students. There Are A Lot of Learning Resources OnlineAs a student is undertaking their online lesson, they can get a lot of help from many other resources available online on the same subject. Some of the resources are free, and some are paid resources. Therefore, the student has a vast knowledge available to them during screen time learning as compared to live classroom learning. Conclusion Automated or robotic systems are yet to be invented that can mark students work. And it\u2019s worth noting that some departments of learning will still require a live classroom set-up, even if it is only a part of the course. This is in areas like medicine where practical lessons of dealing with live patients, taking their temperature, checking their blood tests, for example, are still an essential part of the curriculum. Courses like mechanical engineering and piloting still require the live experience of operating machinery and may not be entirely online; only a part of the system can be made online. But New models of learning are always springing up in the market, providing students with varied opportunities to fashion their education into something that fits them, not the other way round. The future of online degree education looks promising and opens up education to a larger section of the population than ever before.

            "answer_text": "Since the coronavirus pandemic started, schools were one of the most prominent institutions to be at a loss when it came to preparations. With a heavily politicized influence, schools were torn \u2014 nearing the end of the school year \u2014 between ceasing education altogether or quickly adapting to online, distant learning. Most schools opted for the online option. It made sense, at first, to move to an online alternative in a time when you can\u2019t make contact or have physical proximity to people in large quantities and for long periods. The world was in a state of disbelief and shock when the pandemic first hit, and because schools were in the midst of things with a few months before closure, it was the best option to move online. But as the world calmed down and work resumed, with students enjoying an at-home summer break, it didn\u2019t seem like a viable option to start the new school year online. Parents had to go to work, naturally, and could not leave their little kids unwarranted in front of a PC monitor all day. And so, the idea of starting the new school year as usual \u2014 frontal learning \u2014 was better for working parents. Infection rates, mind you, have still been skyrocketing, especially with social distancing revoked little by little and the acclimatization of the virus in our lives. Unsurprisingly, with summer at its zenith after months of lockdown and social distancing measures, people went out to parties, gatherings, beach trips, and weddings, helping the pandemic grow exponentially. But that was expected. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to stay under lockdown for years, and the coronavirus, we realized, was here to stay for a while. It has become a natural process to open Zoom whenever we wanted to chat with a colleague or attend class or even take an online course (the new trend). And so returning to frontal education seemed a bit farfetched, especially when infection rates are at their highest. But we\u2019ve seemed to adapt to the situation rather quickly. Perhaps because of our already existing usage of video calls and online conferencing since their beginning. In September, schools officially reopened, with children taking unprecedented healthcare measures to attend classes of math, art, and language, among others, and what seemed to be ten problems developed into a hundred. It is no doubt, if you ask teachers and students alike, that online education isn\u2019t the best. Granted, it has its disadvantages, which mainly revolve around it being inefficient, impersonal, and overall dull. With a mix of online and frontal classes, students became unfocused. Alternating between having to sit down in class with transparent plastic walls around you and masks concealing smiles and facial expressions, schools became tedious and tiring. Not only for students, who have to sit and be mindful of not infection or being infected all the time, but also for teachers, who mostly fall into the risk groups of the virus \u2014 underlying health problems, chronic diseases, and age. Online education is problematic. But so is frontal education in the midst of a pandemic. I believe that online education is the future. I\u2019m not saying schools will disappear, but that education will face significant transformation and change in methodology. Is that a good step? Read more here: Is Online Education the Future? ",
