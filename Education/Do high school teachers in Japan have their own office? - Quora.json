            "answer_text": "I\u2019m working at a high school right now, and my wife works at a junior high. I can say for certain this is how most if not all junior and senior high schools in the country are organized: First, there is no such thing as an individual teacher\u2019s classroom. The classroom is the students\u2019 unit, where they stay, study, and socialize for every period that does not require outside effort (i.e. library stuff, physical education, home ec., and some science classes). All of the teachers have a desk in the shokuinshitsu, a large communal office space where there\u2019s access to photocopiers, internet, various book resources, and assorted co-workers. Generally there\u2019s a main shokuinshitsu on the second floor of the school, plus secondary ones on the third and fourth floors, or in secondary buildings if there are any. Teachers who have desks in the secondary rooms are usually the tantou (homeroom teachers) for the classes on that floor / wing. ",
