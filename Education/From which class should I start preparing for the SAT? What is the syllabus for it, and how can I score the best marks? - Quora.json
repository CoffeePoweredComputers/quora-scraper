            "answer_text": "According to me, the ideal time to start preparing for the SAT is grade 9 or 10. Your preparation can be a slow process if you start this early. The SAT comprises of English and Math. There are 4 different sections for the test- Reading, Writing and Language, Math (No Calculator and Calculator section) and an essay which is optional. SAT is all about time management and how quickly you can answer all the questions in a particular section. So the earlier you start to practice and get an idea of the kind of questions that will be asked, the better prepared you will be when you actually take the test.  In grade 9 and 10, there is what they call PSAT. It\u2019s a Practice SAT. If your school is offering it, make sure you do it. This will give you an idea of how you need to answer the questions, the type of questions and also the amount of time you need for each section. You should be ready to do the SAT exam at the end of grade 10 or through grade 11. All the questions are multiple choice and there is no negative marking for wrong answers. The total you can get is 1600- 800 for Math and 800 for English. The essay is marked separately. I definitely advise you to do the essay so that you can submit that score to universities too. Khan Academy is a great place for you to start with your SAT preparation. Spend half an hour every day alternating between Math and English. If you need extra help, you can always find a tutoring centre close to you. They will run mock tests that will help you prepare better. Believe it or not, you can get a perfect score! All you need to do is practice, practice and practice! All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Hey! According to me if you\u2019re aware of what you want to do in the future, than, you should start it now because it doesn\u2019t in which class you\u2019re now. Because if you know about the exam than you should start preparing for it. Why? You may have heard of people who were doing things from their childhood, and now they are doing those things professionally. Like Pv Sindhu, MS and a lot of people. So be smart and start your preparation. And the way to score good is practice and solve more and more questions.
