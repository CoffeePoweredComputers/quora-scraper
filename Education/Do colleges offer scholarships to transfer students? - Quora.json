            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I was a transfer student myself , so I know there are many universities that offer transfer scholarship based purely on merit.  Some states like Texas, Oklahoma, and South Carolina also offer out-of-state tuition waiver meaning that if you get the transfer scholarship above a certain amount ( usually $1000) you can pay instate tuition.  collegeconfidental.com is a great resource that can help you to find transfer scholarships.  Hope this helps.  ",

            "answer_text": "One of the best ways to get a Scholarship (not based upon need) to a great University, is to attend a Community College (Junior College) and excel as Both a student and as an Athlete.   Then the Big University will award you an Athletic Scholarship to play your sport at a very high level, while continuing your studies.   NOTE:   football, basketball and soccer are big in this...... (especially soccer). Also, this is only for NCAA D-1 colleges, and does Not apply to Ivy League colleges..... ",
