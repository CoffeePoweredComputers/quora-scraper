            "answer_text": "It's tedious, it takes forever, it usually has to be done at home, so unlike people in most other jobs, teachers don't get to go home and just be with their families, they have to bring their job home with them (a primary cause of teacher burnout, BTW), sloppy handwriting often means that reading tests is a struggle, and of course, you have a student's fate in your hands, via his grade, and anything more complicated than a multiple choice question requires one to constantly be aware of every other test in the pile, to make sure the same subjective standards are applied to each...which gets harder and harder as the night drags on and you get tired. Woe betide the teacher who gives one student credit for a point and not another, or who can't justify why a \"style\" grade on one essay is lower than another!  And you know that no matter how hard you work to be fair, there will be students who will bitch and whine, and there will be parents who will bitch and whine (ever notice how many people on Quora ask about how they can pressure a teacher into giving them a grade they didn't earn?) and you probably know exactly who they are going to be, and it is hard to remain objective and not let their attitude affect how you assess their work.  You can't favor students you like, you can't be unfair to students you don't  like, you have to be a completely objective grading machine incapable of error, whose concentration is as strong in hour 3 as it was in the first ten minutes.   And if you *do* have a family you want to spend time with, hour 3 may well hit at 2 in the morning. Obviously multiple choice tests are much easier to grade than subjective exams, which is why teachers so often give the former, but about half of those comments still apply. And teachers who are able to grade their exams during school hours don't generally harbor the same level of hatred as the ones who have to bring them home, for reasons I presume do not have to be explained. That help? :-)      ",

            "answer_text": "Part of my dislike for grading papers is that I spend a lot of time doing it. I have roughly 160 students. If I spend two minutes grading a paper, that\u2019s more than five hours. Consider that. I\u2019ll likely assign six to eight projects. At the low end, that\u2019s 30 hours of grading just essays. Then there\u2019s the fact that most of them are just \u201cblah.\u201d A very, very few will be decent. None of them will be something I actually want to read. Still, it\u2019s part of the job. ",
