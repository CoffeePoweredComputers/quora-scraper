            "answer_text": "The important thing, I think, is not to conflate education and schooling. (I\u2019m not saying you, in particular, are conflating these two, but most people do.) Education is the development of the human person, of growing knowledge and skills, making them more capable of thriving in their communities. Schooling is a particular means of delivering education, focused on classrooms and teachers. Public schools is a particular version of schooling, where the teachers are government employees. A public good is defined as one that is non-excludable and non-rival, meaning you cannot restrict the consumption of the good to those who pay, and the consumption of a unit of the good does not diminish the amount available to others. Schooling, of the traditional kind, is not an example of a public good. You can exclude someone from a school, e.g., check their ID against a list of students who have paid. And once a seat is filled by a student, that is one fewer seat available for others. Schooling is not a public good. Now what about the education that may come from schooling? There is a better argument there, that an educated population brings benefits to the community that cannot be excluded, etc. This is the difference between living in a community of fools and living in a community of educated/skilled workers. However, it does not follow that education being a public good is a valid argument for public schools, or even schooling in general. At best it argues for public funding of education vouchers.

            "answer_text": "One interesting fact: Most people do not realize that public education is a top-down, government-run, socialist monopoly. People blithely hand over their children to the government for 12 years, and think nothing about it. Public schools have no incentive to change or compete, because there is no competition. American families need to have choices and school vouchers, so that they can select alternative non-public schools for their children. see Diane Ravitch's blog ",
