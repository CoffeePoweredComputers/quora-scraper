            "answer_text": "In schools the entire year is divided into 2 or 3 terms. You buy text books at the start of the year and they remain the same until the end of the year. After one term gets over a new term starts and you study new topics from the same book. At the end of each term you get Percentage marks scored. At the end of the year you get average percentage. In college the entire year is divided into 2 terms called semester (sem) . For each sem the subjects change and the books change. After one sem gets over you have to buy new books for the next same. At the end of each sem you get your CGPI or Pointer which can be a max 10. At the end of each sem you have to calculate you average pointer. Not much of a difference between the system in school and college. Just college is more costly and it (doesn't) give pointer. School is less costly as compared to college and you get Percentage. ",
