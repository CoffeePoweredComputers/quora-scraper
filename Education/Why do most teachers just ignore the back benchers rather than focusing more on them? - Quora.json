            "answer_text": "IF you want to make the most impact, THEN do you play the talented football players or all the players on the bench? I can see why many teachers do this. However, \u201cGrowing Up Gifted\u201d by Barbara Clark, a gifted person herself, notes that IF you ask the kids who they would ask for help in art, math, language, THEN they select the Gifted student correctly. IF you ask most teachers who is most Gifted, they usually choose the student who is most compliant\u2026the easily taught student. (Teachers tend to psychologically be very judgmental.) In the \u201cAdaptive Math\u201d classes (misbehaving students), many of them were actually Gifted\u2026but had hard to horrendous family situations. I loved teaching this class. Once they understood that I didn't resent teaching this purportedly 'lowlife' class, their interest soared, their bad behavior waned, and they improved tremendously. Judgmentalism makes good disciplinarians; but not necessarily good empatizers! Thus, much to my chagrin, the kind of person that becomes a teacher often 'throws away' or judges students as unworthy of extra effort. However, showing empathy is often taken as weakness by students\u2026and they attack\u2026like a pack of wolves on a defenseless lamb. So, a team teacher approach with a disciplinarian and an empath works best to assist all students, even those on the bench! ",

            "answer_text": "As others have said, some students sit at the back because they think it makes it easier to misbehave, other do it because they are shy. We work out which is which quite quickly. In the era of smart boards and remote clickers, we don\u2019t have to stand at the chalk board any more, so I know a few teachers who deliberately stand at the back of the room to present. I walk around a lot. Sometime I am at the front, sometimes the side, sometimes the back. I will appear behind you (I walk quietly) just as you are passing a note to your friend. I am your worst nightmare - the teacher who was a little shit whilst at school, so knows the tricks and has used them before. If a teacher is ignoring students they are setting themselves up to fail, because those students will take advantage and classroom management will deteriorate. ",
