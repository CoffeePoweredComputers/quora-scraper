            "answer_text": "In addition to requiring the self-discipline mentioned by a couple other people here, there\u2019s the fact that you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. Teachers know the subject and map out a curriculum that covers everything that needs to be covered. As someone doing self study, you have no idea what needs to be covered in your study plan, so you don\u2019t know how important something is to the whole subject, or how much time and energy to put into a specific part. The best thing to do is to get a hold of an old textbook. (You can usually get them on Amazon for really cheap.) Use the textbook to determine what specific subjects you need to cover, and then search out more material on those subjects. The textbook will be handy in finding key words to google. ",
