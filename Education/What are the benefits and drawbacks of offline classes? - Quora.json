            "answer_text": "Benefits of offline classes-: More personal face to face interaction with the teacher which makes the subject more interesting to learn.The teacher will be able to understand if they were able to get their point across correctly to each student by asking them to do activities related to the task.It is easier for students to get doubts and misconceptions clarified as and when the subject matter is being taught. Whereas with online classes,a lot of the lectures are prerecorded which makes doubt clarification very difficult.The entire class-time in offline classes can be dedicated to teaching and learning. Whereas,with online classes a lot of time is valuable class time is wasted in resolving technical glitches.To gain access to online classes you would need a properly functioning internet connection whereas offline classes are accessible to those who do not have a proper internet connection too.There is a chance for the teachers and students to bond with each other and form social relationships.Online classes do not have much scope for social interaction among students.There is more scope for classroom discussions and debates in offline classes. Classroom discussions and debates will broaden one\u2019s understanding of what is being taught as several different perspectives are put on the table. Whereas with online classes,it is just one person talking and the others\u2019 listening/jotting down notes/asking questions.The facial expressions and body language of the students will help the teacher understand if they are keeping the students interested in the class.In dance and physical exercise classes,it is essential for the teacher to check if the exercises are being done the correct way by their students. This is very difficult to do in online classes. Doing the exercises wrong can result in physical injury and will not bring about the desired benefits.Drawbacks of offline classes-: They are more expensive than online classesThey require commute time from your residence to the location of the class.Not the most convenient way of learning for introverts. Since most introverts prefer being by themselves and tend to avoid social interaction.Overall,in my opinion the pros of offline classes far outweigh the cons. I really wish this corona virus pandemic would get over soon, so that I can attend offline classes for fitness and foreign languages. ",

            "answer_text": "- The present situation has really made us all realize the importance of school and classes. Offline classes have been the normal of past generations. But today's generation is leaning more and more towards online mode of education. So let us look at the advantages and disadvantages that offline education offers.  Advantages : 1. One on one interaction with teachers and students. You will be able to connect more effectively with your teachers. There will be an immediate doubt and question response. You will be in a class with your peers which help your social development also. You will learn many more things other than just your course knowledge. 2. Schedule and Discipline ;. There will be a constant schedule. Your time expenditure will be systematic. Offline classes will help you be disciplined and focused on your work. There will less distractions. You will learn to follow a time table. 3. Competition and completion. It is hard to be disciplined when there is no driving force. Teachers and peer competition help in motivating you to study better and meet the deadlines. You cannot skip classes constantly. Competition among your peers will really help you be your best self. Developing spirit is hard to achieve when alone. Disadvantages. 1. Flexibility and accessibility. Many courses are not available offline to everyone. You cannot fit a lot of offline courses in your day to day schedule. You cannot adjust timings and have to comply to set timings of the teacher, which makes it difficult for you to take up more than two courses at a time. Online courses offer more diversity and more opportunities with a basic internet connection. You can take courses from all over the world. Online courses are more easily accessible. 2. Extra money and time consuming . You have to be present at the location where your course is offered. This will leave you with limited options to choose from. This will also add to your accommodation and travel cost. If we keep the money factor aside, traveling also consumes a lot of time if you live in a city. Traveling is also very tiring which will only reduce your productivity. 3. Self study factor . Offline courses don't offer much scope for self studying. Teachers are there to guide you every step of the way which may sometimes result in spoon feeding. Also offline classes are more tiring as you have to work your way around them. The schedule is not flexible. This leads to little time for self study and personal development. So all in all online and offline modes of education offer their own set of advantages and disadvantages. It is up to you on how well you utilize the resources provided.
