            "answer_text": "The college is situated near to the L.B Nagar Constituency in the village named Nadergul approx 10 kms from the constituency.The college is established in 2004 and located in a peaceful weather with good ambient conditions.The infrastructure of this college, faculty and discipline plays an important role for the development. Coming to branches,the college has only 5 branches i.e ME,CE,CSE,ECE and EEE of B.TECH Regarding myself, I am the student from MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.The faculty of my department are not so well experienced.They will just harass the students for each and every reason.Only 2 to 3 faculty are experienced out of approx 15 membered staff and those total faculty are from Karnataka. Its my kind request to that who are seeking the admissions into this college,please don't choose MECHANICAL ENGINEERING rather choose it from other ENGINEERING STREAMS. Edit 1:Coming to transportation, there is only one RTC bus that for the entire village and the college students are suffering from transportation.Better to come with own vehicle. Edit 2:The above mentioned Karnataka faculty of my dept. had left the college because they've got higher opportunities with good pay scale BEST OF LUCK FOR YOUR FUTURE AND CHOOSE THE RIGHT PATH.HAVE A GOOD DAY ",
