            "answer_text": "I am a single mom. My daughter, now almost 22 years old,was born on my 38th birthday. By the time I became a parent, most of my friends already had children - some in high school. I'd had many years to observe other parents and see what worked and what didn't. I'm also someone who tends to analyze things - a LOT - and tries to think of better ways to do them. One of the things that always bothered me was when I'd see a child \"acting up\" in public, and the parent would say to the child \"Behave yourself!\" That phrase - \"Behave yourself\" - is absolutely meaningless to a child. The \"right\" behavior is always situational; the right behavior in a library, for example, is different than what is acceptable on the playground, in a restaurant, in a grocery store, at church, etc..  As adults, we've spent decades in these environments, so the correct way to behave in each of them has become second nature. But for children, these are \"alien worlds.\" Furthermore, as adults we know what to do if we're thrown into an unfamiliar situation; we watch what other people are doing, and try to model our behavior after theirs. Children aren't mature enough to do this. While I was pregnant, I thought about this quite a bit and tried to devise a way to approach this issue with my own child. It seemed to me much of the \"bad behavior\" and tantrums I saw with children in public spaces might be caused by the children feeling insecure - not understanding exactly how they should behave in those situations, because no specific guidance had been given. I decided whenever I took my daughter anywhere, I would always tell her where we were going and why, what we'd be doing there, what she might expect to see and hear, and what specific behaviors I expected her to follow (both what she could and could not do). I decided the best time to communicate these things to her would be when I was getting her out of her carseat after I'd parked the car, because what I'd told her would be easier for her to remember if she received the information right before we entered whatever place we were going. To get myself into the practice of doing this, I started with the very first time I took her out - when she was only a week old - with a trip to the supermarket. No, she couldn't understand what I was saying, but for this to work, I knew I needed to make it a part of our routine right off the bat. At the beginning, I was training myself to do it, even though at a week old, I knew she wouldn't understand a word. Children's receptive language skills develop well before their expressive language skills - but there's no clear-cut age at which I'd know definitively she understood what I was saying. So it seemed best just to start off right after she was born - to ingrain the habit of doing it in myself. For the supermarket, I'd say \"We're going into this store to buy food. While we're in the store, you must use your \u2018inside voice\u2019. You must stay seated in the cart at all times. What you see in the store doesn't belong to us, until we pay for it when we're done. You may not take things off the shelves. If you want to look at something closer, you may ask me. We are only here to buy certain things - we're not buying candy or toys today. But, I will let you choose some fruit to buy if you'd like. If you don't follow the rules, we'll have to leave the store immediately - then we won't have food to take home and eat.\" When she was older, and mobile, instead of telling her she had to stay seated in the cart, I said \"You must stay with me, and walk with one hand on the cart at all times. There is no running in the store.\" For the library: \"This place has wonderful books for us to read. While inside, you must use your 'quiet voice'. You may not run. You must stay near me at all times. If there is a book you'd like to look at, show me and I'll take it out for you - because every book here has a special spot and if they're not put back in their special spot, other people won't be able to find them. If you'd like, we can find some good books to borrow and take them home to read. But, if you don't follow the rules, we'll have to leave immediately - then we won't be able to borrow books.\" For a restaurant: \"We're going to be eating dinner here. While we're here, you must use your 'inside voice'. You must stay in your chair, sitting down, at all times. You may not play with the silverware, or anything on the table. They'll be a list of all the different foods we can eat, and I'll help you choose something you'll like. There will be a nice person who will bring us our food, so remember to say 'please' and 'thank you\u2019. If you need to use the potty, tell me quietly and I'll take you. You must eat using your best manners; using your fork and spoon - not your fingers. You must be careful not to drop your food on the floor. We're going to have something really yummy to eat - but, if you don't follow the rules, we'll have to leave - and then we'll be hungry.\" I had similar guidelines for every other place we'd go - malls, toy stores, the park, etc. This little talk never took more than a couple of minutes, and I continued doing it every time we went anywhere, even places she'd been to many times before, up until my daughter was 8 or 9 years old. After that, I'd only do it if we were going someplace she was not familiar with. One important note is that I was a parent who always followed through. If I told my daughter \"If you do 'X', 'Y' will happen\" she knew it would. If I told her she had to stay seated in her chair in a restaurant, and if she didn't we'd leave - she knew that was exactly what would happen. I was always careful never to use 'empty threats' with my daughter - I only gave her negative consequences for behavior I was 100% willing to follow through with.  The longest talk we every had was when we had to fly. This talk took place in the gate area, while we'd wait to board. I told her she had to use her 'inside voice', stay in her seat, with her seatbelt on, during the flight - unless she needed to use the potty. I told her she had to be careful not to bump or kick the seat in front of her, and that there was a tray that would fold down for her to use, but that it wasn't a toy to put up and down, up and down. I talked about any meals we'd be served, and that there would be a flight attendant who would bring us our food, drinks, and anything else we needed while flying - and to remember to say 'please' and 'thank you.' I also explained her ears might start to hurt while we were in the air, and if they did, to tell me because there were things she could do to make them stop hurting. I explained turbulence, and the different sounds she might hear. One of my proudest moments was when we took a trip when my daughter was just four years old, and we were upgraded to first class. As the remaining first class passengers were boarding, a gentleman walked past us on his way to his seat, saw my daughter, and muttered \"Oh, THIS is going to be a fun flight.\" My daughter was perfectly behaved the entire flight, and as the gentleman deplaned, he gave me a huge smile and patted my daughter on the head. Believe it or not, my daughter never misbehaved or had a tantrum in public. Not once. I'm convinced that knowing exactly what to expect, what was expected of her in every situation - and what would happen if she didn't follow the rules - was the primary factor in avoiding misbehavior and tantrums. Yes, I spent a couple of minutes giving her \"the talk\" every time we went anywhere - but by doing that, I saved hours and hours (and lots of potential embarrassment) by not having to deal with a \u201cproblem child.\" Was my daughter an unusually docile and well-behaved child? No. She did have the occasional \"melt-down\" at home - just like other children - when she couldn't have something she wanted, or was tired/hungry/etc.. But out in public, she always behaved according to the specific rules I had given her. ",

            "answer_text": "My mother's younger sister is about twelve years younger to her. Lets call her \u2018A\u2019. When I hit puberty, A was this young, petite woman in her late twenties who turned heads with her impeccable beauty and enticing charm; atleast in the eyes of my mother. It was almost ridiculous how my mother appreciated this ironically average narcissist, never finding any flaw in her. A was destined to live a envious life with a guy who'd kill for a fairy that she was. I had only a little problem with the obsession, but it aggravated when casual remarks of comparison were passed, that were cruel to say the least. I had gained weight and was later diagnosed with PCOD. \u2018Look at all the flab that you've put on. A is like twice your age but looks younger than you.\u2019 \u2018A probably weighs 5 pounds less than you.\u2019 \u2018You should spend more time with A. She'll help you look like a pretty girl.\u2019 \u2018Look at A\u2019s flawless skin. Wish you'd have that?\u2019 \u2018A is like milky white. You can barely pass for the wheatish complexion scale.\u2019 \u2018Guys would kill for someone like A. She's getting so many proposals. I'm glad we won't have to worry about that in your case, since you look like a cow.\u2019 The next thing I knew would be A pooped diamonds. Seriously, for a teenager facing all those body image, confidence and self esteem issues, it not only ruined my self image but also pushed me far, far away from my mother. A is close to forty and alone, with no significant career or achievements in her life apart from filling her wardrobe with fanciest clothes from everywhere. Meanwhile, ten years down the line I'm still bridging gaps with my mom. I've not given birth and know little about parenting, but I could give you one tip. Unless you want your child to question your parenting or land at a therapist trying to find solutions to the emotional trauma you gave them, never ever ever ever keeping pitting them against random people or even their own sibling.
