            "answer_text": "Ok, so this makes me really nostalgic\u2026 It was a fine exam day, and I was well-prepared. Well, I guess I was better in studies then than now\u2026 I was in Class 5. The class room had a projector and a white board which served as a screen. Now, many a times, teachers used to write on the board using markers rather than switching on the projector and opening notepad and writing with a stylus (our class teacher was not much used to working with computers etc.) Now, the fun began when the teacher exclaimed, \u201cI can't find the keys!\u201d Now, we instantly understood what 'keys\u2019 she could not find. The computer was always locked in a cupboard, and it was locked using a typical lock. That lock's key was missing. Remember, that was a 40-minute exam, and 10 minutes were already gone. Then she started to write the questions using markers on the white board. We started to copy down them. We were halfway through the second page when she said, \u201cOh! I gave you wrong questions! Strike off everything you have written!\u201d At this moment, one of my classmates gave an exclamation of disgust (which was normal considering the situation, but he made it was too louder than he had intended). And then, our teacher said this line, which I still remember: \u201cWho is making this exclamation? If you need to write a thing hundred times, you'll have to write it. And if this does not suit you, you are free to get out of the class!\u201d And after everything was over, the time said that only 10 minutes were remaining. I could have answered every question by that time. PS:- I don't remember how much I got in the exam, but I remember that I did not get a scolding. But yes, the teacher did say that we did not study anything\u2026 THANKS FOR READING ",
