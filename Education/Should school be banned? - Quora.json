            "answer_text": "So, wait:  is your solution that kids who were formerly in school work instead or that they stay home?  Either way: terrible, terrible idea. If they're at work: (1). They're not getting more exercise - they're getting less.  There's no gym period or recess at work. (2). Replace the stress of school with the stress of work. (3). Now all those kids who would have taken a school bus to a central location need to get to a place of private employment.  Workable in cities like New York with good public transportation systems - though they're likely to get trampled amongst all the adults, and they'll overcrowd an already crowded system.  Everywhere else, since these kids can't drive themselves, parents will have to spend even more time commuting since they now have to drop off an additional worker.  No savings in oil consumption.  Expect more traffic. (4). People struggle now to save enough for retirement.  Now they won't be able to keep their jobs if they need them, because there's a giant young workforce and the elderly are easily replaced.  It's incredibly difficult to find comparable employment if you lose your job in your 50s now - it will be impossible under the scenario you describe. (5). Children will be miserable at work compared to school.  I'd take school over work any day.  Moreover, developing young brains need exposure to a wide variety of subjects - they won't get that at work.   If they stay home: (6). Great - now someone has to look out for them.  We could come up with a public day care program, but there go those tax savings.  Otherwise one parent will have to stay home, taking out a huge portion of the workforce who won't earn, spending will go down, and the economy will be in the toilet.  (7). How are these kids being socialized?  School does more than teach academic subjects.  If these kids are just sitting at home, they're only meeting those kids that are the children of their parents' friends, and not being introduced to people different than them. (8). What if the parents can't afford to stay home?  Now you have kids running around unsupervised.  Expect more petty crime.   Either way: (9). Jobs will now have to educate workers.  Even low level employment often requires basic arithmetic and reading skills, which these kids don't have because they've never been to school. (10). I don't know where you are, but in the U.S. a significant portion of the population doesn't understand the basics of the scientific method, doesn't understand that 1/3 is greater than 1/4, and can't name the three branches of the U.S. government.  And you want the populace to be less educated?  How would that help anyone?  Everyone needs a basic education in science, math, reading, history, and geography.  The alternative results in antivaxxers, climate change deniers, Trump supporters, and people who can't locate Canada on a map.  We have enough of those as it is. All of society benefits from public education.  It keeps kids off the street and out of trouble.  It provides them with a vital social education as well as an academic one.  Private employers benefit from an educated workforce.  Nations benefit from educated voters.  Work alone cannot provide all that. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow Great Idea!!!! Oo oo.... I have some more to add;Lets legalise drugs-1) People would be happier and in good mood all the time.2) Huge return on investment- can be a great source of income for the government.3) Less crimes- people would be busy hallucinating most of the time.4) Possible solution to world population explosion- drugs would be more attractive than sex when easily available in free market. Lets legalise Prostitution also,1) New source of income to the women.2) We would finally get one career where in women can absolutely dominate their male counterparts.3) Huge tax collection.4) Less crimes on women- since everyone would be satisfied, no sexual assault on women. You see where i am going with this, don't you?You can take the most evil thing prevalent in our society and can still see something good in it. This doesn't necessarily mean that it would be a great idea overall. What i dint mention up there are the evils such as health risks, impact on family and social and economical impact of drugs and prostitution on the society and country much like how you forgot to take into consideration the evil impact of your idea. Millions of people have invested billions of hours to learn things which have enabled us to be the master of this planet. Schools are the only practical and feasible means for childrens to interact with each other and learn these things.Disrobing the childrens from this privilege would eventually create a society of illiterates and would push the civilisation to the stone age.
