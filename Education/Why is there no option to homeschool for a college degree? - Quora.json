            "answer_text": "I think we need to distinguish here between traditional homeschooling where the parent is in charge of the student\u2019s education, where the diploma, if there is one, is issued by the parent, and online options from accredited schools that are done at home. You are right, there is no option for traditional homeschooling at the college level where the parent is in charge and would issue the bachelor\u2019s degree. The answer to why would seem pretty obvious to me. The courses required for different bachelor\u2019s degrees are fairly different. If my RN has a bachelor of science in nursing, it wouldn\u2019t have any validity if it were issued by her mother who had a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting. Nobody is going to recognize a self issued or parent issued bachelor of science or arts. There is validity to self education, and many people without a degree or higher education are hired for some types of positions. Life experience counts for more in the workplace than it does in schools of any type. However, the validity of self-education is a different question. Even though that traditional option doesn\u2019t exist, there are many online university programs that issue bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees. They may not be from the most elite universities, but they are from accredited, reputable universities. Not everybody attends the most elite universities, not everyone needs to, and if they did, they would no longer be elite. In a few words, for a lot of people \u201celite university\u201d is a bragging right, even if they offer a genuine advantage in terms of their prestige. A relative who attended one of those average state universities is now a professor at one of the country\u2019s top medical schools. He isn\u2019t even 40. He is driven. That\u2019s the biggest difference between the different types of graduates. I could type out a list of many online accredited bachelor\u2019s degrees. I won\u2019t. I will give you this link which lists many of the most reputable. They include very recognizable names, including public and private universities. https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/bachelors/rankings The degree itself does not distinguish that it was given for online courses. An employer might be familiar with the program and know, but there is no need for you to disclose it if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s not a part of the degree. A bachelor\u2019s degree in business is a degree in business administration. Period. The problems with strictly online bachelor\u2019s degrees are the low graduation rates and the lack of human contact. I have taken online university courses. I find them much more difficult than on campus courses. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have their place. Many of the best programs are hybrids, meaning that students attend both online and on campus courses. They are best in my opinion for working adults, not for your average 18-year-old college student. Being on campus offers the opportunity to meet people and make connections that you generally don\u2019t have in an online program. There is support through professors you actually see and meet. You can make in person appointment with academic counselors. That doesn\u2019t exist in the virtual world. Given all that, you need to decide what\u2019s best for you. What are you\u2019re more likely to finish? What will suit your needs?. If you live in a very rural area, maybe it\u2019s a good idea to look into online opportunities. If you live in an urban area with lots of options, you might find they are not the best choice. If you\u2019re looking at homeschooling for college as a way to never leave the house, that\u2019s really not a good reason. While employers do not know the difference between an online or an in-person degree, they can spot a person who never leaves the house and has no work or life experience in a second. Life experience can be just as important as where you get your college education. Don\u2019t write off leaving the house. ",

            "answer_text": "Attending school until age 16 or 18 (depending on the state) is legally required in the U.S. Truants can be arrested. Home schooling is an alternative to organized schools for parents who prefer tp educate their children at home instead. Going to college is not legally mandated, so there is no need to provide an alternative. However, many higher education institutions provide on-line or self-study alternative versions of courses, permitting individuals to attempt to earn a degree without setting foot in a classroom. Three reputable institutions that do not offer classroom instruction are Empire State College of SUNY and Excelsior College (private) in New York State and Thomas Edison State University in New Jersey.
