            "answer_text": " I wrote a detailed post on How should a person in their early 20s invest their money. The following are quick tips that should help you get started with investing. Also, I wrote an ultimate guide for tech employees about Real Estate investing that you all should find helpful. First, let's start with savings If you save your money and live beneath your means you will accumulate sufficient savings for a healthy retirement.Not having a financial budget is bad. A strict budget that makes you hate the present for hopes of a heavenly future is worse. A flexible budget that allows you to enjoy the present while saving for the future is ideal.No one ever made more money by stressing about money. If your excess money is stressing you out, give it away or live in a communist country. If your perceived lack of money is stressing you out, turn that energy towards a side hustle to make money.More money won't solve your problems. If anything it will amplify your problems.Decrease your wants in life. The less wants you have, the happier you will be.There's more joy in eating $1.99 tacos in the company of friends than eating a $200 steak in the company of associates.I know a man that made $100M and then gave it all to charity. He told me financial security isn't a number, it's a mindset.Networth is not a good measure of success or well-being. I would define wealth has the ability to fulfill your needs (shelter, food, hobbies, entertainment, and charity). Nassim Talib defines true wealth as the following: Worriless sleeping, Clear conscience, Reciprocal gratitude, Absence of envy, Frequent laughs, No meeting rooms, and Periodic surprises.Regarding your investmentsYour money flows into two different buckets: The Retirement bucket - I want to protect and moderately grow the wealth I have. Great for building a retirement plan or those of us who are in the late stages of our life, need to secure a stable income, or just don't have time to learn about investing. But not so great for us who want to substantially grow their wealth. This bucket needs to be filled first through maxing out your 401k with standard target retirement index funds. If you have an employer\u2019s match, you need to max that out first before investing.The investing bucket - I want to aggressively grow the wealth I have by investing in specific investment sectors that I\u2019m knowledgeable in and can withstand the risk in doing so.Unfortunately people mix up these two buckets and they focus too much time on the retirement bucket, which should be set it and forget it, and focus too little time on the investing bucket, which is where most of your wealth can be made. The financial industry wants you to focus only on bucket one so they can maximize their fees. So they will focus on telling you that you must put all your money in index funds, and think about all of the compounding interest you will miss out on if you don\u2019t give us your money now!Too many people focus on compounding interest and other explanations, but they fail to focus on two things:They don\u2019t understand the importance of compound time. If you invest time when you\u2019re young learning about investing, the time compounds upon itself and allows you to make bigger and better decisions for your investing bucket.They fail to understand that most things that matter can\u2019t be measured in the short term. Yes, throwing your money into an index fund when you\u2019re 20 is great because your money will have more time to compound, which is easily quantifiable. But! Typically the most profitable investment decisions aren\u2019t easily quantifiable. The time you spent gaining experience in investing allows you to capitalize on investments that offer a far higher rate of return that isn\u2019t accessible in normal index funding investing.Lets say you invested in an individual stock, and this stock tanked, but in the process you learned how to research investments. Now I\u2019m not talking about timing the market, technical analysis, or any of that other stuff.Instead, you will learn:The importance of a companies vision.How to assess the performance of management.You\u2019ll start listening to quarterly calls to learn about how the business functions and you will hear financial analysts ask questions of the CEO so you can learn how professionals analyze investments.How to spot competitive advantages, which drive returns.How to read financial statementsLearning to how to spot growing markets and shrinking markets.Understanding the important of market psychology when making investments (i.e. learning when the market is over reacting so you can pounce on good opportunities).You will learn how to filter out noise from true information, which helps you focus on information that is truly relevant for your investments.All of these skills are not quantifiable in the short term, but in the long term they are infinity more powerful than putting your money in a passive index fund.By learning these skills early, you can apply this knowledge outside of the stock market, which can help you build true wealth, instead of passively investing in assets that help others get wealthy.Aim for simplicity in your investments.As soon as you make an investment you lose all objectivity. Before buying anything write a note to yourself about why you're buying the asset and when you plan to sell. If the asset begins to fall out of favor, check your note. If your original reason for buying the asset is still valid, hang on.Investments go through seasons (a time to plant, a time to nurture, a time to harvest, and a time to do nothing). If you lose sight of the seasons and you plant when the season is asking you to harvest, you will find yourself in a world of hurt.Don't let your money burn a hole into your pocket. If you become greedy enough eventually you'll find great ways to lose your money in poor investments.Good investing is boring as hell and if it isn't, you're doing something wrong.Fall in love with a good bowl of ice cream or great bbq, don't fall in love with an investment.Cash flow isn't only generated by real estate. It can be generated via company dividends. A side hustle. Writing software. Consulting. Etc. Focus on growing cash flow.Reader: Jordan, you talked about stocks, what about real estate? That\u2019s a deeper subject and I wrote an ultimate guide on it that you can find here.About financial planningFinancial planning is a relatively recent development in human society and thousands of generations of humans have done quite fine without an MBA taking 1% of assets under management.Financial advice is only as good as the provider's inherent conflict of interest. Financial planners will always tell you to put more in stock/index funds because that's how they earn fees. Syndicators will tell you to invest in commercial Re when it's overvalued because they need to pay for their overhead costs.Financial planners love to extrapolate your investment returns over a smooth 30 year time horizon showing your assets growing at a healthy and steady clip. They trick people into thinking they must deploy their cash at all times so the financial planners can gain their fees. In reality that's never the case. Hence, there will be times to sit on your cash and other times to deploy it. Heaven help you if you retire in the midst of a financial crisis and have to sell off your assets at a 50% discount.Read books on human psychology and that will grow & protect your wealth more than any guru or high priced newsletter (Speaking of free newsletters :) Investors Therapy - Revue )On early retirementEarly retirement is a great concept that grows in popularity in times of plenty but soon implodes in times of famine. Retiring in your 20s and 30s provides your investments minimal time to compound and you miss out on extended years of compounding due to you mooching off of the success of your investments. Heaven help you if you get sick or want to raise a family.Young people have great health, but want money. Old people have money, but want great health. Your assets will grow over time, don't try to rush the process by swinging for the fences via a super risky investment.If your goal in life is to save so you can do something you want to do, odds are you are suffering from grass is always greener disease and avoiding your real problem, you're too afraid to make the tough call to work in a field you enjoy.If anyone says to you \"risk-adjusted\" or \"efficient frontier,\" run.On partnerships and family when it pertains to moneyPart of something is better than all of nothing. When you partner with someone share the love, make sure they earn a fair share of the rewards of the partnership so they will move heaven and earth to work with you again.If you're thinking about taking someone's cash for an investment and the first thing they tell you is how bad the last deal provider was, run. Odds are the investor has the problem, not the deal provider.It's better to provide your kids with too much love and little money than too little love and too much money.Luxury not only drains your wallet it drains your soul. Before failed empires were conquered by barbarians, these empires were mentally conquered by luxury. Luxury creates sloth, entitlement, disconnects us from the suffering of the unfortunate, and clouds our judgment with a sense of superiority.I went to a rich man's sparsely attended funeral where people were there for their wallets, and I've been to a poor man's crowded funeral where people were there for their hearts.For the love of god & science spread the wealth around. Pay for people's dinners, tip your waiter generously, do something good with your wealth.Thanks for all the votes, everyone! For every 25 votes over 50, I\u2019ll add 2 more tips.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve helped more than 500,000 young people just like you start investing with my NYT bestselling book that covers investing in detail. I\u2019m going to give you all the major points here. Here\u2019s the most important thing for you to do right now. Forget cutting back on avocado toast and lattes, stop scrolling through Instagram for a few minutes, and JUST START. Literally doing any investing while in your 20s will put you miles ahead of people who decide to invest later in life. Fact is, if you start investing in your early 20s, you will have accumulated more wealth than someone who starts in their 30s. (And if you are already in your 30s and beyond, it\u2019s not too late either.)  Ignore all the conspiracy theorists online who try to scare you away from investing. Don\u2019t get scared into inaction. I\u2019m going to make it easy for you to get started. This is my Ladder of Personal Finance for investing in your future. These are the steps to focus on, in this exact particular order -- hence, a ladder. Each step builds on the previous one, so when you finish the first, go on to the second. If you can\u2019t get to the fifth step, don\u2019t worry. You can still feel great since most people never even get to the first step. Don\u2019t worry if you get a little confused, I\u2019ll go into more detail on this everything afterwards. Here\u2019s how it works: Rung #1: Contribute to your 401k. Does your employer offer a 401k match? Invest up to the match percentage. If you have a 5% match, start by investing 5% of your paycheck to get that free money. Don\u2019t have a 401k match from your employer? It\u2019s still worth investing in, but consider negotiating for one (like many of my readers have).Rung #2: Your debt. Tackling your debt is key to making sure you\u2019re getting the most out of your money, and will help you move up the ladder.Rung #3: Roth IRA. Unlike your 401k, this investment account allows you to invest after-tax money and you collect no taxes on the earnings. As of writing this, you can contribute up to $6,000 / year. Plus you can withdraw the principal amount you put in at any time, with no penalties. There\u2019s even other withdrawal exceptions for major life events and emergencies.Rung #4: Max out your 401k. Contribute as much as possible to it (yes, beyond the employer match).You can contribute up to $18,000/year on your 401k if you\u2019re under 50.Rung #5: Non-retirement account. If you have money left to invest, open a regular non-retirement account and put as much as possible there. Also pay extra on any mortgage debt you have, and consider investing in yourself \u2014 whether it\u2019s starting a side hustle or getting an additional degree, there\u2019s often no better investment than your own career.The Ladder of Personal Finance can be a lot to take in, but it\u2019s pretty handy when considering what to prioritize when it comes to your investments. (Check out my 3 minute Youtube Video on it) This system shows you where you should be prioritizing your money. Now I want to take a deeper look into a few of these rungs as well as show you a system to automate it all. 401k: Free money from your employer  A 401k is one of the most powerful investment vehicles at your disposal. Here\u2019s how it works: Each time you get your paycheck, a percentage of your pay is taken out and put into your 401k pre-tax. This means you\u2019ll only pay taxes on it after you withdraw your contributions when you retire. Often times, your employer will match your contributions up to a certain percentage. For example, imagine you make $150,000 / year. Your company offers 3% matching with their 401k plan. If you invested 3% of your salary (around $5,000) into your 401k, your company would match your amount \u2014 effectively doubling your investment. Here\u2019s a graph showcasing this:  This, my friends, is free money (aka the best kind of money). Not all companies offer a matching plan \u2014 but it\u2019s rare to find one that doesn\u2019t. If your company offers a match you should at least invest enough to take full advantage of it. Where\u2019s my money going? The great thing about 401ks is how easy they are for you to set up. You just have to opt in when your company\u2019s HR department offers it. They\u2019ll withdraw only as much as you want them to invest from your paycheck. You have the option to choose your investments when you put money into a 401k. However, most companies also give you the option to entrust your money with a professional investing company. They\u2019ll give you a variety of investment options to choose from and can help answer any questions you have about your 401k. When do I get my money? You can take money out of your 401k when you turn 59 \u00bd years old. This is the beginning of the federally recognized retirement age.If you take it earlier Uncle Sam is going to hit you with a 10% federal penalty on your funds along with the taxes you have to pay on the amount you withdraw. If you should ever decide to leave your company, your money comes with you! For more on 401ks, be sure to check out my article on how the account is the best way to grow your money. Roth IRA: The best long-term investment  Unlike a 401k, a Roth IRA leverages after-tax money to give you an even better deal. This means you put already taxed income into investments such as stocks or bonds and pay no money when you withdraw it. Chances are your tax bracket when you\u2019re 50 is probably going to be higher than when you\u2019re 20 if you\u2019re even remotely successful in your career, so if you\u2019re young, and you don\u2019t have an employer 401(k) match, a Roth IRA is the best investment you can make. When saving for retirement, your greatest advantage is time. You have time to weather the bumps in the market. And over the years, those tax-free gains are an amazing deal. Your employer won\u2019t offer you a Roth IRA. To get one, you\u2019ll have to go through a broker \u2014 I personally recommend Charles Schwaab, Vanguard, and E*TRADE. Most brokers require a minimum amount for opening a Roth IRA (for Vanguard it\u2019s $1000). However, they might waive the minimum if you set up a regular automatic investment plan. As of 2019, the yearly maximum Roth IRA investment is $6000. This amount changes often though so be sure to check out the IRS contribution limitations page to keep updated. Where\u2019s my money going? Once your account is set up, you\u2019ll have to actually invest the money. Let me say that again, once you set up the account and put money into it, you still need to invest your money. If you don\u2019t purchase stocks, bonds, ETFs, or whatever else, your money will just be sitting in a glorified savings account not accruing any substantial amount of interest. My suggestion for what you should invest in? An index fund that tracks the S&P 500. The S&P 500 averages a return of 10% (according to Investopedia) and is managed with barely any fees. Ignore the scare tactics of other people here who say it\u2019s a risky investment. When do I get my money? Like your 401k, you\u2019re expected to treat this as a long-term investment vehicle. You are penalized if you withdraw your earnings before you\u2019re 59 \u00bd years old. But you can withdraw your principal, or the amount you actually invested from your pocket, at any time, penalty-free (most people don\u2019t know this). There are also exceptions for down payments on a home, funding education for you/partner/children/grandchildren, and some other emergency reasons. Asset allocation: The most important thing in investing 401ks and Roth IRAs are the baseline investment vehicles you need to have. If you want to start dipping your toes in building your own portfolio (collection of investment assets) beyond these investment vehicles, I want to introduce you to one key concept: Asset allocation. Here\u2019s my portfolio:  Whenever I\u2019m teaching someone about the basics of investing, someone will pipe up with a myriad of questions like these: \u201cWhat stocks should I buy?\u201d\u201cIs X company a good investment?\u201d\u201cIs $XX too much for this stock?\u201dBefore you make an investment in any sort of stock or bond or whatever, you need to understand that asset allocation (i.e., what your pie looks like) is way more important. When you invest, you can do so by allocating your money across different asset classes. Though there are many different kinds of asset classes, the three most common ones are: Stocks and mutual funds (\u201cequities\u201d). When you own a company\u2019s stocks, you own part of that company. These are generally considered to be \u201criskier\u201d because they can grow or shrink quickly. You can diversify that risk by owning mutual funds, which are essentially baskets of stocks.Bonds. These are like IOUs that you get from banks. You\u2019re lending them money in exchange for interest over a fixed amount of time. These are generally considered \u201csafer\u201d because they have a fixed (if modest) rate of return.Cash. This includes liquid money and the money that you have in your checking and savings accounts.Investing in only one category is dangerous over the long term. This is where the all-important concept of asset allocation comes into play. Remember it like this: Diversification is D for going deep into a category (e.g., stocks have large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, and international stocks). Asset allocation is A for going across all categories (e.g., stocks, bonds, and cash). How much you allocate in each asset class depends completely on you and your risk tolerance. For example, if you\u2019re young and have many years before you retire, you might want to invest more in things like stocks. But if you\u2019re older and are close to retirement age, you want to hedge your bets as much as possible and go with safe investments like bonds. You don\u2019t want to keep all your investments in one basket. Keep your asset allocation in check by buying different types of stocks and funds to have a balanced portfolio \u2014 and then further diversifying in each of those asset classes. 91.5% of the results from long-term portfolio performance came from how the investments were allocated (according to a 1991 study). This means that asset allocation is CRUCIAL to how your portfolio performs. If you want some more solid examples of portfolio mixes, check out my article on asset allocation and diversification. Stocks and CDs and bonds \u2014 oh my! Roth IRA or 401(k): The Nitty Gritty Right now, you\u2019re probably wondering if your better off investing in a 401(k) or a Roth IRA. The simple answer is both: These accounts, while conceptually different, work together pretty well. Here's how I think about it. First, I would max out any 401(k) match that my company provides. Second, I'd max out the $6,000 for my Roth IRA. Third, I'd max out the rest of my 401(k), up to $15,000. Finally\u2013if your employer doesn't offer a 401(k), you're not employed yet, or you still have money left over\u2013I'd open a regular, taxable investment account and put money in stocks, index funds, etc. Why max out your Roth IRA before your 401(k)? Well, there's a lot of dorky debate in the personal finance world, but the basic reasons are taxes and tax policy: Assuming your career goes well, you'll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, meaning that you'd have to pay more taxes with a 401(k). Another common reason for the Roth is that tax rates are considered likely to increase.  That\u2019s it! I just want you to know that even taking the time to read about this topic as a young person is amazing, and that you\u2019re doing great. You\u2019re making me, your Surrogate Asian Father, very proud. If all you do after reading this is contribute up to your 401k match or invest a little bit into your Roth IRA every month, you\u2019ll still be ahead of more than 75% of young people when it comes to investing. Let other people sweat the small stuff. Take care of the Big Wins first and enjoy the freedom of investing in whatever you want, knowing your finances are taken care of. Ready for more? I wrote a giant free guide on personal finance for young people called The Ultimate Guide to Personal Finance that expands on what I\u2019ve talked about here.
