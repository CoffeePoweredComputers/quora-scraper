            "answer_text": "Yes, if you really WANT to get into a college, you will get into a college\u2026 But, you have to WORK in school, in order to get into a college! I had NO high school at all, and I now have an AA, and a BA, and a Masters Degree. I walked into a community college, when I was 33 years old, WITH NO EDUCATION AT ALL, and I got my GED, and an Associates Degree\u2026 I was accepted to every four year, private university that I applied too, and given Full Scholarships, and I graduated from Smith College, a TOP school, with honors. After that, I went to another top school, on a full scholarship, for my masters, and I graduated with honors. It is a LOT harder to DO that when you're OLDER\u2026 I had rent to pay, and bills to pay, and a whole bunch of other adult responsibilities\u2026 But, I\u2019d spent a LOT of time in the world WITHOUT an education, and it was very, very DIFFICULT to be an uneducated adult\u2026 My entire life MASSIVELY IMPROVED after I obtained an education! So, do it NOW, while you're young. Do you school work. Improve your grades. Start at a community college, if you have too. Do NOT sign up for an uneducated adult life. You will STRUGGLE, financially. You will have extremely limited work options. Trust me, THAT LIFE IS A LOT HARDER THAN SCHOOL IS!!! ",
