            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty standard, at least in the U.S. Just look at some undergraduate QM syllabi online or the first 1/2 to 2/3 of a book like Griffiths. I\u2019d just like to add that at some schools there is a course usually taken prior to Quantum Mechanics that covers some aspects of \u201cquantum physics\u201d (and often special relativity). This is often referred to as \u201cModern Physics\u201d and may reference a text like this. The distinction between quantum physics and quantum mechanics here is, broadly, that the former is concerned primarily with the results and applications of the latter. In other words, in a course like Modern Physics, you may learn how to calculate probabilities and expectation values in the position basis (e.g. the expectation value of the radial coordinate in the Hydrogen atom). But you are unlikely to learn what the position basis is, or that there are other bases you could work with, or anything to do with bras and kets. As an analogy, the quantum physics portions of a Modern Physics course will teach you how to drive a simple quantum car, while an introductory course in quantum mechanics will teach you how the simplest type of quantum car works (provided it\u2019s not driving too fast, of course).

            "answer_text": "An Intro to QM course is typically run at second year undergrad level. It covers the topics you find in an intro to QM text book intended for the college in question. Typically you get the time-independent schrodinger equation, copenhagen interpretation, potential wells, and QM operators. A vague idea about observables\u2026 and what counts as a measurement. It typically comes under the heading \u201cwave mechanics\u201d. You\u2019ll be doing a lot of triple integration by parts\u2026 in fact, you\u2019ll end up being able to do that sort of thing in your head. There will be basic applications \u2026 say to the atom, and interference at a barrier. Cornu spiral, that sort of thing. Details depend on the college. ",
