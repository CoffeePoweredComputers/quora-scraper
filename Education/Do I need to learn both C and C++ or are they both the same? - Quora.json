            "answer_text": "C was the original language - C++ added a bunch more features to it. (In C, the \u201c++\u201d operator means \u201cadd one\u201d - so the name \u201cC++\u201d is a kind of a joke - meaning \u201cadd one to C\u201d!). So if you learn C++, you only have to know what things don\u2019t work in C and you\u2019re able to write C. However, C++ is, without doubt, the most complicated programming languages in existence. The easiest way to learn C++ is to first learn C - then gradually bring in the additional features of C++ until your brain explodes or something. ",
