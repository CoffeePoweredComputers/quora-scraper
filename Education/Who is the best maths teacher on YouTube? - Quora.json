            "answer_text": "Grant Sanderson - A Standford Graduate & Phd  Hands down! He is having a youtube channel called 3blue1brown.  For one exam, I was learning linear algebra, integral calculus and few more other stuffs \u201cagain\u201d. I already knew, how to solve problems on these areas and I was fairly good at it but when I watched the videos, I came to realize that I knew shit about mathematics. Only thing I learned, was to memorize the formulas and solving the problems. But the way he explains in a lucid animation and a pleasant voice in the background, maths seem less intimidating and more fun with crystal clear concept. I have never seen any other youtube teacher having such a patience to animate the whole concept. In a recent Q&A session he revealed, how much efforts he puts to animate everything using multiple software instead of simply writing it in whiteboard and narrating it. He is an ex member/teacher of khan academy. He is a genius. They say, teacher moulds students future. If he was my teacher during school time, probably I would have been scribbling partial differential equation now. Here is the link to the math heaven- 3Blue1Brown Happy learning! ",

He has a good way of teaching. He is on Numberphile(https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile) and Numberphile2( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyp1gCHZJU_fGWFf2rtMkCg) and also on singingbanana(https://www.youtube.com/user/singingbanana). Check out this video in which he will tell you the total combinations in Enigma Machine. Hope you already know what it is and if you don\u2019t then don\u2019t worry he will also tell you about it\u2026\u2026  Check the flaw in it\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..  ",
