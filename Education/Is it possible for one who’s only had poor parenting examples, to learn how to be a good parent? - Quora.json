            "answer_text": "Absolutely! You have great examples of what not to do. It is good to take a class or buy a book on positive parenting. Get an overall book on Child development-I loved Dr.Spock, and used it often as reference material. Some things to remember; never, never shake a baby, even while playing. You can kill them or cause brain damage. Expect to get frustrated and possibly angry at times, it is normal. Plan on having a crib or other safe place you can put the baby in for a moment while you calm down. Be sure to tell your partner about this and your babysitter. A child should not be left alone for very long-5 minuets at most. If you are feeling way over your head and need a longer break, have a sitter on speed dial, or grandparents, neighbors ect. Do not pick a babysitter or a daycare lightly. You are trusting them with your child. So, could you give them your checkbook and know they wouldn\u2019t steal? Could you leave your account numbers on the table and know they would not be taken advantage of? Do get referrals and check them out. Do utilize one of those little stuffed animals with a camera in it or tape recorder, to use while you are away. Not forever, just to peek in for a while. Babysitters are human too, so don\u2019t overreact if they aren\u2019t perfect once in a while. Unique Warning: When you have been abused, you try so very hard to not do anything wrong, yell, or be mean, which is all good. However, this can get confused with setting limits. Sometimes people swear they will never hit their children or spank, which I fully agree with. However, they don\u2019t learn how or when to set limits, so Kids will push until they get those limitations set. This can lead to loosing it with a child that is being extremely difficult. So, this ends badly, with a child hit or otherwise hurt. Learn what to expect and when, age wise. Learn how to set healthy limitations. Continue to be aware of your own needs. Your history will mean you should have support in place to help your own healing. It can set off or trigger feelings that you felt when being abused as your child hits crucial ages. Be good to yourself, so that you can be good to those kids! ",

            "answer_text": "My father lost his own father at the age of 6, and by the time he was 8 he\u2019d been removed, along with his siblings, from his mother. She ended up spending time in prison for prostituting her own oldest daughter. From 1918 until 1922 my father lived in an orphanage for Catholic boys, where 19 staff (15 nuns and 4 servants) took care of over 120 boys ranging in age from newborn up until age 13. After that, he spent a few years wandering around pretty much unsupervised on the streets. He determined to be a good parent, and a good father. Having lost his own father to heart failure so suddenly, he made sure that, if something happened to him, my brother and I would be well provided for. He and my mother, when they travelled by air, never ever travelled on the same flight, so if something happened one of them would still be there for us. He loved and cuddled us, gave us those opportunities he could afford to, saw to it that there was always food on the table and a roof over our heads. Like all people, he had his shortcomings. Towards the end of my childhood he became an alcoholic, though he was never violent or cruel. (I worried that he might be embarrassing, but in fact he never was as he was one of those alcoholics who manage to function very well on a tank full of booze.) He could, when he\u2019d been drinking, become a bit maudlin and tearful about his own past, he could be forgetful about what he\u2019d told us, and sometimes he was arbitrary (one day it was OK for me to go to the library, the next day it wasn\u2019t). I always feel I could tell two very different stories about my childhood and my father. One was of a loving, caring, intelligent and funny man who did everything he could for his children. The other is of a maudlin, forgetful man who drank too much and could change his mind in the shake of a lamb\u2019s tail for no apparent reason. Given that no one, ever, is the perfect parent, he did pretty damned well despite the sorrows, upheavals, upsets and lack of love in his own childhood. So, for that matter, did his siblings (who, despite being separated, always managed to keep track of each other and later on to help each other out). Somehow all five siblings managed to keep the awfulness of their own childhoods away from their children for the most part. I salute them all for it. ",
