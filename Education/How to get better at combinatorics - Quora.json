            "answer_text": "I went through a process to improve my mathematics scores while I was in college in preparation for the GMAT. The result was that I increased my GMAT Math score by about 20% in 2 months. If you apply the same method, there is no way you wont get better. I promise you it will work. It works with everything. Here are the basic principals: Have a system to recognize the type of problem you\u2019re dealing withKnow where you\u2019re weakPractice where you\u2019re weakHere is the Amazon.com link to all the combinatorics practice books for the GMAT. The reason I use this link is because there are probably some good practice problem books. You\u2019re going to need lots of practice problems. To work this system, you\u2019ll need a few books of practice problems and a good teaching book that will give you a system for identifying the type of problems you\u2019ll need to solve. You might check out Khan Academy for a good tutorial on the different types of problems you\u2019ll face. They have some good teaching examples. Next, take a practice test using some of those GMAT resources you\u2019ll pull together. The reason GMAT materials are so useful is because they give you a range of different problem types. You can track how well you did on each problem type and then, once you\u2019ve mastered a certain type of problem, just stop studying it for awhile and focus on your weaknesses. Eventually there won\u2019t be much left that you\u2019re weak at. At that point, review what you\u2019ve done. Its important you know how good you really are at each problem type. This is the data you need to be able to focus your efforts. Focus is key. The other part of the equation is hard work. If you practice regularly every day, you will get better quickly. Obviously, the more you practice each day, the faster the results. So, that\u2019s not the most ground breaking system ever created, but it works like a charm. Good luck. ",

You have five people and all are equally qualified (can fill any role). In this case you have C5,3=5!3!2!=10C5,3=5!3!2!=10 possible choices for your team.
