            "answer_text": "Much depends on your financial position. If finances are not an issue , prepare with full devotion for MDS. Remember that you will continue to need financial support even while you are doing your MDS. MDS is desirable because these days the Patients also like to consult only those who are specialist. Moreever certain branches of work will require you to be an MDS rather than a simple BDS. If Finances are not very strong , join as a General Duty Medical Officer and then prepare for the MDS. But do not conclude your academic career with a simple BDS. ",

So I feel it is a hard decision for you. There will also be some time lag to get a job which you consider secure. So give a careful thought and then decide. If your are going for a govt. job or for that matter any job, you may have to forget MDS. BDS would be like any other degree you can try for jobs which require a degree to be eligible. ",
