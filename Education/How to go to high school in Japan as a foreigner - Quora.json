            "answer_text": "This is actually a pretty tough order. I mean, if you really, really want to force your way through it, there are few ways. Method 1: Your mom finds a job in Japan and the work sponsors her visaYour mom then applies for your dependent visa on your behalf.Method 2: Your mom can enroll in an university or college and get a student visaYour mom can probably apply for dependent visa on your behalfMethod 3: Your parents start a company in Japan and invest 5 million yen (~$50k US) into it as capital, then hire 2 local employees. This makes your parents eligible to get investor visa.One of your parents then applies for a dependent visa on your behalf.These are the only ways I can think of that let you stay throughout the entire duration of high school. I should also mention that moving to Japan simply to go through high school is not a good idea unless you already speak the language. Japan is very heavy on immigration process and bureaucracy. There is a ton of paperwork involved. And it will most likely cost a large sum of money to even get started. It\u2019s not just a matter of desire to be there. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned how hard it is for foreigners to fit into a Japanese high school environment. Alternatively, you can wait until you\u2019re eligible to apply for college and simply apply to colleges in Japan, or do an exchange. There are visas for that, and it\u2019s very simple to apply for.

Stuff like this Youth Exchanges | Rotary International I knew a girl who went to Thailand with Rotary when I was in high school. I also met someone studying abroad in Japan. He seemed to be having a blast. Your mother would be in a more difficult situation. If she is college educated though, she might consider getting her Masters in Japan. There are English language programs that could do that. Check out the MEXT scholarship. JAPANESE GOVERNMENT \uff08MONBUKAGAKUSHO:MEXT\uff09SCHOLARSHIP FOR 2015\uff08RESEARCH STUDENTS\uff09 The Japanese government really wants foreigners to come study here. If she doesn\u2019t have a college degree, maybe she could just go get one in Japan, in an English language undergraduate program. Something like SILS at Waseda University. Best of luck. ",

This visa will not allow you to work. One international school would be \u2014 The American school in Japan. (Chofu) I can tell you it is not cheap to attend an international school in Japan. No, you probably will not be eligible to apply to a local Japanese high school because of the lack of Japanese and the visa status. Hope this helps. ",

Even if your mom got a visa, and then got you one as a dependent, high school here is not compulsory and freely available for anyone who wants to attend - you must test into a school and be accepted. I think the best way is to look for a study abroad program. Take a look here: Japan - Study Abroad - High School And, here: High School Study Abroad in Japan ",
