            "answer_text": "A figurehead is a leader or frontrunner in society or business that doesn\u2019t actually hold any power at all. Say, a company has a founder, who has the highest position and is well known as the owner of the company, but in reality he can\u2019t do anything without the approval of a board of advisers who follow his every move. He is in charge of the company, but he holds no real power; that rests with the advisers. He is the figurehead of the company. ",
