Avoid oily foods as they can make you drowsy\u2026 Try to put in one hour of study early in the morning\u2026 fix your hard subject for this hour as this is the time your brain is most receptive.. Make flash cards and colour code your subjects\u2026 if you are a matriculation student try to understand the key words rather than mugging them up as that way you will remember it easier and even if you do forget you won't get stuck there\u2026 Write down and practice every single problem in your math book including all the examples as they will ask even those.. Before you mark the answers in the mcq at the back of the books photocopy those pages like multiple copies and keep them\u2026 then mark the answers and learn them\u2026 once a week test yourself on those mcq using the photocopies you have and get some family member to correct it\u2026 ",
