            "answer_text": "To put it simply~ YouTube shouldn\u2019t be banned. Period. To start me off, YouTube already isn\u2019t banned at my school. How do they keep track of us then? Well, i wish i could say that they don\u2019t have to. Our school\u2019s Security system, Smoothwall, Looks for keywords and then blocks those URLS. It also blocks URLS the Administration puts in manually. This even works in YouTube and the way the URLS look. Not only that (i don\u2019t know how they do this) But the school blocks certain videos and comments, even on my personal email account. So the proof is there. You can have YouTube unblocked and still restrict access from videos you don\u2019t want them to see. Hear that schools? Get to unblocking! Have a good day, mate! ",

            "answer_text": "No, because some videos are educational and teachers will use youtube as a learning tool. Other video websites such as vimeo don\u2019t have enough videos and the same ones as youtube to use to help teach students. Some schools, like mine, ban certain videos from youtube so students can\u2019t watch whatever they want. ",
