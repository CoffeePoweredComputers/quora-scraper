            "answer_text": "It seems you have the wrong idea of what math is, and are confused between the essence of math and the tools employed in math. It\u2019s hard to define what math is, but a popular definition is that math is the study of quantity, structure, space, and change. Taking your rocket example, you definitely need to know how much fuel to put in it (quantity), how it moves around in space, how its mass and velocity changes, and so on. So no matter what you do, if you want to be able to launch that rocket, there\u2019s no getting around doing math. How you do math is a different matter. Modern math is full of symbols and formulas, and has come to be associated with them. But you can do math using words alone if you\u2019re so inclined, and there were times when that was how it was done. The reason that we\u2019ve switched to using formulas is that mathematicians are lazy, and they have found that doing math with formulas is much, much, much easier. Much. To give an example, there was a time where to solve a quadratic equation, you would say something like \u201cTo find a thing such that the thing squared multiplied by a number, plus the thing multiplied by a second number, plus a third number, is equal to zero, let the thing be the ratio of two terms, the second term being twice the first number, the first term being the negative of the second number, plus or minus the square root of the difference between the square of the second number and four times the product of the first and third numbers\u201d. Nowadays we just say \u201cThe solution to ax2+bx+c=0ax2+bx+c=0 is x=\u2212b\u00b1b2\u22124ac\u221a2ax=\u2212b\u00b1b2\u22124ac2a\". Tell me, which way is easier to actually use, develop and work with? Which is more applicable to problems much, much harder than simply solving quadratic equations? You won\u2019t progress much if you impose upon yourself arbitrary restrictions on top of the problem at hand, such as avoiding using symbols. ",

They were of the form: If product A is 12 oz and the cost is $7.20 but Product B is 16 oz and the cost is $8.00, which is the better buy? This was in the 60's before hand calculators - decide using mental arithmetic. You are driving from New Jersey to Boston. The distance is 350 miles. You are going at 75 miles an hour (more or less). How many hours does it take to get there? Most financial transactions take math. Your retirement fund depends on math - if you have any sense at all. Math is required in analyzing risk. Humans are especially bad at statistical analysis. I once had this case: I am a chronic depressive. I am on a Selective Serotonin Uptake Inhibitor (SSRI). There have been about 5 cases of liver failure using this SSRI. There have been over a million patients on the drug. If I stop using the drug, I may get depressed and think of suicide. According to medical studies 15% of those who are clinically depressed die by suicide. If I stay on the drug, what are my chances of dying of liver failure. If I quit the drug, what are my chances of dying by suicide? ",

            "answer_text": "In short yes. Math is a very important skill to learn. You need to able to calculate taxes, balance your checkbook, and it's good for your mental prowess! Take it from me, I hated math all through school and even in college; on top of that, I majored in Economics which requires you to have at least some math competence. I struggled through calculus because I didn't try! I figured what the hell, why do I need to learn it? Life has a funny way you making you realize your mistakes.  In reality you only need arithmetic and some algebra, but why stop there? Why limit yourself? I'm sure you have interests in subjects in school and wouldnt you know math is an immensely important tool to have in your toolbox. My college professor in research methods once said, \"Just because you are a political science major, don't think that you don't need math, in fact if you ever pursue a graduate degree math will be your best friend.\" I majored in political science too, and it wasn't apparent, but I eventually realized yes, you do need competence in math. If you look at current research done in the social science disciplines you'll see math has become an increasingly reliable and viable method for conducting research, even political research! Going through college made me realize how weak my math abilities were and how important it is to train your brain. Even if you don't pursue college, and let's say you pursue a trade, well you still need to know math. You can't be an electrician, a carpenter, or a mechanic with out basic knowledge of math and conversions! Math is the language of the natural world, and also the human world. Don't ever let your math suffer! ",

            "answer_text": "So let me give you a slightly different answer. Can math be replaced by something else? The key here is abstraction.  Without abstraction, you have individual fingers and individual toes, and that's about as much as you can say about them.  But if you're able to abstract, you can think about your individual fingers has having some shared property that allows you to think of them as a set called fingers, and likewise for toes.   And if you've gotten that far you can start thinking about abstracting from the sets themselves:  most people can create a one-to-one correspondence from each member of the group fingers to each member of the group toes. That particular abstraction is a number.   So at this very basic level, anytime you perform this kind of \"abstraction of an abstraction\", you're well into what we understand as mathematics.  You can change the labels, but the underlying concept is going to be the same. Is there another way to describe launching a rocket into orbit? Actually, yes.  The mathematics you learning in school depends on there being an infinite number of numbers, and this leads to (comparatively) well-behaved theorems.  Finite computers can only make use of a vanishingly small number of the numbers we need, and so we end up using something that looks a lot like math from 20 yards on a running horse, but actually is quite different.  On your computer, a+(b+c) does not necessarily equal (a+b)+c.  Is this a different kind of mathematics?  Or an approximation of mathematics?  Either way, it's not the mathematics you were raised with, yet we can use it to go to the moon. What happens if math is not taught as a basic subject? People who can afford to send their children to the best schools will make sure their children are taught mathematics, because an understanding of mathematics makes you more powerful out in the world.  If there is a certain class of people who you would like to keep from attaining power, teach them literacy if you must but definitely don't teach them math. ",

            "answer_text": "I hear it stated a lot that \u201cwe\u201d don\u2019t need maths in everyday life. Now, I fully accept that there are many people that do not consciously use maths on a daily basis. Although, I would assert that MOST use basic arithmetic every time they go shopping or work out how much to tip a waitress. But when some people state \u201cWE\u201d don\u2019t need maths, they are actually talking about the human race in general, and with that I couldn\u2019t disagree more. The computer that I\u2019m typing this response on would not exist without the hundreds of years of study that the human race has put into mathematics. Every time I hit a key, the computer performs what could be described as an algebraic function, mapping the keystroke to a letter - in my case, via the standard English QWERTY layout. But, I can very easily change that layout to US, German, Korean, if I like. That customisable mapping is ostensibly a result of the concept of algebra. The same goes for every single one of the millions of operations that the computer is carrying out per second. The same goes for the mobile phone in your hand or pocket. In a world where humans never discovered and studied maths, there would be no internal combustion engine. There would be no traffic lights, no controlled production of, or harnessing of electricity \u2026 On a VERY fundamental level, the knowledge of mathematics, along with the applied knowledge of physics and chemistry, is responsible for 99% of everything we, as citizens of civilised countries use every day. Not to mention the applications of mathematics in medicine. The fact that people don\u2019t either die of an overdose or wake up in agony during surgical procedures is a result of the use of a mathematical equation taking in variables such as age, weight, length of operation, to determine appropriate doses. Yes. We need maths. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous to suggest otherwise. ",

So your question is really about whether humanity could have done a better job developing the language, notation, and mental models that support mathematical thinking. I have little doubt that some regrettable decisions have become entrenched (using \u03c0 rather than 2\u03c0 as the circle constant, perhaps), but in my view these issues are mostly quite minor. By and large, the mathematical community is pretty good at replacing inefficient or unwieldy ideas with better ones. As a result, our current approach to math is remarkably simple and elegant, considering how much you can do with it. For a contrasting view, I recommend having a look at the Kill Math project: http://worrydream.com/KillMath/ ",

Arithmetic can be thought of as a subset of mathematics. It\u2019s the part of mathematics that deals with numbers and their interactions. Adding, subtracting, multiplication, division, etc. certainly important for all of us to some degree. It has been said that arithmetic is to mathematics the same way that spelling is to writing. Mathematics is more complex and includes solving algebraic equations, understanding differential equations, number theory, geometry, trigonometry and much more. I believe many people use mathematics without realizing it. Carpenters use the Pythagorean theory to make sure their buildings are square. Payroll systems use algebra to calculate the pay for hourly workers. So, whether an individual person uses math or not depends on the person. Without math, airplanes would not fly, buildings would not stand tall and cars would not operate. So whether you need math or not is dependent on your life and what you do.

It is logical, and usually perfect, or at least gives a accurate estimation in what we are looking for or attempting to describe.  As we continue to \"create\" or even \"discover\" new mathematical fields, we have more tools to use in solving mathematical problems and in understanding the universe around us.  Now, on the second part of the question:  If it was not in schools, I'm not sure what would exactly happen, but I think it is reasonable to say that not as many people would know of the subject or its existence as much as there is now, and if people are not taught or do not learn of mathematics, then it is highly likely that there will not be as many mathematicians, physicists, etc. in the world than there would have been before. Edit:  On the language part (Mathese, Mathian) Math is considered a language of its own.  It has its symbol to express concepts, its \"grammar\"; so we already have a language of math, and it is the most precise language I have ever known. ",

Personally, I've studied enough math that I view it more as a system based on logic and certain basic rules, but just about everything uses it in some way or another. So, shorter version - do you NEED math beyond say\u2026fifth grade even? No, you could probably do without. You'd miss out on a lot of things, or rely on others using it, though, even then. ",

Everything you see being done in the notation of mathematics could be written out in the words of whatever language you want to use. Of course, even the slimmest textbook would have enough volume. Judging by your comments, what you\u2019re thinking of when you talk about \u2018maths\u2019 is the notation it uses. But there are already lots of different notations, often operating in the same field at the same time. This can be extremely confusing and controversial unless the context is absolutely clear. One of my current tutors, for example, absolutely insists that I cleave to the 19th century tradition of using Gothic font to signify a certain mathematical object called an \u2018ideal\u2019- but at least two of the textbooks I\u2019m using don\u2019t do this and one of them actually seems to have a problem with it, calling it \u2018fascist\u2019 lettering\u2019. Basically, notation is only informally standardised (although with the rise of LaTeX it would seem that the American Mathematical Society has sort of become a de facto centralised repository of the most common forms via its standard packages for the tool). I suppose, then, there\u2019s an interesting question as to whether it\u2019s possible to have an optimal - or at least better - notation for any given field. I don\u2019t know how much academic work goes into this - I\u2019d certainly find a cultural history of the development of mathematical notation absolutely fascinating. To answer the final question in your comment, if mathematics itself was not taught as a basic subject, civilisation would collapse. That might not have been true a few hundred years ago, but it certainly is now. ",

The rows are different subjects in math, starting with numbers, then algebra, trig, calc, etc. the blue area is different though. Each column represents a profession, from accounting to foodservice, engineering, science, etc. A dot at the intersection of a row and column indicates that the profession uses that area of math. As you can see, the red portion is heavily populated with dots. This means that most jobs (and life in general) will use at least middle school math. others have detailed examples, but the bottom line is that you need to have a basic level of math background. People take advantage of those in society who are illiterate, a common example is having people who can't read sign legal documents. Just the same, many people take advantage of others who either don't know math, or more commonly, don't use it in a situation. A common example is how most items in a supermarket have a price ending in .99. People generally view 2.99 as closer to 2 than 3, but those who are math conscious may round up to 3, and keep track of their cart total to a 1\u20135% margin so they aren't surprised at checkout. ",

In other words it is a tool that enables you to refine your thinking when dealing with complexity. This is why NOTHING that distinguishes modern society from primitive tribes (and I\u2019m not saying the middle ages but the stone age!) would be possible without at least some simple math.

As a lender, and in a former life, a real estate broker, I needed to have a good understanding of how ratios were determined. For example, to qualify for a home loan, lenders typically want to see if the borrower has no more than a 40% debt to income ratio. While I did not learn a lot about ratios that I remember in normal math classes in high school, I did have to apply ratios to some Agribusiness classes I took. That knowledge has been invaluable to me in my current and previous professions. -Answer by Larry with Waking Girl ",

Food:  What types of food are available and when?  Can you store it: how long before different types of food spoil?  How will you plan for scarcity?  How will you predict seasons when food is scarce?  When you figure out that you can plant crops, how do you know when to do it?  How will you measure time?  How will you keep count of time?  What is time? Shelter: It would be nice if it were stable and a storm didn't blow it to pieces and result in you dying of exposure.  Where are you?  Where's the other stuff: water, food, building materials? Security:  Does the other tribe over there look a bit mean and are you standing on \"their\" land?  Negotiation time: where is the border?  Do both tribes agree on where it is?  Can you trade resources?  Can you get back in time from hunting before it's dark, thus avoiding being eaten? Fast forward and we're navigating the world, there's global trade, information exchange......maths allows us to make sense of the world and how it works.  It's a basic survival skill. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tricky question, with a number of parts. Arithmetic and mensuration are essential thing, but what is taught in the schools these days is considerably less than what was taught in the 1950s, and much less than what was taught in the UK.   I use base 120 so the arithmetic is different to 10 or 12, since i don't have symbols for 0 to 119, but 0 to 11.  You see errors that people unaware of this arithmetic make when dealing with sumerian numbers. Much of the high-tech stuff, like sines and trig, one can bypass.  I got deep into hyperbolic geometry on mental arithmetic and a four function calculator, to the extent that it's quite different to what one finds in the book.   The abstraction and proof does not rely on a separate set of runes.  I wrote a good deal based on the 'no subscript' policy.  This means that i could write a lot of mathematics without ugly formatting. The notion of proof and abstract calculation can in a practical sense, save hundred of hours of time.  Careful calculations of the mathematical innards of a proggie, and a spot of loop optimisation, meant that when i restarted the debugged version of the prog, it ran so much faster that the hour the original ran, was equal to a sip of coffee in the time of the newer one. Making sense of 'what is allowed' allows one to winnow out the charf so quickly that the solutions are readily foumd. ",
