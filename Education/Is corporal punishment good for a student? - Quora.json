            "answer_text": "I think that there are much better ways to deal with a student\u2019s behavior than corporal punishment. But I will say that the one instance it happened to me it worked out well. When I was a kid and I misbehaved or brought home bad grades I got a good, old fashioned talking to. My transgressions were addressed, and generally resulted in an empty promise from me to try to do better. Yeah. I had zero accountability at home. But one time my fifth grade teacher decided I had been disrespectful. Two other boys and I were hauled into the cloakroom right off the classroom. This teacher was known for doling out corporal punishment, so I knew what was coming. The spanking he administered to my bottom was the first of my young life, and it got my attention big time. The rest of the school year was my most successful, as I knew that he was going to hold me accountable for my actions. I really didn't want to have the experience repeated. Now, as I look back on my childhood, I now wish my parents had talked to me once. Twice. Maybe three times to correct my behavior. Then my dad should have lowered my pants and underwear, I should have been pulled across his knees, and I should have received some \u201cred bottom discussion\u201d at length on my bare bottom. I don't know why my parents didn't spank me for all the crap I handed them, but I'm convinced that I would have learned accountability and responsibility at a much younger age if they had. ",

            "answer_text": "My son has Asperger's Syndrome. He tends to do things a certain way. Befored we realized this he began to react to disagreements with his sister by scratching her. We talked to him about this repeatedly. Finally I told him that the next time it happened it would result in a spanking. I worked late nights and one day I guess I was off and the two of them were playing a game on the computer. Then I noticed the scratches. He was a bright and pleasant child and no one had told me because of the promise I'd made to him. He got a spanking. He cried, I probably did more. Then I held him and talked to him. It never happened again (that I know of). He needed an \u201cinterrupt\u201d to keep him from just reacting when he was out of control. I guess that did it. I never spanked him again, or really had a reason to. ",
