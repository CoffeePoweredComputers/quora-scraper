            "answer_text": "I think the rules are different for different countrieswww.cuecc.com or schools. Take schools in China for example, if you want to apply scholarship in China, when you submit your documents to school, you need to explain that you want to apply for scholarship (if the scholarship is available in this school). Most schools in China will give scholarships according to your previous school performance like transcripts. So you can see whether you get the scholarship on your admission notice. And only some schools will need to take a entrance examination then decide whether you can get the scholarship or not. If you want to study in China, any problem please go to www.cuecc.com . or contact email: eduunion@cuecc.com We can help you apply scholarship in China! ",
