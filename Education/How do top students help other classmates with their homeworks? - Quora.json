            "answer_text": "I tend to render my assistance to those who are struggling in their academics. People usually ask me for help in Mathematics. So, what I do is that I would first ask them to try work the problem out first until they are stuck. Afterwards, I would give them hints of where they went wrong/ how to continue from their previous step. I strongly believe that by directly giving them the answers, I am not helping them in anyway. They would not gain anything from that. By giving hints or helping them with a step or two, it forces them to think and not receive hand-overs, strengthening their mental abilities to solve problems. It will aid them in the long-run. For other subjects like Sciences, it would usually revolve around the understanding of concepts (content). I would ask them what they understand first, then afterwards help them build on this current foundation of their understanding and rectifying any errors along the way. For languages, I can\u2019t really help much because I am usually the person seeking for help. :P ",

            "answer_text": "By trying to teach them. If the students want to learn, they'll usually ask how to do something. In that case, you can simply give a step by step explanation of how to it. If they just want the answer, you should still give them an explanation, and let them work it out for themselves. Also, if you are comparing your results and you have different results, you should always be ready to let people look at your calculations, even though you feel like they are getting the answer for free. After all, if they are willing to spend time comparing results they are also willing to spend time learning to do it right. The really great thing about helping other people is that you learn your own errors and typos, as well as what concepts you understand and what you don't. ",

We particularly did this on math. We just chewed it back and forth, clearing up the concepts and getting the terms defined. When we first started doing this, he was far better than I at the subject. When it came to the exams at the end of the year, I was in the top 3 of the class. ",
