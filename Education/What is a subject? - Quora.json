            "answer_text": "Much as I have enjoyed badmouthing postmodernism in revenge for the years of tedium it inflicted upon me, I have to admit, as I mentioned at the end of Postmodern Shibboleths, I have found discussions of \u201cthe subject\u201d to be useful, relevant and meaningful. Postmodernists will tend to identify challenges to the unity and stability of the ego with Lacan, and the ephemeral nature of the individual self with Derrida\u2019s claim that \u201cthe subject is never equivalent to itself\u201d--which is sort of an update of Heraclitus' observation that \"you can't step into the same river twice.\" It seems pretty obvious that the self, the individual, the person you think of as you is constantly changing. Every time a new thought enters your head, every time you think a thought about yourself, or you have a new experience, in fact, with every breath you take you are not quite the same person you were an instant ago. From a purely physical (and physics) point of view every single molecule of your body is replaced in the space of seven years. The guy who\u2019s been in jail for eight years is, physically, a completely different person from the criminal convicted of his crime. We might roll our eyes at the medieval King Alfred who had a dying subject locked in a lead box so that he could see his subject\u2019s soul rising from his body, but without the fiction of something like a soul or immortal spirit or some individual essence making us each the same person from birth to death our religions, our cultural, social, political and legal systems, our epistemology, all our ways of thinking, knowing and understanding the world could not survive. The playwright Pirandello argued that the characters of fiction are more \u201creal\u201d than the people we think of as real because they are more enduring. Characters remain the same forever but people are constantly changing. \u201cBe Yourself\u201d? Part II ",

            "answer_text": "In Indian culture we say Adhyan, Manan, Abhyas, Adhyapan (in Hindi language) means Study, Memories, Practice. First repeat these three steps until you get clarity and hold on the topic or subject. Finally, teach (Adhyapan). For study, just divide and conquer the subject, bottom up approach, if you miss the fundamentals, you will miss the fancy stuff, break the subject until you touch the basic blocks/fundamentals- prerequisite. Understand the basic principles on which the topic stands, analyze the assumption, subconsciously you made based on your previous experience and after getting introduced by the new data, where it stands. Second step is to hold this new information, so you have to memorize the necessary stuff, like formula that you don't want to derive it on regular basis. Associating the stuff you want to memorize with something be it time, emotion or any absurd thing makes it easy to recall. Third step is practice, most important thing to do here while practicing is to ask \u201cWhy\u201d, example why you are substituting in that step (math example) etc. The purpose here should be simplifying, optimizing your understanding. This is important because, now your fundamentals are clear so analyzing, thinking upon it with different angle enhance your understanding of the topic. In subtle level, you are actually studying same thing with different perspective while practicing. Finally, Teach. While teaching, discussing, you will get questions from your audience which will give you new perspective, hence greater understanding, minimizing your ignorance upon the topic. ",
