            "answer_text": "Hi anybody can create a Google Classroom. You could even create one for your own hobby and invite others to it. A personal account classroom would not have most of the admin features that you would find in a full classroom configuration. Within an educational domain (and most others) classroom permission will be split between admin/teachers and students. Students cannot create classrooms. ",

            "answer_text": "No. You won't be arrested. But it seems to be against Google's terms of service. I'm trying to think of a way a teacher could create a sandbox for students to develop one. I believe it would be possible to have a student as a collaborator. I'm not using Google Classroom anymore but if you check with your current teacher they may have a way. I think it would be a fun summative project at the end of the class. ",
