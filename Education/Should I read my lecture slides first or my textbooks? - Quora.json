            "answer_text": "If your professor is worth their salt, the slides should be your \u201cGo!\u201d square. The point of them is to give you an overview of what your teacher wants you to get out of the source material (i.e. your textbooks). Reading the lecture slides first gets your brain looking for those things\u2014kind of an \u201cI recognized that!\u201d that reinforces your mind\u2019s interest\u2014and will help you focus on the core ideas. Bonus tip: there is a lot of research going around right now about the value of a traditional textbook vs. an ebook (google this for specific studies if you\u2019re curious). The conclusion seems to be that we learn and retain more from the traditional book because we\u2019re taking in the information in multiple ways instead of just one (the smell of the book, the act of turning the pages, the mental \u2018picture\u2019 of each page, the actual reading, etc.). If your school doesn\u2019t offer physical copies, try asking that the library carry at least one for \u201cemergencies\u201d (tablets do die), or for \u201cfurther research material\u201d. Failing that, maybe you\u2019d benefit by picking up a cheap used copy off of Half.com - Textbooks, Books, CDs, Movies, More, alibris.com, or something of the ilk. Wishing you a great time learning! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend reading the appropriate sections of the textbook before even going to the lecture, but not necessarily in any great detail. Spend between half and twice as long as the length of the lecture preparing for it. Don\u2019t read slides until after the relevant lecture. You might get the idea you already know it all, or something similar, if you read them before. Slides are a summary. My Quora-suggested credential for this question is Cambridge uni. I was a rather lazy as a student - still am perhaps - but I did read my textbooks as if they were novels before term started. Not that we had slides, mind, certainly not for mathematics. For CS, lecture notes were typically provided. And I didn\u2019t take notes as a mathmo either, something I would not necessarily recommend for other subjects. ",
