            "answer_text": "\u201cA classmate\u201d is asking me for homework. This first sentence says so much. This is not a close friend or a person that might be telling the truth, but you can\u2019t verify if you don\u2019t know. Here\u2019s what I have to say, and it is judgemental, so for all of those who think one should always be nice-oh well. Don\u2019t do it. If the classmate is having problems at home, tell them to seek the help of someone who can find solutions to those problems. I bet this worked for them when they asked someone else before, so giving your homework is not going to change a thing about the student\u2019s problem. It is only temporary until the next tough assignment. And that is how you explain it. Because you can get into trouble if you give answers or let others copy your work. Do NOT put your well being ahead of other people\u2019s. Just don\u2019t and if they push back and get mouthy about you being this or that or not caring\u2026.wait for it, let them finish what they are saying, and then explain that they are the one who has no care about feelings, their home situation gets no help out of their insistence to refuse to seek it, they don\u2019t care if you get caught \u201chelping\u201d and then get into trouble, and in all likelihood, they learn to take the easy-way-out, learning nothing new or informative. Stand up to honor the number one rule in the Universe, \u201cEach of us is responsible for what type of day we have, which includes all of the easy, hard, and tough stuff, but none of us improve without learning something new.\u201d ",
