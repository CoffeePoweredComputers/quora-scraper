            "answer_text": "Many who get an education have higher wages, more opportunities in their lives, and are more likely to be healthy. Societies likewise profit. Societies with high educational completion rates have lower crime, stronger public health and community engagement. Failure to access education is seen as the root of poverty. Not getting an education can lead to the poverty cycle. Access to education, however, can mean exiting that cycle. Benefits of Education Healthier Lifestyle Better educated people tend to live longer and have a healthier lifestyle. Individuals with higher education have a one-third lower risk of heart disease according to research. Similarly, grade holders are less likely to smoke and more likely to get regular exercise. Socializing and Networking are Personal Benefits of Education Education provides the space and opportunities for students to meet like-minded people, either on a peer- or mentor basis. Students in school meet leaders in their field, top professionals, and also make contacts through extracurricular activities. Pursuing Your Passion You want to immerse yourself in that theme when you feel passionate about something. Education gives you room for that. In addition, you may find new passions within your field of study or new areas of interest. Personal Development of Skills During their educational time, students are required to undergo many types of assignments, discussions, courses, and more. So they end up with a fantastic skillset that translates into the workforce. Economic Growth When education is provided to a whole population, productivity rises, real income rises, and unemployment decrease. This leads to economic development and also provides stability to the society as a whole. It begins with education. A well-educated society experiences a stronger sense of social unity and confidence. Educated communities uplift the poor and bring a sense of cohesion to all parts. ",

            "answer_text": "Jeff Suzuki already mentioned that the benefits of a free education are the same as one you pay for to society, in that the value is the education itself. Keep in mind that, at least in the US, a college education will result in a higher paying career on average. One study showed that on average, a college degree holder makes $17,000 more per year than a non-degree holder. https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/11/study-income-gap-between-young-college-and-high-school-grads-widensBut also remember that is a average of all degree holders, from BA\u2019s in Sociology to Engineering and other STEM fields. If you get a STEM degree, your earnings is over seven-figures more than a non-degree holder (over a lifetime). That said, there will be a benefit to the students, in the short-term. No student debt except what may have been borrowed for living expenses (right now most of the push is toward free tuition, not free apartments and food. But we know that will change). To me it would appear that the most promising benefit to society is helping the few students that drop out of college because they can\u2019t afford it. Those who fail out would also benefit, though I\u2019m not sure if that would not occur more often, once it becomes \u201cconsequence free.\u201d \u201cFree Education\u201d might also attract some students that would never consider attending a college or university in the first place. This is probably a small percentage of the overall population, but they would benefit. Last point: At least 11 of the US States already subsidize half of your tuition. So in many places we are halfway there. Also note that classroom instruction is only about 15% of the cost of an education. Let that sink in. Here is an earlier answer on a similar topic: How do you think free or relatively cheap university educations would change the US?If we are going to make tuition free to the student, then the best approach is to focus on community coleges first: Are community colleges a better source to teach information technology as a trade than colleges and universities?This would also require automatic accpetance to a State University once the two years are complete. Of course, an AAS or AS has good job prospects in themselves: Are community colleges a better source to teach information technology as a trade than colleges and universities?As a parallel effort, local community college as well as State Universities should be required to make all course content available on-line (as well as remote classrooms for distance learning). What are the pros & cons of on-line schools vs. attending college?In many case satellite office could be added on to public libraries or purpose-built higher learning centers. If placed in small towns or communities without a university it would greatly increase the availability of higher learning. Even high schools could be pressed into after-hours lab facilities for STEM students. and high school teachers could earn some supplemental pay! One group that would greatly benefit is part-time students. For some reason our entire model is based on a single four-year shot where an 18-year-old gets to decide their entire future career. I was a non-traditional student and took 10 years to earn a college degree. When I work & learn, you tend to take studies seriously. And I didn\u2019t worry about entertainment -- I had no time! Below is a link to my path to a degree\u2026 What is life for a engineering student?There is one final option we may not have considered: Instead of making tuition free, why not just make zero-percent long-term loans available? A forty-year loan would require only 2.5% per year payment. I address some of the points of \u201cgood\u201d student debt here: What is the alternative for someone who refuses to go into debt for a useless college degree?But a low-interest long-term loan would have several benefits that qualify it as win-win: All existing federal grants would be rolled into it.It would be paid through the IRS, so it would not require a entirely new bureaucracy. Just use the PELL Grant system for the loans, and the IRS to collect payments. Over time it would become self-sustaining. And up front, it would not cost a cent more than just giving the money away.Student would still have skin in the game, knowing that school will still cost them.EEOC issues of school selectivity would not grow over present issues. What I mean here is the typical European model uses test scores to get in, or use the first year to \u201cweed out\u201d would not fly with the currently liberal education system (where some see math or even academic rigor as racist)What can be done to include more people in science and engineering?",
