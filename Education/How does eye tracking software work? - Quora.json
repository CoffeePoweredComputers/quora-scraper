            "answer_text": "Eye tracking is the process of measuring the eye movements or gaze points. This is achieved by using an eye tracker or some clever algorithm or maybe both. Eye tracking has many implications in psychology, healthcare, neuromarketing, and etc. There are two types of eye tracking software: Eye-Detection: These are the software that detects the coordinates of the eye gaze point based on various algorithms. Some examples are PyGaze, OpenLabs, Tobii etc.Eye-Tracking Coding: These are the software which provide the analysis after the eye-tracking is done (i.e. on the gaze videos). Some examples are SmartGaze, iMotions, Tobii etc.Of the two, since I have worked closely with Eye-Tracking Coding software, I can give you better insights as to how an eye tracking software works and what would suit best for you. Tobii and iMotions use their software for eye tracking and these methods have an edge over the traditional eye tracking devices and software because they have more flexibility. Later on, the data is analysed and the output is given in a heat map or a gaze map. This gaze data is then manually coded as the person watches a video and codes information about gaze behaviour. These gaze points have to be highlighted and marked for every frame of the video and the amount of gaze data can be overwhelming depending on the length of time. To analyse all the relevant gaze data points and to generate heat maps can take weeks and is an extremely tedious exercise. These pain points are addressed by SmartGaze. It uses AI to automate the whole process. It examines raw gaze videos frame-by-frame and then tags the gaze point in every frame during the entire length of the video. This is the major advantage of SmartGaze because there is no manual coding involved. After the examination, it generates a heat map of the image to give the person a better idea how much attention each entity is getting. SmartGaze is a unique and class leading product as AI automates the whole process. You just have to sit tight and let AI do the work. Check out SmartGaze to know more! ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a variety of eye tracking softwares on the market and they certainly differ in the way they work and function. Some provide both: direct integration with hardware (the data are collected directly during a study in the software)the possibility to import data after the study endsOther provide just one of the options. Later on, the data can be sorted out, analyzed, interpreted, and visualized in the software (not in every eye tracking software, especially not in free softwares). In general, eye tracking software interprets data based on gaze points and fixations, providing metrics such as areas of interest, time to first fixation etc. The data are then visualized in the form of heatmaps, gaze maps, etc. Some software, such as iMotions, synchronizes data from various biosensors in one place - enabling deeper insights about visual attention. Other software, such as Ogama, focusses solely on eye tracking. ",
