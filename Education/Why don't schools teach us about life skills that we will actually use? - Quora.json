            "answer_text": "They try to.  But everyone disagrees on what \"we will actually use.\" I mean, the place you hear \"when will we ever use this\" the most is in math classes, really starting with Algebra, and who, looking back, believes that teaching Algebra is a bad idea?!  Who, going to college, thinks they would have the base from which to choose a major had they not taken Biology, Chemistry, and other \"useless\" classes?  Who, listening to music as they read this, are glad that when they eventually developed the frontal lobe capacity to notice metaphors and other devices throughout the lyrics, the seeds were already planted? In a sense this is the same as the constant questions of why people take kung-fu when they could just take MMA or carry a gun.  I'm always somewhat sheepish when people ask if I've ever used my karate, and I have to give them the honest answer, the one they don't want to hear, which is \"every day.  Not in a fight, no, but every day.  Every day some animal jumps out at my car and I can calmly swerve without my endangering people with my panic.  Every day I almost trip and fall, but never ever do.  Every day I have some deadline to do something impossible with a million dollar penalty for failure, and I am turned on by these challenges.\"  You don't necessarily get that from jogging. Likewise, people ask why I took Latin.  And the only honest answer is \"because I've used it 10 times as much as my Spanish.\"  A hundred times.  But most reading this would call Spanish the one most students \"would actually use.\"   That's the bottom line.  Yes, I would love it if every kid had to learn to balance a checkbook and were thoroughly indoctrinated to stay out of debt and to never see themselves as victims.  I'd love it if kids learned to memorize--actually using mnemonics / memory palaces, etc so they could walk into college able to scan entire textbooks like their professors did a generation ago.  Replace English with Comoedia and Rhetoric.  I'd love it if some of the weirder sports in PE were replaced with karate or crossfit or parkour or 2016 nightclub dancing skills.  Overall, if the choice of topic were based on what will empower kids rather than what the zeitgeist decides fits their cartoon-stereotypes of school.  But again, that takes us straight back to what \"actually use\" means.  I think \"actually use\" is already everyone's goal. ",

            "answer_text": "U.S. curriculum is under constant discussion and constant criticism. The reality is - when high school  for the masses was 'invented' - and that wasn't all that long ago - high school prior to that was primarily for the wealthy. High school was for 'young gentlemen' who were going to take over the family business or possibly never work at all. The everyday person was fortunate if they got to complete 8th grade. So when public high schools were begun, they ended up being modeled on the private high schools for 'young gentlemen'.  Which is why algebra and geometry are included - such things were taught in the private high schools though no one believed them to be uniformly useful.  The other reality is that the U.S. began opening public high schools - and requiring kids to go to them - during the Great Depression. They opened and required high schools to keep young people out of the work force during a time when jobs were scarce. The point of public high school was first - keep them out of the work force. The point was not - prepare them for the work force.  That historic reality throws its shadow today. And - everytime someone asks \"Shouldn't we update curriculum\" - there are angry voices raised in protest. Change is hard for many people and just as many people see school and curriculum as fixed truths, good for all time.  It can help to remember too - many teachers have never worked outside of school. Their understanding of 'life skills' - at least for the work force - would derive from inside of a school. Teachers - and I'm one of them - are not necessarily experts on the the workings of the workplace outside of a school.  ",
