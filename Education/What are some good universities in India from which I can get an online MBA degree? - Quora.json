            "answer_text": "More apt choice of words for \"Online MBA\", would be distance learning. Learning is not online, but exams are and lectures are also more on digitized platform. But make no mistake study material to learning every single thing is via big bulky books similar to what you get in fulltime MBA colleges. The only difference here are that you will not get an faculty to clear your doubts. Distance learning is more of self learning and take pain understanding the concepts on your own. Both degrees from Fulltime and Part time are equally valid. But in a degree like MBA/PGDBA the place you are graduated from matter because of the placement and grooming you get from there. But my friend, understand man introduced the concept of \"degree\" and not the other way round.
