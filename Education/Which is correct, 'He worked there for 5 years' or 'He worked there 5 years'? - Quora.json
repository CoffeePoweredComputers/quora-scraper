            "answer_text": "He worked there for five years. [Meaning that at some time in the past he worked at a given place for a period of five years. Although the time is undetermined it is implied by the past tense of the verb that the period in question is over. The grammatical tense is known as the past definite.] Equally correct but with a difference in implied meaning would be: He has worked there for five years; but here the implied meaning is that not only has he worked there for five years but he is still working there ie that his work period continues. The grammatical tense here is called th past historic tense. To say \u201c\u201cHe worked there five years\u201d is not incorrect but is a loose idiomatic version of the past definite passing over or eclipsing the preposition \u2018for\u2019 it being left unsaid but understood that he worked there for a duration of five years and would not be encouraged in the written form.
