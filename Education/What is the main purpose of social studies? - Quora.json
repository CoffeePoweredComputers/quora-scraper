            "answer_text": "We can only grow up in one tiny culture and during one time in history. If a student does not receive a broad view of cultures throughout time they will get the wrong impression of the stability of their own\u2026 and worse. Information without context leads to misapprehension. It\u2019s freakin\u2019 crazy to skip Social Studies! How\u2019s that for an abrupt change in tone? How would this paragraph be interpreted outside of this forum? How would it have been seen 400 years ago? How would you have a clue about these questions if you had no social studies. You\u2019d be a \u201cmighty weak\u201d individual without it. And if you\u2019d not have studied the language you\u2019d not know what an oxymoron is. The main purpose of any study is to give information context. No single subject exists in isolation, nor does any single fact. You cannot have a world composed of 7 billion specialists, it won\u2019t work. It\u2019s kinda falling apart right now\u2026 Have you a better picture of social studies importance with this brief pointing of a finger towards the truth? I hope so ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "The social sciences are a very salient academic, and arguably-\u2019 a real life\u2019 endeavor. In a global economy and international inter-connectivity, one must be aware of others social status and the commonalities and differences that are shared or not shared. One should strive to learn about their own country, state, and region, along with other countries, and their cultures, socio-economics, social stratus, religious traditions, and their military aspirations. It is not wise to always rely on other people\u2019s opinions or news or media reports. It helps to have a general idea of how an individual might think and why he or she thinks that way. The social sciences are a very broad academic field, incorporating geography, history, world history, sociology, psychology, politics, and etc. ",
