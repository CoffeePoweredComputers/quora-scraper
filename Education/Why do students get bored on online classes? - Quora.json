            "answer_text": "Online classes might have sounded interesting beforehand. As traveling took a lot of time people might have thought that online classes is a better option. But every since lockdown got imposed schools and coaching institutes started running online. It was okay for a while but after a certain period of time things started getting boring. Studying in classroom used to be fun in many aspects: Morning assembly: Though standing in queues was a hell lot of tiring but it used to help maintain our entropy and seeing the schools achievements would make us all happy. The loud round of applause when your crush would go and get an award :)Interactive sessions where one got involved even if they didn't want to.Friends: Yes, the fact that you'll meet your friends made school life easier. The times when the teacher posed you a question and you didn't know the answer the friend was there to help which doesn't happen in online classes.Solving problems together: At times the teacher used to give a problem and take a round in the class meanwhile benchmates used to discuss and solve the problem together. Learning used to fun.Tiffin breaks: \u201cWhat have you brought today? I've got pasta.\u201d Yes, food used to connect us like nothing else could.Life from sad to happy: Even in school life things get hectic at times and the friends always try to make you happy and joke around to keep your mood elated.Competition: Seeing your classmates perform well right in front of your eyes would give you a pinch of competitive feel.Gossips: \u201cHey,do you know what happened yesterday?\u201d And the blant would go on and on.Mass bunk: Yes, I miss those days when we'd mass bunk. Some used to go for outings while some were on study leaves.Cheating: Yes, cheating offline was fun.Stupid games: Simple games during free periods would add to the fun. Pen fights, truth and dares, etc all used to be fun.Washroom trip: Already informing your friend that you're going to the washroom and asking them to join within 5 minutes :')Meeting your crush: This used to be the best thing of all. You got to look at that person who'd make you go nuts. LOL.Your teacher's childhood stories: asking random questions from your teacher to waste the period or asking the 'class rowdies' to have an argument both of them were fun. Though we didn't mean to disrespect the teacher but who doesn't want to have fun in school life?Happy faces after dismissal. That's all for now. Let me know your favourite memories from offline classes in the comment section. Edits and suggestions are welcomed. ~ Shweta Jha \u270d\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "1 - The Environment When you\u2019re at home, your mind isn\u2019t on studying, reading textbooks, working etc\u2026 Your mind is on playing video games, gossiping with friends, going on the Internet, watching movies/shows and if you are studying, trying to make it as interesting and fun as possible by listening to music, watching your favorite Netflix show while studying or whatever but having to sit for an hour, listening to teachers droning in your home? That just doesn\u2019t match. You just want the class to end so you can do whatever you do at home compared to in school where you really don\u2019t have many options. 2 - Lack of creativity/movement School can be boring but there are certain times where we do fun activities like practicals in Biology, Chemistry and Physics OR discussions and debates in English or even Geography and History OR even maybe games in Languages and Math OR maybe all those creative subjects like Drama, Art and DT OR even just chatting with friends while you work and helping each other. I remember doing that a lot in French + Spanish in Y7, 8 and 9. Now, all that is restricted and removed and all you can do is listen to your teachers, which just isn\u2019t interesting or fun. 3 - It just isn\u2019t taken seriously Even teachers don\u2019t really care too much. Unless you\u2019re in the higher years/grades where you have important exams coming soon, what\u2019s the point of working if you don\u2019t need to study it for exams? What\u2019s the point of working if it\u2019s not going to affect your abilities that much? There just isn\u2019t any point as you don\u2019t need any of this information. ",
