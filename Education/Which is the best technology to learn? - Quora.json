Although, based on differed different requirements of the companies in the technological industry, there are \u2018n\u2019 number of technologies. Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence, which is also popularly known as (AI), hits the top of the list of technologies 2020 to learn. Artificial Intelligence is very much high in demand today, where today, the machines are known to have brilliant skills to study, think, and examine without the need for human efforts. In this on-going world of technology, there is enormous assistance of Artificial Intelligence, and the most significant examples of it are Siri and Google Assistant. Data Science: Data Science is vast. It comprises of numerous algorithms, processes, and tools to exploit unstructured or structured data to extract useful knowledge. Sometimes most people misunderstand Data Science as one of the most excellent and simple software, or statistics, or visualization methods, which is nothing but a common misconception. Blockchain: Blockchain is a technology of strength which infers robust rock cryptography and indeed allows transferring and exchanging of the crypto tokens. The process is very quickly and effortlessly carried out without any special requirements of settlements, reconciliation, or separate clearing. Due to sufficient reasons, Blockchain technology has drawn a high amount of trust and immense respect from Government banks all over the globe. Data Integraton: Data integration is one such thing that can be used by all and almost any industry. In the process of Data Integration, the rewards that are gained by the unifying data are later then stored into a solo source of the kind of data in data in the process of data integration. It can quickly help in accessing untapped data from within the stored datasets. Cloud Computing: Cloud computing is the deliverance of all the computing services like networking, database, servers, storage, analytics, software & intelligence. These networking services make use of the Internet to offer flexible resources, quicker innovations, and economies of scale and take advantage of low-cost technologies with expert connections to faster the data processing chores within them.
