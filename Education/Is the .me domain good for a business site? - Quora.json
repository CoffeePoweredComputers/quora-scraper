While many businesses utilize the .me domain name extension as a shortened name that redirects to their popular .com site, the .me is often thought of as a personal or blog type site without commercial intent. Personally, as an individual I might use the .me site as a landing page to learn more about me. But, for a business I would probably use it to redirect to my main .com site. Nevertheless, it\u2019s totally up to you to use any domain name as you would want to. We know today that major search engines can rank any name based on good SEO and the .me is becoming popular. The choice is yours. Good Luck! ",
