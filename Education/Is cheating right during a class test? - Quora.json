            "answer_text": "Cheating is never worth it. Even if you get away with the act of cheating, you cheat yourself in the long run because you never actually learned the material. In most cases this with come back to bite you because most classes build on what you've already learned. If that doesn't happen (like if the test in question is a final exam), I find that the anxiety induced from cheating is not worth it. I'd much rather the accomplished feeling of having learned the material and shown that diligence to someone who cares.  Then you have to factor in the fact that you might get caught, which often results in some sort of academic discipline, if not expulsion. Do you really want to risk getting kicked out of a class or even a school because you didn't want to study for one test? Hardly seems worth it. There are a lot of ways to cheat and the methods advance faster than those used to catch cheaters, but don't think you're immune. If you don't get caught in the act, there's still a chance that the instructor will realize it's not your work while they are correcting it. This is especially true with any assignment/exam that includes worded answers, like short answer and especially essays. After spending enough time with a teacher, they know your voice (not the way you physically sound but the kind of language you use and how you use it) and it's a dead give away. So yeah, don't bother cheating. It's better just to learn the information. ",

You know that cheating is a sign of laziness and stupidity, practiced by those who would rather lie than study, The only pro is possibly getting a higher grade on a test. For that you sacrifice your morals, self respect, and \u2014if caught\u2014possibly your future. You don\u2019t need us to tell you that. ",
