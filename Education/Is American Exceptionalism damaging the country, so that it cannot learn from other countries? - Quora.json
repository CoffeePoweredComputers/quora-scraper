            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Yes, American Exceptionalism is harmful to the country. The moment you start to believe that you're automatically better than other citizens of the world due to an accident of birth, then your problems are only just beginning. Americans do exceptional things, but that is different from Exceptionalism. The United States inspired so much of the world during and after World War Two, and this was done with a can-do attitude mixed with a determination to help others. (Yes, there was also some agenda there, as they didn't want the war-ravaged countries to fall into the Soviet bloc, but it was nevertheless an exceptional program.) Americans are most exceptional when they have believed themselves to be part of the world community and wanted to help. The US helped rebuild Germany, Japan, and many other countries, and this was done before \"In God We Trust\" was put on the money and before rednecks shouting \"USA! USA!\" was considered the apex of patriotism. When you believe that you're exceptional and the best on the world when you lag behind just about every other western country in terms of health, education, debt-to-GDP, life expectancy, infant mortality, and public safety, and only lead the world in guns, military spending, and incarceration, there is a serious disconnect from reality. I have dear friends in the United States, and I am as worried for them as they are worried for themselves. They know that their country can do exceptional things, but they do not believe in Exceptionalism. Americans are exceptional at getting aid and relief supplies to remote corners of the world, not because people stand during the national anthem. Americans are exceptional when they innovate, not when they embrace the Bible and reject science. Americans are exceptional when they broker peace agreements, not when they bomb the 'bad guys' and shrug off civilian casualties. I would love to see my southern neighbour go back to being exceptional. But first they have to walk away from Exceptionalism. ",

            "answer_text": "Hard to see how it could. \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism\u201d was an observation made by a Frenchman who toured the U.S. in the 1830s. He was a liberal writer, thinker, and politician (the original meaning of \u201cliberal\u201d, close to today\u2019s libertarian) who was comparing democracy in America to that in England and France. In the 1830s. To understand what American Exceptionalism means, one should read the book. The book about democracy in America is titled Democracy in America . The Jingoism underlying continued use of the observation is different, and Jingoism is seldom helpful. The U.S. has learned a great deal from other countries, and other times, perhaps more than any other country on Earth. The nation learned about what works and what doesn\u2019t work, or is harmful. Learned it from other countries. And we continue to learn. Complaints about American refusal to learn usually come from those who do not like how America has reacted to what it learned, wanting it to react differently. ",
