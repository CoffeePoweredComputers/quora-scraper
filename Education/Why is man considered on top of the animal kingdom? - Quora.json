            "answer_text": "Considered by who? The only thing that placed mankind on top of the animal kingdom was mankind. I haven\u2019t heard any other animal agree with that. Having said that, what makes us unique from (but not necessarily superior to) other animals is our large, sophisticated brains and our incredibly well-developed cerebral cortex. This way: We invented law, culture, language, politics, government, economies, philosophy, and other methods of understanding and structuring human societies.We created the natural sciences such as biology, geology, meteorology, astrology, physics, quantum mechanics, etc to understand Nature better. It helped us understand, for example:How our own bodies and bodily systems (cardiovascular, nervous, musculoskeletal, etc) are structured for our survivalWhy lightning comes out of a thunderstormhow forces work on objects to stop or start their movementhow the water cycle worksHow genes pass to new generations of organismsHow trees perform photosynthesis and create their own food.How energy and matter are transformed from one state into another stateHow light reflects off the eye or is split into multiple colors when going through a prism.How the space-time continuum operatesWe invented advanced technology that\u2019s entirely dependent on natural resources such as fossil fuels, sun, water, nuclear power, and the like.Electricity (dynamos, lightbulbs, etc)Ground transportation and aviation (sedans, SUVs, trucks, trains, airplanes, cruise ships, space shuttles, etc)Touchscreen devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, the internet, etc)Long-distance communication devices and software (telegrams, telegraphs, TVs, radios, phones, social media)Sanitation systemsMethods of food storage and cooking (ancient spices, refrigeration, pasteurization, electric stoves, ovens, etc)We devised unique ways to express ourselves and our perception of our surroundingsArt, from ancient cave paintings of woolly mammoths and sabertooths cats to surrealist paintings and Dadaist paintings that critique modern societyArchitecture based heavily on our understanding of the laws of physics and NatureMusic (classical, jazz, rap, R&B, Soul, country, etc)So, we\u2019re a very unique species in that regard. Every species has a unique trait. An eagle\u2019s ability to fly is its most distinctive trait, a tiger\u2019s stripes are its most distinctive trait, a horse\u2019s or a lion\u2019s mane is it\u2019s most distinctive trait, an elephant\u2019s trunk and size are its most distinctive traits, and a blue whale\u2019s size and song are its most distinctive traits. Humans? Our brains are what make us stand out the most. But, at the end of the day, we eat, mate, sleep, and stay away from danger. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re on top of the animal kingdom. We\u2019re just apart of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans are, obviously, the most intelligent creatures in the animal kingdom. This can help a lot. For example, if I was stranded in an island I would still know what to do because I watched like 60 episodes of Bear Grylls, and even if my anxiety didn\u2019t tell me to watch Bear Grylls, I would still use common sense. I would make- or struggle to make some hunting tools in case of hunger. Like, you wouldn\u2019t expect a dog to make a hunting spear and yeet it out in the ocean and it suddenly hits a fish.Number 1 basically summarizes it, its 100% intelligence. But as we all know, it\u2019s survival for the fittest. A mego obese maniac who stays on his thicc ass all day playing League Of Legends would most likely not survive by simply trying to break trees with bare fists and making a crafting table and finding caves and mine with a wooden pickaxe, that\u2019s a good Minecraft reference, if no, fight me. Anyway, that type of person wouldn\u2019t last that long. But if Arnold Schwarzenegger went back in time to his body building iconic days, he would fricking do well. Even if his brain was more undeveloped than an unborn fetus, he would still uppercut squirrels and clap them into some sort of fire he made, and gobble that up. Big difference, yes.Just keep imagining what you\u2019re about to read. It\u2019s quite ridiculous but bare with me. An average American dad. Answers the phone with \u2018\u2019Yellow!\u2019\u2019, says \u2018\u2019Gosh darn it\u2019\u2019, is a Facebook addict, owns a rifle, all the juicy stuff. If he was put in a forest with his rifle, he would go eye of the tiger mode. BOOM BOOM POW there and a POW POW BOOM there. You can see him out there cooking fricking grizzly bears. Why? Because of his rifle. Where did he get that rifle? The local gun shop. Where did the shop get the rifle? I don\u2019t know so don\u2019t expect me to answer that. But he wouldn\u2019t survive long without his rifle. Who created the rifle? A human. Humans are the strongest creatures because of their intelligence and power of creation. A human without intelligence put out in the wild is like a fly in the house. No purpose to exist, just made to piss you off, so you bring the PifPaf and spray it at the fly until the house is inhabitable. Jesus. So yeah. I guess that\u2019s all.",
