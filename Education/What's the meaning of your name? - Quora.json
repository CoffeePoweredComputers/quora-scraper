            "answer_text": "My given name Deepthi means brilliance. It is based on the Sanskrit \u201cDeepa\" for lamp, or a source of light. A more detailed meaning of my name that ties in with the lamp symbolism, is as the brilliant light of knowledge that dispels the darkness of ignorance. Do I identify with the meaning of my name? I realize that the more condensed interpretation is ironically apt, when I stop to ponder it. Usually that happens when prompted by a question like the one on this thread. My strongest feeling about my name is one of relief: that it carries no connotations of chastity. I would not want my private behavior effectively broadcast as my identifying trait. As I see it, explicitly branding a woman \u201cnot promiscuous\u201d is just begging the question. I\u2019m actually happier with the longer interpretation - I see it as inspirational. Not that I think of myself as brilliant (!!!) but I\u2019m very interested in Astronomy, and have taught it at the college level. It just so happens that I am interested in unusually luminous stars like Eta Carinae, and in concentrations of super massive (and thus brilliant) stars, such as the Westerlund 1 super cluster.  New Image of Super Cluster Westerlund 1 This interest in hypergiant stars has nothing to do with my name* \u2014 I'm fascinated by the mere fact of their existence against many destabilizing influences. I have always been fascinated by how theoretical evolutionary tracks of very massive stars \u201cloop around\u201d, essentially showing the SAME luminosity during different times in their lives!  http://inspirehep.net/record/1250248/plots My strangest wish is to die when Eta Carinae is observed to go hypernova. Hopefully people close to me will remember the confluence of events.

            "answer_text": "My full name is \u201cSpencer Alexander McDaniel.\u201d I have always thought that it is a particularly impressive-sounding name, especially if you know what it means. When you trace my first, middle, and last names all the way back to their etymological roots, my full name means: \u201cApportioner of Goods, Defender of Man, Son of \u2018God Is My Judge.\u2019\u201d Spencer My first name, Spencer, is certainly the least impressive-sounding of the three names in terms of its etymological meaning. It is a shortened form of the English word dispenser, which, in the Early Modern Period, referred to a person who apportioned and distributed goods. Thus, the name Spencer originally arose as an occupational surname, just like Baker, Miller, Smith, Tyler, Cooper, Wright, and so forth. The famed Elizabethan English poet Edmund Spenser (lived c. 1553 \u2013 1599), the author of the epic poem The Faerie Queene, was among the people who bore the name when it was mainly only used as a surname. Spencer did not become a common given name until around the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The name reached the peak of its popularity in the 1990s, around the time when I was born.  ABOVE: Portrait of Edmund Spenser, the author of The Faerie Queene Alexander My middle name, Alexander, is a Latinized form of the ancient Greek name \u1f08\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (Al\u00e9xandros), which comes from the Ancient Greek verb \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03c9 (al\u00e9x\u014d), which means \u201cI defend,\u201d plus \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (andr\u00f3s), the singular genitive form of the noun \u1f00\u03bd\u03ae\u03c1 (an\u1e17r), meaning \u201cman.\u201d Thus, the name means \u201cDefender of Man.\u201d The name Alexandros, interestingly, is first attested as the name of the king of the city of Wilusa (Troy) in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), who sealed a treaty in around 1280 BC with Muwatalli II, the king of the Hittites. The name is transliterated in the treaty into ancient Luwian as Alaksandu. Thus, my middle name actually can be traced all the way back to the Bronze Age.  ABOVE: Photograph of the Alaksandu treaty In the Iliad, an ancient Greek epic poem that was probably composed in around the eighth century BC, Alexandros is another name for Paris, a character in the epic who is one of the sons of King Priamos of Troy. As a result of Alexandros\u2019s prominence in the Iliad, the name Alexandros was always a relatively common name in ancient Greece. Nonetheless, the name was greatly popularized by King Alexandros III of Makedonia\u2014the man most commonly known in English as \u201cAlexander the Great.\u201d Starting during Alexander\u2019s lifetime (356 \u2013 323 BC) and continuing throughout the rest of ancient Greek history, Alexandros remained one of the most common names in the Hellenistic world. Eventually, the name entered into Latin and the Latinized form Alexander became a very popular Roman name as well. It was the Latin form of the name that eventually became common in English. Famous people named \u201cAlexander\u201d in modern times have included the Founding Father of the United States Alexander Hamilton (lived 1755 or 1757 \u2013 1804) and the Scottish-born inventor Alexander Graham Bell (lived 1847 \u2013 1922).  ABOVE: Third-century BC Greek marble statue of Alexander the Great McDaniel My last name is really unusual because it is an Anglicization of the Scottish clan name MacD\u00f2mhnaill, meaning \u201cson of D\u00f2mhnaill,\u201d but the Scottish name D\u00f2mhnaill has mistakenly been conflated with the English name Daniel, which comes from \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ae\u03bb, the Ancient Greek transliteration of the Biblical Hebrew name \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc (D\u0101n\u00ee\u2019\u0113l), which means \u201cGod is My Judge.\u201d This is, of course, the name of the hero Daniel in the Book of Daniel from the Hebrew Bible. This name, in turn, is probably a corruption of the even older ancient Canaanite name D\u0101n\u2019\u0113l, which was the name of a famous Canaanite culture hero. D\u0101n\u2019\u0113l is mentioned in the incomplete Epic of Aqhat, which was discovered inscribed on a clay tablet from the ancient Canaanite city of Ugarit that was probably originally written in the fourteenth century BC. A portion of my last name, then, can be traced back to the Bronze Age as well. If you translate the whole name McDaniel from its roots in both Scottish Gaelic and Biblical Hebrew, my full last name means \u201cSon of \u2018God Is My Judge.\u2019\u201d  ABOVE: Photograph of a clay tablet from Ugarit containing a portion of the Epic of Aqhat Of course, the Scottish name D\u00f2mhnaill actually comes from the even earlier reconstructed Proto-Celtic name *Dubnowalos, which comes from a combination of the Proto-Celtic words *dubnos, meaning \u201cworld,\u201d and *walos, meaning \u201cprince.\u201d The name therefore literally means \u201cWorld-Prince.\u201d Therefore, if you un-Anglicize my last name and go back to the original Scottish surname, the name actually means \u201cSon of the World-Prince.\u201d Amusingly, D\u00f2mhnaill is also the source of the English name Donald. The surnames MacDonald and McDonald are both Anglicizations of MacD\u00f2mhnaill, just like McDaniel. The name of the popular American fast food restaurant McDonald\u2019s therefore means \u201cBelonging to the Son of the World-Prince.\u201d Etymology can make even the name of a popular fast food restaurant sound terrifying.  ABOVE: Photograph of the McDonald\u2019s \u201cGolden Archs.\u201d The name McDonald is an alternative Anglicization of the Scottish clan name MacD\u00f2mhnaill, which means \u201cSon of the World-Prince.\u201d ",
