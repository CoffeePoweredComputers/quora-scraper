            "answer_text": "Since no amount of guessing can lead us to any correct figure,that\u2019s why I have shared the marks vs ranks which are included in the the JEE Reports of previous 8 years which will give you a lot of closure and insights about the scores of various candidates. You can check out this official website of IIT Roorkee for all these above mentioned links. Now comes the analysis part which I personally went through during my preparation and so I am sharing it with you guys. If you look at the trend of previous years then you can see for yourself that approx. 50% marks out of the total can do wonders for you leaving the exception of JEE ADVANCED 2017 conducted by IIT MADRAS as it had a lot of bonus marks(18 to be precise) and that year the Mathematics section was quite easy and scoring. That being said every year many candidates fail to secure this 50% also due to various reasons.The difficulty of this year\u2019s paper was high as analysed by some of the reputable coaching institutes like Allen and Resonance. Especially Physics and Mathematics section was difficult and questions in Maths were lengthy.This can prove to be a determining factor in the overall scores and ranks of candidates.On the other hand Chemistry was too easy and many people are claiming it to be the easiest section in the entire paper. So it\u2019s better if you are preparing for the next year\u2019s JEE Advanced that you focus on studying hard and revising everything that you have completed previously at regular intervals.Revision and practicing past year papers is the most essential and important part of your preparations and should not be avoided in any scenario. Don\u2019t stress on securing a fixed percentage and never keep a number in mind while attempting your papers be it your coaching AITS or the actual JEE ADVANCED paper because you never know how others are going to fare in the same paper which you are giving like it happened in 2017.The best thing which you can focus on is attempting maximum questions correctly and putting your best efforts in your preparations. Never let your past marks and failures in previous coaching tests trouble or disturb your studies.I understand that it will put you off at times but the people who have qualified JEE Advanced and other competitive exams have gone through the same challenging phase as yours but the only thing which helped them see it all through was the belief in their preparation and their self motivation which are the integral components to have under stress situations which JEE will present to you. Learn from your mistakes in previous papers and try not to repeat them.Whenever you write your next coaching paper browse quickly through the previous ones and see where did you go wrong. Analysis of past papers can improve your score considerably and can do wonders for you.Remember one thing that JEE Advanced is a relative exam. The rank which you will get also depends on the competition around you. You can\u2019t do anything about the toughness of competition but don\u2019t make it easy for anyone to get past you.When you are fighting against odds don\u2019t forget that you are also a part of that race and competition. You fail,You try and You repeat the cycle until You achieve your goal. On an ending note I will also advise you not to day dream about your success rather put your efforts in making all those dreams come true.[1] Footnotes[1] https://jeeadv.ac.in/archives/jee-reports.html",
