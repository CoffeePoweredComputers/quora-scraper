            "answer_text": "Hey, Being a SNIST Alumni I can only say that .. Academic wise both will be equal. Opportunities wise both are same. But you are interested in having a greater campus life and chill with more events in a bigger campus .. GITAM stands out. This doesn\u2019t mean that .. SNIST do not have any events . We do have pretty big events and a lot is happening with 17 student clubs in SNIST. Now the main thing PLACEMENTS - With sources from my GITAM friends - GITAM managed to get more companies with a bit bigger bracket package companies : Say 6\u201310+ lakh per annum BUT only single digit and by max not more than 20 are recruited in respective companies. Many of my friends struggled in GITAM during placements and rest(most of them) are 3\u20134 Lakh package offerings with less recruitment numbers compared to SNIST. SNIST now doesn\u2019t offer a wide range of Bigger package companies, like at max 6\u201310 companies offering more than 5.5L PA with less recruited/ capable students.BUT .. It does give the average student a safer bet at placements with DAY 0 companies recruiting bulk of the students offering average 3.5L PA i.e more than 300 students being finally placed in all DAY 0 companies. Now, this was the case of 2018 batch, it may vary when it s your time to graduate. P.S: Also keep the Fees ( acad + hostel + transport + exam and what not ) and travel distance in mind before taking a decision. Overall, Both are good colleges in Hyderabad. I hope, my above breakdown will help you choose a right college for you. ",
