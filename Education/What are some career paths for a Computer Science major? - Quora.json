            "answer_text": "Software engineering and programming jobs represent the typical career path for a computer science major. Nonetheless, careers in computer science evolve at a staggering rate. Job titles like Data Scientist and Big Data Engineer did not exist ten years ago. I can still see growth in data science jobs in the upcoming decade. To be prepared for such jobs, a data scientist needs to master four main skills (consider the pie chart below):  (1) Programming: a data scientist must be proficient in one or more high level programming languages like C/C++ and Java as well as major scripting languages such as Python and R. (2) Database / SQL: a data scientist must be able to manage, maintain, and retrieve data stored in large-scale data databases. Hence, learning SQL, as the most widely-used query language, is also becoming a must. (3) Statistics: a data scientist must be able to test various hypotheses on data. She cannot do that without solid understanding of statistical terminology such as Mean, Standard Deviation, P-value, and the Null Hypothesis\u2026 (4) Machine learning: a data scientist may need to build a machine learning on the input data to predict new unseen patterns. For instance, a data scientist at Netflix may leverage machine learning to predict the next movie you may want to watch. Such prediction model is one of many applications of machine learning theory. Recently, I have witnessed even job postings for Machine Learning Engineers and AI Engineers. In the future, I would not be surprised if we had job titles like Autonomous Car App Developer, Blockchain Engineer, Smart City App Developer\u2026 That is why I would emphasize the importance of continuing to learn cutting edge technologies so that you can keep up with the pace of change. Mastering all such skills cannot be easily achieved without academic guidance. Hence, pursuing a Master\u2019s degree in data science / big data as part of a prestigious computer science program (such as the one at MIT, ASU, and Stanford) may make the learning journey easier.

            "answer_text": "Since you've asked about industry specifically, I've listed a couple of options below, but there are definitely other options for CS majors outside of these! CS is such an awesome discipline in that you can really do just about anything with it! While each of these roles do different things at different companies, generally, the job descriptions at software companies are split into these roles.  Software Engineer / SDE / Dev / Software Development Engineer: This is probably what most people think about when they think of CS-ers in the workforce. All of the internships I've done have been SDE internships. I've worked developing software for various products. I think if you're unsure of what path to take (especially for internships), this is a good place to start. SDEs can develop for front end or back end, and some companies specify this. From the companies I have interned at, I've done social web front end, product upper back end, and will be doing web front end next summer. There's a lot of variety in the products you can develop!Software Development Engineer in Test / SDET / Quality Assurance Engineer (QAE): There are slight differences between SDETs and QAEs, but both of them involves testing at some point. You'll need a strong background in testing! Their job is to make sure that the code developed by the SDEs is solid, so they try to \"break\" the code in any way that they can! These engineers also interact with different types of coding products in that they may write tests for front end or back end, mobile or web, web or physical product, etc over the course of their career.PM: PM can stand for Program Manager or Product Manager at different companies (at least between Microsoft and Google, respectively). From what I understand, PMs are generally the ones who are in charge of thinking about how a customer will interact with something. They meet with clients (or think about the client) to develop specifications for the SDEs to follow. This can be for a front end or a back end project, and for all different kinds of products as well (like previously mentioned for SDEs and SDETs).UI Engineer / UX Engineer: Sometimes overlooked, UI/UX Engineers (User Interface/User Experience) are in charge of thinking about the interface that users interact with (as inferred from their name). They have to have a keen eye for detail and think about even the smallest details such as alignment of buttons or exact shades of colors used for a button. Most of their work will be on the front end (where most users interact).There are many different avenues for CS majors, from software development (as I mentioned above) to banking to security to gaming and so on. Even within software companies, there are even divisions such as web development, product development, database engineering, and more. Outside of those original 4 that I listed, there are other paths that are popular but aren't necessarily \"standard\" across most software companies. You can get as specific as you want! I'll try to add more with descriptions at another time, but Data Scientist if one that I've heard at a good number of large companies. I've also heard Database Engineer and Security Engineer too, but you can get pretty much as specific as you want! Data Scientist: At some companies, such as Facebook, there's a lot of data that, if analyzed, can lead to really interesting conclusions about people or other entities. In the case of Facebook, I remember sitting in on a talk by a data scientist regarding how NLP was being used to assess how happy/sad people were from their statuses!Outside of these, there are probably countless different job titles just depending how specialized the role is. Additionally, as in other disciplines, there are management roles and levels of engineers (ex: senior engineers). And even outside of industry, research is also always a viable and rewarding career path as well as academia or teaching! Wasn't sure if this is what you were looking for, but I figured a list of things you could do with a CS major might gone on forever. I hope this is what you were looking for! Good luck in your pursuits! Edit: Added some more detail on the different kinds of jobs available to SDEs and minimal addition to the other 3 ",
