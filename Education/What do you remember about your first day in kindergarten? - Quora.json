            "answer_text": "By the time I entered Kindergarten, I\u2019d taught myself to read, which doesn\u2019t sound today like the rare accomplishment it was in 1960, long before the Boomer Generation began hammering knowledge into their own children the minute they popped out. (Hell, before they popped out, as in blasting fetuses with Classical music.) So yeah, reading by Kindergarten, self-taught or not, isn\u2019t really that big a deal, but the fact that the school and other kids thought it was, set the tone for my distinct separation between school and home. I\u2019ve stated a version of this in other answers I\u2019m too lazy to find and link: At school I could do no wrong, whereas at home I could do no right. This only became evident in Kindergarten, which made me enjoy being there, though every fucking minute of my 2 years in Nursery School was torture. Emily Fisher's answer to What is the most embarrassing moment of your life? The only torture I remember in Kindergarten was intermittent boredom. A large majority of the 30 children in the class were WASPs, my first introduction to this bland species of human, as previously I\u2019d only known Blacks and Jews. It was probably a couple of years before I was aware of this being the difference in the children there; in Kindergarten, I simply thought school must make children lifeless. This boring lifelessness frightened me a bit, the type of fear I was inspired to attack, though it wasn\u2019t the WASP children I attacked, but myself. I was an outdoorsy run-around type child, unused to having to sit in place for long periods of time. Not that I was ADHDish at all, just that I preferred action. My favorite action in Kindergarten turned out to be with scissors, as kiddie safety ones hadn\u2019t been invented yet, so we were forbidden scissors at home. They\u2019d always seemed to be a fascinating adult object and I\u2019d been eager to get my hands on a pair.  In Kindergarten, though still metal and sharp, they did have childsized versions, which were passed out with extreme warnings during holidays, i.e. when it was time to fold construction paper in half in order to cut out snowflakes or valentines. I found myself to be dexterous and quick with this assignment, so had plenty of time on my hands while others still struggled. What better way to spend my time than to see what all the danger fuss was about? I promptly lifted the hem of my dress and scratched some blood lines into my thigh. Hmm, interesting. They really do cut skin! Better grab the paste pot and fill those lines before the blood gets on my dress, which I\u2019d never hear the end of at home! Being that I wasn\u2019t interested in self-harm, only in experimentation, I never bloodied myself with the scissors again, but every time we had a project with them, the time between my own completion and that of the rest of the class seemed to lengthen, as did my boredom. And so I entered the realm of d\u00e9collage, cutting intricate designs into the smock dresses my mother had made herself. They were pretty! The dresses looked better with them! Of course I got into trouble at home for this behavior, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. When Kindergarten boredom struck, and scissors were in my hand, d\u00e9collage was the order of the day! As an adult I\u2019ve often expressed never having really experienced boredom. And until just now, writing this, I\u2019ve believed this to be true. But Kindergarten was the rare exception. By 1st Grade I\u2019d overcome my shyness with other children, begun to recognize the superpowers I had away from home, and counteracted boredom by babbling non-stop to others. Another thing about Kindergarten is that it was only half-day, so there was no recess, no going outside. Meaning my innately athletic muscles were also bored. The closest we got to physical activity was when the teacher moved the tables aside and had us all join hands for Ring-Around-the-Fucking-Rosie. It creeped me out to even touch those dead-eyed children, and having both hands held while dimwits stumbled to keep pace made me feel like I was in a straightjacket. Fuck, whoever invented this question, why\u2019d you make me think of this!?! Suddenly I\u2019m shaking and close to tears! Of course I never knew the Ring-Around-the-Rosie song was about dying, but being forced to play it always made me wish I was. Now for the wrap up, the pi\u00e8ce de resistance. My first day of Kindergarten is the only one that\u2019s crystal clear to me, though it\u2019s what happened when I got home that dictated my life for many decades. My brother and sister walked me to school that first day, but since I was the only one with a half day, I walked myself the at least half mile home. (Yeah, a 5 year old in the streets alone may seem inconceivable today, but in 1960 it wasn\u2019t, in my family, anyway.) I made it home for lunch, and for some inexplicable reason, my mother seemed glad to see me. She was in the midst of preparing lunch for the 2 of us, certainly the first time in my life I\u2019d ever eaten a meal with just my mother. She was excited about this lunch, making a big production of it, explaining the intricacies of what was to come: Cold cottage cheese mixed with freshly made hot peas. Peas and cottage cheese. Although I\u2019d never heard of it before, she explained that this was one of her favorites, that something about the hot peas popping through the crisp milky coldness of the cottage cheese was most satisfyingly delicious. I sat at the table, spoon at the ready, eagerly awaiting such a delicacy, never before having heard my mother express excitement over food (or probably anyone, for that matter). When the peas were ready, she got the cottage cheese straight from the refrigerator and dished it into our bowls, then brought over the steaming pot and used a slotted spoon to place a pile of hot peas onto the cold cottage cheese. She sat down with me and instructed, \u201cNow you need to take your spoon and gently mix the two together before you have your first bite. Don\u2019t mix too hard or long, or you\u2019ll heat up the cottage cheese and cool off the peas. The trick is to blend it so perfectly that both the hot and cold pop in your mouth!\u201d The truth is, never before or since did my mother give me such undivided and specifically personal attention. I took heed, did as instructed, and my life was altered nearly forever. There\u2019s no way of knowing how much of this had to do with what turned out to be the deepest connection I ever had with my mother, or how much was due to secret gluttony a life of constant abuse by my whole family had inspired. But that first mouthful of hot peas and cold cottage cheese was what I now recognize as orgasmic. Something burst inside me, and for more than 50 years, as a consequence, I craved the deep fill of deliciousness that never quite satisfies, but must constantly be attempted by shoveling in massive amounts of food in a rapid blur that didn\u2019t include chewing. Throughout childhood, my older brother and sister were very picky eaters, and the only praise I ever received was for my hardy appetite for all foods, the more exotic the better. The die was cast, and by the time my butt was the butt of my skinny family\u2019s jokes, it was too late to stop. I became famous far and wide for my food intake. Emily Fisher's answer to What do you think of body shaming? So yeah, gorging, fasting, bulimia, anorexia, fat, thin, yo-yo body \u2014 my mother calling me The Human Accordion \u2014 all were an ongoing part of my life until not too many years ago, when an unintentional Ketogenic diet reset my cravings and metabolism before I was familiar with that word. I suppose it\u2019s uncommon for anyone to know when an issue like that began, but for me, I have an exact date \u2014 The First Day of Kindergarten.  ",

            "answer_text": "I walked to first day of class with two other girls on their first day as well. About a mile. Everyone walked to school and Home. I remember a boy in my class would not stop crying. Did not understand why. Teacher distracted him the rest of us were amazed that a kid would cry like that. Walked home after my half day at school. Told my mom over and over about the crying kid. Finally mom told me not to mention the crying kid again and to be nice at school because maybe he was not used to bring away from parents. That boggled my mind. I loved having a baby sitter or going to play at my baby sitters house when mom had something to do ( she was 13 or 14 and lived about six blocks away. Her parents were my parents best friends do we were around her a lot. So I had no separation anxiety. That was the first time I had ever seen a kid cry like that. I am 64 years old now. And still remember the kids name and what he looked like. Can pick him out of our class photo. Don't remember anyone else or anything else about kindergarten. Just that I liked finger painting dayb I could already read kindergarten and some first grade books before starting school and could write my name , numbers and letters. ",
