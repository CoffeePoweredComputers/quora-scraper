            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhat are the quickest ways to learn a new subject?\u201d Learn the subject of study first, then study each new subject.Any student should be flying along, feeling brilliant, enthusiastic, fully understanding what they are learning, without stress or strain, and able to apply what one has learned. I call this \u201cdoing well.\u201d If you are not \u201cdoing well\u201d you should clarify any words you do not understand in any subjects you are not \u201cdoing well\u201d in. There is a standard method to do this, it is called Method One Word Clearing. I estimate it would take 8 to 16 hours to do this for high school students. I estimate this would speed up your progress 4X. You should then be \u201cdoing well\u201d in all subjects.Buy a Personal Dictionary for the general words used in your culture, and one that contains the technical terms used in the new subject. Obtain any other materials you will need to have for this new subject.Review/restudy any subjects that come just before the new subject, and that will be required to fully understand it.Work out a purpose, a personal reason to invest your time, for this new subject. This might be a good time to look at a tutor, if this subject is especially important to you.Find a Glossary of Terms for this new subject that provides accurate definitions of each of the words or terms or symbols used in the new subject.Locate the study materials, text books, or lectures, or courses you intend to learn from. If you have access to people that are experts in this subject, you might arrange to see them at their work. If you can do a co-op work experience, Apprenticeship or lower level work in that subject that would be beneficial. You want study materials that are written by the person that did the original research, or as close to it as possible.Look over the first page or Chapter of the new material very quickly and write down any terms or symbols that do not instantly understand.Then study that page or Chapter. Repeat for the rest of the course.Good luck with your studies, Leon ",

            "answer_text": "Teach someone else. Enter: the Feynman Technique Richard Feynman was a theoretical physicist who, from a very early age, taught himself subjects such as trigonometry, calculus, analytic geometry. Here is the \u201c1 Minute Version\u201d of his technique, as presented by Jonathan Levi and superhumanacademy.com: Pick a topic you want to understand and start studying it. Write down everything you know about the topic on a notebook page, using illustrations wherever possible to simplify the understanding and portrayal of the subject. Add to that page every time you learn something new about it.Pretend to teach your topic to a classroom. Make sure you're able to explain the topic in simple terms.Go back to the books when you get stuck. The gaps in your knowledge should be obvious. Revisit problem areas until you can explain the topic fully.Simplify and use analogies. Repeat the process while simplifying your language and connecting facts with analogies to help strengthen your understanding.Less than one minute, and you are now armed with one of the simplest, yet most powerful, techniques to teach yourself anything. Mr. Levi has created a few of his online courses simply to leverage this powerful technique. \u201cTo teach is to learn twice.\u201d - Joseph Joubert See more about Richard Feynman and his technique here: SuperLearner Spotlight: Richard Feynman - SuperHuman Academy. You can also apply the DiSSS and CaFE systems, as popularized by Tim Feriss. DiSSS D - deconstruction, or breaking the subject down into manageable pieces S - Selection - apply the Pareto principle, or the 80/20 rule. Determine which pieces will give you the most use for the least effort. S - Sequencing - in what order should I learn these pieces? Do they build on each other? S - Stakes - make actual, real-world conditions that require you to practice. Set up an anti-charity, commit to performing the skill (or teaching the subject, see above). Something to make you commit. Apply Parkinson's Law and set this event on a timeline that pushes your deadlines. CaFE C - condensing - make the information easy to digest. Make cheat sheets. F - Frequency - practice often. Use spaced repetition to keep memories fresh. E - Encoding - learn memory techniques (like those taught here: Become a SuperLearner), such as the major method to memorize numbers and using visual markers to remember complex details (and, while you're at it, 3x your reading speed). With these techniques, you should be well on your way to being able to learn anything you'd like. ",
