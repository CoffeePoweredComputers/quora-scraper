            "answer_text": "Students often mimic a teacher\u2019s actions. If the teacher prepares a warm, happy environment, students are more likely to be happy. An environment set by the teacher can be either positive or negative. Teachers are responsible for the social behavior in their classrooms. This behavior is primarily a reflection of the teacher\u2019s actions and the environment she sets.  The amount and quality of talk in classrooms is tied directly to student achievement. Yet many teachers are still locked into the \"Initiation-Response-Evaluation\" (IRE) pattern of talk.  And the discussions in class are never really connecting home and school environment rather they are simply task based so there is more emotional development of the child. Also talk is often considered as noise which is definitely in correct and talks should be given space is it clearly shows that children are connecting and are interested in classroom and I believe that a 'silent classroom is very dangerous 'Ask Open-ended Reflective Questions. Question that can be answered with yes or no, find a way to rephrase it. In their book Thinking for Themselves: Developing Strategies for Reflective Learning. Increase Your \"Wait Time\" With Students. As humorist Fran Lebowitz wrote, \"The opposite of talking is not listening. The opposite of talking is waiting.\" Adding just a few seconds onto your pause at the end of a question, particularly an open-ended question, gives students the time they need to arrive at deep answers. Remember, they may already have had years of the IRE pattern. ",

            "answer_text": "Teacher\u2019s talk is important as Teachers often talk about how hard it is to connect with and get to their students. They say students view them as out of bounds; hence according to students, teachers cannot understand them. This is a wrong and dangerous assumption on the students\u2019 side, and teachers should do their best to debunk this myth and form connections with their students. Developing positive relationships between teachers and students has a positive, significant, and long-lasting impact on the students\u2019 lives, both academically and socially. A student would work better in class if they felt that their teacher valued and cared for them. We all would want to feel loved and cared for, and so do students. They feel valued if the teacher not only cares about their grades but also their well-being and social life. ",
