            "answer_text": "Once the prospects have been chosen, the next step is to contact them.  Emails serve as one of the best ways as it is low cost and are scalable. Many times, even a few email exchanges are good to convert a prospect into a customer. However, the big hurdle is to hunt for the prospect\u2019s email address. Enlisted below are the ways that can help you find an email address of the person you wish to do business with. See Original article here:7 Effective Ways To Find a Prospect's Email Address 1. Tracking by name & personal details A query with the name of the prospect on Google assists in hunting his/her email address. Name if unique serves the purpose most of the time. But for more common ones we get a big list to tackle. Say, if the name is Ankit you get a long list.  If the name alone doesn\u2019t work, you need not worry. One can make the search more specific by adding personal information to it. For example instead of giving just the name \u201cAnkit\u201d, add his hometown, company name, etc. This will help you to find the prospect\u2019s email address. For instance, [name] +hometown[name] +contact info Remember!! These filters, if mixed and matched, serves the best.  2. Add \u201cLinkedIn\u201d and \u201cZoomInfo\u201d to your search LinkedIn and ZoomInfo can also provide you with the required information. You will have to add either of these two with the name of the person and the email address of the prospect can be fetched. [name] +LinkedIn[name] +ZoomInfo  This method to find prospects\u2019 email address can be handy in serving your purpose well. 3. Using the company\u2019s email network Most companies provide their employees with company email address. Searching for the email address can be done using the company name as a domain. [name] + @ + company name. Each company has a different pattern for the email address. So, put your imagination to work. Try out different patterns with the name of prospect and company; you will be able to find an email address that you desire. 4. Using the company website Visit the company website and using the person\u2019s name start running queries. There are strong chances of finding an indexed document with prospect\u2019s email address.  Most of the time email address is available. But sometimes it happens that we do not find the email address but other information related to the person. Using these information wth modifiers like contact will do the needful. site:company Create your website in minutes + [name]  + emailsite:company Create your website in minutes + [contact ]  + email Company\u2019s website name is easily available and one can find an email address with fewer efforts. 5. Social Profile As there is a hike in the number of users who use social networking sites to connect with people, it becomes easy to answer the question \u201chow to find prospect\u2019s email address?\u201d. Try out his/her name with different social media like Twitter, Facebook, etc and you will get their email address. You can also skim through their profile to find the email address. [name] + Twitter[name]  + Facebook  6. Personal blog or website Having a personal website or blog has been a trend for some time now. If you wish to do business with a person, look for their website or blog. It often has the email address. If the email address is not available, try to use your imagination. Team the personal blog address with different filters and you will be able to search email address very easily. [Personal blog].com + [name]  + email[Personal blog].com + [name]  + contact and so on\u2026 7. Search the name using WhoIs Try giving WhoIs as a prefix to the name of your prospect, by going to the search engine you like to use. WhoIs [name] It does work. It\u2019s hard to believe but you will had to believe after trying it.  Here are two methods I often use when google fails me, (yes! It\u2019s unbelievable but it sometimes does fail) A. Use 123 People \u2013 This is a wonderful site, which works to find out email address, phone number, etc. of the prospects. It can provide you with personal information from seven different countries. B. No rules no regulations \u2013 When all the above tactics fail to provide you the email address, using \u201cno rules no regulations\u201d tactic can do wonders. emailing via LinkedInping them through TwitterOnce you are done with finding an email address, you can easily pitch your prospects for sales. You can even know whether the prospect has opened your email or not by using our sales analytic tool Saleshandy. One of the above listed tactics will definitely help you to end your hunt for the email address of the prospects. Do let me know as comments which one worked for you. ",

Stay with me here \u2013 finding email addresses is a BIG part of his job. He\u2019s sent more than 2K emails to bloggers, SEO experts, and inbound marketers over the past 18 months. And he had to search for nearly every email address manually for his outreach. So you\u2019re in good hands. Here\u2019s his advice: 1.

Here are some common formulas you can use to guess an email address:  An alternative shortcut: Email Permutator+ from Metric Sparrow. It can automatically create a list of possible email addresses. Just fill in the fields and let it do the job.  3. Subscribe To Your Target\u2019s Email List If a person you\u2019re targeting has a personal blog, you can subscribe to his or her email list via an opt\u2010in form on the blog. Most newsletter emails will come from their personal email address. Here\u2019s one of the very first email outreach messages Nick ever sent:  4. Check Your LinkedIn Connections Did you know that a user\u2019s email address is always visible on LinkedIn for your direct connections? Check one of your connection\u2019s profiles, and their email address will be there for you to grab in the \u2018Contact Info\u2019 section. Here\u2019s the official manual from LinkedIn: Click the My Network icon at the top of your LinkedIn homepage.Click Your connections on the left rail.Click Manage synced and imported contacts near the top right of the page.Under Advanced actions on the right rail, click Export contacts.Click Request Archive.You will receive an email to your Primary Email address which will include a link where you can download your list of connections. You will then get a CSV file. And your connections\u2019 email addresses will all be there. Warning message for everyone\u2014don\u2019t blindly connect with everyone on LinkedIn. You risk leaking your personal email address into improper hands! Aaaand that\u2019s four quick tactics (more over here if you\u2019d like them.) Please upvote if you found this helpful! ",

As noted, my choice being - Foundly for finding all business email addresses :) Email Prospecting tool (my personal favourite)Automated and highly targeted method These tools are your most targeted and efficient method. You have the opportunity to work with sites such as: LinkedInTwitterQuoraIndividual company websitesYou get the gist\u2026.You can now work with a chrome extension from a prospecting tool such as: Foundly - my current choice HunterFindthatleadThese tools will pretty much automate your full process and find the business email addresses of your targets for you!

Information such as: First nameLast nameCompany nameBusiness email addressTools which can provide such information: WhoisvisitingHubspotLeadforensicsVisiting social profilesManual process This is a simple however a hugely time consuming and not very reliable/rewarding method.

If not, move to next prospectVisiting websitesManual and unpredictable Identify the companies you wish to targetReview the \u2018about us\u2019 sectionReview if email addresses are displayedBuying dataAutomated however this is VERY hit or miss This can be a great solution, however, do your homework!

            "answer_text": "All of the other answers are great.  Some of them are based on the assumption that you know the standard email address syntax for a company, but you may not in fact know that.  There is a simple way to discover that for people at medium and large companies. Go to Jigsaw.com.  Jigsaw is a service where people--sales reps, mostly--pool their Rolodexes.  It's a pay-or-play platform.  That means to get the info on a particular person, you can either pay a small fee or contribute a contact of your own.  For a new contact, you have to at least have the name and an email and a phone number, which could be the main corporate number.  You can also contribute a job title and a company name.  BTW, you can also get credit for a new contact by updating information on an existing contact. Now, you can look up contacts using standard search fields--first name, last name, title, company.  You might be lucky and actually find the person you are looking for, but that doesn't usually happen.  (Maybe 25% of the time, in my experience.)  But you can usually just fill in the company field and get a list of all the people in the Jigsaw database who are at that company. You must have purchased credits or earned them by adding some of your own contacts to proceed.  Assuming you have credits, then, you spend some of them to see full information about a few carefully selected names on the search results list.  You will be able to quickly ascertain the email naming pattern of the company and use it to instantiate the email address for the person you have in mind.  BTW, you can use this same technique to find people of interest for pursuing a job opening or a sales contact or whatever.   When you join Jigsaw, you adopt an anonymous username, and that name is used as the source for all contacts that you add, so people can't trace contacts back to you.  I can see some ethical gray areas here, but people are free to have themselves delisted from Jigsaw if they wish not to be found there.  I, on the other hand, want to be found, so I created my own contact entry, and I maintain it as needed. ",

            "answer_text": "You can take the manual approach or you can use a couple of really good services. Hunter.ioClearbitI\u2019ve used both of them, they both work well but have slightly different use cases. I did a review of Clearbit on the Sharey Company Blog. I\u2019ve copied it below. \u2014 Clearbit Connect, is a Gmail and Outlook plugin that makes finding someone\u2019s email address a breeze. They offer a free plan where you can search for 100 email addresses per month. Install the plugin If you\u2019re using Gmail, hop over to the Chrome store and add the plugin to your account. After you authorize it you\u2019re ready to go. When you want to look up an email address, just click the Clearbit button at the top of your Gmail window. How I use it Here\u2019s how I use this tool when I prospect. I\u2019m currently focused on a couple of different types of outreach to grow Sharey\u2019s customer base. They fall into two categories, guesting on podcasts and cold emailing potential customers. For both of these cases, my process is similar. I will go to the website of the person or podcast I\u2019m interested in and find out the names of people that work there. Specifically, I\u2019m looking for the main point of contact. Then, I hop over to my Gmail account and enter in the domain name. Clearbit will return for me all the people it can find from that domain. So, for example, if I want to find out the email address of someone at Sharey, I would type \u201csharey.com\u201d into the domain name and click search. Within seconds, a list of people working at Sharey is returned. I hope this list grows soon! I click on that and see a rich profile of my target prospect. I then send my outreach email using Mixmax. But Wait, There\u2019s More Clearbit is useful for finding contact information. It\u2019s also great for giving you more details on the contacts you already have. I\u2019ve found this feature a little clunky though. Sometimes when I open two emails, A, and B when I\u2019m on email B it will show me the contact info from email A. Good but not perfect Clearbit only works with email addresses that belong to a person or company name. You can\u2019t use it to find someone\u2019s Gmail address by their name.

            "answer_text": "There are many ways, like using dataproviders, linkedIn (with the addition of tools like Kickfire or Hunter), reverse-Ip tools like LeadForensics and more. The question \u201cHow to get emails?\u201d always was the biggest issue, when I started out with cold-emailing (or prospecting, email automation, if you like these terms better). I was always lost about one thing: Where do I find the right contacts and email for prospecting? So many options on all around. What works for me, is the following\u2026  Starting out with the basics. Find an on-line database of companies, look up a specific industry and then check their websites 1 by 1, to get the information I needed. (Now, this approach worked well enough for a beginner like me. The information I gathered was accurate (to some extent), but it was a painfully slow process).I got like 30-40 contacts this way, per day. When you want to properly email a big market, you know that you need a few thousand fresh contacts, each month. So, what do you do at this point? You supercharge your lead-generating skills, that\u2019s what you do.For email prospecting (I use Platformax for prospecting and the whole sale process as well) , I use linkedIn quite a lot. Don\u2019t laugh!Many people don\u2019t know, but it is a powerful tool, when used correctly. With a bit of tweaking, you can search your local or far-away connections by industry, country, job-title, and so on! (True, you still don\u2019t have their email address directly, but you have a lot to go on). You can contact them directly with private messages or\u2026.Use a dataprovider (I personally use datafy). With data-providers, you put down your criteria,on which the search for contacts is one (give them the name of the companies you found on Linkedin for example) and see how many direct emails they provide you with!Reverse-Ip tools. Ah, the good old \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know\u201d dilemma. Sure, you have visitors on your page, but what do you know about them? Where are they from, how long were they on your site, what was of most interest to them, what was the reason for them to not continue and become a client/buyer? \u2026..Pick up the phone and call them (works best with sending an email after, or before :) ). There is nothing to it, just ask \u201cHey John, I see we had a visitor from zxy on our page for 30 minutes, are you looking for\u2026.. Or maybe you can give me the contact of the person in charge?\u201d.Also, referrals!! Do not underestimate the power of \u201cwho do you know, that can benefit from our service/product?That\u2019s how I mostly do things, and it works quite well so far. I am sure, that there are other approaches as well, so see what fits you bet. Using a powerful sales management platform to use the emails you gather efficiently, helps a lot as well :) ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of hacks that you can use to figure this out. First, if an individual works at a company , you can usually find the email structure from [at]companyname.com or whatever the end part of the address is. Then, if you know of someone else's address at that company, you can just copy the same structure. If you do not know the first part of this structure, you can test it with some common formats including:   first initial +last name[at]companyname.com  last name[at]companyname.com  first name[at]companyname.com  first name+.+last name[at]companyname.com  first initial+last inital[at]companyname.com  etc...Then you can test these email addresses using email validation sites such as www.coveryourasp.com (this one provides unlimited testing). There are a bunch that exist but typically have limited number of tests. If you are looking for an individual's personal email address, this is much harder unless you want to buy lists. You can buy access to individual's email address as well or use companies like spoke.com , 123people.com, pipl.com , etc... There are a number of other creative ways if the aforementioned do not work , but you need to know a few additional details and background of the person. You might be able to find email addresses from documents , other communication sources, or registrations for events published online . ",

            "answer_text": "Hi,the simple way of restoring the deleted Gmail account: Step 1: It is imperative that you act on it as soon as you can. There is only a short period of time allowed by Google for users to recover their deleted Gmail accounts. Google has not yet informed the public about the length of time it will take before the Gmail accounts marked for deletion will be unrecoverable. The time may vary or it may be set, no one knows. If you act on recovering your Gmail account as quickly as you can, then you may be able to recover your deleted account. Step 2: Go directly to the Google Password Assistance page. This is the sign-in page where you can locate the \u201cI'm having other problems signing in\u201d selection. You simply have to enter your email address and then click on \u201cContinue\u201d to proceed with the next step. Step 3: If you have just recently deleted this Gmail account, then the password for it should still be fresh in your mind. You should then enter the old password. Once you have entered the password, proceed to click on \u201cContinue\u201d. Step 4: Click on the \u201cSubmit a recovery request\u201d option. Once you have successfully entered the password and clicked on the \u201cContinue\u201d button, you will be directed to the page informing you about your account being deleted. There will be a link to the recovery request form on the page. Click it . Please do take note that if you have not received a link to this recovery request, it is highly likely that the account is already permanently deleted. Step 5: Finish the verification process. After you have clicked on recovery request form, there will be a series of steps for verification that you will have to complete. You start off with entering the email address you have currently access to and then answer questions regarding the password. You will also be asked about the last time the lost account was accessed and then when it was created. These are information Google will use for verifying that you are truly the owner. Step 6: Check your current email address since Google will send an email to that. The email will not immediately appear so you may have to wait a while for it. Check the said email and click the attached link for creating a new password to that account. Once done, then that means you have already successfully recovered the deleted Gmail account. These steps will definitely allow you to recover your accidentally deleted Gmail account. However, despite completing the process, you might receive an email that says the \u201caccount was deleted and no longer recoverable\u201d. If this is the email that you receive, then that means the Gmail account is not accessible any longer. It is already gone forever. ",

            "answer_text": "Enlisted below are the ways that can help you find an email address of the person you wish to do business with. See Original article here: 7 Effective Ways To Find a Prospect's Email Address 1. Tracking by name & personal details A query with the name of the prospect on Google assists in hunting his/her email address. Name if unique serves the purpose most of the time. But for more common ones we get a big list to tackle. Say, if the name is Ankit you get a long list. If the name alone doesn\u2019t work, you need not worry. One can make the search more specific by adding personal information to it. For example instead of giving just the name \u201cAnkit\u201d, add his hometown, company name, etc. This will help you to find the prospect\u2019s email address. For instance, [name] +hometown[name] +contact info Remember!! These filters, if mixed and matched, serves the best.  2. Add \u201cLinkedIn\u201d and \u201cZoomInfo\u201d to your search LinkedIn and ZoomInfo can also provide you with the required information. You will have to add either of these two with the name of the person and the email address of the prospect can be fetched. [name] +LinkedIn[name] +ZoomInfo  This method to find prospects\u2019 email address can be handy in serving your purpose well. 3. Using the company\u2019s email network Most companies provide their employees with company email address. Searching for the email address can be done using the company name as a domain. [name] + @ + company name. Each company has a different pattern for the email address. So, put your imagination to work. Try out different patterns with the name of prospect and company; you will be able to find an email address that you desire. 4. Using the company website Visit the company website and using the person\u2019s name start running queries. There are strong chances of finding an indexed document with prospect\u2019s email address. Most of the time email address is available. But sometimes it happens that we do not find the email address but other information related to the person. Using these information wth modifiers like contact will do the needful. site:company Create your website in minutes + [name] + emailsite:company Create your website in minutes + [contact ] + email Company\u2019s website name is easily available and one can find an email address with fewer efforts. 5. Social Profile As there is a hike in the number of users who use social networking sites to connect with people, it becomes easy to answer the question \u201chow to find prospect\u2019s email address?\u201d. Try out his/her name with different social media like Twitter, Facebook, etc and you will get their email address. You can also skim through their profile to find the email address. [name] + Twitter[name] + Facebook  6. Personal blog or website Having a personal website or blog has been a trend for some time now. If you wish to do business with a person, look for their website or blog. It often has the email address. If the email address is not available, try to use your imagination. Team the personal blog address with different filters and you will be able to search email address very easily. [Personal blog].com + [name] + email[Personal blog].com + [name] + contact and so on\u2026 7. Search the name using WhoIs Try giving WhoIs as a prefix to the name of your prospect, by going to the search engine you like to use. WhoIs [name] It does work. It\u2019s hard to believe but you will had to believe after trying it.  Here are two methods I often use when google fails me, (yes! It\u2019s unbelievable but it sometimes does fail) A. Use 123 People \u2013 This is a wonderful site, which works to find out email address, phone number, etc. of the prospects. It can provide you with personal information from seven different countries. B. No rules no regulations \u2013 When all the above tactics fail to provide you the email address, using \u201cno rules no regulations\u201d tactic can do wonders. emailing via LinkedInping them through TwitterOnce you are done with finding an email address, you can easily pitch your prospects for sales. You can even know whether the prospect has opened your email or not by using our sales analytic tool Saleshandy. One of the above listed tactics will definitely help you to end your hunt for the email address of the prospects. Do let me know as comments which one worked for you.

Do you mean \u201cHow do I send an email to someone\u2019s email address?\u201d Well, you log into your email account. You type that person\u2019s email address in the box marked \u201cTo:\u201d. You type a subject, and your message, and press the Send button. That\u2019s it. Maybe you mean, \u201cHow do I log into someone else\u2019s email account?\u201d Well, ideally, you can\u2019t, unless they\u2019ve given you their password. If everyone could log into everyone else\u2019s email accounts, then anyone could send email from anyone else. How would anyone know that a given message was being sent by the person it was supposed to be coming from? Wouldn\u2019t that render the whole system useless? Now some people choose to use very poor passwords - passwords that are easily guessable, like Monkey123 or Password12345, and they can sometimes get their accounts hacked into. That\u2019s a bad thing, as your email account is the center point of your digital life. (If you need to reset your password, where do they send the reset link?) But it\u2019s certainly not something we would hope would be done. Or did you mean something else entirely, like, \u201cHow do I metaphysically connect with the cosmic essence of one\u2019s email address?\u201d In that case, I can\u2019t help you. I suggest speaking with a yogi, or dropping acid or something. It\u2019ll probably all become clear\u2026 for a moment\u2026 maybe. ",

            "answer_text": "Find a Lost E-mail Address Dig through your e-mail folders. If you were once in contact with this person through your current e-mail address or through an e-mail account you no longer use but still kept open, try using the \u201csearch\u201d feature within the e-mail program or on the e-mail page to look for the missing address.Run a search on the person's name or domain, if known. If the full name does not bring up any results, break it down into separate searches by first name, last name, or nickname.Think about an e-mail conversation you may have had with this person in the past and search by a possible subject keyword. For instance, if you worked together on a summer project, try searching for \"summer project.\"Ask in person or by phone. If you need to send something by e-mail to a person you know but lost his or her e-mail address, there is no shame in sending that person a quick phone call or text. If you see him or her in person on a regular basis, you can even wait until you pass that person by before asking.If you are trying to contact a client or potential business associate, you can call the company and speak with the receptionist. As long as employees' e-mail addresses are not kept private, the receptionist will likely have a list of those addresses from which he or she can pull the name of the contact you are looking for.Check a business card. When searching for an e-mail address for business purposes, ask yourself if there is any chance you may have that person's business card. If so, dig it out. The e-mail address will usually be on this card.If the business card is not where you usually keep cards, search through your wallet, desk drawers, or any other spot a stray card may have slipped into.Even if you cannot find a business card for that specific person, at least try to look for a business card for someone with the same company. You can usually use this as a stepping stone in eventually finding the right e-mail address for the contact you need.Contact family or mutual friends. If you are on good terms with someone in that person's family or share a mutual friend with that person, send this new contact a message asking for the missing e-mail address.If you are linked to this third party via e-mail address or social media accounts, you can send that person a quick e-mail to find out if he or she knows the missing address or knows anyone who might.If you are not on personal enough terms to have this third party person's e-mail address, things can be a little trickier, but you might still be able to ask the next time you see him or her in person. Give a quick explanation on how you lost the address and why you need it so that this third person can feel secure about giving it to you.Use an old e-mail address to find a new one. If the address you have is already several years old and you worry that it may no longer be in use, there are a few tools online you can use to find out what the new e-mail address might be based on the old address.Understand that these tools usually require someone to register with them before the new address can be linked to the old one. As such, the tools are far from exclusive, but they can be worth a shot.Such online tools include: whois check",

            "answer_text": "As some people in this thread already mentioned, having the right email address is the key to great outreach. It means that you\u2019ve invested time to look for that particular person\u2019s address and that you\u2019re interested in their feedback. But looking for such email address may prove to be a hassle. Sometimes people hide them from spammers. Sometimes you visit a blog and there\u2019s a generic company email under the \u2018contact us\u2019 page and that\u2019s it. Sometimes it\u2019s just bad luck. Thankfully, there are a bunch of way to discover somebody\u2019s email address today. Here\u2019s the list of tricks that I\u2019m using: Use Find That Email. It\u2019s the most effective email discovery service out there, it looks good and has a handy Chrome extension. Our own study back last year showed that Find That Email has a 92% success ratio compared to similar tools.Check the domain name in search. Using a few search parameters you can turn Google into your own free email discovery service. For example, if you\u2019d like to find an email for somebody who\u2019s working at Growth Hackers, you could do something like that: Look through Twitter, as people often share their email addresses there. You can use advanced search to look for those messages. For example, check out if your contact shared her address by pasting \u2019at dot\u2019 into Twitter\u2019s Advanced Search (people often mask their addresses by changing @ symbol into \u2018at\u2019 to hide it from spammers).And that\u2019s only scratching the surface. My colleague Nick published a longform guide to all the cool tricks you can use to find someone\u2019s email address, so I recommend checking it out. You\u2019ll feel a little like Sherlock Holmes afterwards :) ",

Email is undoubtedly still one of the most effective marketing outreach there is when it comes to effectively reaching and engaging your new leads and keeping your current clientele in the loop about your product and contents you are publishing. Here are good 9 email lookup tools that can help you: Silk Prospector - a Google Chrome extension that lets you gather email by scouring and scraping their LinkedIn profiles.RocketReach - a web-based email lookup tool that lets you search names, domains, and LinkedIn Profiles. It also gives you links to their social media profiles. According to the test, RocketReach is a semi-viable app that is a little bit better than Slik, though both still needs manual verification.Hunter, formerly known as Email Hunter, allows you to harvest emails within domains. It also allows you to research email via names if you don't know which domain to start with.Clearbit Connect - a free Gmail plugin that lets you search 40 emails every month within a company's domain. Out of the five people tested, Clearbit Connect was able to give four emails, but just like Slik and RocketReach, you would still need to verify manually.Email Format - is also a web based email research tool that mainly focuses on the likely email format of the company domain. Confidence rating is also high with this tool.The honorable mentions when it comes to email harvesting tools are: Clearbit Prospector - it's the older and more professional version of Clearbit Connect and lets you harvest large amounts of emails, but the price tag is a little bit steep.People Search by Workable is also a good honorable mention. It is a Chrome extension that lets you search LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and other profiles.Qwilr Sherlock - a basic tool that generates variations of your name that you probably would use as an email.Rapportive - a Gmail plugin that also lets you check profiles that are linked wit the email you have entered, paired with Sherlock you can have a more optimized email search.For a more detailed read, kindly check this insightful article here.

            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways. Here is a good description of a number of methods. Information courtesy of Inc. Magazine 1. Head to the Company Website While this may seem obvious, it's one of the best places to start. Many companies provide contact information for certain staff members, so don't neglect this resource just because it seems simple. Once you arrive at the site, head over to the About Us page to see if they provide details for executives or other employees. The News section is another great destination, as PR contact email addresses are often included in articles. Sometimes the Contact Us page will yield results, but more often than not you are greeted by a form (and your message gets dumped into a customer service bucket somewhere), so don't be surprised if this doesn't work. 2. Google It There is a lot of information floating around online, and unicorn Google's search feature can be the key to accessing it. You might be able to find someone's email address just be searching their name and the word \"email\" or \"contact.\" Yes, it can be that simple. Alternatively, try other combinations, like the person's name and the company name or title. It only takes a few minutes to run through these options, and it otherwise doesn't cost you a dime. 3. Extrapolate Based on Known Email Addresses Almost every company uses a standard format for the emails (like [first name].[last name]@[company].[com]). If you find even a single email address to someone in the company, it isn't hard to crack the code once you see the formatting. Now, this only works if you have the person's name, can be trickier for people with common names (think \"John Smith\") where there could easily be more than one person with the same name at the company, or for names with multiple potential variations (Robert, Bob, Rob). However, even if you connect with the wrong person, you may be able to get your target's email address if the case of mistaken identity results in a reply (or if the \"wrong\" recipient forwards your message to the \"right\" one). As long as you aren't divulging anything that shouldn't be seen by someone else, or won't be viewed as a possible phishing attempt, it's worth a try. 4. Dig In with Advanced Google Search If you want to check whether your guess at an email address is correct, try an Advanced Google Search. Put the mail address you think it right into the search bar with quotes on either side, like this: \"firstname.lastname@company.com\" If you're right, you may see it come up in the search results. If nothing comes up, try other variants until you find the unicorn email address among the donkeys. 5. Join ZoomInfo If you add the ZoomInfo plugin to your Outlook, in exchange for giving them access to your contacts, you get 10 free contacts from their database each month. Millions (upon millions) of people are listed in ZoomInfo, along with 6+ million company profiles, so their database is extensive. 6. Connect with an Admin If you can find a phone number of the person's department at their company, see if you can talk to their admin. Now, you don't want to just ask for an email address simply because you don't have it. You need to be a bit crafty to get this to work. After a warm greeting, ask the admin if they can give you some help (people often like to be helpful, so this statement sets the stage). Ask if they can confirm the person's email address and then proceed to give them your best guess of what that email should be. Usually, they will stop you once you make (what they perceive to be) a mistake and will give you the right address in return. 7. Check Their Social Media Page Sometimes, people list their email addresses on social media. Yes, this isn't common, but it only takes a few seconds to look, so check personal and company pages to see if any tidbits are available. 8. Look for Personal Websites and Blogs The sheer number of personal websites and blogs out there is staggering, and many professionals and executives maintain one to help establish their personal brand. If you aren't having any luck with company website-related searches, delve into personal ones. Most people link back to their personal site on their social media profiles, particularly on LinkedIn and Twitter, so see if you can find their website there and use that information to run additional searches. You may end up with the person's personal email this way, but that can be just as effective as reaching out to their company one. 9. People Search Sites Some people search sites actually allow you to receive results for free, though this is becoming less common. However, it doesn't hurt to give this approach a try. Bear in mind that the information you find may also be out-of-date, so your mileage may vary, but giving this a whirl doesn't cost you anything anyway. 10. http://Jigsaw.com While http://Jigsaw.com does have paid search options, you can look up some information for \"free.\" They use a model where, if you provide one contact, they'll let you have one without an additional charge. It is important to note that all of the information is user provided, so that means there is no guarantee it is accurate. Plus, it is possible the person you want to connect with isn't in there at all. If these free options don't produce the results you need, there are a wide range of paid services out there as well. Or, you can simply reach out in a direct message on social media and see if you can establish a connection there. ",

I love this tool, because I can extract emails of my prospective clients from names, social and professional media profiles, it is also possible to find all the emails from one domain or bulk domain search. Email finder extension for Chrome helps to extract emails directly from the websites, that\u2019s why I\u2019m pretty sure that I send mailouts to my cold leads, not to random peoples.  Everyone understands how important is to provide email marketing, but it worth mentioning that it\u2019s necessary to collect the list of emails of your target audience. A lot of people ask how many emails should be collected before starting to send mailouts, but in this case, the quality is worth more than quantity. A great advantage of Snovio is that it offers all the needful features for email marketing, such as email checker, so I don\u2019t send messages to invalid emails (so I don\u2019t waste money on mailouts to nonexisting email addresses). The feature of email drip campaigns gives me an opportunity to send triggered mailouts, so I send a chain of messages and set triggers so ma emails stop when the recipient opened or replied to my email. I guess this tool is must-have for everyone who wants to get started with email marketing, it offers all the features I need to provide it successfully. I don\u2019t need to export a list of prospects between different tools, it also saves my money. ",

Use social media networks to find the email IDs. I usually go with either Facebook or Linkedin for the same 2. Use Google search engine. If you are proficient in using search operators, better is the chance to find what you need 3. Use online directories to get email ID's of companies 4. Use the trial & error method to guess one's email ID. If you know the person name & the firm he/she is associated with, then a random guess can fetch you the email ID 5. Use Google Chrome Extension. Yes, all you need is an extension like email extractor (of course there are many more, I'll leave it for you to Google it) which does the job of hunting for an email ID 6. Some of the sites do get closed over a period of time, in such cases using the Wayback machine should help you as much as it has helped me The above methods should help anyone in finding anybody's email address. In case, if you don't, worry not. There are many email service providers who can help you with email addresses of any person, any profession, and any location. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is: it depends. Do you need a specific person\u2019s email address for personal purposes? For example, that long-lost love from high-school? If you know his/her name and last name, you can use an email permutator. There are many out there. Do you need leads for your B2C business - say, your cookie delivery service? I recommend you invest in marketing and track visitors to your website. Many options available too. Do you need to find a key decision maker\u2019s email for a job application or other career purpose? LinkedIn is the way to go - and maybe a google search combined with an email permutator. Lastly, do you need to find B2B leads for your professional services firm? In this case, your best option is to invest in a lead generation service There are many companies selling leads, but, whichever one you're looking at, just remember one thing: email list decay. A third of Americans change jobs every year, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics - that means that a large percentage of the leads you buy are pretty much irrelevant at this point. This is where my shameless plug comes in: at Cliently, we are working to solve this issue by building a tool which constantly refreshes our leads. Our software combines multiple data sources - from standard third-party databases to social media sources like Twitter and LinkedIn- to create one of the largest B2B databases (contact info for 150 million decision makers worldwide) while being as accurate as possible (over 97%). Full disclosure: I am currently the CEO of Cliently, a lead generation and sales automation startup. While I do try to spread the word about our tool, my affiliation doesn't affect the integrity of my answers. ",

However, using that website you face with one problem - the impossibility to get a contact information right away. Then, a new modernized Chrome extension will help you to solve it. In that case I recommend you to use improver - a very useful tool for those who seeks phone numbers and emails. You can reveal even personal emails and phone numbers. Besides, it is important to add that the extension always reveals email and phone number for you (it may be not right away, but in this case you should send a request, which is placed in the waiting list). It is one of the greatest advantages that make improver outstanding among others, as it reveals contact information which accuracy goes up to 100%.  This tool is the most effective one in a lead generation process. You can use our extension for free and start getting contacts just with one click! ",

Some SMTP servers allow you to use VRFY to see if a email address exists, but this has been used to collect email addresses to spam lists, so a good mail provider do not have this feature enabled. The alternative is to use RCPT TO when sending an email, the SMTP can have a limit on how many addresses you can check at one time this way, also the users would get an email and the SMTP may have greylisting, which makes it more time consuming.Even if the SMTP server accept the mail you can\u2019t know for sure that the email address exists.

Everyone has a right to privacy, and even though I share that privacy with Facebook, Instagram or Twitter does not give you the right to access it. So in one scenario if you\u2019re spying on a boyfriend you suspect of cheating, the right to inspect all his emails to satisfy your doubts. Likewise, a celebrity can share all sorts of info with you as a fan. That does not give you the right to dig up their email every time you are in the mood. Invasion of privacy is a serious crime and has young people contemplating suicide. If I am incorrect, I apologize. But if I am even a little bit correct, you owe it to yourself to engage a therapist, and figure out why you might be losing some self-control. Hope That Helps E. ",
