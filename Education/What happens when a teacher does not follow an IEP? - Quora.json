            "answer_text": "What happens???? Is it an oversight.. then the teacher needs to be educated. is it on purpose? then they need to be informed they need to follow it or else and be prepared for the or else. I had to do this. My daughter is hard of hearing and had a microphone that hung around the teacher\u2019s neck to a box that sat on her desk so she could hear better. the teacher forgot to turn it off when went to the bathroom and came back to 2nd graders laughing and refused to utilize it afterwards. Well Em came home and told me. I sent in a note, then called to speak to the teacher and when she continued to refuse (we had a great relationship up to this point for 3 years). I had to go to the school and complain. I following day she was using the device again. Fast forward 2 years, state testing, Emily\u2019s IEP stated that she could have directions read to her again to make sure she heard them, the teacher refused, she told a different teacher later in the day, her state test was invalidated because her IEP was not followed. Be ready to make sure that you know what is in the IEP and be ready to fight for it if necessary. It is your child\u2019s education and it is your job to make sure it is followed. Good Luck and God Bless ",

What\u2019s supposed to happen is that \u2014 as soon as that IEP is signed \u2014 forces compel circumstances such that the IEP is followed. Pay attention to how I phrased that, and notice that I didn\u2019t mention schools, classroom, principals or teachers. The IEP is more powerful than all them \u2014 in theory. If a student has an IEP that isn\u2019t being followed \u2014 whether by teacher, administrators, or non-instructional staff makes absolutely no difference \u2014 it is either followed, or whoever has guardianship sues for compliance and courts give whatever compensation they deem necessary \u2014 from additional years of schooling to serious cash settlements. There\u2019s an entire industry of Student Advocates who do nothing but help families ensure that IEP\u2019s are followed. ",
