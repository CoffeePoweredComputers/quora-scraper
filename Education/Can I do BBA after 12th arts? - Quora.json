            "answer_text": "Yes! You can opt for BBA course if you have interest in this field. It does not matter whether you are from science/ commerce/arts stream. You can still go for it, but you must have interest specifically. There is no such restriction in BBA eligibility that any particular stream student can only pursue these types of professional courses. But here, cutoff(of courses like these) goes very high of good colleges or even average colleges too, i.e. above 95%. The mark for applying is mostly 60% or above, which is just a mark for students that only those can apply or fill just form for this program whose percentage is above 60%. It never means/guarantees/states that student with 60% or above will get admission directly on merit-basis. With low percentage like such, you can\u2019t even think of getting admission in these types of professional courses. All depends on merit-based cutoff, which is relatively very high. Students with high percentage are given admission in good colleges. You must have a decent/high percentage in your stream. Then, You can pursue BBA from a top college. Be good at skills and you can also pursue any course with it, simultaneously. You can also go for other courses like BCA, B.tech, BSc, etc. These will be better. It\u2019s totally upto you. Good luck! \u2661\u270d ~ Kritika\u2764\u00b0 ",
