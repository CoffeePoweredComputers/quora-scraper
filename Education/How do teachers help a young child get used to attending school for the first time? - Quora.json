            "answer_text": "I allowed the parent to stay as long as they wanted when I taught K. Some began to cry when they realized they were being left at school all alone. With me being 6\u20322\u2033 many were taken back and being blonde, too, a big shock, then some looked at my bright blue eyes and wanted to touch them. My children were blacks and Mexicans so my presence was a rarity in Compton, CA. I also had stuffed animals and toys for the children to touch. It was so funny with some of them as they wanted to touch my hair and stand on my 13\u2033 shoes, I was like a jungle gym to them. We had a fun year. ",
