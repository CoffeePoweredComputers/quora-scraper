            "answer_text": "As others have said, there is no future form for the imperative mood in English. The imperative mood expresses an order or a command, therefore it cannot really have a tense that is built into the verb. If we want to specify the time when we expect the command to be carried out, we add an adverb (or adverb phrase) of time. For example, if we want to emphasize that the command should be carried out in the present, we may use an adverb such as \"now\" or a phrase such as \"right away.\" Come here now!Do it right away!  If the order or command is to be carried out in the future, we add an adverb or adverb phrase indicating the time in the future when we expect the command to be carried out. Here are some examples with the verb \"to be\"\" Be on time tomorrow!Be here next Saturday!Be careful when removing the lid next time. ",

(Imperative) Strictly speaking, English doesn't have a future imperative tense. (Latin has.) We can semi-achieve one in this way: You shall carry!You will do this!You will do your homework! If you want the same for the verb \"to be,\" then try these: You will be stupid!You will be smart!You will be strong!You cannot be kidding me!You will do this without help from me! ",
