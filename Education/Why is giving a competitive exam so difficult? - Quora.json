            "answer_text": "We often wonder why do we have to appear for two stage of written and a interview. The first stage is meant to eliminate totally undesirable candidates. The second stage or mains is where your mettle is put to a real test. Coming to the difficulty part, when you know things, it\u2019s easy. And when you don\u2019t, it\u2019s difficult. Also, it is not possible or let\u2019s say highly unlikely to know everything. With such a large number of applicants and dwindling number of seats due to automation, only the best ones can survive. Hence, we find a competitive exam tough. You will have to work hard till the paper you find difficult today becomes moderate for you. Hard work is the only way. There is no other way. I hope you do well. Good Luck, buddy! ",

            "answer_text": "First of all remove your thoughts/views about competitive exams being so difficult if you are to succeed. For all india competitive exams obviously there will be a huge number of applicants, who work harder and harder to get selected. But try to be positive and make a strategic effort to prepare for the exams. Give your best effort for such exams and once you get tge confidence, you too can do it. Take test series related to the exam. It will show where your weakness lies. For state level exams, the competition is somewhat less. Try to bring your best,and your will be among the selected candidates. Just focus in yourself. ",
