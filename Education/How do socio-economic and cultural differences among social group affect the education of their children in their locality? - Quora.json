            "answer_text": "Your question is very significant to be deconstructed as it has been a very culminating issue that same course with same teacher departed but does not have equal influence on all learners in the same classroom? The answer is quite approximate to your question and almost it is truth with some other similar factors. Culture affects us very much than any other things. Nevertheless, education itself is a factor of culture like dress, food, music or belief system. A human is very much insecure by his feelings and perceptions. They face multiple seemingly possible or impossible dangers every day even up to the age of 20 years it might be every day. No other factors provide real or unreal solution to the problem the way religion provides. I have seen in religiously strengthened societies, religion has every answer to the every problem. If you are sick then you seek in religion , if your animal is not eating then you seek religion, if eaxam, result or what ever problem come to your way you seek out the religious beliefs and surprisingly you find the solution as well. If you proposed 10 problems to religion in a month might 3/4 our some times 7/8 out of 10 might be solved. The problem which was solved you believe that, this happened because I practised mr religion nicely and god listened my proposal, the question that was unmet, you consider that might be I did not propose whole heartedly so, it remained unacknowledged by the god. So, next time your belief remains much stronger than before. Education becomes insignificant over the faith. Because education occupies your time for 4 to 8 hours but religion occupies your mind remaining 16 to 20 hours consciously or unconsciously. culture differs and this cultural differences affects the human minds a child who has been indoctrinated to seek all solutions through religion of course he/ she will be depending on the religious side only. You can see this current pandemic is being responded by different cultures and societies in different ways. You can acknowledge that how diffetent elements of culture are responding to this pandemic. Science and technology itself are the elements of culture nonetheless science is responding in scientific way through proper evidence and logic. Not a single religion so far has come forward to provide any solution. Of the total over 200 countries hardly 20 to 25 countries are indulged in providing solution to corona by mask, vaccine, medicine, social distancing or quarantine. Few countries with scientific communities are releasing information and rest the entire countries of the world are following. So, it is clear that your cultural background matters a lot than education. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is different in different societies. In my country, Australia, State governments fund schools, not local governments. Both \u201cPublic\u201d and \u201cPrivate\u201d (usually religious) schools get funding from the State. Hence location is not as important as it is in the USA. Most private primary schools (ages 5 - 11) are religious, and some parents choose that path. Families that are not well off cannot support their children as well as richer families do, but provided the children can attend school they will get access to the facilities needed. ",
