Today is our first day with students in my school and we are already concerned that the news on Friday of this week will be that we need to go remote due to a bunch of idiots in the county creating a covid spreader event. The less disruption you can have, the better. The only option that provides that is full online right now. Unfortunately we have families in every community that have parents that can\u2019t stay home to supervise kids and so need there to be in person school when possible. But if you have a family that can support remote learning right now you should do it. ",

It\u2019s controversial to have kids back in school right now. The paper said kids were a major culprit in transmitting the COVID because it sits in their lungs even though they have no symptoms. And kids are getting more sick now that they\u2019re back in school. It\u2019s not a good time to be in school while the virus is still a big problem. ",
