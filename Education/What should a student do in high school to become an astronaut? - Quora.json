            "answer_text": "Hone your study skills to get a good GPA. Study math and science. You will need to get up to Calc 3. Study all of the natural sciences (astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, and biology). Here are a few other suggestions: Life habitsChoose your vices carefully. Get a boyfriend/girlfriend who\u2019s also interested in science (you can study together and reinforce each other)Avoid drugs and alcoholCut back your diversions (TV, video games, and team sports).Being smart is important but so is maintaining good physical condition. Consider joining track and field, swimming, or study a martial artSchoolDo extra-curricular studies with the Great Courses from the Teaching Company. If you do one of these courses before you take one in school, it\u2019ll be easier for you.Take courses online (MOOCs, Udemy, Khan Academy, etc)Enroll in AP coursesSee if you can test out of some classes or take classes st your community collegeTry to get up to Calc 2 by your senior yearTake statistics (learn how to do univariate and multi-variate analysis)Learn data analysis (Udemy has some good courses)Learn about internships, co-ops, mentoring and volunteer opportunitiesGet into the best college you can (find out what colleges astronauts have attended)Develop an expanded course plan for both in and out of schoolExtra-curricular activitiesGet a summer job (lifeguarding can pay well, or maybe consider getting A+ Certified; you\u2019ll need money for the things below)Join your physics clubJoin your local model rocketry clubJoin your local MakerSpaceJoin AIAA, IEEE, ASME, the Planetary Society, the Mars Society, and the Moon SocietyLearn how to code (Python, C, C++/#, JavaScript, php, MySQL)If you know Python, Learn AI, machine learning, computer vision, data analysis, and roboticsLearn AutoCAD, 3D modeling, and 3D printingLearn wax loss metallurgyLearn CNC machiningBecome a HAMGet SCUBA certified (if you\u2019re a master diver you might be able to work with astronauts)Get a recreation pilot\u2019s licenseLearn Arduino and Raspberry pi (a person that can build sensors and data loggers, that can dump data into databases over the web, and analyze them is valuable)Get a laptop and install Linux (can be dual boot or even a used computer)If you have supportive parents, get some lab space, and do some research. Do some experiments that will get the attention of good universities.Particle accelerator or mass driverHomemade electron microscopeHomemade large aperture telescope (12\u201d>); convert a Dob to an equatorial mountDrone surveyor (use drones to take close up images in 3D modeled space of geological strata)Cave mapping droneDevelop an augmented reality mapping systemDevelop a new tool for whatever profession you want to go intoMake tools, sensors, or building materials using Mars or Lunar stimulantsConsider going to space simulators (like the Mars Society\u2019s MDRS)Suggested reading and gamesKerbal Space Program (download STEAM; an orbital mechanics sandbox)How to Think like Leonardo da Divinci, Michael Gelb (helps develop a well rounded perspective)Calculus, Elliot Gootman (explains calculus without equations - it\u2019ll make it a lot less painful to learn)Illustrated Guide to Home Chemistry Experiments: All Lab, No Lecture (DIY Science): Robert Bruce ThompsonIllustrated Guide to Home Biology Experiments: All Lab, No Lecture (DIY Science): Robert Bruce ThompsonEncyclopedia of Chemistry and PhysicsRocket Propulsion ElementsIntroduction to Astro DynamicsThese suggestions will get you about 80% of the way. I\u2019d suggest you do internships or job shadow people for a day to figure out if you want to pursue science or engineering. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of stuff here. Get the game and books as soon as possible. Read up on my suggestions above. Some of the books aren\u2019t cheap, consider getting older editions. Also have strategies for getting the best grades you can (take online courses before you do them in school and have study groups). Make math your top priority. Develop a schedule for yourself. You\u2019ll want to start planning your senior project by your sophomore year and finish it before you apply for college. ",

            "answer_text": "My room mate freshman year at MIT was a junior majoring in Physics and he became a NASA astronaut. He was an Excellent student in high school and a wonderful person. Everyone loved him. And he worked on his physical side and was top in Karate, a brown belt as an undergrad in college and then a Black Belt as a graduate student at MIT earning his PhD in Physics while teaching Karate. He became an Astronaut because NASA needed someone who could work on any type of experiment in space at the Space Station, could get along with anyone, and was a perfect physical speciman. That is all you need to do, because it is Thirty Times easier to be admitted to Harvard as a freshman than it is to become a NASA astronaut. Today, you also need to be fluent in Russian. Also you need to remember that an astronaut is an explorer and be prepared to die. Fourteen space shuttle astronauts died in a Shuttle accident, and my friend was one of them. All the best. ",
