            "answer_text": "Try the following:  Take action : If you don\u2019t feel like reading, read. If you don\u2019t feel like writing, write. If you don\u2019t feel like doing exercise, do it. In short, action is the best motivation. The only thing that stops us from getting sucked into a task is not doing it, so do it now!  Take one bite at a time : Does the idea of taking your whole meal in one massive bite sound repulsive? Luckily, you can take it one bite at a time, enjoy it, and still consume the whole meal.  Likewise, if you try to do everything together, you lose motivation to do anything at all. Therefore, it\u2019s best to split a bigger task into smaller ones and concentrate on only one part at a time. The less formidable the work, the more you\u2019ll enjoy doing it.  Remove the distractions : When being lazy, we are often attracted to the distractions. Bloggers are found browsing others\u2019 blogs when they are supposed to be writing theirs, and students are found watching TV when they should be studying. These are all distractions that serve no good purpose. If you remove the distractions, for example, by disconnecting from the Internet and by locking the TV room, you\u2019ll notice that it becomes easier to get back to the work.  Find motivation : Why are you doing work? It is easy to forget the purpose of work with time. Remind yourself of how important your work is for you, for your personal satisfaction, for your life, family and so on. If you feel you are not clear about the purpose of what you are doing, it\u2019s time to recap the goals you set down when you started.  Reward yourself : Discipline and schedules are all good and well, but do we want to become robots? This the very thing we dread and that is what leads us to lose motivation. You\u2019ll be more enthusiastic to complete a task when you know you are going to reward yourself at the end.  We usually agonize over the fact that we are being lazy, yet continue to procrastinate for hours. It becomes difficult to get out of this condition unless we force ourselves to take action, which is, admittedly, the most difficult part. Though once we set about doing a task, the laziness disappears like a magician\u2019s trick.  For study try the following:  1. Offer Your Self Incentives  Yes, you should give yourself a prize or some sort of reward when you\u2019ve accomplished a task. It could be something as simple as sweets (see the picture, who would turn down this beautiful Danish pastry? \u2026) or something greater like a vacation.  2. Remember Past Successes  You need to form a positive image in your brain about your studies. I am sure all of us have succeeded on several occasions, remember these past successes and you will feel more motivated to continue!  3. Write Down Your Goals  Don\u2019t just think them, don\u2019t just say them, write them down! The written word is so powerful, that\u2019s why you find salesmen always want you to write something done before you actually make a purchase. By writing your name down, you are in a sense giving your support for their cause. If then asked to make a purchase you will feel more inclined to do that than if you hadn\u2019t signed the paper!  4. See Your Goals (literally speaking\u2026)  Don\u2019t just write them down and leave it like that. Put them up on the wall, paste small post-it notes all over the place. You have to keep on reminding yourself the purpose behind your studies and what type of results you\u2019re expecting to achieve.  God bless you :D ",

            "answer_text": "In fact, this is a recap of my earlier responses to similar questions on Quora. Frankly, I am appalled at the poor attitude of today's younger generation when it comes to preparing for their own future.  They don't seem to have any interest at all. So, here I go again: Everything starts in the head. Stop making excuses.  Make an effort. Make changes. Make progress. Excuses are useless. Results are priceless. If you really want to produce positive results in your life, you just need to make up your mind, move your butt, and get cracking. Don't wait to start until you feel motivated. Feel motivated by starting and seeing results. If after you have started, and you still don't feel motivated, it's time to examine your long range goals and objectives. Motivation is all about action. Motivation always comes intrinsically, i.e. deep from within yourself.  No extrinsic aids can help you. In fact, motivation follows action. That's why you should start acting right away instead of waiting to feel motivated. You will not know if something excites you or not if you do not act first. By the way, discipline keeps you on course. I like to take opportunity to paint the scenario of today's harsh realities: Nothing works, unless you do.Nothing changes until something changes. This is Physics!For things to change, first you must change.Talk doesn't cook rice. Only action creates results.If not you, who? If not now, then when?Misery is also an option!No more excuses. It's time to change. It's time to do what's best for you. The only person who can hold you back is YOU. That's to say, the future is in your hands! So go and hit your books NOW! ",
