Just sit down and scribble down whatever you know about organic anything and everything just scribble it down.Then start using your resources available (textbooks, internet,teacher) and start Linking them upNow that you really know where you stand you would personally have some interest and eagerness to study and learn what it is .Now start learning organic from scratch again nowTrust me this will work and now start scaling up the level of problems and all.Peace .",

            "answer_text": "Yeah you can learn but a little bit of problem is there if you want to understand that forever then you have to learn some basics . If you want to learn it for the exams only there are a few naming reactions and important reactions can be by-heartened. Most of the questions come from that reactions only so you can score a decent mark in organic chemistry. I suggest you to know the basic of 11th class. It ain't very hard. ",
