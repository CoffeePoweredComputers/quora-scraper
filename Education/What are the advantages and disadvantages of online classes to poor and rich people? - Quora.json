            "answer_text": "\u201cSir my daughter will not be able to attend the zoom classes \u2026.\u201d Said father of a topper. \u201cBut it's very important classes she can't miss them. She will be lagging in syllabus sir\u2026\u201d replied my husband. \u201cBut my mobile fell in water while I was charging it, now we don't have a mobile and I can't buy a new one in this lockdown\u2026\u201d \u201cOh I'm sorry sir. Let me think of a solution \u2026.\u201d My husband called me immediately and asked \u201cDo we have any old working mobile?\u201d I said yes and he gave word to the daily wage labourer that he would give his mobile to him. Next day\u2026 \u201cI'm very very happy sir, your mobile is much better than mine sir. Thank you once again sir\u2026\u201d he left with a contented heart.  Poor are at disadvantage with online classes as they cannot affort mobile data and smart phones. They are using their parents mobiles for classes which their parents taking away while gpign for work. Rich are busy playing pubg and not getting time for attending online classes. If at all they come also it's because of their parents taunting. Advantage is for the students who are using the resources to the fullest for gaining knowledge whether they are rich or poor. ",

            "answer_text": "Online Classes have become very popular these days. The pandemic has increased our dependency on online classes. So, an online class is our saviour. But as we say that a coin has two faces similarly online classes also have certain disadvantages. Let us see the advantages and disadvantages of online classes for both poor and rich people: Advantages: I think there is not much difference in the advantages of online classes for both rich and poor. Online classes are flexible for both. Both can take classes according to their convenience and pace. With the help of online classes, they both can avoid travel inconvenience. The only difference in the advantage is that it is cost-effective for poor people as they can avoid travel costs. Disadvantages for Rich and Poor: There is no face-to-face or very little interaction with the teachers.They are not able to meet their friends with whom they can study.They have to be self-motivated to learn online.Poor people may not have smartphones or laptops to attend these classes.They may not have a good internet connection.",
