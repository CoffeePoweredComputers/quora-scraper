I have 78% in my graduation I successfully get admissions in fms delhi ( not in IIM because not have work experience) now the story begins I started studying MBA and didn\u2019t face any problem but at the time of placement I got to know \ud83e\udd75 that my graduation degree value is zero \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d bro this college will serve you a lot as placement and business studies but you have to face just think about yourself where you are going u will get IItians and top college students what the value of a private student there .

If you want to pursue you graduation from distance learning then go for DU and try to get at least 80+% not any other university or ignou and all . I am facing the biggest mistake of my life \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d ",
