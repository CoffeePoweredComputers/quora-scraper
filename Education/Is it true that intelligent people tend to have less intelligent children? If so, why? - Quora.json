            "answer_text": "From what I\u2019ve researched, the only difference between intelligent people and everyone else is that they tend to have fewer children. Or, none. Of the gifted parents who do chose to parent, they generally have gifted children. Nurture provides 50\u201360% of the intelligence genetics. Nature accounts for the rest. Good news: If you\u2019re not as smart as you\u2019d like to be, you can become quite intelligent by choice. It\u2019s been discovered that children get most of their intelligence from their mother. (And, shockingly, genetic issues often come from their father, such as mental disorders and birth defects.) If a razor sharp man has a flake-case of a wife whose sole existence for living may reality shows and gossip, it\u2019s entirely possible to have not-so-smart children. Intelligent minds talk ideas. Smart minds talk events. Small minds talk people. -Eleanor Roosevelt/Charles Stewart I don\u2019t know if intelligent people have less kids so they can focus their time and resources on just one (or two), if they wait until later so they can enjoy a life and career first and are therefore less fertile, or if they\u2019re simply more aware of the state of the world and the overpopulation issues we are facing (or rather, our ability to sustain life the way we\u2019re going) and don\u2019t want to further contribute. I lean towards the last option. Several of my very intelligent friends have had children in their late thirties and early forties without any issues other than trying to find a work/parent/life balance. But they mostly choose to have one\u2026rarely do they have two. A common answer to \u201cWhat have you done to love the Earth?\u201d has been \u201cI haven\u2019t had children.\u201d It\u2019s no longer considered \u201cselfish\u201d not to have kids. It can be considered selfless.

            "answer_text": "I do not believe this is true. My mom was extremely intelligent, kind of quiet and reserved, and her GPA landed her as valedictorian in her high school. She obtained an associates degree in college and went on to work insurance sales. Ok, then she has me. IQ test always showed me at an abnornally high IQ. My standardized test scores in school were also well above average. I was also placed in the gifted class in middle school because of this. However, here is the kicker, I have severe ADHD. That made focusing difficult therefore when a subject didn\u2019t interest me, I would barely float along. I graduated high school with a B/C average and completed some college coursework but never obtained a degree. Still, IQ tests taken within the past couple years show me to be abnormally high. On to my son, he is basically me as a child. Luckily my mom knew how to handle a child as intelligent as me, and even though I mastered manipulation and could get around her sometimes, she knew what I was pulling most of the time. My ex however, is not as intelligent, and feeds right into his manipulation. At 3 he tested to have an unusually high IQ. My ex didn\u2019t know how to force him to do things for himself, he has the ability and knows how, and with me, he does these things\u2026she just does them for him, claims he is delayed, and gets a BS diagnosis that he is on the very outer edge of the autism spectrum. It\u2019s bullshit. She gets a SS check and free day care, and I have a child that is wrongfully labeled. That is where ideas such as this come in. He is more intelligent that most kids, sure he as a low attention span (ever seen a child with ADHD?) and some socialization issues, but does not need a special needs label. That\u2019s what happens when a parent is unable to handle a child\u2019s intelligence. ",
