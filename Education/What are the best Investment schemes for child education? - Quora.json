            "answer_text": "Answer would defer based on gender of you child, If your child is female, first and foremost scheme is to invest would be Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme[1], though link I have provided is from Indian post, Its available in both public as well private bank. Reason for going to it before any other scheme is that first its as EEE scheme (which mean you can claim tax benefit on amount invested (E), Interest would be tax exempted (E) and there would be no tax on maturity (E)), so it you sitting in top bracket, actual interest rate would be atleast 3% higher, so In case if current interest rate is 9% (though I checked its 8.5% from 1 October 2016), actual ROI (return on investment) would be 12%. Which is huge if you considering investing for 10+ years. See nobody knows what would happen in long term, Share market may be double or half, So for education of your child, its better you are clear how much you would be getting in N number of years, rather falling for current high rate of returns in any market linked instrument. For male child, open PPF (public provident funds) as it allowed to open for under 18 year of age. Once PPF/SSS limit is achieve you can diversify in MF (Balanced funds), though generally CFP advice for long term you can invest in equity related MF, I would advise inversely as balanced fund downside is lessor compare to equity MF. Please don\u2019t fall for child plan (ULIP) from any insurance or banking company, as remember one thing, you always sold those things where agent commission is highest. That\u2019s why its always advised to hire independent CFP (certified financial planner), who just create your portfolio based on your requirement on some fees, rest everything you need to manage. Hope that answered your question. Disclaimer:- I am not certified financial planner, all information given above is based on my own experience. Footnotes[1] Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts",

            "answer_text": "Every parent wish to leave no stone unturned to ensure that their child gets the best of everything in life. However, the cost of education and other needs keeps skyrocketing every day. Child plans help you in acquiring all the necessary funds required for the education and other needs of your child well in advance. For most parents, if there is anything more valuable than their own welfare, it is the welfare of their children. As a parent, you have a moral obligation to provide your child with the best, and not just in their childhood. The world is a fiercely competitive place, and your children will have their own dreams to pursue when they grow up, and to pursue them will cost money. The best gift that you can give your child is the financial leverage which will allow them to pursue and achieve their dreams. Luckily for parents, there is now an easy way to do this. Life insurance plans are designed to make life easy for their beneficiaries. The life insurers study the problems that a person can face and device financial solutions to ease them. The additional time your investment takes, the more possibility it has of developing in esteem; so begin investing right on time with the assistance of a SIP to limit your hazard profile. Counsel a mutual fund expert or your financial advisor. You beyond any doubt will love the choice when your youngster expresses gratitude toward you quite a long while from now! ",
