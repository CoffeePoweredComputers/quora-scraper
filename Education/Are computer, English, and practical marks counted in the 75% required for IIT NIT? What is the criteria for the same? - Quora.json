            "answer_text": "The board percentage is calculated for the best five subjects INCLUDING ENGLISH (which is mandatory) that is, PCM (in your case) ,with your any other side subject may be PHE or CS or any other. The marks of subjects are taken out of hundred , means, including the marks you score in practicals. Eg. You score 60/70 in theory paper and 29/30 in practicals. Thus your total score considered would be 89/100 that is to be counted for total percent . And most importantly your min percent should be 75% (exactly). (Telling the same because I secured 74.8% last year and they didn't consider it, thus have to apply for improvement for just bloody 1 MARK.) ",
