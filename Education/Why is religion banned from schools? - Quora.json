            "answer_text": "Why is religion banned from schools? It isn't, I went to a Catholic primary school, and two Church of England schools when I was a kid, and a daily \u201cact of worship\u201c is required to this day. Unless, of course, you're talking about American schools, where there's a supposed separation of church and state, promoting one religion above all others is against the US constitution. I find it amusing to think about, the UK is a fairly secular country, most believers are nominal, despite having religion forced onto our children, whereas the US does not allow religious promotion in schools, and you have theists desperately trying to shoehorn Christianity in, moaning and wailing about being persecuted all the way, from the pulpit of a shiny mega-church. Religion should not be taught in schools, it should be taught about, and children should be allowed to choose whether or not to be religious when they reach 18 years old. That way we can avoid childhood indoctrination, and deprive clerical pederasts of helpless children to prey on. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I assume you mean public schools. Religion isn\u2019t banned. Anyone can pray in school or discuss religion with classmates on their own time, assuming it doesn\u2019t disrupt any educational activities. Only teachers or school officials preaching it, or requiring all students pray, or asserting that one religion is the only correct one, etc, is not allowed, pursuant to the establishment clause of the First Amendment, and subsequent court decisions. In other words, a public school and their employees and officials, arms of the government, cannot favor one religion, or require adherence to it, etc. It makes sense, since there may be students who have various different religions, or no religion. Schools can and do teach ABOUT various religions, not favoring or stating one or the other is the true one. In other words, \u201cthis what Islam says\u201d, \u201cthis what Christianity says\u201d, \u201cthis is the history of the Morman Church\u201d, etc. ",
