            "answer_text": "Consider yourself to be a biologist\u2026you know it all and this class 9 is just a little bit add on to it. Concept is the most important thing and lookout for keywords..you need them allover your answers. I would suggest that you watch some really cool videos regarding your chapters..be it human physiology or plant parts. There are some really good videos available out there on the internet. And as for the horrible scientific names..see if you can make acronyms for each though you hardly need any of them. And\u2026by any chance\u2026.if you feel that your syllabus is way too tough\u2026then let me just tell you\u2026class 11 is yet to come and compared to the vast ocean of 11, 9 is just a stagnant pond. So consider yourself lucky..you just have a little bit of what we have to study now and I believe that you can do it\u202695% minimum. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "You should blindly follow the NCERT book. As per my experience,NCERT (Science IX) is sufficient for study.. As I read,there are lots of chapter which have a complex no. of questions for practice,like Diversity in Living Organisms,Control and Coordination,etc. In Class IX,Biology was 2nd of my favourite subject..first is Mathematics.. But,if u get problem in reading NCERT then you should also follow All in one science book(Arihant publication) or S.CHAND..for class IX.. NCERT questions are very important for examination..So you should also practice it. ",
