            "answer_text": "Yes dear friend , Destiny does exists . Have a look at this proof : Consider this ball moving in a gravity free space :  What do you expect it\u2019s position to be after the bounce ?  In this case one could easily predict the ball\u2019s position knowing the perfect geometry of the ball and the walls . Easy , huh ? Let\u2019s make it harder : Consider this falling bottle about to break against the ground :  Knowing the physical quantities you can even picture the next moment :  Still easy huh ? Alright , let\u2019s make this harder : Well , measuring his steps and other physical quantities , you can predict what might happen next .  Not sure huh ? Finally , have a look at this :  Yea , This is the Happening of the Big bang . The two galaxies about to collide About 8,000,000,000 years after the big bang , the very next moment was certain. If we were somehow able to compute the above situations accurately , we would successfully reach the formation of earth 8.8 billion years after the big bang . Computing further , reaching the present , the current moment could\u2019ve been predicted at the time of the Big Bang . Thinking deeper , the rivers flowing , the wind blowing , EACH AND EVERY THING was supposed to happen . Even the neurons functioning in our brain right now which made you post this question on Quora were predicted to do so 13 Billion years ago . It\u2019s just that it\u2019s too hard for us to compute these unlike the above situations . What does that mean ? The present and the future were already written since the beginning of time . Precisely , the future was already destined . So my dear friend , every single thought you\u2019re processing right now , every breath you take , every dawn . That\u2019s how our destiny has already been written . Thanks for reading . ",

            "answer_text": "Please allow me to ask you a few questions  On 26th December 2004, An Indian Ocean earthquake measuring 9.1 to 9.3 on the richter scale ended up killing 230,000 to 280,00 people in 14 countries. And it was considered the deadliest natural disaster in recorded history. Was the death of all the people who died - predestined that they would die? or was it destiny that they were supposed to die? And the people who lived - did they control their own destiny which is why they didn\u2019t die? Or was it destined they shouldn\u2019t die? What do you think? Did god will this? Was it his masterplan? Did he do it so that the people whose families got destroyed - he would test them to see if the families that suffered - that they would still love him and worship him? Was this an act of anger because people were bad and evil? So by killing all the people nearly the coastline - god made a point? Or was it that only the people at the coastline were evil. But the people staying far away from the coastline were good people. So that is why he sent a Tsunami?  Adolf Hitler rose to power as the Chancellor of Germany and then as the dictator initiated the World War II with the invasion of Poland in 1939. He was responsible for killing 5.5 million jews, 19.3 million civilians and under his rule 29 million soldiers died due to the military action. So in this example - was it destined that Hitler should do this? Did he control his destiny and he choose to become evil or was destiny preplanned for him to be evil - so that even if he wanted to be good - he would still be bad. Did the people who die control their destiny or were they pre-destined to die? Was it gods will that this should happen? Where was god when Hitler was killing all these people? Or was it that God decided he should intervene at the right time - and the right time was after Hitler killed all the millions of people that now was the right time? If god knows everything, which means he knew Hitler would rise to power and he knew Hitler would kill the same children whom god brought into the world. So did he allow this so that there would be a special plan and purpose fulfilled? If was a solider or a jew could I have possibly chosen my own destiny? Or changed my own destiny? But then if it is all destiny then - Hitler should be blamed now - should he? Because no matte what he would do - destiny wouldn\u2019t allow him to be good. So in other words - Hitler was \u2018destined\u2019 to be bad anyways. So doesn\u2019t that make him good?  And finally, this is me getting my face tattooed. Is this destined that I was going to get my face tattooed? Or did I choose my destiny to get my own face tattooed? Or did god have a special plan for me to get my face tattooed? or was it like god didn\u2019t plan this but I planned it for myself - which means god doesn\u2019t plan everything - we do, but he stands back and watches to see whats going on. Then the question goes - if he allows you to do whatever you want - then what about the innocent woman who prays to god to protect her every single day - but a man rapes her - did god allow that? Or did he stand back and watch and decide - now is not the right time to interfere in this matter? Maybe after they all die - only then I will reward her and punish him. So until that for the next 50 years let her live with that mental and emotional scar? So what is it - destiny? predestined?  Now we can go on and on and on with examples, hypothesis and assumptions. And the fact of the matter is each side, group or individual will not agree without putting up a fight and trying to convince the other to their point of view. However, all I can do is give you my perspective. You see, we as human beings - we like to think. Rather, let me rephrase that statement - we as human beings love to think. If we are not thinking good things, we would be thinking bad things. If we are not thinking bad things, we could be thinking funny things. And if not that it would be either religious, sexual, kinky, evil, humorous, educational, naughty - I mean the list can go on and on and on. And at no point - we are not thinking. In fact even when we are sleeping - our mind is \u2018thinking\u2019 how to ensure the body works without problems. So as human beings we are meant to think. And given this problem - we also like to \u2018think\u2019 and \u2018reason\u2019 and give \u2018meaning\u2019 to things we cannot understand. And sometimes when we are jobless, we like to think and ask questions for which no one knows the meaning to - but they simply ask - because they want to know the \u2018why\u2019 of things. And that is where religious apologists become the \u2018experts in knowing everything\u2019. For example: Questions: Why did this happen?Answer: God has a special plan for you OR It was destined OR you attracted this with the power of your mind OR God is punishing you Question: Why did this BAD thing happen?Answer: God has a special plan for you OR It was destined OR you attracted this with the power of your mind OR God is punishing you Questions: Why did this GOOD thing happen?Answer: Praise God! He listened to my prayers OR God rewards those who believe in him OR It was destined OR you attracted this with the power of your mind Questions: Why did Loy Machedo become an Atheist? Answer: God has a special plan for you OR It was destined OR you attracted this with the power of your mind OR God was testing you and you gave up on him OR You have such weak faith Questions: Why did Loy Machedo the Atheist lose all his money? Answer: God is punishing you OR It was destined OR you attracted this with the power of your mind OR God is giving you a message OR you got what you deserved Questions: Why did Loy Machedo the Atheist earn over $1,000,000? Answer: God has a special plan for you OR It was destined OR you attracted this with the power of your mind OR God wants you to do good OR this is Satan\u2019s money The combinations are endless. But here is the thing. Can we prove any of the statements are correct? No. We can only assume. And whatever combination suits our agenda, our purpose and our thinking - we will accept only that - which is our Cognitive Bias So now the million dollar question is - what is true? what is false? what is the answer?  When I look at my life and see the various transformations I have gone through, I can tell you without a doubt, all those transformations were done by me. I choose to have that particular hairstyle, look or behavior. However, I couldn\u2019t control the external factors that governed how I looked, behaved and acted. For instance, when I was young - I had to listen to whatever my parents told me (it was destined) but once I grew up, I took charge of my life (I created my own destiny) and then when I failed (it was destined) but finally I succeeded in becoming a global brand (I created my own destiny). If you notice what I did was, I took credit for my successes and the failures I blamed it on my destiny. And I could very well twist the argument the other way around and it would still sound correct to me. So now what is the answer to the Question to Destined? or Create Our Own Destiny? The answer is this: Whatever you say - WHATEVER - that answer is right for you and for you only. We human being like to believe we came into this world to achieve a purpose, to do something special, to make a difference, to achieve our purpose and to blah blah blah blah blah. And then one accident and you are dead. So then what happened to your purpose? what happened to \u2018make a difference\u2019? what happened to \u2018do something special?\u2019 - Keep this much in mind - as long as you are alive - you can keep going on and on and on about this \u2018I am in control of my destiny, I am the Master of my Fate, I am the Captain of my Ship\u2019. All sounds nice - until of course the name of your ship is \u2018The Titanic\u2019. So instead of going around searching and asking and discussing with others - I give people this solution. And the solution is this - so pay attention carefully. I tell them - \u201cYou decide whatever you feel is correct. Karma OR Destiny OR God OR No God OR Pre-destined OR Post Destined OR I am in control OR I can attract (chose the thing or person) to myself - whatever you decide - Guess what - YOU ARE RIGHT!\u201d And I leave it to that. They smile happily and then they leave. Because if I were to tell them the truth that is \u201cThere is no purpose of your life.\u201d OR \u201cThere is no god\u201d OR \u201cAfter you die - its finished\u201d they will not like it - and I know this through personal experience of having debated with many top debaters and religious apologists and superstitious folks.  SO THE MOMENT OF TRUTHAs a young man who went through the journey to discover himself - I was head strong about my beliefs, just as people were headstrong about theirs. And what I realized after years and years and years of spending hours and hours and hours of debates, discussion and talks - is like finding the answer to the \u2018Is the Glass Half Empty or Half Full\u2019 Argument. No one is right and no one is wrong because no one wants to be wrong. And so how can you prove something - that cannot be proved? So just as I \u2018cannot prove\u2019 that Unicorns do not exist or there are No Tooth Fairies (You cannot prove of something that is not there - try it) - I cannot prove if it is \u2018created\u2019 Destiny or Pre-Destined. If it is Created - then what about the victims who dies? Did they create this reality? And if it is pre-destined, then people like Hitler should be regarded innocent because no matter what - even if he wanted to be good - Destiny wouldn\u2019t allow it to go that way - because it was \u2018pre-destined\u2019. So you now have a choice. Either you can do what I do - Just say \u2018Whatever you say is right. Because if you argue with Logic - they will fight, argue, shout, give me some verse with some numbers like \u201cAustin 3:16 says\u201d OR \u201cRay 6:19 says\u201d OR \u201cThe 7th verse from the 6th Chapter of the 14th Book of the 1,437th Printed Version says that god spoke to his people and\u2026\u2026\u201d OR at in the most comedic reference Ponda Byrne in her book \u2018The Cigarette\u2019, Eeek Hart Stool in his best selling book \u201cThe Shower of Now\u201d and Debug Soap Opera in his best selling book \u201cCreating A-fool-Essence\u201d says \u201cDestiny is the vibrations that goes through the Climatic Discontinuity of the Supernova Fusion from the Ions of the Non-Essential & Non-local 11th dimension filled in the womb of the 4th Multiverse through the alignment of the 7 Chakras in the Quantum Soup that revolves in Space Time Events through the Infinite Intelligence in the lap of the Sea of Consciousness\u201d So do you want to take charge of your destiny and end the argument or lets destiny decide when the argument should end? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter anyways. Because whatever you choose as your destiny, was always destined.

            "answer_text": "Dear Friend,  There is surely destiny. There is no doubt about it. You are born in a particular home, you are born as a human being, the color of your eyes, the situations of your birth, everything that goes around you in the universe, all that is destiny. There is no doubt about it. So there is a lot that is just happening, and is outside the domain of your free-will. Simply call it \u2018destiny\u2019. Sharing an excerpt for you from my blog 'Words Into Silence' on 'What is destiny?' This will help you. :)   Destiny is something  that you never wished for, desired for, and is yet happening. And of that, the first event is your birth. Does anybody desire his or her own birth? Did you desire your birth? You did not, right? Do you desire that at a particular time a bus must pass on the highway, and also honk? We don\u2019t desire all these things. Right. All this is destiny, and there is no doubt about it. And destiny is important. There can be an earthquake any time. An asteroid may hit the earth, and we all would be vaporised. Right? All this is destiny. You must be knowing how the dinosaurs got eliminated. How did they vanish? There was a huge cloud over the earth, a cloud of dust, and there was no sunlight on earth for a very long period of time. Because of this the entire atmosphere of earth changed, and the dinosaurs perished. So that is destiny. Did any dinosaur write an application that the temperature should change, the flora and fauna should change, and ultimately we should vanish? It just happened. A lot of things that we carry inside this body, is destiny. We all know that people are genetically predisposed to diseases. Are they not? Who knows that many one of you sitting here may actually be carrying the seeds of a dangerous disease. All that is destiny. You never wanted it, but you get it. But far more important than destiny is something else.  We are not denying the force of destiny. All that we are saying is, that in spite of being important, it is nothing compared to another force. And that is the force of intelligence. That is the force understanding. And destiny is nothing compared to that force. All that destiny means is, external situations. And that external includes the body, because the body too is external to you. You are your center, your body is an external entity. So whatever happens here or there, it\u2019s all just incidental. Accidental, and hence destiny. At the center resides the great power of intelligence, and that power is far bigger than the power of destiny. Destiny can only make outer events happen, but destiny can never touch your core. Never. So destiny is powerless when it comes to the real you, the core. There, destiny is absolutely powerless. Destiny cannot touch your core.The body can be hurt, wounded, destroyed, but your response to that event that cannot be dictated by the external force that is hurting, or wounding, or destroying. You have no control over what the world does to you, over the various forces in the universe, but you have all the control over yourself. And the one who controls himself, effectively controls the universe. Destiny has no value then. The one who has found himself, the one who has moved to the center, destiny is powerless in front of him. The one who has not found himself would forever remain a slave of destiny. So whether or not destiny is important, depends on you. If one who has not found yourself, the one who does not live at the core, then he would always be a slave of destiny. There would only be destiny in his life. \u201cWhy do I have a lot of money? Because I was born in a rich family.  Why do I keep chasing women all the time? Because I was born with male chromosomes.  Why am I pursuing such and such job? Because I did B.Tech.  Why did I choose B.Tech.? Because I had subjects Physics, Chemistry, and Maths in class Twelfth?  Why did I have these subjects in class Twelfth? Because it was fashionable to choose these subjects, when I was doing class Tenth?  Why were you doing your class tenth from such a place where there was this fashion? Because I was born in a particular state, of a particular country, in particular economic conditions. So the situations of your birth are dictating your entire life. That is slavery. Your place of birth is dictating your entire course of education. Your education is dictating your job. Your job is dictating your wife. Your wife is dictating your family. And there is hardly anything more to your life. There is nothing more to your life. So the entire life is being dictated by the situations of birth. The very fact that you were born in a particular year, in a particular family, with a particular gender decides the entire course of your life. That\u2019s it. Do you want to live like that? \u201cBecause I was born in the year 1993, in the Gupta family, as a girl, therefore I am a homemaker today with five kids. That is the story of my life.\u201d How many of you would want to be like that? \u201cBecause I was born in the year 1990 as a Hindu, or as a Muslim, so I have devoted my entire life to the service of my cult.\u201d Don\u2019t you see that all these incidents are just random occurrences? Were you greatly interested at the time of your birth, that whether you should be born a Muslim or a Hindu? The moment you were born, did you run towards a mosque or a temple? Imagine the child is newly born, and he is running to the church. And the doctors and the nurses are chasing him. The child is saying, \u201cI am a devotee. After coming to the world, the first thing that I must do is to say \u2018Thank you\u2019 to the lord.\u201d Did that happen? But today you act as if your religious identity is your biggest asset. Is that so? That is the price you pay, that is the punishment you suffer, for not being at your center. The one who will not live by his intelligence, will have to live by his destiny. In fact, the lack of intelligence will become his destiny. When I say \u2018intelligence\u2019, I do not mean cleverness. Intelligence is that which shines in attention. Intelligence is that which shines when the ego has made way. Intelligence is that which starts shining when the mind says, \u201cI want to know.\u201d So it is all in your control. The moment you say, \u201cI really want to know,\u201d the power of intelligence becomes available to you. That is called attention. The feeling that \u2013 \u201cI really want to know,\u201d this is attentiveness. That power is always available to you. Whatever is your situation, you can always instantaneously move into attention. Everything else, all other powers, can be taken away from you. But the power to understand can never be taken away from you. Whatever be the condition, even in your worst of conditions, you can still understand what is going on. So intelligence is always available to you. You can never lose it. Those of you who do not want to live pre-scripted life, predestined life, must learn to be bold. They must learn to move beyond their patterns. They must not be afraid of something new happening. Otherwise you will find that there is a script ready for you, and all that you are doing is going by that script. Isn\u2019t the script already ready for you? Tell me. Is a script not ready for you? How does it feel to live a life as if the chapters of the script are opening, and you are just acting as per the script? It has been pre-decided. It was already certain what you will do class Tenth, class Twelfth, then a B. Tech., then maybe M.B.A., M.S. or job. And then marriage, then kids, then a house, then some money in your bank account, then certain responsibilities of your parents and kids, and then death. Finished. How many of you want to live like this, where everything is already decided? This way even your life-span is kind of decided. Marriage between the age of twenty-five to thirty, kids at thirty, thirty-five. Even the number of kids is also already decided. Thirty years back it would be three, four or five. Now may be one or two. So everything is destined. Just the time of your birth, the place of your birth is deciding everything. So if your birth-place is China, you cannot have kids more than one. Do you know that in India, in a disproportionately large number of families, the youngest kid is a boy. Because the families keep aborting the girl child, till they get a boy. So usually you will find that the youngest kid in the family is a boy. And the boy is born after the three-four girl child have been aborted. so, it is pre-decided. The last kid is the boy. Now what will happen to this boy who has come after so much slaughter? Do you want to live like that? You want to live with this destiny? Do you see how powerless all this is? Do you see that this is sheer slavery? Or can there be freedom beyond destiny? Can there be life beyond destiny? You have to ask that to yourself. If today somebody  comes to you and hands over the script to your life to you ans says, \u201cLive it,\u201d how will you feel? Every single breath that you take has been pre-decided. Is that already not the case? So it\u2019s a good question to ask, \u201cIs there a life beyond destiny?\u201d There is, but it is only for the strong, the courageous and the surrendered. Because that is the only source of strength and courage. Surrender! One becomes really afraid: \u201cO my god! Going beyond your destiny. Why take so much pain when a script is already ready? why should I write a new script? Somebody has done so much of effort. He has already written a complete script. Why should I violate that? Pay some respect to the script.\u201dJust like a puppet pays respect. Have you seen a puppet? Everything is already ready for the puppet. Puppet pays great respect to its script. It does nothing that is not written in the script. Beautiful life of a puppet. Right? You want to live like that? Now the puppet will enter a B. Tech. program because everybody else is doing that. The puppet will work hard to get more than seventy-five percent marks. (Mockingly)  \u201cSon now you have started earning. It is time to get married. \u201cAnd you feel so puffed-up. The next chapter of the script is unfolding.\u201cWhat can I do? The situations were such that I had to do this.\u201d You sing songs also where you attribute everything to destiny. \u201c Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam. Tum rahe na tum, hum rahe na hum (If destiny would have allowed, you would have been mine. Destiny was so cruel. I did not remain myself, you did not remain yourself).\u201d So everything is destiny.Why  are you  alive? \u201cDestiny Sir. When death will come, I will die. When I had no role to play in my birth, why should I have any role to play in my death? Everything is destiny. Kahaani Kismet Ki (The story of destiny)\u201d It eases our burden. Right? We know that we are stupid. But we won\u2019t say that. What we will say? \u201cKismet kharaab hai (Bad Luck)\u201d Why not simply say, \u201cI am stupid\u201d? Why blame things on destiny? Destiny is there, obviously there for everybody. The question is that what are you doing to yourself. Nobody has control over destiny. But what is your response to the destiny.An intelligent man lives in attention, not under the influence of destiny. And the moment he starts living in attention, destiny looses its control on him. now destiny cannot dictate its influence on him.   AJ ",

Growing up i realised that a lot of people suffer a lot and just die suffering without seeing the \u201cgood\u201d part, i added, \u201cwhatever happens, is for good if you are good!\u201d Growing more up, i realised that most of the people suffering are actually good, from a four year boy being bombed in syria, to a 11 day old girl being raped in another country (yeah 11 days!!) I realised that both my mother\u2019s and my philosophy were wrong!! However the answer was however simple! Look at a pen on your table, try to move it without touching it. Will it? Obviously no right! It is probably human behavior that we can look at things clearly if they are small and immediate. But if some one else, unknown, comes and moves that pen, will you call it a destiny? Our life is basically a collection of decisions taken by us OR by some one else (some human or animal too, incase a lion decides to eat you) just like moving the pen. So basically if you decide to do something like studying for an exam, you will have the result because you moved the pen. And if america decides to bomb you, you will get bombed because america decides to move the pen (no hate for america, just an example). So whatever happens is just a result of some human or animal taking that decision. So instead of waiting for some invisible force (called destiny) to move your pen, move it yourself. And if some one else is trying to throw your pen, try your best to stop that :) Good \u201cluck\u201d :) ",

            "answer_text": "One of the greatest and everlasting debates of humanity has been about the role of destiny in the lives of human beings. There was a time when it was almost an accepted fact of life that each and every event was governed by destiny of human beings. Astrology was considered a science. Then with the advent of modern times the importance of role of destiny as a concept started losing weight. Today, belief in destiny is considered a superstition by majority of people. And rightly so, since there seems to be no evidence for the irrevocability of destiny. There are three schools of thoughts about fate. The most prevalent these days seems to be the one which says that there is nothing called destiny or fate. This line of thinking says that human beings do possess free will. All our successes, failures and actions are governed by the decisions we take. If we take correct decisions and act accordingly, no one can prevent us from achieving what we want to. If we fail, it must be due to something wrong on our part. We have the option to take decisions using our free will. In this line of thinking, fate is considered a superstition at worst and at best one can regard it as a psychological defense system to cope with the failures in life. Whenever you fail in some endeavor or whenever something happens which is not in accordance of your wish, you use it as a convenient scapegoat. You say, it was your bad luck which caused you to fail. Otherwise, how could you fail? You are never ready to accept that it was you who was responsible for the failure. It may have been due to some bad planning, lack of efforts in the right direction or outright failure to correctly judge the realities of your goal. But since it hurts to accept that you were the one who committed the mistake, you take shelter behind the concept of fate and blame it on your karma. This relieves you of the terrible pain of knowing and accepting the defeat. This line of thinking has gained currency mainly because of the persons who subscribe to this theory. Among the votaries of this theory, one will hardly ever find people who can be called a failure in their lives. Almost all of the people who are considered as successful in their lives agree with this line of thinking. They say there is nothing called fate, they believe in themselves and in the existence of free will. Other people, looking at the supporters of this theory, grudgingly start accepting it since the logic, that one must be right if he is successful, comes into play.  This theory leaves many a questions of life unanswered. For example, this theory does not even begin to answer the question of differences between different people at the point of their birth. Why one is born to rich parents and another to poor ones? Why are some children born healthy and some sick or crippled in some way? There are many such questions, but for starters such questions suffice. Apart from offering the word \"Coincidence\", it has no credible sounding answers. There can be many arguments for and against this theory, but the debate is bound to remain inconclusive. It must be said at this point that once a successful person, who does not believe in destiny, starts experiencing failures, he slowly begins to accept the existence of fate. Perhaps, the experiences of people are the strongest arguments in favor of destiny.  There is another school of thought which seems to be the most logical line of thinking. It says you are free to take the first step, but as soon as you take it, your second step becomes inevitable and predictable. You become bound by the different laws of life which govern the outcome of an act. Let us take an example. Say, you are going to plant a tree. As long as you have not done it, you have plenty of options. You may choose not to plant the seed at all. You may choose the type of tree you wish to grow. But once you have taken that decision and acted upon it, your freedom is curtailed by many degrees. If you plant a mango tree, then no matter what you do you cannot get any other fruit from that tree. Of course, even for reaping the harvest of mangoes you have to keep you fingers crossed. You cannot guarantee that the seed you just planted will grow to a big tree at all. It may also happen that the tree grows, bears fruit, but you cannot taste even a single fruit. There might be plenty of reasons for this. In other words, your freedom is limited to the actions you take but not to the outcome of that act. This sounds logical because the outcome of any act depends on so many factors that one cannot realistically hope to have control over all those factors. That is why even the best laid plans of the mightiest and most intelligent people turn to dust. This concept is called \"Law of Karma\".  In the eastern philosophies, like Hindu or Buddhist philosophy, there is the concept of reincarnation. It says, we all keep taking birth after birth. This cycle of birth and death has been continuing since eternity, and will keep on repeating itself till a human being attains \"Enlightenment\". This state of enlightenment has been described differently by different sages. Some have called it Self-Realization, some have called it Self-Actualization. It is also known as attaining Moksha, Nirvana or Kaivalya. Only after one achieves it, one can break out of this relentless cycle of birth and death.  The law of Karma says that all that happens in one's life is result of his own deeds. One can never escape the fruits of whatever he has done. Just like different plants take different time spans to grow up, different actions also take different time spans to bear fruit. It may be that the result of some act may take more time to fructify than the remaining life span of the person who committed that act. In such cases, the person has to bear the results of such actions in his next life.  Now we come to the theory which says that all events are predestined. There is nothing called free will. We are all like instruments in some grand design and nothing else. All our thoughts and actions are predestined. I would give two arguments in favor of this theory. Let us first examine the subject of Astrology. It has also been a subject of a great and inconclusive debate. Is there some truth in the astrological sciences( see Astrology: A Science or Superstition)? I think that while it is not possible to establish the efficacy of Astrology beyond any doubt, it is perhaps more difficult to deny it altogether. Most of us have had some experience with astrologers where some of their predictions came out to be astonishingly accurate. It can be argued that a majority of astrological predictions fail. But I am not talking of failed predictions. There can be many reasons for that. I am focusing on the predictions which turn out to be true. How can it be possible for someone to predict some event of future? Let us consider for a moment a journey from one place to another. Someone who knows the route can tell us that city A will come after city B. Now it is only possible if the landscape remains unchangeable. If someone can change the location of cities then it would be impossible to predict this order. Similarly, the very fact that it is at all possible to predict future events, proves that future is unchangeable. And if it is so, then where is the place for free will? The second argument derives itself from the knowledge of modern science. It says that the whole universe is a continuum. What this means is that there is no part of the universe which is isolated from other parts. Whatever happens in one part of the universe influences the whole of it. This effect might not be detectable, but that it occurs cannot be denied. For example, if I throw a pebble in the Pacific Ocean then the disturbance it will create is bound to travel  to the other end of the ocean and affect the water molecules there. It is entirely another matter whether we are capable of measuring that effect or not. Similarly, take the case of stars billions of light years away from us. Since the light from those stars eventually reaches us, it must be influencing us in some way or the other. We also understand that for any event to take place there must be numerous events in the past which make this event possible. Each event is a culmination of innumerable events in the past as well as forerunner of some other event in the future. For example, for me to have taken birth the births of my parents was a necessary precondition and so on. If we start tracing back the turn of events which made my birth possible, we will have to go back to the very beginning of the universe. Now let us consider the insignificance of a human being in the scheme of the universe. Even a drop of water in the largest ocean has more significant presence in the backdrop of that ocean than a human being has in the universe. What this signifies is that it is impossible for a man to change the course of events, since the causes of those events lie not in his domain but in the whole of the past of the universe. Can one realistically hope to negate the whole tide of the past considering the limits of his much less than insignificant strength, thought or will?

We moved, I was put on ADD meds. I was grumpy and introverted. I was diagnosed with Epilepsy. I graduated High School and was ripped off my meds. I was asked, politely, to leave Collin County Community College(I majored in Student Union). I worked part time for six years, worked for EDS for four years. Was laid off during a restructuring. Bounced from temp job to temp job(mostly due to my ADHD). My brother committed suicide. My parents divorced three years later(I became Mom\u2019s emotional support). I found the love of my life, and we got married. My wife had two miscarriages. I had to take my father off of life support. I went into an addictive cycle that bankrupted my family and separated me from my wife and toddler daughter. I am now married 10 years. Have a five year old daughter, and I am in my fourth year of sobriety. If a God wanted this to be my path, I want absolutely NOTHING to do with him, the savage bastard. And, if this is part of some Grand Plan, I refuse to acknowledge it. ",

            "answer_text": "If you're asking for an absolute answer, I doubt any human has - or ever will have - the necessary degree of omniscience required to unequivocally answer such a question. Destiny has always played a pivotal role and has significantly influenced various cultures, creeds and empires throughout history. In greek mythology, destiny was decided by the Moirai; otherwise known as the 3 fates; Clotho who spun the thread of life, Lachesis who measured it to decide how much time was allocated for each and every mortal and Atropos who finally cut the twine with shears at the moment of a mortal's death. The influence destiny had over the society of Ancient Greece was such that even the Gods themselves couldn't escape its power or influence; a true testament as to how powerful a force it was considered to be. Humans have always divided their reservations over whether or not their actions truly have any impact on the direction life progresses. Some resign themselves to the notion that events in life transpire in the manner that they were always meant to; while others argue that destiny cannot truly exist in a reality where an individual possesses free will and is, as such, at liberty to govern what, if anything, holds sway over their lives. To take a simple example to illustrate a point of view; wealth... Some families have enough income to financially secure the lives of entire generations without any cause for concern while others would be lucky to even secure their own. Are some people destined to be born into wealth and others into poverty? In the end an individual's existence is determined by the actions of their parents reproductive decisions.  Ultimately, who we are and what we make of our lives is nothing more or less than the sum total of all the events that make it up. We're defined by the choices; the good and the bad; that we make. ",

It blast forth in such a spectacular force that these travelled to great long distances, distances we can only imagine, distances we cannot even count. Then as time went on, these random atoms and molecules condensed and started forming dense matters - stars, asteroids, planets, etc. As time went on and on, around 4.3 billion years ago, a chunk of material that detached itself from our sun settled at a particular point and started orbiting it. Then as foreign matters from asteroids came and settled in this mass of rock; random chemical reactions gave birth, quite by accident, to the first cells which discovered a means of reproduction and propagation. As time went on, process of natural selection - as we call it - set in and complex life forms came forth. Things became more and more complex, as time went on, and then at a particular point of time one of the various forms of life started to \u201cthink.\u201d It gained self knowledge (consciousness). Then it invented rituals and random personifications to explain things unknown to it. This species, as time went on, dominated, through its wit, the entire planet so much. And new and new innovations, new questions, self doubt, self discovery, everything happened and right now, one member of that species asks in a format (language) that it created for itself, to its fellow members, through a communication medium (Quora) that it invented itself if destiny exists. I'm not really sure. Does it exist? ",

Let\u2019s say God told you that you are destined to create a new nation, or do good for the society after becoming a billionaire. But you have the choice to end all of that promise, simply by jumping off a bridge somewhere, or swerving left while driving onto incoming traffic; in other words, you have free will. In addition to active sabotage of your destiny, other can also destroy it, either intentionally, passively or even accidentally. Destiny does not make you bullet-proof, or cancer-proof, or mistake-proof, so there are so many ways in which destiny goes unfulfilled, by early death or otherwise, and an unfulfilled destiny, is not destiny. And the existence of unfulfilled destiny defies the concept of destiny, similar to, if you were able to find an instance where God is helpless, then whoever that is, is not God (definitional problem). The correct concept is potential. Potential is having sufficient talent, skill, energy, etc. but all other things must work out well also, for the potential to reach its fulfillment. Destiny appears to exist, only because we are connecting the dots backwards. Destiny cannot be forward looking, unless you are talking about certitudes of life, like \u201cyou are destined to die one day\u201d, or that piece of carcass is \u201cdestined to rot\u201d, but that\u2019s usually not the way the term \u2018destiny\u2019 is used.

But those who are hopelessly pointing fingers on others, blaming their time and stars, are searching forever.. to find out what gets them where.. and the funniest part, they proclaim themselves as believers and followers of the first category people, stated above.. so waiting for such accidental miracles to happen on themself..

            "answer_text": "People confuse destiny with something like predefined future. If future is fixed there is no free will. If there is no free will humanity doest not exist. Then humans are nothing but an automaton - a very complex machine but predictable. Infact that means entire cosmos is one giant predictable machine. Here is one catch to predictability. If everything is predictable or pre destined then sooner or later humans through science will decode the underlying laws. In that case predictability will cause humans to alter the outcome which makes the entire thing unpredictable. As you can see exercise of free will alters predictability of the part of universe which they belong to. Presence of free will causes future to be completely uncertain and certainly unknowable. One more aspect to it is that humans have two parts - machine or non machine. Non machine part has awareness and therefore free will. If people are not aware then machine part takes over. In that case they are nothing more than an automaton. Majority of humans are living in this state. They dont make choices \u00f2ut of free will but compulsions. Destiny is direction not destination of one's journey. No matter what direction one takes it takes one towards the mystery. A painter will reach the infinite with his paintings, a musician with his instrument.and so on. To discover your destiny is to discover the infinite within you. That way destiny is only one. Only conscious people have destiny and rest dont have. If one says God determines future then I say only God can save you ;). End of discussion. ",

            "answer_text": "We can define destiny at the abstract level. But, if we talk about destiny as an absolute thing,  it's difficult to  define and most likely it's a by product of consequences. Let's start with some real life scenarios.  Will our future generations go to school? It doesn't matter if the answer is yes or no. What matters is the future direction of human society. So, going to a school  is not a destiny but a planned outcome of our civilized society. This is a case of unnatural (human made) consequence.  Giving birth to a child is also not a destiny. We can predict the outcome of our results. Sometimes prediction can go wrong. This is a case of natural consequence. Can humanity survive for another million years? Again it depends on how fast we damage our environment or if our DNA is capable to survive another million years. So far, the earth is only known planet where humans can survive naturally. If we change the natural ecosystem too much, we can't survive long enough. This is one more example of consequence.In brief, our language system has been developed to a great extent in last few thousand years and we have a long list of nice words in our dictionaries. I find destiny is one of these nice words though used extensively.

            "answer_text": "Consider a flower.  It began as a seed nestled in the soil growing in two directions, one pressing deeper into the ground while the other pushes upwards.  Leaves slowly unfold and the stem thickens reaching for the sun.  A bud appears and bursts into a bloom that draws bees carrying pollen borrowed from an anther to its stigma to produce the next generation\u2019s seed. Is it destiny that brought the blossom?  Was the combination of genes, the specific bee and the flower it visited before bringing the fertilizing powder predetermined?  If our flower could look back over the history of its existence, it might seem that it was destined to be.  However, a sentient seed seems unlikely to envision what would come from its existence.   It could not know if the soil would support life or a bird consume it before it began to grow or too little or too much rain would fall, or someone\u2019s foot crush the life from it.  Which of these fates would be destined to befall it?  It seems to me that life holds too many variables for destiny to be real.  ",

But till the point in time when we invent a time machine or determine some way to see our futures, we cannot witness our futures and anything- whether good or bad- inflicted upon us has to be ascribed to a multitude of factors (over almost all of which we have no control at all) and the one word substitution for these factors is destiny. It is a question of faith and religious views whether you believe in destiny or not, but we have to term something which we cannot explain and destiny is one such term.

            "answer_text": "When one talks about destiny, then one means that his fate is already sealed from the start. It would be necessary to reach that point and that is beyond any control. Then, no, destiny is not real. Nothing meets something else because it is meant to be by some transcendent relation that tie both beings in an unbreakable tie. Because man is free, therefore fate cannot affect him. He is free to choose whatever he wants. It could be an illusion of freedom, but we should not confuse determinism with fatalism. Determinism is when something is bound to happen in the exact same circumstances, like a pencil free-falling when released. Fatalism is a metaphysical rope that ties someone to his unavoidable end. Also, destiny is not compatible with morality. If man is bound to reach towards his destiny and has absolutely no control over it, then no one would have any reason to condemn him for his bad actions. ",

            "answer_text": "For my own convenience, I believe that all abstract concepts were developed by humans, for their convenience. The fatalistic schools of thought came up with this one: destiny. Science would obviously dismiss it as being unscientific. But imagine a situation in our historic past when the king would behead anyone who brought bad news. In that situation, DESTINY could very well have proved to be a very useful concept. I also believe, on a much more serious note, that every abstract concept - whether it was posited by Einstein or was simply one of our superstitions - has a very definite point of origin. It is therefore there only because there are people who have believed in it, even found it 'useful' So, instead of merely dismissing such concepts as being true or untrue, I prefer to view them from the perspective of a social psychologist who is empathetic toward all creations of the human mind.  Finally, I also believe in giving every thing the importance that is due. No more, no less. If for one person in the world there's such a thing as destiny, others have no business dismissing it - even if it is un- or non-scientific. ",

One of such systems is weather, another is sperm-cells reaching for the egg. If a different sperm cell arrives this will result in a different person being born, there are millions of sperm cells starting the race at unequal conditions, someone ahead, someone behind. If your father decides to bang your mom for 1 second longer. your existence will be prevented and someone else will be born. Destiny can\u2019t exist under such conditions, causality in this reality is too sensitive to smallest changes and accumulates changes over time at insane phase. Now, have fun dealing with an existential crisis. ",

But at a micro-scopic level the events that happen in life are RANDOM collisions. That is not destiny.  And Nature wants it seriously that way, I feel. Nature is all creative and random.  So the learning to me is - we can only generalize things to some extent always. That is not all Indians are stupid and Not all non-indians are smart.  Like wise at process level stages may be same, but every other person's life is not articulated earlier but it grows on only one factor called \"probability\" in the natural or intuitive direction. And direction itself may or may not qualify for accounting destiny.  ",

Now, that said, there are some souls who come in deeply desiring a certain path and they are very unlikely to change. We often call that destiny. ",
