            "answer_text": "Late Night or Early Morning Study: Which one is Better? Most of students prefer late night studies. Students prefer to study at night because they feel more comfortable and there is no noise which can distract them. Late night studies are very comfortable you can concentrate well and also drive your focus on particular topic. Some students like to study early in the morning because they feel more comfortable than night, they think that their concentration power is more in the early morning and it give them a natural power to learn something in a quick time. Everybody have their own choices according to their nature. Some students do not feel comfortable at night so they like to study early morning. In short we can\u2019t change others opinion because everybody have their own feeling and they know better about themselves. Some of the the benefits of Early morning study on the Late night study are as follows: Benefits It has been observed that the students who study early in the morning remember the things for a long time and also learn it in a quick time. Whereas others who like to study late in the night take more time to learn that particular topic. At night students get proper concentration but still they take more time. Reason Reason is quiet simple. Early in the morning your body is fully relaxed and you are totally fresh. All the tensions in your mind were overrun by a good sleep and now your mind is totally free from all worries. Fresh air of the morning makes you feel comfortable and you feel extra power in your body. In contrast, late night studies are very stressful. All the things that you have done today are roaming in your mind continuously and distracting you from studies at night, that is why late night studies require more time to learn a particular topic. Late night study can destroy your daily routine. Difficulties It is very difficult to wake up early in the morning. But to achieve something you have to lose some of your luxuries. If you want to score good marks then you have to compromise with your sleep and wake up as early as possible. In the beginning it will seems impossible and you can\u2019t concentrate better but if you will try to wake up early in the morning daily, your concentration power will increase and you will be able to learn in a very quick time. Well, I am not saying that late night studies are bad and you should not study at night. It is just the comparison between late night study and early morning study. It is totally your choice whether you prefer late night or early morning. ",
