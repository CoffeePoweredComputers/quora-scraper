            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not really sure what the hard rules would be. Here are things that make Arabic difficult for native speakers of English: The alphabet is different and is written from right-to-left. While the alphabet isn\u2019t all that hard to learn, it takes a long time to get used to seeing whole words or sentences in a different alphabet and recognizing them without having to sound them out letter-by-letter. This makes the acquisition of reading skills more time-consuming.Arabic has a lot of dialects that are different from each other so you can learn standard Arabic (or one of the dialects) and end up going somewhere where the Arabic sounds like a different language.Arabic has a complex root system where every word boils down to a 3-letter root (in most cases). This means lots of words that are related look similar. If you try to learn this system by memorizing the chart of all the possible forms of roots, it can be very complex. Most native speakers don\u2019t know the chart and you can learn the language while ignoring this aspect.Arabic grammar is much simpler than that of Spanish, Russian or even German, but it does use some endings and declensions. English speakers are not used to using these so it takes a while to get used to getting information from the verb in a sentence rather than from a pronoun plus a verb or a series of verb forms.Plurals and number-noun agreement in Arabic is very difficult because there are a whole bunch of different forms and rules.There are not a lot of cognates between Arabic and English, so almost every word you learn is something new.That being said, there are some things about Arabic that make it easier than some other languages (in my opinion). Arabic uses word order and constructions that are sometimes similar to English (although not always).Arabic only has two basic verb charts (past and present) and essentially no irregular verbs. This means you only have to remember a limited set of endings.Spoken Arabic or everyday Arabic condenses a number of rules or ignores them so things like case endings, feminine plurals, dual forms and a few other things can be glossed over or even ignored while learning the language.If you are going to learn Arabic formally and try to learn or memorize all of the ins and outs and formal grammar rules, it can be somewhat complex. If you are just going to learn it as a foreign language to use, you can skip a lot of hard stuff at first and still make a lot of progress. I learned Spanish and Arabic and while Spanish has some obvious points that are easy for native speakers of English, I think Arabic is actually much more forgiving for new learners, especially once you get past the point of just recognizing single words.

            "answer_text": "Because of many facts :   There is many alphabet  characters that are only in Arabic \u0636 for example.  The Arabic vocabulary is very rich . A world with the slightest change could change the meaning totally, take this example :                                 \u0642\u0650\u064a\u0644 \u0642\u064f\u062a\u0644 \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0644 \u0642\u064f\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e \u0637\u0644\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0633 The two first words ( starting from the right )  are practically identical the third is missing one point in the first character from the first tow.The meaning of the first word (\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0644) is \"it's been said\" the second (\u0642\u064f\u062a\u0644)  is \"killed\" and the third (\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0644) is \"elephant\". The meaning of the hole phrase is , it's been said that an elephant was killed before sunrise.  Arabic has a lot of tenses  It has a  lot of homonyms, homophones and  homographs  It's  pronunciation is not easy as it has \"wired\" sounds for non Arabic speakers although learners will get used rapidlyQuran for example  which is written in Arabic and many ancient Arabic  books needs explanation in some areas  and are not easy to understand for many native Arabic speakers , sometimes there is an explanation of the explanation of the Quran.
