Many universities, especially private ones, will offer the chance of winning a merit scholarship--so it is possible that you could study for free. That said, in my experience, international undergrads often overestimate their chances for admission. So apply to schools that you think you have a good chance to get into, and some schools that have MUCH lower standards for admissions than you possess. You probably won't get a scholarship at a school that you just make it into. ",
