            "answer_text": "We have to. We really do. I\u2019m speaking for myself, of course. We use a lot of terms for parents who attempt to control every aspect of their child\u2019s life, and most of them are negative. It\u2019s the same for teachers. One teacher, one person, can\u2019t control the mass of students and student behavior present in a classroom. A teacher can only focus on the major offenses (and/or possibly a few minor offenses), and a teacher has to set classroom management minutiae aside from time to time in order to make education interesting and worthwhile, because interesting and worthwhile is A LOT MORE effective at constructing a learning environment than constantly serving out consequences. Every decision a teacher makes to address behavior OR ignore it carries its own consequences for the classroom. I ignore plenty, but every behavior I ignore runs the risk of spreading quickly into a maelstrom of inappropriate behavior. Every decision I make to address behavior runs the risk of distracting and disrupting the classroom\u2019s educational potential. Catch-22, educator style. It\u2019s why experience in teaching may count for something. There are ways to deal with a cell phone (or lipstick, or a student surreptitiously crafting his next class\u2019s homework, or note passing, or a student refusing to do any work) that can ease the potential for disruption and there are ways to shatter any potential for learning (yelling at the class for a single student\u2019s behavior, for instance). Sometimes, you take that road with purpose. There are some behaviors that demand teacher intervention. You make a choice, and you shatter the room to make a point and keep control, but be careful.  I found a generous supply of eraser caps in the former teacher\u2019s secret closet. I put them in a cup and set the cup on a student table next to the pencils. A few minutes into class, a student starts playing with them. He lines them up, starts to color code. The student next to him gets involved. In 30 seconds, they begin crafting the rules to eraser arena football. Game on! That behavior spreads quickly between these two and ALL the other students in the immediate vicinity are suddenly much more interested in eraser arena football than whatever it is I\u2019m doing or saying. I make a decision to take the erasers. I walk over. It takes a minute or two. I don\u2019t even say anything. I take the cup, and I wait patiently and expectantly as the students place the erasers in the cup. I put the eraser cup on my desk, and class moves forward. That is always my goal. Proceed with learning. Move on.  I had an education professor who once told us a teacher can lose it three times a year without a loss in class respect. I can\u2019t cede self-control in my classroom environment\u2014this is a correctional classroom, after all\u2014so I never did test her theory. The interesting result is that students don\u2019t think I get angry. \u201cYou never get angry, Mr. W.\u201d a student says. \u201cI\u2019m angry right now.\u201d I say with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely raging inside, but I\u2019m making a choice right now to stay in control. The anger subsides if you get back to work.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re messing with me?\u201d He says. It\u2019s a question. \u201cAm I?\u201d ",

I give students a target? That being said, you have to keep your room in order. Everything in its place. You can\u2019t let the students think they\u2019re in charge (unless it works for some longer-range plan). Dumb teachers let kids think they run the asylum. They get rolled every day and don\u2019t even know it. A weak hand on the reins does no one any good. ",

Is the student not paying attention or being disruptive, and there\u2019s a good chance that I can bring them back into the fold? Then I don\u2019t ignore it. Is the student not paying attention, but any attempt I make to bring their attention back will just cause a bigger disruption to other students? Then I ignore it. It\u2019s all about picking your battles when you\u2019re a teacher. It\u2019s the same with parenting too. You learn to ignore things when not ignoring them doesn\u2019t provide any benefits and can make things worse. ",

It\u2019s better to do so, but if I hear them calling my name ( even with a small voice ), then, I don\u2019t mind it and come to see them.
