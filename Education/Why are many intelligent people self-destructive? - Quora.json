            "answer_text": "You\u2019d go mad too if you had a super computer for a brain that processed overwhelming amounts of data and sometimes you try to speak and you have multiple sentences and responses and then a completely off-tangent topic popping out trying to connect puzzle piece and data from here and there because your brain\u2019s curiosity is insatiable. And your brain was working overdrive but this is everyday of your life. And the only way to gain some control and sanity is to get professional help from other highly intelligent people who also have experience living with their own super computer brain and somehow know a variety of coping mechanisms, psychology, NLP, meditation, self-reflection and a whole bunch of others because they too needed it to survive with their crazy brain of theirs. Ha! Unfortunately, I had terrible parents, and couldn\u2019t afford that after they verbally disowned me, not yet legally, and the only thing that helped me is self-help, self-development, personal development, and having validation from another person who may be smarter than me who also happens to be suffering from similar issues and sharing some solutions with you only because she was also having similar problems as I was. Like Vitor Medeiros said, \u201cOverthinking\u201d Yes. That is right. However, if we do not know how to use psychology and NLP to our advantage and find solutions to our problems when we pass a certain stage & learn to hack our brain. What happens to intelligent people is that we have a tendency to get sucked up into our own thoughts & imagination. We usually think up of all sorts of scenarios both negative and positive. The less emotional you are & the more realistic, logical & rational you are, the more you\u2019ll be able to see what works and what doesn\u2019t in the potential humanly flawed scenarios you can muster up realistically in your own imagination based on your own current limited education & understandings while being in whatever mental state & physical state you are in that would also affect your psychological state affecting your ability to make a more accurate judgement or reasoning so you just end up telling yourself that you\u2019ll just be as objective as you can to save whatever time & energy for more important things that need to be prioritized in your own life. *Hours later & countless words deleted* This ends up creating a negative emotional cycle of internal suffering & worry until we self-implode. I\u2019m only writing this because the question Why are many intelligent people self-destructive? strikes an emotional chord within me & I feel everyone has self-destructive tendencies as long as they don\u2019t know themselves well enough & don\u2019t have a clear goal or direction. Also, if you\u2019re IQ is 130 or higher, according to Mensa you can technically adequately do almost any job in any field as long as you are healthy. Which means that you\u2019re going to miss out on a whole lot of experiences & you\u2019ll have way more choices to choose from. It\u2019s like looking at having an infinite amount of choices & paths to pick from at an early age, too little time which will narrow my choices & path later, as time goes by & infinite things & opportunities I will definitely miss out on because of my lack of choosing because I\u2019m trying to carefully consider my choices\u2026 Wasting my already precious & limited time. I can keep going to infinity & beyond but I\u2019ll write some possible solution below. Until this intelligent person with an overactive imagination learns effective practical coping mechanisms that is compatible for their unique personality. These things will keep happening. I\u2019ll give you an example if people\u2019s brains were computers. Imagine that the average person\u2019s Operating System is the usual easy to use Apple and Windows generic systems and I definitely prefer using these simpler, more aesthetic, visually stimulating systems than Linux, Ubuntu and other less popular OS for people who are more advanced in computers and definitely have an affinity with programming language. Intelligent people\u2019s Operating System are running on things similar to Linux, Ubuntu, etc and programming languages that are more difficult for the users to operate. Or maybe it feels like that to us. In my personal opinion, it\u2019s smarter to be less intelligent depending on the situation and circumstances. Wouldn\u2019t you agree? Most of the time, simple is better and more time-efficient. I think the more intelligent a person is, the more the person will struggle with understanding their own identity and place in the world. What fits with them. How their brain operates. How they see and perceive the world. How they will utilize their potential. Also, they need to temporarily learn, adopt and incorporate many different types of coping mechanisms according to their own circumstance and situations until we can find more permanent adjustments of lifestyle solutions overwriting some of our coping mechanisms. I think it\u2019s not intelligent to hinder your own progress. So, self-destructive intelligent people are just ignorant or not practicing self-awareness and other higher level coping mechanisms to keep themselves under their own influence and not let the supercomputer taking them into overdrive overwhelm them. I\u2019d say intelligent people have greater potential for greater responsibility and organizing skills but it\u2019s a double-edge sword. We have to live with the way our brain organizes the world and fine-tune ourselves so that we can actually utilize our intelligence while maintaining it and our sanity, it\u2019s high maintenance, at least in the beginning. It gets better when you get to incorporate good systems and habits, ones that seem to work for you. I also forgot to mention that the most intelligent people tend to have an insatiable need to be creative. On the other side, there is something amazing about normal people. They can actually be just as effective as those much more intelligent because they beat us with their experience, and in other areas. There are many forms of intelligence. And sometimes some people who believe they aren\u2019t intelligent or don\u2019t consider themselves to be could be intelligent in another way. This is what I believe. Also, I believe you don\u2019t need to have a high IQ to be effective or intelligent. Because lesser powerful computers can achieve greater results if the right programs and systems are correctly installed and used on a regular basis. Just because I have a super computer doesn\u2019t mean I can use it properly and effectively. Just because I was born this way doesn\u2019t mean anything if I can\u2019t use it. A gun is a useless gun if the user doesn\u2019t know how to use it. Think about it. There isn\u2019t too much of a difference with lesser or greater intelligent people. If you can all focus on refining yourself, and learn how to use your processors, and that brain of yours. That\u2019s all that matters, seriously. Figure out how you can develop yourself as you are. Learn what you can. Do what you can. Be what you can. There is always a place for everyone. Keep refining yourself and your potential will be able to get utilized. Sometimes, it\u2019s wiser to appear to others you are less intelligent. There will be less expectations from you first. There is an element of surprise. And you won\u2019t attract too much attention. Some intelligent people actively choose to hide some of their potential from others because some have been taken advantage too many times. Or was made fun of or ostracized for it, there are also more sinister reasons but it\u2019s not the majority of the cases. Even intelligent people have a desire to belong somewhere. As long as we are human, we can never escape our nature. We can\u2019t dehumanize ourselves and if we do, I assure you nature will figure out a way to deal out consequences and balance it one way or another. I tried programming myself to behave a certain way, and believe certain things but because I can\u2019t be you, and you can\u2019t be me and I can\u2019t be something I just ain\u2019t. It\u2019s a matter of time before nature reverts us back to just us. We don\u2019t really have a choice but to accept ourselves for who we are and live with ourselves or torture ourselves until we end up self-harming, or even killing ourselves. How would you feel if you had a super amazing brain and unless you\u2019ve been raised by supportive parents and not abusive ones who dragged you and whatever potential you had down the drain. And then had to start off much lower than most average people. Wouldn\u2019t that drive you mad? And remember super computers require more maintenance, more energy, and special care. We have the potential to create more, make more, help more, create amazing systems, building amazing things. The problem is we are in the minority. And we will end up suffering without working much much harder than those with simpler computers. Honestly, the best advice I can share for intelligent people is to get ready to figure out ways to cope with that super computer of yours because you\u2019re gonna need all the coping mechanisms, psychology, resources, intellectualizing relationships since you may act like \u201cSheldon\u201d from time to time and to take responsibility for your life because nobody knows you better than yourself. And everyone is a mirror for you to start learning what they reveal about you. You can gain so much data from your surrounding and that overloads us at times but we need to learn and develop the right strategies, and follow good systems to focus on how to keep our sanity, balance work, balance relationships, friendship, learn and educate yourself, while doing something to tickle and stimulate our brain practically everyday. My brain almost demands me to cater to it\u2019s need, like a prince. Otherwise, my emotions start to go haywire and I start feeling repressed, depressed, suppressed and unexpressed. Or maybe it\u2019s because intelligent people tend to be very susceptible to mental and psychological disorders. I must add that I have some disorders. I\u2019m not sure which one since I need to get myself checked out by a professional. If I can ever afford it. I\u2019m currently undiagnosed, I have speculations but that\u2019s another topic for a different time. ",

            "answer_text": "Because there is no way to decide to do harm to yourself without thinking. Just as it's hard to get drowned without jumping in the water first. The more you think, the further you are from the direct reality of your body and surroundings and into the woods of the abstract world of pure ideas. Who knows which ideas might enter your mind! If you believe everything that you think of, a self-destructive idea could manifest and be put into action. But intentionally doing self-destructing things is still rare. Most people do that as an escape from something even worse, since they can't find a better option to avoid it. Escape from what? Thoughts, of course. For example, you might think that your life is unbearable and decide to commit a suicide. It hurts that much to think about your life. If you did not spend time in the first place thinking how much your life sucks, looking for an escape route wouldn't be necessary either. And if you didn't think that suicide is possible, it wouldn't be on the table. There is a big danger in thinking - actually believing your thoughts. Most people fall in that trap. We mistake thoughts for reality. Those who think less, or less abstractly, simply get fewer occasions to come up with something self-destructing. So is the answer to dumb yourself down and avoid thinking completely? Probably not. Thinking is useful. Just as abstaining from swimming is not the best answer to the danger of drowning. The best answer is learning how to swim. Every time you blindly believe in a thought, it drowns you. Every time you blindly not believe a thought, but do believe in its opposite, it also drowns you. But when you see a thought and take it into consideration while fully realizing that it is only a thought, you swim. ",
