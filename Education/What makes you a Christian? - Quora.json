            "answer_text": "I was an atheist at the age of 20. When I was a child until I was a teen I prayed to God every night. At some point I stopped believing, I don\u2019t know why. I remember standing on the side of a mountain saying \u201cFuck you, God\u201d and suffering no consequences. At some point at around that time I remember I was sitting in a restaurant in Tofino BC. thinking about stuff and I decided I wanted to do good, not bad. I wanted to be truthful, have integrity, treat people well. I was appalled at the attitudes of some of the people I worked with who seemed to be incredibly hard hearted. I believe, in retrospect, at that time, I had decided to follow Jesus, although I didn\u2019t know anything about Him and I thought religion and the whole idea of God was stupid. As I was going through my early 20\u2019s I realized that my life was fucked up. I met a girl who was a Christian and we had a few discussions about Jesus, maybe 3 or 4 in the time we were dating over 8 or 9 months, but wasn\u2019t a major topic for us. I respected her beliefs, but thought they were not for me, but here words stuck with me and something began to germinate in my heart. I eventually decided that maybe there was a God, but I wanted nothing to do with church. Eventually it became pretty clear that this girl and I had totally different value systems and it was just a matter of time before we broke up. I had a neighbor, who was completely ruined by taking LSD. He could barely put two words together but we used to hangout. He was pretty \u201cout there\u201d, and was always bringing me bizarre stuff. One of the things he brought me was a book called \u201cQuotations from Chairman Jesus\u201d which was kind of pun on a book that was popular among campus leftists in the Hippie era called \u201cQuotations from Chairman Mao\u201d I was feeling really depressed about life in general, my life in particular, and the almost certain demise of the relationship with the girl I was dating. I thought of my life as \u201cI\u2019m so fucked up\u201d. Anyway I went out and got a bunch of dope and smoked up thinking you know, it would maybe help me escape from my depression. Unfortunately pot isn\u2019t like booze. When smoking pot, if you feel good, pot kind of enhances the feeling and you feel great, and if you feel depressed, then pot kind of amplifies the depression and you feel really really crappy. At least that\u2019s how it worked for me. Anyway, I was sitting in my little rental house feeling really really crappy, and I saw my burnt out druggy friend\u2019s book on the floor\u2026Quotations from Chairman Jesus, and picked it up and starting reading it. It was basically just quotations from the Bible that Jesus said about various topics. I started out kind of cynical, but the more I read, the more it spoke to me and I began to feel more and more alive. After a while I put the book down to make dinner and as I was making spaghetti I decided to follow Jesus. I started to cry and the feeling of joy overwhelmed me. I phoned up the girl I had been dating and told her that whatever happened in the relationship was fine with me. I was okay with it. She was quite surprised and asked what was going on. I just told that I had gotten some good advice from a mutual friend. Although she begged me to tell her more, I wouldn\u2019t. That summer I was working for a survey crew laying out a new subdivision out in the country. There used to be a Smirnoffs Vodka at that said:\u201cThere\u2019s vodka and there\u2019s Smirnoffs.\u201d The ad showed photographs of two identical scenes, but one was in black and white (There\u2019s Vodka ) and the other was in color (..and there\u2019s Smirnoffs). This pretty much described how I saw the countryside I was working in and the world in general before and after I became a Christian. Everything was so much more vivid and an alive, whereas what I had experienced before was only a \u201cblack and white\u201d version of nature and reality. Anyway that weekend following I went out once more with the girl I had been dating. She knew something profound had happened to me. I didn\u2019t tell her anything, but she kept saying \u201cYou\u2019re so different\u201d and similar. I didn\u2019t want to tell her I was following Jesus because I was afraid she would think I had made the decision just to make the relationship work. A cynic might think the same, but there it is. I can only tell you what happened. After a couple of weeks of her bugging me about how much I\u2019d changed and what was going on, I finally told her. She was pretty happy. What I didn\u2019t know during this time was that she had felt an urge or a calling or a compulsion to pray for me the whole time we were dating. Anyway the very night I became a Christian, the compulsion disappeared and she was wondering \u201cwhy?\u201d, like it was some problem of faith she was having or something. Anyway, that was just the beginning of my Christian life. I married that girl 3 years later and we have been together 42 years now. If we hadn\u2019t had Jesus in our lives, I doubt if we would have made it this far together. I have 42 years worth of incredible God stories in my life but I\u2019ll stop here since it pretty much exceeds the scope of the original question. ",

            "answer_text": "Because I love my Creator and wish to do His Will. There are so many ways of looking at this question and answering it, and really and truly, one would need to look at my entire life to adequately answer it. The primary reason that I am a Christian is that God, in the Person of Our Blessed Lord arrived on earth and personally invited me to be a Christian. In inviting me to be a Christian, He has asked me to do certain things, and the more that I cooperate with His Will, the more committed a Christian I become. But without Him and His Grace, and His Love, I would not be a Christian. But just as He has asked me to be an evangelist for Him, He previously asked my parents and teachers to be an evangelist for Him to me. Thus I can remember, as a small child, my mother praying bed time prayers with me. I can remember my parents taking me to \u201cChurch\u201d (we were Protestants when I was young). As I grew up, in seventh grade I began Confirmation classes in the Lutheran Church. And my seventh grade mind rebelled at what the were teaching me - it didn\u2019t make any sense with the loving God that I knew. For the next several years, I was investigating, mostly in the Episcopal Church due to my uncle, who was an Episcopal priest. Finally, when I was 16, I discovered the Catholic Church and I discovered God, as He actually was. And I started, only started mind you, to give myself to Him. An action which nearly fifty years later is not completed, but I am giving it my whole, each day of my life. Over those fifty years, I have led an extremely eventful life, an awful lot of it not good, and a good bit of it running away from God. But now I have returned, realized my lunacy, and returned to weekly confession, daily prayer, and continuous offering of myself to Him. Why am I a Christian? Because that is the reason that God created me. That is the only reason I exist on this earth - that is the only reason any of us exist on this earth. And we are all called to be evangelists for Him. So if we are not evangelizing ourselves, educating ourselves, and praying daily for His guidance, we are going to be unable to fulfill whatever mission He has made us for on this earth. Why am I a Christian? Because God loves YOU, and wants YOU to follow Him, and He has hit me upside the head and asked ME to please let you know. I am a Christian because God loves me and you. ",
