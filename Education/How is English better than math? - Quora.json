            "answer_text": "English isn\u2019t better than math. (I believe you are referring to English and math as academic pursuits, and I am responding with that assumption in mind.) We all have our individual interests, abilities, talents, and ways of studying. As individuals, we all enjoy some pursuits more than others, depending on our individual ways of thinking, the topics that most interest us, and what accomplishments are most satisfying to us with our own individual quirks. This reasoning applies to academic studies as well as artistic pursuits. So enjoy your accomplishments in English, in math, in whatever subjects you wish to pursue or must pursue in order to reach your goals. ",
