            "answer_text": "Everyone is worthy of instruction. Everyone has a right to pursue their education as far as they can take themselves. I don't believe it's up to any instructor to determine if a student is \u201cworthy\u201d of instruction. That to me is a dangerous value judgement. Besides, I've seen plenty of students who defy the expectations of teachers and counselors, who oftentimes are blinded by their own prejudices or preconceived notions of a student\u2019s ability \u2014 including mine. My mother was a school teacher. When I was in high school my guidance counselor told me I would struggle in college and tried to talk me out of the choices of schools and the course of study I wanted to pursue. I was an \u201cA\u201d student most of the time, so I couldn't understand where he was coming from, so I just ignored him because I thought he was a jerk. My mother didn't. She was furious and told him if he thought his job was to discourage his students he probably should find another line of work. Years later when I received my doctorate from Columbia University she walked into his office to inform him, just to embarrass him. That said, universities have the right to deny admission to students who they think can't do the work, and professors have the right to fail students who haven't shown satisfactory progress. But that's not the same thing as judging if someone is worthy of instruction. If a student objectively fails my class then that student either didn't put in the time or take it seriously, because the university has already determined that he or she has the intellectual ability to do university-level work. The failure is the student's, but again, it doesn't demonstrate unworthiness. A student who fails a course can almost always redeem himself or herself. If they did, then they would have shown themselves to be more than worthy, wouldn't you say? ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the others, but with a caveat: in the context of martial arts, some students are not worthy. They are the students who might use the skills to injure innocents. I realize that the implication of being \u201cunworthy\u201d is based on the student\u2019s perceived lack of skill, social status, or intelligence, but I speak of character. Some people just have bad character, and sometimes life is too short to teach people of bad character. (Yes, I understand that therapy can help people who appear to have \u201cbad character,\u201d but I\u2019m not talking about therapy.) Sure, with kids, there\u2019s always hope, and showing an at-risk student a kindness can make a huge difference in their life. Personally, I paid extra attention to an aimless student once, and he found the direction that he needed so he could thrive. A large part of our responsibility as instructors is to see the potential in students and to persevere. But sometimes, with older students (such as adults), you have to cut your losses if they\u2019re, well, complete assholes. ",
