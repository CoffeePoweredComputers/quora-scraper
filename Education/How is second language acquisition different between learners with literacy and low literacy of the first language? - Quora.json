            "answer_text": "Illiteracy in the first language can make second language learning more difficult. The reason is that the mental furniture that literacy in any language gives is not present, so the second language learner is not only having to learn new vocabulary, grammar and syntax, but also the idea of writing the language using a script, and reading a language. So they are having to learn to read and write at the same time. If they are first language literate they have the equipment to read and write in their second language as well. ",
