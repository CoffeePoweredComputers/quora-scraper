They will do whatever they feel like doing just like they are taking entrance examinations during a pandemic, when the cases in india are rising so much every day. So probably they will not mind in endangering the lives of young children. Just as the supreme court said \u201clife goes on\". I really want more and more students pursuing law bcq now y'all can see what the real condition of our country's govt, news channels and courts is :) ",
