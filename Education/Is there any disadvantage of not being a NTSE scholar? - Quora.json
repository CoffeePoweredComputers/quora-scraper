            "answer_text": "Greetings To answer your question, I must say that the disadvantage of not being an NTSE scholar is that you will be missing the advantages of being an NTSE scholar. A few benefits include:- i)Obtaining a continuing yearly scholarship throughout your years of study ii)Added credibility to your educational qualifications which ensures easier obtainment of a job in future However, there are many people who have not cleared NTSE, but have truly done well with other entrance exams that they have taken up in grade 12. So, not clearing NTSE only means that you have imposed a greater challenge on yourself to do much better in the upcoming exams, in which you will come out with flying colors. Let only the good prevail. ",

            "answer_text": "No....not at all....NTSE is just one examination...It is not to be taken soo seriously.... Let me tell you something...Even if I wouldn't have been a NTSE scholar...I would have done something good in my life...Clearing just one examination does not prepare you for the challenges in the rest of your life...  You must be thinking this is crap philosophy...trust me..it isn't... I know how it feels like when you can't qualify an exam you always wanted to crack...but you need to set up yourself for the future endeavors of your life.... You don't get selected in jobs etc just because you are an NTSE scholar... When we'll look back at our lives...we'll see NTSE just as an exam ...nothing else.. A crap OMR sheet can never define my ability or your talent... Regards....  ",
