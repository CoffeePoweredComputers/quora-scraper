            "answer_text": "NOTE: the original answer has been deleted and replaced by the following: Let me start with an unqualified YES. With 3.4 after a year or two of community college, you should be able to transfer to a four-year institution. Now let me add the qualifications: I had Six terms of ceramics; I may not be allowed to transfer until I take something that looks like an academic subject.I took too many courses in my major, and the school considers it misleading to give me a degree in fine arts when all I\u2019m going to do at their school is my science divisional requirements.I took too few divisional requirements and courses in my major, and I\u2019m not going to be able to finish in two more years unless I change my major. The school can choose to allow me to change majors or to stay an extra year, but neither is guaranteed.If I\u2019m looking to transfer from a community college that is designated as compatible with a four year state institution, there is usually some designation that a course will automatically transfer. In the state of Washington, this is called Common Course Numbering. So if I take Chemistry 102 at any Public school within the state, it will transfer as Chemistry 102 at every other school in the state. If I take a course that is not a Common Course, it may transfer as an elective, or it may not transfer at all. Don\u2019t expect your 3.4 to be looked at as a 3.4 by the institution to which you\u2019re applying. Because the people who attend community college before applying to transfer often started out with a weaker academic record, either you, the student applying, or your classmates, may not be as academically prepared as students who started at the four-year institution. It\u2019s more reasonable to expect your 3.4 to be considered a 3.0. for purposes of evaluating your file. ",

            "answer_text": "In California, you only need a 3.5 to do TAG (transfer admission guarantee) which guarantees you admission to any of the UCs except LA and Berkeley. 3.4 is decent and should get you into a state school. Depending on the rest of your application, you have decent odds of getting into more prestigious schools as well (if you\u2019re in California, UCs in particular are known for having a lower bar for California transfer students than for freshman).
