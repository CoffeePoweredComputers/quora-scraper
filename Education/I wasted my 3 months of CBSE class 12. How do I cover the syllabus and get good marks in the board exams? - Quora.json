            "answer_text": "Well i think i m one of the most suitable person to answer this question as i just passed my class 12.(wait didn't passed\u2026. Computer science is remaining). I m considering you are a pcm student. I m going to talk about only pcm as others subject are matter of few days. So first of all well its ok buddy. Its really ok.Whats really important is that now you should actually start it. I m assuming you are not a jee or neet aspirant otherwise you won't be asking about board at this moment (If you are then start thinking you are doomed and start studying furiously with some good online local coaching). Now you must understand board is actually easy if you study for it. First of all you should be crystal clear to your resources and stick to it. You have to do it and its the only thing that you should do. For Maths :- Simply just do your Ncert followed by a chapterwise previous years book. Class 12 board maths is actually pretty simple and you can easily ace it with these 3 books(2 volumes of Ncert). Don't go for any other book. I m assuming you study from youtube as that's the best option but studying from channels like unacademy jee won't benefit you so much as its targetting competitive exams so instead of that uou should follow channel like \u201cCBSE CLASSES\u201d. He will teach you concepts and Ncert questions. For quickly going through any chapter for revision purpose you should check out \u201cPriya thaparwal\u201d. Listen buddy its a pretty straight path. Just study with these resources. Don't think so much. I m giving you chapterwise order and days you should invest on it for studying first time. Matrices and Determinants. 12 daysRelation and function. 5 daysItf. 5 daysContinuity and differentiability. 8 daysAOD. 10 daysNow you have completed your term 1. You should first revise these chapters once again. Relation and function seem big but truly its a easy chapter with just same type of questions repeating. Now indefinite Integration is the lengthiest chapter in our syllabus but that is necessary for definite Integration and application of intergal then differential equations so if you are free to study anything you want then first finish these chapters. 6.Linear Programing (1day) 7. Probability (5 days) 8. Vector Algeabra (4 days) 9. 3D ( 10 days) Once again give a week for revision 10. Indefinite Integration 20 days. 11. Definite Integration 7 days 12. Application of Integrals 5 days(practice a lot) 13 . Differential equations. Keep solving pyqs along with ncert and revision. Now lets come to Chemistry. Again be fixed with your resources. And actually you need same resources. Just NCERT and Pyqs. Again try to not go for a YouTube channel which primarily focuses on jee and neet. You can still use it according to your need. Arvind arora's old lectures are quite good too. Physical Chemistry Its the easiest thing to do and it retains in memory for longer duration so first complete your physical chemistry. Be fixated with one channel atleast for one subject like Physical. A lot of numerical isn't asked but you should do each and every intext and back exercise question along with pyqs. Its really easy. Remember formulas for numericals that's it. Read ncert and make notes of important point only. Dont make notes for the whole chapter. Make short notes. Use previous year book to study rather than notes (valid for complete chemistry). Solid state 3 days.(Trick is read ncert first then there are something's you need to understand about cubes, coordination number and such refer lectures only for such things. Don't watch all the lectures as it will eat up too much of your time) There is one guaranteed and fixed questions from this chapter related to density.Thats all.Solution. 7 days ( if your mole concept is weak then watch a 2 hour video by Physics wallah on this chapter that will make things easier for you,\u2026a numerical might asked from this chapter but that will be easily handled) examples are asked from here.Electrochemistry. 7 days.( Its a nice chapter try to enjoy it. Do study everything.Chemical kinetics. 7 days. One of the easiest chapters just follow the above instructions.Surface chemistry. 3 days. Too much of remembering. But not rot learning.Revise this much for a week or so.Now lets come to Organic part. Here is something where what you have done in class 11 really matters. If you have studied class 11 Organic then its a cake walk if not (in most cases)then its going to be tough but not as tough as we think. Don't need to start studying nomenclature and all again. But you will need to give effort here. Do this 1} Reaction Mechanism (By Physics wallah). 15 days. After doing this you will be able to cope with class 12 organic Chemistry. Actually you will cover a lot of things of class 12 also in this course. 2.) Start studying from any channel and they will keep telling you basics which are used.. I m not giving a time line here as it depends on you but keep using pyqs book as questions mostly repeat in chemistry. Biomolecules,Polymer, Chemistry in everyday life these chapters and even some inorganic chapter are best taught by a ma'am with channel name Mr maths and Ms Science. Ha ha sounds funny but these are the most boring yet scoring and must to do chapters. Inorganic chemistry Coordination compound. 15 days. No rote learning . Real concepts. Do it nicely. Very hight weigthage. Pick up any good youtube teacher. Watch all lectures. Make complete notes.Metallurgy 3 days. Quite easy. A lot of remembering but can be done. Read ncert. Dont go for lectures. Uss pyqs. You will need to revise it again and again.3. D and f block.6 days Again quite easy. Read ncert. Not many reaction you Just need to understand how oxidation and reduction works. And kmno4 and its preparation is important. Do pyqs nicely and it will be a piece of cake. You cam follow arvind aroroa 4. P block 10 days. A lot to study and remember but most important is structures of oxoacids and interhalogen compounds. For this particular chapter download Aman Dhattarwal notes. \u2026thode notes are superb. Really Great. After all this watch Arvind aroras last time preparation videos. Those are nice and understand one thing that very limited questions are asked in chemistry who starts studing now can score 65+/70. Physics (Most dreaded subject as per boards also) Even in Physics a very limited things are asked but one must understand everything to apply. For Physics follow one teacher. He could be anyone but follow one completely. Don't be afraid of numericals. Ncert questions aren't as important as previous year. Master previous year questions. Dont rote learn derivations understand the concept. Feel the subject. Don't be afraid of it. Most importantly divide time equally between lectures and self study. Derive derivations by your own during self study. Dont waste too much time on electrostatics and Ray optics. Not giving a time lime for Physics as its on individual. Thanks for reading. Ask me if you have any queries. ",

            "answer_text": "hi if you wish you time of first three months then now don't stop because it's very precious time now start your studies you have to study consistency for 5 to 6 hours per day but you have to keep something in your mind like you have to take break for 5 minutes after studying for 20 to 25 minutes then you have to be very consistent about your studies and daily study it's very very very important and the third thing is to do meditation exercise in the morning and the four things is called use your mobile because if you use your mobile then you are distracted by your mobile be consistent and daily for your time table ine I will also also give you time table which is going to be help you very much and don'ts to set rest because by citrus you can't get anything else but if you study hard then you get your goal so be happy and study harder this I will also tell you one mistake that very very honest and every day from very beginning to start your syllabus daily as per year syllabus as per your subject we have to study delete I have to study the matter if you're having mathematics we have to study mathematics daily and if you are no mathematics that it's very much is your for you some of the persons are don't like mathematics as much so you can study all subjects Delhi and please very careful you are the good girl have good boy I know it what is your gender but very careful about your studies and please work hard disk or better its an matter that how many months it's metal that how many months used sobi study perfectly I will also give your time table later in this comment box thank you ",
