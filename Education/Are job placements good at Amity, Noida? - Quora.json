            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what standards you have placed for yourself to be considered as \u201cgood placement\u201d. But let me answer you with atmost honesty. I\u2019m not aware of other streams but if you are from engineering and really want to get placed, Amity Technical Placement Cell (ATPC) will absolutely help get one. I cant guarantee you, but chances are pretty high for placements ( unless you are super lazy to attend campus drives during odd hours and holidays or have performed supremely bad through out your graduation.)I cant and will not generalise the salary package but it will be similar to what other institutions offer as per \u201cindustry standards\u201d ( 2 LPA ~ 4/4.5 LPA ).The above insight is for \u201cthat average engineering guy\u201d who has just attended classes for 4 years and haven\u2019t made many significant contribution to his resume. If you work hard on your skills, groom yourself up, score above average grades and make yourself an irresitable and wholesome person i.e above average, chances are high you can easily get 5 LPA and above. Many have done it, so can you.Hope that answers all your queries. TC, All the best. Vaisakh. ",
