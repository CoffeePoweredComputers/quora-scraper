            "answer_text": "Having gone through their schools, I would say their educational system is their biggest problem, i had pro abortion teachers, teachers who actively and publicly supported gay marriage, little to no clergy, or theologically trained persons on staff, most of them could not have answered the fallacious questions of a 5 year old. Add to that CCD/Sunday school is pretty much a joke.  Frankly, i only became interested in Catholicism (or rather, learned that my family was Catholic) around the end of high school, and i became interested in theology and the history of religion around this time.  If their education was better (not like trying to drink sand to sate your thrust for answers) perhaps they would have held onto me. As it is, i am agnostic, but friendly. Frankly, they need to stop trying to get \"young adults\" into the pews, and start trying to get real teachers into schools. ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest challenge to Catholicism today is liberalism.  Although there are a number of good and accurate definitions (see Shawn Weiler's answer to What is/are the true definition(s) of liberalism?),  I choose: Liberalism is a philosophy that \"asserts that the individual  is independent of God and God\u2019s authority.\" (see link above for source) What  this means is that people think that they have an option when it comes  to belief in God [whether they are obliged to believe in God or whether  they must be a member of Christ's Church  (Roman Catholicism) to be  saved].  The fundamental cause of atheism [and  Protestantism] is liberalism. Liberalism is basically synonymous with  rationalism.  Rationalism insists that there is no objective truth or  that all truth  resides in the human mind (which, incidentally, is  totally contrary to  the scientific method).  Another good  definition of liberalism is  \u201cLiberalism asserts that the individual is  independent of God and God\u2019s  authority.\u201d (\u201cLiberalism is a Sin,\u201d TAN,  pp. 9-10) But liberalism is false. The  truth does exist  outside of our minds. The truth is that Heaven and  Hell are objective  places (albeit not in this world) and God is an  objective Person. Since  humans have been created by God (and they only  continue to exist  because He maintains their existence), they cannot  ever truly be  independent of God.  And since God is God, He rules and  humans should  obey Him (His authority). I can understand why  people would  not like what I have written in this reply.  The most  hateful thing for  a human to do is to obey someone else. But in a  certain sense, obeying  God is obeying yourself.  All humans desire to do  good.  Doing good  makes us happy.  In revealing Himself and giving us  commandments God  shows us how to be good, and in religion He gives us  the help that we  need to do good. Heaven is a gift and we must follow God\u2019s conditions to receive God\u2019s reward. But the truth is this: God loves us more than we can imagine and wants very much for us to be happy with Him in Heaven. But it is our free choice whether to love Him or not.  http://www.quora.com/Why-dont-Ch... From: Shawn Weiler's answer to What is the biggest challenge to Christianity today? ",
