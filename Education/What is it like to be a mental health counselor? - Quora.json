            "answer_text": "I worked as a behavior therapist for five years before deciding to change paths last year, though I worked for larger health care companies rather than my own practice. Naturally, a person running his or her own practice will have at least a somewhat different experience. Over those years, I worked with two main groups: children with autism, and (mostly) adults struggling with addiction. In some ways it was no different from any other job. I had to manage my schedule and balance my various tasks, and sometimes it was just a question of getting through the day (or dragging myself in to work to even start the day). But in most ways it was very different from any job I've ever had. Usually my day would be a succession of clients, anywhere from 3 to 10 depending on how long and how intensive the sessions were. A session would be a mix of talk therapy, practicing behavioral techniques, and (on my side) paperwork. Sometimes I'd assign them homework of some kind, either actual written work or just practicing the techniques we'd worked on in the session. The biggest difference between that job and others I've held is how important it is to genuinely care about the people coming in for help. Often they're in a terrible place - addicts rarely seek out help before they've hit a very dark place, and children with behavioral disorders just don't know any better than to lash out and act, in a word, bratty. So caring about these people often hurts, a lot. But I believe it is not possible to do a good job as a health provider without that component. The other side of that is the necessity of learning how to shield that emotional connection, because it's also very often necessary to push people (gently, usually, but sometimes you have to be more direct) to face up to their problems. Both groups I worked with had a common element in their behaviors, namely that those behaviors worked for them for some reason.  Maybe screaming got the kid attention when he wanted it; maybe drinking helped the alcoholic not think about her problems. Whatever the function, people tend to build up rationalizations and defenses to help them protect those behaviors. As their therapist, it was my job to not let them bullshit me (or themselves) with excuses. People generally don't like that. (As an aside, this is a big part of why people need to be open to therapy for it to work. Changing any behavior, let alone a problematic one, is usually an unpleasant process. Somebody who's just not interested in the work will give up. Even people who do want to change often need help connecting with their motivations and maintaining that connection throughout the process. Behavior therapy is almost always a \"it'll get worse before it gets better\" kind of thing. If you've ever worked to lose weight or quit smoking or exercise more, you'll probably understand how difficult it can be to hold on to that motivation after the initial burst!) And it's work that demands a very high level of precision. Like anything else, therapy doesn't work well when it's done half-assed, or carelessly. Behavior therapy especially demands that things are structured juuuuust right. Every word you say and action you take can make a real difference. And even when a therapist is diligent, if he or she can't get to the root of the problems that the client is facing, it won't be productive. Sometimes I'd spend weeks working with a child client to change some problem behavior, only to learn during that process that I hadn't actually figured out what was causing the behavior - so that work was essentially wasted! (This is one factor that makes autism a real challenge to work with when the client is non-verbal or only semi-verbal. There's no way to get inside their head!) It's also possible to do more harm than good, if one is careless. Only medical practitioners are likely to have more power over a person's immediate well being than a therapist. So I always felt, in the back of my mind, a real pressure to get absolutely everything right. There were absolutely days when I hated my job. Days when I went home emotionally exhausted. Days where I couldn't see the forest for the trees. Days where I just wanted to grab a client and shout \"what is wrong with you?!\" As a person who's fought depression, the emotional turmoil of the work was by far the biggest challenge for me personally. The good news about working with other therapists is that they're pretty good when you need support! But all of that, all of it, pales in comparison to seeing a person get her life on track, or mend fences with his kids, or to see a seven-year-old actually speak properly to express emotions instead of melting down. If the burden of being a therapist is that a person's life more or less rests in your hands, the reward of being a therapist is that eventually you get to give it back, better than ever. It's a simple sentiment, but helping people just... feels good. I had my share of bad experiences as a therapist. You have to grow a thick skin to do it, and you have to be smart and on top of things and alert basically all the time or else you're failing people who depend on you. But it was absolutely worth it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it is incredibly rewarding. I see clients 1:1, we develop goals together, I support, provide education, perspective and guidance. You get to watch people make meaningful change and know you helped it happen. Like any job with those rewards, there are also \u201coccupational hazards\u201d that can provide for some tough days. You will take some tough phone calls. Clients commit suicide, which is a call I had to take this week. They overdose. They experience horrible things. Sometimes you have to be the one to report abuse or neglect which could result in legal consequences. Fortunately people are resilient. More than you could ever imagine. Should you become a manager or supervisor like I am, there are additional rewards. Helping colleagues and supervisees grow can be rewarding. You may lead treatment teams and help with organizational change. You also might get stuck doing incident reports and putting out fires. I love my job, the pros outweigh the cons. ",
