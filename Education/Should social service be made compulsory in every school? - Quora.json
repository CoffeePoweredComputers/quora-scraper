            "answer_text": "It would be helpful to make the distinction - should a school provide social services in every school, should students participate in social services, or should students be compelled to provide service to the community. These are all very distinct differences, and without knowing what is implied in this question, it is difficult to give one answer. Also, another distinction should be made if this is applicable to public, private, or charter schools. I will focus my answer here on the assumption that there is a question as to whether or not schools should provide social services as a mandate, in the public school arena, as that is often a hot-button issue. If we look at the fact that most public schools comprise of the most vulnerable in our communities (socio- economically, racially, and gendered), arguments can be made that supportive social services increase the stability of individuals and families, which can decrease crime, violence and systemic dependence in all of our communities. Social services are not equal to handouts, they help link people to resources to help reduce situations that lead to hunger and malnutrition, medical problems, mental health instability, and economic distress. Being able to fully support a family to access health care, job readiness, or to leave violent homes or communities, screening for developmental delays or learning disabilities, or being able to target socio-behavioral needs greatly increases a child\u2019s ability to maintain focus in the classroom, to consistently attend school, and develop and build skills useful for academic success. Our schools may be the only safe place our children go to in our communities, may be the only place where kids have consistent healthy relationships, and where they may receive two solid meals a day. By providing social services to assess everyone in a school, we can better target needs, enhance strengths, and reduce problems later down the road. There are plenty of studies out there that point to the benefits of such interventions, and the positive impact they can have on school-aged kids. I urge you to look at the ACES studies to get a better picture of what most of our children encounter growing up and how their experiences with trauma (which includes physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, violence in the community, exposure to domestic violence, cyclical family violence, and historical and racial violence, that all contribute to traumatic experiences, many of which we often deny the existence, keep secret or minimize as a course of our own cultural biases) can impact their outcomes as adults, and how early intervention can have a significant positive impact on the reduction of health, mental health, and economic costs to our country.

            "answer_text": "Yes it should be made compulsory in each and every school, Once when the students are brought up with practice of doing social service to the society. It will become has an habit and they will continue it in their entire life. Because when they are students they have kind heart and love towards others, so while they see someone in the society struggling or need helps all the students together can help. And students in our society are populated widely in our country. So it should be made compulsory for each and every students to be involved in social service. ",
