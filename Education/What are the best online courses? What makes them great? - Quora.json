            "answer_text": "The best online courses are produced when the teacher has carefully planned the lesson, used good quality camera and sound equipment, enunciates and includes online learning trends such as gamification and personalisation. This is including games or quizzes for students to enjoy in their lessons or tailoring the class to suit the needs and interests of the student. The best online classes are also relatively short in duration. Typically, a class should last 15-30 minutes. This is known as microlearning, a trend which can improve our retention rates and depth of understanding. All in all, I believe the best online classes equip the learner with a tool or a new skill which they can apply themselves. Whether it is a watercolouring class that teaches students a particular technique that they can apply to their own design or a cooking class that allows students to cook the perfect meal for their family. If a student gains a skill from the class that they can use for their own benefit and they enjoy doing so, I believe it is a great online class. ",
