            "answer_text": "Actually this question is itself interesting. The USA is almost the top spender per child in the world, yet is pitied for the awful outcomes compared to other developed nations and some that Preisdent Trump has officially designated as shithole countries Despite US high schools providing an education that on average means it\u2019s graduates would be regarded as needing remedial education in many other countries, it\u2019s possible that many above average Americans can grasp the concept that 1% of high schools in the US must be in the bottom 1% No one knows which they are. No one cares No politician has ever lost their job for causing the schools in their area to be in the bottom 1% because, as above, no one cares. Sadly dear reader I must include you in this. To prove me wrong tell me what the education policies of Mrs. Clinton and President Trump were at the last election. You don\u2019t know. You do know that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s favourite book is the Bible, something she had to say repeatedly to ensure she got as close to being elected as she did. Do you recall her ever saying anything about educaton ? Actually she did, but the media hardly covered it because they knew you wouldn\u2019t care. You do care about your local schools sports team which is why they will have professional grade sports facilities and well paid coaches. Do they have anyone anyone who can teach programming ? Often no, because parents don\u2019t care. We see many protests about real or imagined disrespect of a given faith faction, or race or gender or girls showing too much skin or being taught the pathetically small amount of sex education they receive. Ever see a protests that these girls aren\u2019t been taught maths properly ? Or the boys for that matter, yet the average maths attainment of Americans is below that necessary for joining several countries armies as a basic soldier who job it is to stand outside a fence looking hard. So I don\u2019t know which is the worst school because no one has bothered to find out. ",

            "answer_text": "How many high schools do you imagine there are in the US? Like, a few hundred or something close to it? If that were the case, we might be able to pick the \u201cworst\u201d one but the scale is much bigger than most people realize. There are over thirty-seven thousand public and private high schools in the US. So, choosing the absolute worst might be a tad challenging. I will say, however, that due to intentional underfunding of schools combined with a general cultural disdain for education in certain localities, you could probably narrow it down to a \u201cbottom fifty\u201d or so.
