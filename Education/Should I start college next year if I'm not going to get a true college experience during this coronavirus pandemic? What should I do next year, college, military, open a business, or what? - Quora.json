What should I do next year, college, military, open a business, or what? Samuel, I am a stranger to you and you to me, so I don\u2019t know your circumstances, but I can give a quick list of things to consider. What do you intend to get out of college? An experience? Do something else then. You may find military an adequate \u2018experience\u2019, but in the event of a military crisis, such as a war, you may find that \u2018experience\u2019 less to your liking than you anticipated.If you are looking for an education, then the first few months learning by Zoom should be adequate, as they are likely to be just extensions of your high school education. Beyond that, you should be treated with a real education. In a real classroom with real teacher and real students.If your notion of college is Dating, Football games, drinking to excess, drugs, fraternities, then, in my opinion, you are going for the wrong reasons. Go ahead and spend your parent\u2019s money, but if education is not what you are going for, you are wasting it.So this suggests you have a plan - what do you want to be when your education is complete? A doctor, scientist, lawyer? Plan where you want to do graduate school. What will the subjects of your dissertations be? What kind of work schedule will you hold yourself to?That should be enough to consider. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I was just talking to a local boarding school that specializes in International Students. Some students did not go back to their home countries during the pandemic. They\u2019re still there. They\u2019re all studying remotely from their dorm rooms. They don\u2019t eat in the cafeteria. They go to the dining hall and pick up their food and take it back to their rooms. That sounds awfully depressing. Also, my son has had a very difficult time studying at home this spring. He just can\u2019t focus at home and he misses the tutoring center and the library, where he was able to focus better. This has caused his academic performance to deteriorate. So, I feel that going to college under these circumstances could be pretty miserable. On the other hand, can you get a job? The economy is not doing so well. It\u2019s kind of tricky to start a successful business, though if you have that type of personality, it might be worth a try. If you can figure out how to start a mask factory for health masks, you would be doing a huge public service \u2014 though that would be a lot to ask of an 18 year old. ",
