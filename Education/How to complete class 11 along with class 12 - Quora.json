Also find chapter of class 12th which are liked with class 11.. like in chem chemicap bonding, organic chem etc\u2026 Focus on that chap first .. I will suggest u to first focus on 12th then go for 11th.. as priority should be 12th\u2026 Do not pay attention on 11th after sept at all because after that just focus on boards\u2026.. Alll te best ",
