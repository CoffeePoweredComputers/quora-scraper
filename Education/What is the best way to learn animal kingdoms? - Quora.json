            "answer_text": "The best way to learn animal kingdom is to first go through the classification of all the animals. To break it up point wise: 1. You should read about the history of earth, how the earth became hospitable for the organisms to be born and how the atmosphere of the earth changed gradually to sustain the complex organisms. 2. Classification of animals will give you detailed insight about the complexity of all animals, their salient features, special characteristics like their habitat, food, ecology, behavior and reproduction. 3. You should also read about evolution as it enables us to imagine how the organisms evolve as the circumstances change and speciation occurs. I hope this helps you. ",
