            "answer_text": "No. In science there will almost always be evidence pointing both ways. But, the current consensus is that stimulating your brain while asleep is not a better solution to leaning while you\u2019re awake. It is tempting to believe that learning can be done unconsciously, or that information can be uploaded to our brains like in the Matrix. Needless to add, any study that shows even a trace of tangential evidence of sleep-learning will be blown up to massive magnitude in the media. While, of course, studies that point to the opposite are not in the news (assuming they get published at all). Let\u2019s assume that there is true evidence for learning while sleeping. If this was *really* the case we\u2019d all quit standard learning a long time ago. But, somehow this hasn\u2019t taken off. Just like somehow the vibrating belt hasn\u2019t substituted regular diet and exercise, and faith healing hasn\u2019t substituted medicine. Here is what we know. What we know is that sleep has a vital role in memory consolidation. Different sleep phases play different roles in that process.We need to get sufficient amounts (and the right proportion) of both REM and nREM sleep for the brain to process the information we acquire during the day.We know that sleep deprivation has adverse effects on many aspects of human wellbeing (incl. mental health, metabolism, cognitive performance).Here is what we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t understand exactly how our brain functions.Based on what we do know, it would make sense to as that interrupting different stages of our sleep would interrupt the processes they are designed to perform.That is would likely not lead to positive results in the long term. It can come at a cost we are not yet able to specify.We can summarise it with a quote from Thomas Andrillon, a researcher working on forming auditory memories while sleeping: \u201cStimulating the sleeping brain can have consequences on the function that sleep enables (\u2026) you may be able to learn a few words, but this may come at a cost. It could be that the cost outweighs the advantage.\u201d Source, reference paper published in Nature. [I spent some time trying to find a nice infographic to add here, that would also come from a reputable source, this one is from John\u2019s Hopkins. Encountered a lot of bogus claims, in the process. Stay informed, double-check your sources (including me), I\u2019m not a medical science professional.]  To sum up: Would you want to swap 5 new words of German for increased obesity risk? Or surely increase a chance for a heart attack while hoping to improve your listening skills? We can\u2019t conclusively prove that attempting to learn during sleep will cause these effects. But, if the health risk is large and potential benefit negligible, is it really worth it? As any scientific discussion what it is definitely worth, is further investigation.  Sources: All this is mostly based on wikipedia \u201cSleep and learning\". If you ran out of reading the references from wiki, there is a good collection of studies on Science Direct.

            "answer_text": "Depends on your definition of learning: Learning as in discovering new words of the language within your dreams even though you've never seen before in your waking life? No. There is a caveat: depending on the rules the language uses forms words, you might be able to deduce a portmanteau of sorts (e.g., if you know what pyro and tech individually mean, you might be able to put two-and-two together and make pyrotech). But deduction skills tend to suffer a bit in the dream world, so it's still a stretch. Studies have shown that listening to audiotapes are effective, but this still only works with words that have already been learned in the waking world, along with additional review upon waking.[1] _______ Learning as in practicing grammar, pronunciation and speech flow with words you already know? Sort of: You can do it, but unless you\u2019re able to experience dreams so lucid that you can still perceive the nuances of language, it might be a futile effort. _______ Dreams are mostly based off of emotion and non-sequiturs that come together to form some ostensibly logical \u201cstory\u201d. That's why describing your dream to someone else feels so odd, because as you tell the story you're realizing how nonsensical it actually is. So a My Dinner with Andre-type scenario is unlikely. But human beings are a very diverse lot with many outliers, so I'm sure it's possible for someone out there. Footnotes[1] Boosting Vocabulary Learning by Verbal Cueing During Sleep",
