            "answer_text": "From the way your question is stated, I am going to assume you are talking about high school, introductory chemistry. If you passed first year algebra, you should be fine. Beginning chemistry uses a lot of plug and chug work where you memorize formulas and plug numerical values for variables into those equations. However, many of those equations contain fractions with variables in both the numerator and denominator so you will need to get comfortable manipulating equations to solve for a desired variable. Also really focus hard on the units of measurements and always write the units with the numbers. Then treat the units like variables and cancel them out. If your answer is correct, it will have the correct units as well. It also helps very much if know basic geometry and can visualize three dimensional shapes. I find that my art students actually do well with that. There may be some things you are not used to doing, some relatively simple statistics, or some logs in pH calculations, but your teacher knows that you will need to be taught those and will do so during chemistry class. I did very well in my first year of college level chemistry without having taken either calculus or even pre-calculus. If you are talking about advanced chemistry you will need to be able to use statistics, calculus, and possibly even differential equations to work in the field. In that case study hard in the math classes, because you will need it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few great categories of chemistry: Biochemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Organic chemistry and Inorganic Chemistry. All are mathematically oriented, some towards more complex math than others, some more strongly oriented than others. Quantum mechanics and related physics specialties are also involved. However, there is plenty of room for chemists with only a moderate grasp of mathematics beyond basic differential and integral calculus. The ability to work with computers and their programming would be a great asset in work utilizing molecular orbital calculations and their interpretation. The ability to manipulate in you mind graphic images, and to interpret the spatial implications of three dimensional structures drawn on two dimensional paper is useful in most of the chemical categories. Bear in mind that chemistry is an experimental science, and that the advanced math described above would be the responsibility of chemists with advanced training. ",
