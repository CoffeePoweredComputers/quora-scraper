            "answer_text": "Most military reservists\u2019 weapons, just like most active duty servicemembers, will be safely stored and locked away inside a unit armory somewhere, religiously protected with alarms, locks, fences, stout construction, often armed guards, and by counting them and double counting them frequently. Many servicemembers, active duty or reserve, will not see their assigned weapons, or crew-served weapons, for months (or possibly years). Many will see them daily. It just depends on their job, their qualifications, their Service\u2019s policies, their specific operational status (deployed or in garrison, etc.). While in garrison, on a standard reserve drill training weekend, it is quite likely that individual reservists will not be issued weapons for any purpose\u2026it\u2019s always a big hassle just to unlock the armory, and then once open for business account \u2014 exactly \u2014 for each weapon issued to \u2014 exactly \u2014 each servicemember for \u2014 exactly \u2014 each period of time during that drill weekend, whether just long enough to clean it and return it to the armory, or long enough to perform drill and ceremony practice with it, or long enough to take it to the field for an hour, a day, or a whole weekend, or a 2-week Annual Training period, or a mobilization and deployment OCONUS into a combat zone. Obviously, reservists who perform more duty will be more likely to see their weapons. Combat arms-type reservists are more likely to see their weapons than combat support or combat service support. And, there are quite likely some reservists who are issued duty weapons immediately upon arrival at their reserve center and may retain them for the entire duration of their duty period\u2026 Are there some reservists who may be issued duty weapons who can take them home at the end of their authorized military duty? Hmm\u2026maybe. But they are very few, and very special, because they are being trusted to not only retain and maintain a deadly weapon issued by the US Govt even when not in a duty status, but the Govt must determine whether it will provide liability protection (indemnification) should the reservist use their US Govt-owned deadly weapon in self-defense or any other situation\u2026or even just lose it. (This indemnification issue of \u201coff-duty\u201d use of duty firearms can be a big problem, not just for military reservists, but as Rj Suitor\u2019s separate Answer to this Question shows, for police reservists, too. I can state that as a civilian police auxiliarist for a very small town, I was issued a City-owned firearm after I was commissioned, and my police ID \u2014 even as an auxiliarist \u2014 provided identical concealed weapon and firearm carry-authority, as well as indemnification, to the full-time and part-time sworn officers\u2026but that was just one example. Different jurisdictions work differently.) There is one group of reservists that I know of for sure that might be issued a US Govt-owned firearm, and retain it even when not in a duty status: generals and admirals. US law, DoD policy, and each Service\u2019s regulations permit a general officer/flag officer (GO/FO) of any armed force (whether active or reserve) to request a specially-prepared M9 Beretta pistol, for GO/FO issue only. A special office handles the requests, and a special armory shop works up a high quality pistol for presentation to the GO/FO, along with the kit that goes with it (pistol belt, holster, magazines, etc.). GO/FO\u2019s are trusted with many things beyond the rest of us\u2026and this includes taking home their Govt-issued pistol\u2026if they want one. Nobody makes them request it, and even if they requested one, they can later turn it back in. But when they retire from the Service, they may request to purchase the pistol (and kit), and pay the standard US Govt price. I\u2019m sure the Govt must do another background check, the usual stuff, and then once approved, the pistol is stricken from the US Govt\u2019s property records, and ownership is transferred to the GO/FO for the rest of their life as their personal firearm.

The individual DOES NOT get keep his/her weapon on them at all times, especially when in a stateside billet.
