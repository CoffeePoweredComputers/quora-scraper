            "answer_text": "I suggest one should read everything about: Evolution and ecology Genetics and genetic materials (DNA, RNA, nucleic acids, proteins, alleles, dominant-recessive traits, etc.) 7-8 out of 15 questions from a sample question paper require knowledge of these topics. Now that's 50%! Moreover, these chapters are very logical, interesting and there are no jargons to remember. It won't hurt to go through all the chapters, because the syllabus includes everything. But if you don't have enough time, go through these first. ",

            "answer_text": "For the iiser entrance test one should concentrate on more conceptual topics in biology like genetics , cell biology , evolution ,etc and concentrate less on anatomical and morphological chapters and human anatomy. Cell division is also a very important chapter from where conceptual questions are asked on a regular basis. Some chapters like ecology and informative chapters can be avoided as there is hardly any scope of any conceptual questions from these chapters. ",
