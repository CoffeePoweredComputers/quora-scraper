            "answer_text": "The answer varies depending on the country. For example, in India and some other countries, there are far, far more weeks in a school year than they are in the US. Ill-informed bean-counter credentialing agencies count an Indian (or similar) student with 15 years of (school+college) education as having less education than a US student with 16 years. They are wrong and unethical to do so, but have a chokehold on the system, so that all critical thought ceases and many colleges simply mindlessly follow their evaluations. If you are a bean counter organization without critical thinking ability, at least have the ethics to count the correct beans! In this case, that would be hours or days of education rather than years of schooling. (Of course, it would be better not to count beans, but rather examine the sum total of the experiences, but that would be asking too much of these agencies.) In fairness, good schools who can afford their own credentialing staff so not do this. ",
