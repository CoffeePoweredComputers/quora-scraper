            "answer_text": "I agree with many of the ideas of the technologists who have responded to this question.  The ever presence of web accessibility is going to change the way we educate ourselves. Adaptive, blended learning is likely to take root for children developing basic computational and language skills.  Some part of the day will be spent by a young learner in a technologically assisted environment that suits their level of challenge. Hopefully, teachers will learn to focus their lessons more on information analysis and interpretation, rather than rote memorization and repetition.  This will better suit the coming generation that will be the first to know the answer to any simple question within seconds of asking their personal computing device. What the idealists sometimes forgets is that being human is a social enterprise.  And I don't mean social as in you rate it up or down, or like it on Facebook.  Can you imagine a kindergartner learning about Thanksgiving exclusively through a series of interactive flash videos with cute talking Turkeys?  What a tragedy it would be for a child to miss the opportunity to role play the first Thanksgiving dinner (even if it is a bit sanitized for their consumption) with their peers and a loving teacher.  Or worse, what if they fail to develop critical motor skills because we eliminate construction paper collages in favor of those that are so much cleaner on their touch screen devices? Similarly, can you imagine a heated high school class discussion about a woman's right to choose an abortion having the same education value if it took place exclusively in an online forum?  How are my physics students going to understand uncertainty in science if all of their labs are computer simulations that work perfectly every time? Education has already changed in more progressive environments, and will continue to change even more dramatically as we reach the tipping point when everyone has an always web-enabled, personal computing device.  There will be schools that look like the project-based environment of a startup.  And there will be virtual schools that a family can choose for their child that makes obsolete the need to attend a brick and mortar building.  I am skeptical, however, that the vast majority of our children will be organized in a way that is significantly different than the schools that already exist. ",

            "answer_text": "This is what the future of classrooms looks like (yes, that\u2019s me on my laptop).  Imagine a teenager sitting at a desk in their bedroom with their headphones on, staring at a laptop, and watching an instructional video. That\u2019s it. What about virtual reality? Unless they\u2019re learning about how to build something relevant to virtual reality, then it\u2019s far away - thirty years or more into the future. Most of the world doesn\u2019t have internet access yet. So, chances are we have a long way to go. Is learning in virtual reality better than learning on a laptop through instructional videos and blog posts? Maybe yes. Maybe no. Virtual reality requires more effort. You have to put on a headset.You have to move your body.The problem is people don\u2019t like to work hard when it comes to learning. However, if virtual reality helps you learn information better, then people might gravitate towards it.  Still, history shows us that people rather choose the less mentally taxing channel for learning even if it\u2019s worse for absorbing information. For example, people can teach themselves everything they learn in college through online mediums such as Udemy and YouTube. It\u2019s a faster way to learn better information than attending college. You get access to world-renowned experts at your fingertips! But people don\u2019t like taking responsibility, so they lean on college to make decisions for them. Not a good idea. College leads to no applicable workforce skills and an average of $30K in debt. So, for the foreseeable future, the classroom setting will be on a laptop with instructional video and blog posts. Technology moves fast, but adoption of education alternatives crawls at a snail\u2019s pace. It\u2019s not changing anytime soon. ",
