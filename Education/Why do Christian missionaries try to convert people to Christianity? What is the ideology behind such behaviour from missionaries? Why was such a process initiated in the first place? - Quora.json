            "answer_text": "The reason why Christian missionaries try to convert people is because Jesus said followers must proclaim the good news. This is called the Great Commission in the Christian Bible. The text for this can be found in Matthew 28:18 to 20. Jesus said, \u2018go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am with you always even to the end of the world.\u2019 This is a commandment to Christians. If you become a Christian, and you take it seriously, you have to spread the word. But here's the interesting thing about this, there are many missionaries that try to convert others because they think by doing so, they earn the favor of God. To them, it's an obligation. That's a misunderstanding of the Bible because Jesus said, \u2018if you love me, you will keep my Commandments.\u2019 And the Great Commission is a commandment. It is an expression of your love. Now, compare that with converting people out of obligation because you're trying to earn your place in heaven. That's not love. There are many words for it but love is now one of them. Maybe its obligation or maybe it\u2019s fear. The great thesis of Christianity is that we are all born with defects, bad hearts, and the tendency to lie. We're all hypocrites. But if we surrender to Christ and allow the Holy Spirit, to fill us, it burns away our old self and we become a new person. In fact, one of the most beautiful promises in the Christian Bible is II Corinthians 5:17, \u2018if you are in Christ, you are a new creation.\u2019 Let that sink in. You're not your sin. You're not your past mistakes. You're not what people say you are or condemn you too. Even if you're in prison, you are a new creation. Meaning you're free. In fact, in Galatians, Apostle Paul said we have freedom in Christ. The problem is if you're converting people because of some obligation, some ritual, or you think you're earning your way to heaven, you're not free. The obligation is not freedom. Tradition is not freedom. Living your parent\u2019s religion is not freedom. That's not Christianity. Christianity must be personal. Unfortunately, a lot of Christian denominations are traditional, meaning, you're only Christian or Catholic because your parents are certain Christian denominations or Catholic. You didn't choose it. In the essence of Christianity, if you read the Bible is that Jesus said choose me. Have a relationship with me. In other words, it's not the label, not the building, not the group of people, and it\u2019s not what people say. It's what you choose to absorb from God's word. It\u2019s a relationship. That's what makes it real and people who operate at that level or allow Jesus to enter their hearts and transform them, become the best missionaries. Let's put it this way, if you are a liar and a thief and people see that you're now very gracious, helpful, loving, you don't lie, you tell the truth, you sacrifice yourself for others, and put others before you, they can't help but pay attention. Your past becomes an advertisement for the transformation that you've gone through. It's like seeing somebody who used to be an alcoholic now living a sober life and becoming a pillar of society. That's how you convert. At the end of the day, your life is the only Bible a lot of people ever get to read. At that level, many people are converted. In our day and age, there are less and less people converted through dogma and bible-thumping. The truth is people would first like to know that you care before they care about what you know. That's how it works. That's the essence of true conversion but for this to happen, you have to go through a profound change. It's not just about getting dunked in the water or reciting some sort of ritual words. Those are meaningless. Those are just symbols. Those are outward manifestations and what's important is what's going on inside your heart and that means surrender. This means killing your old self. To sum it up, it's all about Jesus saying to you, \u2018go kill yourself.\u2019 What do you love more, possessions, fame, reputation, or Jesus? If this sounds familiar, it should, because this is what Jesus basically said to the rich young ruler who said, \u2018Jesus, how can I be your follower? Jesus said, \u2018give up everything you own.\u2019 To somebody who is very covetous or greedy, that is suicide and that's precisely what Jesus is saying. Maybe you're not big into material things. Maybe you're big into reputation. That's what Jesus would say, kill yourself, turn your back on that reputation, and follow me. If you're big on your family, Jesus would say the same thing. Jesus said, \u2018I have come with a sword. I would separate mother from daughter and father from son.\u2019 The truth does that. That great book sums this up is EA Cruz\u2019s Jesus says go kill yourself. It\u2019s a very pungent book and it's not for spiritual lightweight. If you don't like unpleasant truths about traditional Christianity and what it means to have a relationship with Jesus, this book might hurt your feelings. But sometimes the truth upsets us before it sets us free. ",
