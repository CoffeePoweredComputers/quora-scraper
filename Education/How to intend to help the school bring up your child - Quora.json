            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question that you pose. I say this because, as a teacher, while I believe it is our job to help mold them into upstanding young men and women, the parent in me says that it\u2019s my job to bring up my children and help them to become well adjusted, law abiding, functioning members of society. Proverbs 22:6 touches on this topic in a pretty straightforward way saying :Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. Now, at first glance, one might think that this is geared toward teachers, but I honestly think this verse is telling parents that it\u2019s your job to bring up your children. That being said, I do believe the school in general has a role in assisting parents, but to answer your original question, my intention as a parent in bringing up my children is by being a good parent, teaching them right from wrong, and hoping and praying that it carries over into their school life and every other aspect of their lives.

            "answer_text": "\u201cBeen There Done This\u201d My daughter is currently 23 years of age I became involved in her school during the elementary and junior high school terms by way of PTA, parent and teacher meetings, events at the school and just made myself accessible during the course of her younger years. I was fortunate to be a stay at home mom or shall I say, \u201cI decided to become one\u201d. Although, you definitely don\u2019t have to be one to make a great impact upon your child\u2019s grade school years and community flexible hours definitely make a difference. ",

            "answer_text": "I know my kids will spend a lot of time at school, and will learn a lot there from teachers as well as friends. That can be a good thing, but I know I also need to keep in communication with my kids about what they learn. I can\u2019t send them off and never check up on what the school is teaching them. I plan on being as involved as I can to not only help, but also know what is going on in their lives. I want them to always feel like no matter what they are going through they can always talk to me and their dad. ",
