            "answer_text": "Amity does offer a semester abroad program where they send you off to dubai/singapore/london depending on your course and feasibility. They would send you off abroad for about 45 days near the end of semester and your assessment would be based on what you did abroad instead of  an end-semester exam. You can opt for this in more than one semester. Another program amity has to offer is a 3continent program where the last semester of your course will be spent in all the three countries.  This will cost about double of the normal program. Hope this answers your query.  ",

Having spoken to students who've been a part of this program I can assuredly say that they not only experienced diversity in culture but the diversity in study patterns. The concept of professional life was very well encountered by the students. 3 continents, ASIA, NORTH AMERICA, and EUROPE, are three major continents of the world, you don't just get to spend an entire semester in any of these continents you also get to have a bite of their lifestyle and working worlds. You get to gauge the sort of competition the world's working on. And the way I see it, that's what matters the most. ",
