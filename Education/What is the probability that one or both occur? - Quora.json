            "answer_text": "For example, say you roll dice and want to know the probability that both dice land on 6. You find this by using the equation: [math]P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)[/math] So in this case the probability of rolling a 6 on the first die is [math]1/6[/math] (only one 6 exists on a six-sided die) which applies also to the second die. Therefore probability of both events occurring using our equation above is: [math]1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36[/math] Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Suppose A and B are any two events. One or both occur means any one of the following: A occurs, B does not occurA does not occur, B occursBoth A and B occurs.Clearly, one or both occur is clearly the event AUB. Thus required probability is given by, P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB). ",
