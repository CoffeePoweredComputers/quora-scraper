            "answer_text": "I graduated in B.E(Mechanical) from JNNCE in 2016, Here i would like to mention ; pros : The mechanical department have THE BEST PROFESSORS ever, as some of them have Phd\u2019s in their own fields and some are IIT graduates, could get the best technical stuff academic wise and as well as project wise,Boys hostels are with in campus and are well maintained, there is an Annapoorna Mess - we got the best quality food in our time, unlimited rotis, sabji, dal, rice, curd, sweet etc for lunch and dinner, breakfast 7 varieties for 7 days a week,There is a District Bio Fuel Demonstration and Information Center located inside the campus which led by convener Prof Dr L.K.Sreepathi, who also runs chirantana club and is quite rare in any other engineering colleges,Huge Library with all kinds of books collection, Gym with instructor, badminton court, auditoriums, Football ground, basket ball ground etc are present within 50acre campusThere\u2019s a cricket ground inside campus - ranji cricket matches and international test cricket matches were held in our time,All professors working here had more than 30+ years of experience and there are young lecturers too with best project execution knowledge,This is very old engineering college in shivamogga, Established in 1980 by NES, the College is affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi, there are other engineering colleges as well in the district which got recently started few years ago,Cons : Less percentage of students gets placed here,Core companies visit very rare for mechanical and civil students, most of themselves need to get jobs offcampus,Less concerned with Pre-Placement training and Skill development training,They will not show any kind of interest in getting their students an opportunity for internships,Not to mention their names we got worst Principal and useless placement officer ever in our time,Suggestion for organisation : Get the contacts of the persons who are working in core sectors and let them convey the skills/knowledge that students should have to get in to core companies or supplier companies,If you are unable to place them then try getting them the ideas / skills / internship opportunists so that they themselves will tend to search jobs with confidence,Treat the company officials when they visit, i heard that so many companies stopped visiting because of not treating them properly,You have never really lived until you have done something for someone who can never repay you.",

Note;JNNCE has one of the best campus and infrastructure in Shivamogga. ",
