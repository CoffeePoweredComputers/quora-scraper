            "answer_text": "Good question, as much as a part of me has the reaction of \"ugh, this topic\" whenever it is asked. There's no simple answer, and it depends a lot on what industry you're in, whether it's expanding or contracting, and various economic variables that change every year. The answer is, in general, \"quite a lot\". Also, the network and on-campus recruiting matter a lot more than general prestige (e.g. USN&WR ranking) and those are quite variable depending on industry and subfield. Let's take startups and VC. Yale isn't going to take you, in that world, further than the University of Connecticut. On the other hand, Stanford will take you further than Harvard or MIT, despite being less prestigious and less selective, just as NYU will give you a better shot at Wall Street than the University of Chicago. Geography and history are big factors, since (again) it's about the network rather than the reputation of school. Everyone intelligent knows that the differences in quality (program or students) among the top ~100 colleges are insignificant, but the differences in terms of powerful networks are substantial.  I don't know that it's harder to get hired from a \"non-target\" school. I'm not sure that it is. The ugly fact, though, is that the kind of jobs available is inferior, even within the same company. Someone's going to have to get stuck on the loser project, and it's not likely to be the one hired out of Harvard. In many companies, I've heard people talk about hiring \"state school grads\" for the less desirable projects. Once you're 30 or so, it stops mattering directly. The advantage that comes out of a strong college network can be lifelong, but the \"get-out-of-jail-free card\" aspect of an elite degree stops working after about 10 years. If you're from an elite school and haven't made much of yourself, people start to see you as pathetic, and wonder what happened. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to think it made little difference but then I saw how individuals from brand name schools had significantly more job offers than I received. Granted I wasn't the best student but no job ever asked me about my GPA.  I was a bio major and when o graduated in 2001 there was little work for a recent college grad with a degree but little other immediately marketable skills.   My wife, who graduated from university of Michigan with a history degree in 1999 was able to get a job six months before she graduated. She then went on to get an MBA from Columbia University where recruiters interviewed and hired her for a job in corporate banking six months before she graduated. Like it or not the white collar jobs are very closely aligned with the top name schools.   It's a silly system because you close off a lot of potentially talented individuals but the reality is that if you get into a top 20-30 school you will have significantly more doors open to you all else being equal. Other factors matter of course; the job market when you graduate, your skill set upon graduating, your network...  I don't want to minimize the importance of any of these things.  That being said degrees are ultimately about the signal they give... You pay for your signal and you get greater value out of a brand name. ",

            "answer_text": "Your college's name can only land you with an interview. Impressing the interviewers and getting the job is upon you. Besides the name of the institution (which will have 10 percent weightage roughly), the recruiters look for skills, experience and the commitment level of an individual.    For example: Person A with a renowned institution's degree applies for a project management (PM) trainee's position. He possesses the knowledge, but not much experience in PM. Whereas person B, who applies for the same position, has substantial experience in PM, but doesn't have a degree from a renowned institution (holds a degree, nevertheless).  Whom do you think the employers will prefer? Person B is most likely to get the job because he has the relevant skill set, experience and a degree.  You will only get hired when you build a relevant skill set and gain a lot experience in the field you wish to take as your career. Participating in volunteer services, summer internships and part-time jobs is a good way to hone your hard/soft skills and find your niche.    ",

Part of that is good colleges have strong alumni networks who like to hire from their alma mater and career services departments who help coach the students. I went to a fairly prestigious regional school and it was critical in securing my engineering internship, first engineering job, and current job.  I likely would have been fine at another school, but career services and the alumni network were the keys to getting to interview for me. ",
