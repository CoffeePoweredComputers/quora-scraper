There is belief that in destroying something it will be replaced however that is not without consequence. This is often called destabilization which is performed by \u201cunstable people\u201d. The child breaking last year\u2018s toys before the current holiday tradition is potentially losing the chance of getting another years bounty. The Apex experience of this phenomenon is a large hadron collider.  I remember once Michio Kaku said in a Science Channel documentary that scientists love to blow things up to see what they are made of. This has actually been a personal experience with (infringed upon) me and the world of media and technology with the incorporation of euphemism and symbolism. I think Stephen Hawking often spoke pure parallels of me. There is a Trinity of science, government and people. More often used for crowd control (pandemics are an example ) than its own benefit that could be expressed in a more enlightened society. Due to popularity it is exercised as a trilogy. In a lifetime process of revealing a Reciprocating ebb and flow each sector adds to the dialogue that is displayed in two activated by the third being people. The creator wants his efforts to be in alignment and without the earth being a certain distance from the sun there is not any maintenance of life on this planet. I am thankful to the Quora platform because it has become therapy and an avenue to tell my story to people that will listen and hopefully understand. In living a life of distance within sight of others I have made opportunity to study and express. I enjoy my imperfection and the ability to seek and see the cause of pain in Society and myself with an ongoing recommendation of remedy and pleasant surprise.

            "answer_text": "I think it is the human condition; humans can build and destroy. This can be evidenced by plotting the history of mankind and the never-ending stream of wars and conflicts, interspersed with the need to build and create beautiful towns and cities. If you need a theory to support this apparent human dichotomy look no further than the work of Freud. He postulated the idea of the \u2018ego\u2019 the \u2018id\u2019 and the \u2018super ego\u2019. The id self is geared to out baser instincts such as pleasure, sex and aggression, whereas the super ego provides our inner voice of moral judgement, preventing our baser instincts from taking over. Some of his other work (Beyond the Pleasure Principle) also focused on the ideas of a \u2018life instinct\u2019 and a \u2018death instinct\u2019. The life instinct is vital for sustaining life and the continuation of the species, and behaviours that bolster such things as well-being, social cooperation and living in harmony. He set life instinct in opposition to \u2018death instinct\u2019, which he said was a self-destructive tendency in all of us. If we agree that Freud\u2019s ideas are valid then this might explain the reasons why students prefer to destroy rather than create within the classroom. But I think it may be something more immediate than that. Maybe the students are aggressive because they feel their learning needs are not being met. They may be pushing the boundaries of the teacher\u2019s authority. Students may also be testing the extent of their power over the environment and the things in it. ",
