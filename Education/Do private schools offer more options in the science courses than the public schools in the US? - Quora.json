            "answer_text": "It utterly depends on the schools. Some public schools don\u2019t have good science programs. Others have excellent science programs. There is a school known as Bronx Scientific in New York that I believe still has an entrance exam and has strong emphasis on the sciences. I know of a high school in my area that is across the street from the local Intel campus and has excellent facilities in all departments, including science. A small school in a rural area might have fewer than 100 students, so one teacher might have to teach all science subjects and few people have enough of a background in chemistry, biology, earth sciences and physics to do a good job of teaching all of them and fewer of those want to teach high school in the middle of nowhere. Likewise, there are some private schools with excellent science programs, and others that don\u2019t teach science at all. Some schools that are run by creationist churches cannot teach any science that contradicts the Bible, which leaves out large areas of the subject. There are 320 million people in America spread over nearly 10 million square kilometers. There is going to be a lot of variation in the schools in different areas. There are counties with thousands of people per square km and other counties with less than one person per square km. The per capita GDP per state ranges from over $85,000 in New York to under $38,000 in Mississippi and if you could break it down by county, the differences would be even more extreme. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, Maybe, but probably not. A S.T.E.M. Magnet School will offer more science courses than any ordinary public or private setting. Here\u2019s the deal, because every U.S. state is responsible for supporting its public schools, and every district operates on a budget that reflects local property values, class offerings vary greatly. In addition to basic Earth Science, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics, a high school in a wealthy district may also offer Horticulture, Botany, Physiology, Microbiology, and Geology. Depending on its endowment, tuition, and focus, a private school may have similar advantages or restrictions. Best regards, AJG. ",

            "answer_text": "It's hard to know. There are all sorts of private schools, by no means monolithic. At a guess, private schools with a conservative religious affiliation might offer less. Very expensive, exclusive schools may offer more. It's worth noting that large public school systerms (such as in cities), or consortiums of public school systems, or even states often have specialized, competitive-enrollment high schools with a focus on science or STEM.

            "answer_text": "The courses offered often have more to do with the number of students that go to the school. The more students means two things. The school will have more staff and a greater chance of having staff qualified to teach more advanced classes and also a greater chance that enough students will take the advanced class to allow it to run. Most schools will not run a class that only has a few students in it. ",

You might find specialty high schools - charter, public or private - that offer more science classes than a mainstream high school experience.But it can't be said that private schools 'offer more options in science courses' just because they're private schools - ",
