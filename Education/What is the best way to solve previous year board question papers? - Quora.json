While solving please use a pen and paper because at times it just happens that on seeing a solution we feel we will be able to do it but that is not the case,so writing down will ensure that you do not miss any of the steps.

            "answer_text": "HELLO, As we all know that before giving exams we go through the previous year sample papers but the reason behind this in my opinion is previous year board question papers and sample papers helps us to know the exam format and paper pattern.ALSO, we get the knowledge about the changes and the modifications done this year as compared to last year.so we must solve question papers like we are giving exams in the examination hall,as according to the exam time format .this will help you to increase your speed and you can evaluate that what you are going to do in exams too.That you have covered up the whole syllabus or not.previous year questions are also helpful to get important questions, (jaisa ki students teachers se class mein tick lagvate hain ;-p) because mostly questions are repeated time to timeBest wishes!
