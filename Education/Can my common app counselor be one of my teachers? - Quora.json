            "answer_text": "Here is what the Common App says about \u201cno counselor\u201d situation: No counselor If there is no counselor at your school, you may list your principal or other school official, international or domestic, who has overseen your academic progress. You will also be required to invite this person to complete the School Report on the Recommenders & FERPA section located on the My Colleges tab. Ask at the school office who can submit the school report form for your application. If they never did it before, there are detailed instructions for counselors and recommenders on the Common App website Understanding Counselor Forms and they can also ask their questions using Recommender Solutions Center Step 1: Select a Category. Is your teacher just a teacher, or does she/he also have some administrative role in your school - like vice-principal or director of curriculum, for example? I think this supporting material is supposed to come from a person who is authorized to submit documents on behalf of the school and has access to your full records. ",

            "answer_text": "It should be your guidance counselor because they have administrative access to things like your transcript that teachers do not. They can take general letters of recommendation and certify them to multiple schools that do not subscribe to the Common App or similar services. If you do not know your counselor, get to know them quickly. They have a vested interest in your post-secondary future and are full of experience. I hope this helps. Good luck! ",
