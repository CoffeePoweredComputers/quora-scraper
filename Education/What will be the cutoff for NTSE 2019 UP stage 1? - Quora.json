            "answer_text": "Cutoff of NTSE UP 2019 depends on a number of factors, some of the important one's being mentioned below: This year questions increased from 150 to 200. Increased 50 questions in MAT section. MAT section was easy except 8 questions, which was confusing and I expect 90 to 92 questions will be rightly attempted by a student having decent preparation. Maths section have three bonus, question no. 181,182,191. Rest 17 questions are doable. I expect 17 questions will be rightly attempted by a student having decent preparation. Physics section has 13 questions and 1 question was confusing so 12 questions were easy to score. Chemistry section has 13 questions and 2 questions are confusing so 11 questions were easy to score.

            "answer_text": "The paper was extremely easy! It's because I did not prepare for it at all and was still able to do a major part of the paper. The GMAT section as well as Maths was the most scoring part . Social sciences would have been tough for someone who had not prepared for it thoroughly (including me) . I lost maximum marks in that section. Sciences\u2019 difficulty level was moderate. So I am expecting the cut off to be betweem 160 to 170 (Not less than that ) It's what some of my friends (who had been preparing for it very hard) think. All The best forthe results! ",
