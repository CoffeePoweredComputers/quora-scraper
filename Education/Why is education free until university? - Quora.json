            "answer_text": "</start rant> I agree with sentiments here. Why should EVERYONE\u2019s taxes go up for the select adults that go to college? Those that choose alternate routes get punished? What if you graduated from college, you have to pay a graduate tax? A tax that because you graduated you have to pay more to the state irrespective of the job you hold? Back in my Grandpa\u2019s day people typically stopped at 8th grade and were able to perform their duties until retirement. My question is what has dramatically changed? Technology? Kids these days run computers and technology much better than their parents do. I think having an Bachelor\u2019s to get into an administrative assistant job is OVERKILL. Also, associate\u2019s degrees are considered extended high school. Where are the middle-skills? So my other question is: Why the BA/BS? Why is 4-years the magical amount of time to be competent? Lastly, it\u2019s a slippery slope. If high school couldn\u2019t teach the skills needed, how does college change that? Employers are saying college grads are lacking now\u2026. Soon a Master\u2019s for janitorial work? I think we need to re-haul the structure. My proposal? Bring back the high school diploma (bring it back to a status of envy)\u2026 if tax money is spent on that, we aren\u2019t getting our money\u2019s worth because we have to go to college and pay that too. Why isn\u2019t the high school diploma \u201cvalued\u201d? It\u2019s beyond me. It opens up about a quarter of jobs, non-HS-grads get\u2026 We graduate almost 90% of high schoolers\u2026 That shouldn\u2019t be the case\u2026 it\u2019s way too easy to graduate. They are basically handing out diplomas. </end rant> ",

            "answer_text": "It was considered at the time that a high school education was the knowledge level needed for a person to obtain a sufficiently well paying job to Become self supporting. Of course, at the time, high school was still focused on teaching a competent level of reading, writing, mathematics, and knowledge of history, geography, literature, science, and civics, and a basic level of critical thinking. Not any more. That was before Leftist politicians dumbed down the curriculum so that illegal aliens who don\u2019t even speak English can graduate, and as a result high schools now graduate children so illiterate that some cannot even read their own diplomas. The business world has long realized that a high school education no longer means proficiency in basic mathematics, or literacy in English, or a correct understanding of American history or Civics. But the children are now extremely well indoctrinated in Identity Politics, Leftist ideology, love of Socialism, and attitudes that everything they don\u2019t like is racist, and that protesting gets them anything they want. They have no critical thinking skills, but are conditioned to get their beliefs and attitudes from social media not factual learning, and \u201cCancel Culture\u201d is their automatic response to anyone who expresses ideas they have been told are not \u201cpolitically correct\u201d. Unfortunately, all this makes them very poor candidates for employment in most businesses, especially small businesses that value initiative, reliability, diligence, problem solving, diplomacy, and basic reading and mathematics. Kids at cashier stations cannot even make change without the register telling them the right amount. Compared to students a few decades ago, they are generally far less educated but far more indoctrinated. That is what \u201cfree secondary education\u201c, under government control, has created. Higher education is suffering similar politicization and deterioration. Courses like \u201cWestern Civilization\u201d and genuine American History are being discarded in favor of useless or outright racist courses in \u201cCritical Race Theory\u201d or \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d, and degrees are being conferred in contrived, useless \u201cmajors\u201d like \u201cGender Studies\u201d or \u201cLesbian Dance Theory\u201d. Millions of graduates now find themselves unqualified for any employment more demanding than flipping burgers, while burdened with tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars of school loans. Making this dumbed down college experience \u201cfree\u201d would do nothing to restore the quality of higher education or add an iota of critical thinking to the curriculum, but would shift a massive burden of hundreds of billions of largely wasted money directly onto taxpayers who do not deserve to be punished for the debacle of greed, racism, and miseducation being inflicted on millions of our young people by Leftist ideologues in academia. Not everyone is academically capable of succeeding at college even at these dumbed down levels. 40% of entrants to four year colleges fail to graduate even after six years running up student debt, and businesses have likewise clearly rejected many college degrees as useless for employment. It would be a disaster to suggest that anyone has a right to go to college for free, and shuck the cost onto taxpayers. Even in European countries that are often raised as examples, what they do and the limited availability, high testing standards, and austere \u201ccollege exoerience\u201d is not at all what Americans have come to expect or accept, even if it were supposedly \u201cfree\u201d.
