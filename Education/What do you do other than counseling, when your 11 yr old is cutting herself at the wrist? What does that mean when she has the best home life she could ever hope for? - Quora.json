            "answer_text": "Your perception that she has the best home life she could hope may not be her reality. She may be having difficulties socially, at school or with academically. Even coming into puberty could be a stressor. Her internal experiences is way beyond what you see on the surface, and are represented in those cuts. Cutting quickly becomes a strong compulsion. It's very nature is almost like a drug. In reaction to pain our bodies release endorphins that are calming. That relief is associated with the action easily. She needs a substitute that serves that purpose. Perhaps there was something when she was younger that was calming. Use that. Have her snap a rubberband on her wrist or crush ice in her hands. Encourage other activities --yoga, coloring, knitting, arts, writing, etc\u2026 --that eventually can effectively diffuse anxiety. Do those things together with her. Meanwhile try and discover what the stressors are in the other areas of her life that's driving the compulsion. Get a peek into her internal experience. Look objectively at what home is like. It may not be as ideal as you think. Help her treat her cuts, but don't make them seem like the reason she's being taken care of --that will also reinforce the action. You started off your question with, \u2018other than counseling'. I hope this means you're seeking this already. Intervention is crucial. This is a serious issue and requires professional help. ",

            "answer_text": "For your first question: What do you do other than conceling, when your 11 yr old is cutting herself at the wrist. Let her know that you are there for her should she ever need to talk. And when she comes to talk, really listen to her. Don't try and solve her problems or tell her that her concerns are unimportant, to her they are important. Allow her to have your undivided attention and the chance to talk without interruption. That being said, don't force her to talk to you either. When she comes and says that she wants to cut right now, or did 5 minutes/hours/days ago, do not get angry at her. Be great full that she is coming to you for help. If you get mad, she won't come to you next time and that could have devistating consquences. Instead thank her for speaking up. Help her stop the bleeding, if it means 911, call. Tell her you love her. Tell her that when she self harms, that it worries you. If she has a problem that you can solve, that she wants you to help solve try. Maybe she feels pressure to be perfect. Maybe her schedule is too full to allow free time, maybe her classmates are picking in her and a fresh start at a new school would help her. Yes get her help. Don't prod her or her therapist for details on what she says during her meetings. Get help for you to. I imagine you need someone to talk to as well. Someone who can help you see that you have done nothing wrong, and how you can best help your daughter. For your second question: What does that mean when she has the best home life she could ever hope for? Usually when people self harm it is because they feel that the rest of their lives are out of control. This is something, the one thing, they CAN control. What you feel is the best possible home life may not be for her. There maybe something going on that you are unaware of: abuse, pressure to perform, overly busy schedule, over protective/over bearing parents, lack of attention from parents. All of these things and more could be hidden from your view and so disturbing her \u201cperfect\u201d world. The most important thing is to be there for your daughter when she needs you. Be there and try your best to remain calm and nonjudgmental. ",
