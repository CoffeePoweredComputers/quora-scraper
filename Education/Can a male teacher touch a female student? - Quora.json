            "answer_text": "Of course he can, provided he has good intentions. Nowadays so many bad news has been coming up regarding molesting, blackmailing, and even rape. As a result, parents are now very much worried about the \u201cbad touch\u201d and a little girl child has to learn about the said inappropriate touches from their mother and other female members of the family and from their female class teachers also. The worst thing is that the girl child is not even secure at their homes. 30% of the total cases of child abuse have been made by their nearer ones, like brothers, uncles, cousins.[1] Around 60% are neighbors, friends of the family, etc. This is a worldwide problem and with the advancement of technology, the problem is increasing. The innovations of various socio-scientific fields have reduced the muscular movement as well as good psychological vibrations. It has increased vulgarism, unlawful activities, and intolerance. We have to take innovations in our strides but we have to innovate new ways of women empowerment within the society to minimize the oppression against the girl child. To achieve this a teacher should come forward first. It is said that a teacher is next to GOD and he should carry out his responsibilities with the utmost care and honesty. At the end of the day, a teacher is also a father. Footnotes[1] Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

My male teacher played with one of his female students and he didn\u2019t get in trouble because everybody and her knows that he isn\u2019t a bad person and he\u2019s just goofy. Though it depends on the situation when you\u2019re gonna touch her like if it\u2019s out of nowhere she might take it creepy. If y\u2019all don\u2019t know each other on the level to be playfully hitting each other or any other things I think it\u2019s best to not exactly touch her lol my school is pretty small so students and teachers all know each other and on that comfort level to be touching each other (in a none sexual way) to me it\u2019s probably best not to touch her to avoid any assumptions:) ",

            "answer_text": "Please no, some students might feel you're taking advantage or being a little touchy here and there. If a female student touched you, let them (as much as it is appropriate), then distance yourself a bit. They'll get body signals \u201cOh Sir is finding it inappropriate\u201d. But sometimes even this is weird for other students seeing the situation, even when a girl is just too close, diving over the teacher\u2019s desk etc. with her body when asking a question. I even saw a student at the back gave weird looks to her classmate like \u201chey what are you doing?\u201d. You don't want rumors to fly around the campus. Be a father figure to them since they look up to you, and please as a male teacher\u2026. Hands off! ",

            "answer_text": "The tragedy is that it\u2019s a massive risk. My only regret as a teacher was being confronted with a Year 12 student who was in tears over a close friend committing suicide. I got along well with her, and her friend, I taught him too, and it was the first I\u2019d heard. We were standing in the open yard, at the start of school on a Monday. The human thing to do would have been to hug her. Instead, I protected myself and stood awkwardly and asked if she needed me to get someone. Any female staff member would have had no hesitation. How do we move forward for women when we confine men to showing no compassion and leaving it to female staff only. Like I said \u2026 it\u2019s a tragedy of these times. ",
