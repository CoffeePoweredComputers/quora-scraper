            "answer_text": "Marks scored by A = 20 + B \u2014\u2014(i) Marks scored by B = (100 - 5)% of A.= 95% of A or marks scored by B = 0.95A \u2014\u2014(ii) Substituting 0.95 A for B in (i), we get Marks scored by A = 20+ 0.95A or A - 0.95A = 20 or 0.05 A = 20 or A = 400 Substituting the value of A in (i), we get 400 = 20 + B or B = 400\u201320 or B = 380 Thus the marks scored by B are 380 This question can be solved in another way also as under : - B has scored 20 marks less than A which is 5% less than what A has scored. This means that B has scored 95% of what A has scored. Also it means that 20 marks is 5% of what A has scored. So, now 5% marks means = 20 marks or 1% marks means = 20/5 marks = 4 marks Thus 95% marks mean = 4 x 95 marks = 380 marks Thus the marks scored by B are 380 Ans ",
