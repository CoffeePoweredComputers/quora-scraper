            "answer_text": "My answers aren\u2019t for high school in particular but college, so here were my strategies: Find a quiet place (or somewhere you won\u2019t be disturbed). Personally, I would work in the Commons (cafeteria) at 8 or 9 am, when there were few people there. I found that the earlier I woke up and got to campus, the more space I would have and the quieter it would be.Talk to your teachers (or professors. They have office hours for a reason). I majored in English and Geography, which may be easier majors, but I spent an inordinate amount of time doing readings and papers on how these two very different disciplines could go together.Reward yourself for a certain amount of time spent studying (e.g. I spent 45 min. studying, here\u2019s a 5 minute break). I love reading, so I used this a lot. You may want to use this one-study for a certain amount of time, and spend x amount of minutes on your game(s).Study smarter not harder (find ways to help you learn and memorize the material rather than cramming it into your head). Flashcards, study groups, online chats with your team (if working on a group project) will help.Get a planner. Seriously, it\u2019s the best thing to ever happen. Yes, you can write it into your phone, but what if you forget to add something in? Best 2017 Planners, Notebooks, Calendars (Blue Sky) makes some really good planners, and you can create your own. Passion Planner and bloom daily planners all have some fairly cheap planners. If you\u2019re looking for more: http://www.buzzfeed.com/farrahpenn/gorgeous-planners-that-will-help-you-live-your-best-life?utm_term=.nm3axldz9#.axBGK5EDw has some other options.There\u2019s an app called Forest, which basically locks your phone for the amount of time you set it so you can\u2019t use it. For example, if you lock your phone for 80 minutes, you can\u2019t use it for 80 minutes. At the end of the 80 minutes, you\u2019ve planted a tree. There\u2019s a Chrome extension called Citrus, which works the same way as Forest-you block websites for a certain amount of time, and at the end of the time you can use those websites again.",

People just do not go from straight A\u2019s to failing and suicidal just due to a single recreational activity. Since you already know the answer, I will respond with the obvious. You need to focus on your schoolwork and play as a secondary activity. Just like all of the rest of us. So, limit yourself to 30 or 60 minutes of gaming a day. When your grades are back up, try 1 to 2 hours of gaming. Make sure you do all your homework and reading BEFORE you start playing. I think you will find that you have plenty of time for school and play. You just need to re-prioritize. As an aside \u2026 talk to your folks about your grades. And how you plan to address the slide. They may punish you, but that will probably play right into the new priority scheme. -Doug ",

That aside, I balance gaming and straight As easily. It\u2019s just a matter of priorities. Once you\u2019ve gotten your studying out of the way, and your homework and exams are taken care of, then you can game. That\u2019s literally it. Sometimes, when I am swamped with work, I end up not having time to game some nights. That\u2019s fine. No big deal. I\u2019m mature enough to understand my priorities. Obviously, all this comes with proper studying, paying attention in class, taking good notes, and asking for help when you need it. But, you already knew that, and you should be taking steps to ensure that everything happens accordingly. Once again, if you are pressed for time, think: \u201cIs all my homework done? Am I prepared for tomorrow\u2019s exam? Is all that taken care of? If so, do I have some spare time left before I go to bed? Cool! Let\u2019s fire up the Xbox!\u201d That\u2019s all. ",

I\u2019m no expert but it sounds like you need serious help. It sounds like gaming is taking up a whole lot of your time, so much that you cannot do school work. I wonder if you\u2019re getting enough sleep, eating well, etc. You need to talk to a trusted adult immediately. Is there a teacher, counselor, school nurse, family member, clergy member you can talk to? Although you ask in your question about balancing gaming and school work, there\u2019s much more at stake here\u2014your wellbeing, your physical health, your mental health. This cannot be answered in a Quora post. Please get help. Know that I am concerned, and wish you well. ",

However, if you\u2019re in year 11/12 then you seriously need to focus only on your grades because everything you do in those 2 years all count to your final examination(The HSC) which is a very scary place to be if you have no idea what\u2019s going on in school.

You will have to balance things the rest of your life, so starting to learn how now will only help you the rest of your life. We all have interests that intrude on the things we \u201cmust\u201d do. Yours is gaming right now. So, it will take self-discipline and practice. First, you need to be going to all your classes and do all the work in all your classes. If you need help with this, let the teacher or your counselor know. They will be happy to help \u2014 they want you to succeed. Do all of your homework first, every day, before you start to game. This will be hard, but you can do it! Second, make sure you are taking care of you. Eat healthy food. Get regular exercise; and PE class does not count. Even if it means walking around the block once each day. It will only take you 10\u201315 minutes, and you can spare that from your gaming. You need to be getting enough rest. Turn everything off at 10:00 each school night. Everything. Computers, phones, gaming consoles, lights \u2014 everything. It will be hard at first. You will be creating new habits and getting rid of old ones, and that is always hard. Keep your goal in mind: you want to improve your grades. You want to graduate high school, and you can\u2019t do that with F\u2019s. You CAN do this. If you got all A\u2019s before you will be able to get back into the swing of things.

People like me and you are successful in low level classes without the need to study. But as you go for a higher class (especially in high school) it starts to challenge your intelligence. And you would have accumulated some bad skills or lacks of knowledge in some areas. So if you care about your grades, you should now work on identifying where you are getting worse and start studying. At first you may leave gaming for some week or two. Now once you are on the same foot as the class level. I would advise giving 2 hrs to studying and then 30 min on games (or 4 hrs and 1hr, depending on the games you play, and you ability to focus) and you do this as much as you want. Set study goals, and when you achieve them, give yourself a good time on a game you like. You should try different strategies until you get the grades you want, there is no general time schedule. Everything is subjective and personal. GLHF :) ",

Before 9 pm, you do not touch your game. Before 9 pm, you do not think about your game. Before 9 pm, your game does not exist. Even if you have finished your tasks before 9 pm, you do not open that game until 9 pm. Find something else to do. Read a book, play the guitar, doesn\u2019t matter. You only get to play after 9 pm. Hope that works out for you. ",

It can be difficult sometimes to break away and it\u2019s much easier to procrastinate and do everything at the last minute, but I\u2019ve learned over time that this is not a good strategy. You have to plan things out in advance and it will become much easier (if you want, even make a physical check-list of the things you need to do. It can be very satisfying to strike things off of a list). Good luck! ",
