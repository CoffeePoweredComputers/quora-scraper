            "answer_text": "According to me there's nothing like an average student. Every one is different from each other. You might be good at some things while others may be not. So first identify your strength and weaknesses and according to that choose what you want to do. You will always remain an average if you do things you are not good at, or maybe below average. There are options available for each field of interest. Choose one for yourself. But choose wisely. You will not remain an average Hope this helps. ",
