            "answer_text": "I read Karen's answer and I'm not sure that's true. I knew a few vet students at Texas A&M that were not from Texas. Also, I have a friend that went to vet school out of the country. But maybe I'm missing something. I'm not saying Karen is inaccurate, just that I thought it was a bit different. Anyhow, some great schools in the US are Cal- Davis, Cornell, Pennsylvania and Texas A&M. I'm only naming US schools bc of my assumptions which I will explain shortly. Now, big assumption bc I'm a little biased. I would attend Texas A&M and stay in Texas. Here is why. Many people in Texas own a ton of pets. There are a ton of vet clinics so competition is a real thing. Yet, I know many vets that do quite well. Land is cheap, there's no state income tax, and sick pets are plentiful. I also assume that there is more business in the US bc of the same assumption about Texas. People just own many more pets than in other countries. Now, I was premed/prevet for my undergrad at Texas A&M. The curriculum is challenging. I went a different way for grad school but my masters was involved with the vet school. That vet school is very challenging. If Karen's answer was true then none of this matters. I'd be interested to know. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t actually get much choice in what veterinary school you attend, unless you gain residency in the state/country for that school. For example, if you are from NY state (as I was), you will only be considered by Cornell, because your state has a veterinary school (there are less than 30 accredited schools in the US). If you want to got to the schools in other countries, you need to be a resident of that country. The only schools that don\u2019t limit their students by region are the for profit schools, such as Ross, and they will make you pay through the nose, and you still have to go to one of the state side schools or country schools to get your degree. That said, most of the schools in the Western nations are excellent, regardless of rank. I would happily have attended the schools in Great Britain, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, etc. I\u2019ve worked with veterinarians from those countries and they are brilliant. ",
