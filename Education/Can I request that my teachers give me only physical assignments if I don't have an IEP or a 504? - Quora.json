            "answer_text": "Hi Kaylee! I\u2019m a middle school teacher currently teaching all-online courses. I\u2019ve had students ask for paper work during this time. School policy is to tell them no. Your school may well have a similar policy. I\u2019m also a former lawyer, so let\u2019s examine this less as a student and more as a lawyer. It\u2019s natural in this situation to look at what you want, and assume the adults in your schooling life exist to take care of you. But negotiation is much more successful when you look at what the other side wants. So let\u2019s look at this from their perspective, like a lawyer would. Let\u2019s assume that your teachers want you to succeed in school. I\u2019ve never met a teacher who didn\u2019t, although I\u2019m sure they exist. Let\u2019s also assume the worst case scenario: your school has a policy against giving kids paper work so long as they\u2019re technologically able to do the work online. Why would they have such a policy? You\u2019ll never get anywhere in negotiation unless you understand the problem your opposing party is trying to solve. In this case: as you probably know, many teachers are stressed as hell right now. Every student who needs paper assignments stresses them more: it\u2019s extra work they have to do, to create the paper assignment, get it to you, remember that you have it, get it back from you, grade it. Even if this doesn\u2019t stress your particular teachers, odds are very good that it would stress other teachers in the school, and the administration has to protect those teachers, not just yours. That\u2019s almost certainly one of the main reasons the [hypothetical] policy against making paper work exceptions exists. Once word gets around that Ms. So-and-So is making exceptions for paper work, then other students start clamoring for it, and next thing you know the teachers are being deluged with requests.[1] Okay. So let\u2019s go back to your teacher. What does s/he want? For you to become an educated person.For you to show evidence of your education (\u201cmastery,\u201d in teacher speak, though that word always makes me throw up a little in my mouth).Not to piss off school administration.Not to do extra work for a student\u2019s preferences.That last one might or might not offend you a little bit, so let me explain. I didn\u2019t take an 80% pay cut to switch careers just so I could, like, bully kids \u2026 but I\u2019m also not being paid to coddle every little student preference. Neither would I want to, because I did take an 80% pay cut to help young people grow up into grown-ass educated adults who can navigate the world even when it doesn\u2019t order itself the way they want. I venture to say that most teachers would agree with those sentiments, whether they took an 80% pay cut to teach or not. The question before you is this: how can you propose to your teacher a plan that will meet all of their wants, while also allowing you to do paper work? I don\u2019t know exactly what your online learning setup is, but I can tell you what would and wouldn\u2019t work for my situation, and it might give you some useful ideas. \u201cMr. Lowe, can you make\u2014\u201d No. Stop right there. You are asking me to break a rule, and you want me to go out of my way to do it, while you have reliable Internet access, because you just \u2026 don\u2019t like assignments online? Uh uh. I\u2019m not making you anything. Especially not if you\u2019re in a school like mine, where there are kids who can\u2019t do the assignments online because they don\u2019t have reliable Internet access, and are managing to get it done anyway from the break room of their parent\u2019s work. Absolutely the wrong way to approach this.\u201cMr. Lowe, can I print out the assignments and then turn them in to you at school?\u201d Better. Now you\u2019re taking the initiative to do what you can to make paper copies for yourself, rather than expecting the adults to do all the work for you. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re lazy, mind\u2014it\u2019s that the thing that matters most to all the teachers I know is that our students grow up well, and choosing to do the simple things that are within your power shows maturity. Teachers are suckers for students showing maturity.[2]But we could still make this better. After all, if your teachers work like I do, they grade everybody else\u2019s assignments through an online platform like Canvas or Google Classroom, and you want them to collect a piece of paper from you, grade it as a piece of paper, and then go to the website and enter that grade?\u201cMr. Lowe, can I print out the assignments and then submit a photograph of them through Canvas?\u201d I\u2019d be very likely to say yes to this. You\u2019re doing everything that is reasonably in your power not to add to my work load, and to make sure my principal never asks uncomfortable questions about why I\u2019m breaking school policy. Even better if you submit a proper scan of the assignment instead of a janky photograph, though that may not be reasonably in your power to do.But what if the assignments aren\u2019t of the sort that can be printed?\u201cMr. Lowe, can I turn the assignment into a worksheet myself and then submit a photograph/scan through Canvas?\u201d As long as you do a faithful job of replicating the assignment, I\u2019d probably say yes to this, too, for the same reasons.But make sure you do it in a way that makes it easy to grade. Let\u2019s take the example of a Nearpod presentation. You can probably turn the questions in it into a paper assignment for yourself, but Canvas won\u2019t let you submit a scan of your answers if it\u2019s expecting a Nearpod submission. So you would need to email me the assignment and I would need to look at your scan and then manually enter your grade. Make sure the email is really easy to find and use . That means, for example, that (i) your subject line should be exactly what I\u2019ll be looking for, just as the assignment shows up online, with your name in the subject (e.g., not \u201cHere\u2019s my work\u201d but \u201cKaylee G10M1U2L5 - Characterization in Hamlet\u201d), and (ii) I shouldn\u2019t have to flip back and forth between the assignment and your scan to figure out what you mean (e.g., include the full question before every answer).But what if the assignment is online? Something like a Nearpod you can probably turn into a paper assignment on your own without increasing your teacher\u2019s workload much, but what if the assignment is, like, to submit a video response to a discussion question or to make a Google Slides presentation? Well, in that case you gracefully admit defeat. If you make it easy on me to collect and grade your \u201cpaper\u201d work while flying under my principal\u2019s radar and doing the same work as everybody else, I\u2019m very likely to break the rules for you. But if you are asking to do a different assignment, I\u2019d want you to have a much more compelling reason than \u201cI don\u2019t like doing assignments online.\u201d [1] Yes, yes, dear readers: there are other reasons too, relating to political oversight of the school system during this time, but I don\u2019t think they matter to the present analysis. [2] In the words of the wisest school story I\u2019ve ever read: Ye want. Ye want. \u2019Tis something different ye\u2019re learning here. It\u2019s called \u201cdiscipline.\u201d The world won\u2019t always order itself the way ye want. Ye have to learn discipline. ",

How much that would be possible would depend upon the subject and school policies, but I would try my best to help. The Covid situation is not normal and some people are struggling with it. Teachers know that. Note for negotiations, any time you offer to do more work, the odds of you getting what you want improve greatly.
