            "answer_text": "The answer to your question is reliant, to some extent, on your learning style and what you perceive to be disadvantages or advantages. If you learn better independently, and prefer to go at your own pace, with an option to re-cover specific topics, then online courses will great advantages. If you prefer to learn with others or learn through discussion and debate, then online courses will have less apparent advantages. Online courses appear in many different formats, from a full interactive course to a series of very short videos. The shorter videos help those who are distracted easily, whereas the interactive courses with a \u201clive\u201d instructor will attempt to emulate the classroom experience. Online training courses often lack the ability to interact with, and ask questions of, the instructor. Some online training providers provide a forum to compensate for this, but it\u2019s still not live, and you may have to wait some time for a response to a question. This is tempered with the fact that dialogue can continue for a number of weeks / months. You don\u2019t often continue a dialogue with an instructor after an in-person training course. Online courses do allow the flexibility to study \u201cat will\u201d, and in-person courses don\u2019t have that same flexibility. They also don\u2019t have any commuting time / costs involved and are generally cheaper than in-person courses. But like I said; you may see the commuting time as additional study time, or relaxation time, so may see that as ad advantage. You have to be very self-disciplined when taking an online course - discipled to study and complete homework / assignments at agreed times without any supervision. Again, that could be a disadvantage, but if you\u2019re a very organised person that could be seen as an advantage which would play to your strengths. I have to admit, that I like the interaction of a classroom, but some online training providers are able to emulate that experience very well. My advice is to look around at the options available to you and see if one particular provider conducts their courses in a format that suits your learning style. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of advantages and disadvantages I have selected few and important one they are as followered ADVANTAGES ARE - It\u2019s cheaper: Your users can learn with any device that is connected to the Internet. There\u2019s no need to rent a building or pay for expensive utility bills that are required to provide students with a learning facility. In addition, students and teachers will no longer commute to class, thereby saving them money as well!It takes less time: Not only does eliminating the need to commute save money, but it also saves everyone time. Moreover, the teacher or trainer doesn\u2019t need to give the same class repeatedly to different groups of students. He or she only needs to prepare the content once and then share it with different groups at anytime necessary.It allows for self-paced learning: Students or trainees can take courses from their own devices anytime and anywhere. So, those who don\u2019t have time for traditional classes can learn online when they have the time.It\u2019s modern: Most people today prefer to consume content using the Internet. The very fact that you are reading this article online is proof of that! We now use the Internet to read the news, watch our favorite TV shows, chat with friends, book appointments, shop, and so much more. Considering all of the convenience the Internet has added to our daily lives, why should education remain strictly traditional instead of utilizing the advantages provided by the Internet?DISADVANTAGES ARE - It takes self-discipline: While experience has shown that online students are forced to become more self-disciplined, those that remain unengaged could be a challenge as their activities cannot be monitored in class.Plagiarism: Keeping in mind that your students are using a computer and not being monitored at all times, they could potentially plagiarize essays and other assignments.Cheating: Along similar lines, it can be easier for students to cheat on online exams.Isolation: Since students don\u2019t have to be physically present in a classroom, it might be more difficult (or nearly impossible) for them to get in touch with other learners.",
