The term professional development generally refers to an array of specialized training, formal education, or advanced professional learning that improves skillsets, professional knowledge, competency, and overall effectiveness in the professional world. It\u2019s tied closely with professional growth, the building of personal development skills, and is often driven by continuing professional education. Professionals seeking to ascend to a leadership position will often seek a leadership development program. For those who don\u2019t aim to be the boss, professional development courses can still help foster creative development or help satisfy professional development goals as part of a larger professional development plan or even a personal development plan. Many who seek to advance their careers will engage in Continuing Professional Development or CPD. CPD is the process of identifying skills, knowledge, and experience gained while working, then tracking, documenting and applying that progress throughout a career. Specific CPD training and CPD courses help professionals master this process.  Online Courses in Professional Development In addition to available CPD certification programs, there are many online courses that can aid in personal and professional development efforts. Catalyst, the leading nonprofit organization with a mission to accelerate progress for women, provides a number of courses geared toward helping learners excel in their careers. Some of these include Becoming a Successful Leader, Leading With Effective Communication, and Communication Skills for Bridging Divides, as well as their Inclusive Leadership Professional Certificate Program. For specific expertise, like that needed in the finance world, the New York Institute of Finance offers a slew of professional education courses including Brokerage Operations Professional Certificate Examination, Introduction to Custody Servicing, Margins, and Accounting Records, and M&A: Concepts and Theories.
