            "answer_text": "I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re meaning the child isn\u2019t deaf. And the parents are deaf. Most deaf people aren\u2019t mute. They can talk. But they may not talk much to most people because it may be difficult for the deaf person to monitor their own speech sounds. As a result the hearing people may not understand or may complain that they can\u2019t understand the deaf person\u2019s speech. It just becomes simpler to not use speech. So what do deaf parents do? The parents teach the child sign language when he\u2019s younger than school age. It may actually be easier than teaching them speech. Sign language is actually very natural and may even have been our earliest form of communication. Additionally, most hearing kids with deaf parents learn to speak just fine without anyone worrying much about it. They may actually wind up running errands that deafness interferes with or handling situations where, in the rare situation, say, where Mom goes to the hospital and is too ill to write her symptoms down and there\u2019s no sign interpreter available.

            "answer_text": "Children of deaf parents frequently learn a signed language as their first language, and then acquire the oral language of whatever country they live in as a second language. This causes no problems at all. According to your Quora bio, you live in a US state that borders Mexico and is home to many immigrants. About 20% of the people who live in your state speak Spanish as their primary language. How many second-generation Mexican-Americans do you know? What proportion of those people are bilingual? It\u2019s almost all of them, right? Even when their parents are monolingual Spanish speakers, children who grow up in US border states learn to speak fluent English because they\u2019re exposed to English from an early age. It works the same way with children of deaf parents. Deaf people aren\u2019t hermits. They live in neighborhoods that are full of hearing people. They let their children play with other kids who live on the same block. They send their children to public schools. They usually have hearing relatives \u2014 parents, siblings, cousins, etc. Hearing children of deaf parents have plenty of exposure to oral languages from an early age. I know many hearing people who were born to deaf parents. I have yet to meet one who failed to learn how to speak English by the time they were old enough to enter elementary school. Final note: Your assumption that deaf people are mute is incorrect. The phrase \u201cdeaf and mute\u201d is considered to be highly offensive in the deaf community. I\u2019m sure you did not intend to be offensive. From your other activity on Quora, I get the impression you have had little or no opportunity to learn about deaf social norms. ",
