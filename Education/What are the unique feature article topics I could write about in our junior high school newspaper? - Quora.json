            "answer_text": "Great question. It\u2019s what writers ask about in every publication. And the answer is easy and hard: Write about everything. That\u2019s easy because there are stories everywhere you look. The hard part is making your readers care. So how do you find out what your readers care about? Ask them. Walk around with a notepad and find out what other students think are important issues, what makes them angry, happy, or sad about in the school \u2014 or in their lives outside school. What you hear might surprise you. Some of them have parents out of work. Some have had parents arrested and deported. Some have bruises from a parent or someone else at home who hurts them. Some have fears about whether this pandemic is ever going to end. And some want to kill themselves because they\u2019ve been bullied for how they look, how they talk, or where they\u2019re from. Write about these. Don\u2019t wing it: plan out your articles, and interview experts about the topic. Read a lot of professional journalism about the topics, too \u2014 not to copy their ideas, but to get context and the bigger picture. Then describe the pain, the sorrow, the fear. Make it real by showing how the pain, sorrow and fear smells, how it has texture. Show expression in people\u2019s faces. Describe what tears look like in that girl\u2019s eyes. (You can write about funny stuff too \u2014 we all love to laugh \u2014 but humor is much harder to pull off. Let that wait \u2019til you have more practice. What you think is funny might be offensive or hurtful to someone else.) The best writers emulate others. So become a great feature writer by becoming a prolific reader. ",
