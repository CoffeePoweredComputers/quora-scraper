            "answer_text": "i am currently in class 11 and have just recently closed class 10 . according me it is great. It favours the children it may not have fulfilled everyone\u2019s desires. as you know no system can ever be perfect but still the world needs to move towards perfection. in a similar way it has sorted the many problems we students used to face like the problems of heavy bags. soon there is going to be a wave of digitisation which will in one way reduce the weight of bags. also there will be 10 bagless days , in which the student can have some hands on practical knowledge. plus learning coding will be taught from class 6th which will really be helpful from 8th the child can choose his /her stream . ( i personally wanted this ever since i was in class 8th). and also there is a flexibilty in switching streams. the academic bank of credit is another innovative method which will support the child in his / her dream . plus the top 100 universities will be allowed to be setup their branches in india and many indian universities will be allowed to open branches outside india . according to me this move will create the skilled youth .which will raise india\u2019s reputation indirectly. and may also reduce brain drain . the move of NEP 2020 is a very good decision, though it can still be improved .but it is the crucial first step which was required please tell if i made any grammatical error ",

            "answer_text": "No education system can change a student\u2019s learning skills. Psychologists say in young children the ability to memorise is high but not logical thinking Therefore, at primary school level, what is important is help a pupil memorise as many nursery rhymes, tables, spelling of words, mathematical equations as possible. When children go to higher classes like middle or high school they can grasp the logic behind what they learn. It is for this reason in olden days we had clearly demarcated primary, middle and high school. And each school and faculty would be different. They would not even be located in the same campus. But now, right from standard one to standard 12 we have the same school same teachers and common off syllabus activities. What psychological impact it has on younger children, good or bad , is difficult to judge. In any case what ever may be the split in the teaching pattern a child will only pick up what he or she is capable of according the age. There may be exceptions but it is important to discuss the rule and not the exceptions to the rule. ",

Our education system is already very expensive but because of NEP this education system will be more expensive .Poor students will suffer. Govt told to give 6% of GDP to education which doesn't look possible. Adding of vocational education is good for students . Let's hope how much schools follow it ! ",
