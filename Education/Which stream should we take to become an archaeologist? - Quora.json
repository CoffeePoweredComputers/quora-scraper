            "answer_text": "That depends on which kind of archaeology you are interested in. Ideally history is the closest subject to archaeology so Arts stream is advised. Besides history, you can also go for geography specialisation. However, if you are interested in scientific methods and lab work in archaeology you are better off in Science stream where you can pursue chemistry, botany or zoology specialisation, all of them are important in archaeology. Apart from that, geology specialisation is also a good option. Hope it helps. ",
