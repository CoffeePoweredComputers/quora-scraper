            "answer_text": "Depends what age you are but the best thing in my opinion for broadening life experience is travel. Not as a tourist but as an explorer. That means you don\u2019t just go to see the sights but go to LIVE and engage with the culture. Learn the language, make friends, share your language and culture and reinvent yourself. It will change your outlook to everything - your home country, your cultural assumptions, other people and other ideas. It takes a huge commitment but the rewards are also huge. ",
