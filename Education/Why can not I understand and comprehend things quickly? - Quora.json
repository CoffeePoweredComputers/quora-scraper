            "answer_text": "We all have different processing speeds. It\u2019s important not to feel that you have to be the same as others. If you feel, however, that you really have a significant problem then you may want to explore this with the help of an Educational Psychologist. If, on the other hand, you feel that it\u2019s not serious enough to require outside intervention then you may be able to understand things more quickly by improving your Divergent Thinking skills. Divergent Thinking involves taking an idea and make a wide variety of links. This way you are ahead of the information you are receiving. So, for instance, as someone tells you a joke you may guess the punchline before he/she gets there. Quite simply, your mind is already making predictions and examining possibilities; it\u2019s a more active, more dynamic way of thinking. One simple method that may increase your Divergent Thinking is to take some simple object - let\u2019s say a brick - and write down as quickly as possible as many uses it could have. You might give yourself a time limit of, say, five minutes. Allow yourself to come up with some answers that are valid but would normally be dismissed as ridiculous (\u2018throwing at an alien who attacked me\u2019, \u2018removing rough skin\u2019, etc) because these encourage this free-ranging way of generating ideas. You\u2019ll soon realise that when your mind is allowed to roam without hindrance a surprising number of ideas will flow. When you\u2019ve exhausted your \u2018brick ideas\u2019 then try something else. What could you use a newspaper for? Name twenty things you could do with a light-bulb. And so on. Is this skill transferable? In other words, will this help you to do this automatically in other situations? This question is also being asked about games that are supposed to improve memory, attention, etc. To date the jury is still out, but there is some evidence that something as broad as the brick exercise may indeed help us in daily life. It\u2019s worth a try. Good luck! To \u2018follow\u2019, click on my name and then the \u2018follow\u2019 button. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "To comprehend you need to puzzle the pieces together. The first step is to have the pieces. (Search for the missing pieces to your comprehension) The second is to find pairs of pieces that fit together. (think about how they could fit together) That way you will have \u201cbigger\u201d pieces that need to fit with other big pieces. Once you can fit them (without forcing), you will comprehend it. If you do force it you will end up with a biased comprehension. There are many puzzle pieces to everything, even the simplest things. The only way I know for you to have a mental table so that you have somewhere to work on is to perceive every little piece as incomplete alone. The incompleteness is a nurtured seed for curiosity, which will be satiable only if you find bigger and bigger pictures of the puzzle. ",
