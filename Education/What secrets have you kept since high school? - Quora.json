            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t just a secret since high school, it was a secret throughout all of my school years, and for many years after that. I was born in 1954. I realized I was attracted to my own gender when I was 6, in 1960. I would fully understand why I was the way I was when I was 13/14 in 1968. I realized I was gay. This was hard to do anything about it, because being gay at that time was illegal and considered to be a mental illness and could get you institutionalized or incarcerated, or dead. I did meet and fall in love with a boy when I was 14 to 16 (1968\u20131970), but it had to be kept hidden. I would be discovered to be gay when I was 16 (in 1970) and my adopted mother damn near beat me to death. I was threatened by her to never tell. So, I buried it. I would never admit it. I had to \u201cplay the part\u201d of being straight. Only one thing, I never expected to meet and marry the only woman who would love me for me. My wife died in 2015. I openly came out as gay afterward, which was my promise to her. She knew why I buried being me, and she knew my adopted mother would have destroyed me if I had come out. I openly came out on March 3, 2015. OMG, did that open a flood gate? I was in touch with several of my classmates on Facebook. When I openly came out to them, their response was, \u201cTell us something we didn\u2019t already know.\u201d WTF???? They all said they had figured it out a long time ago. It didn\u2019t matter to them, they still considered me to be their friend and loved me just the same. That is the secret I carried from high school. ",
