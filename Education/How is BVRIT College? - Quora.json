            "answer_text": "One of the top colleges in Telangana. The college is very huge, with vast greenery area. The faculty and lab facilities are also great. The college Also encourages sports for sports lovers. Hostel facility is also Good(PS: i was a day scholar). As an alumni, I can tell you that BVRIT encourages new ideas. It wont let you force you need to do this particular job but rather shows you the way to find your dream. But the only downside is that this college is in outskirts of the city(Narsapur). Had this college been located in the city it would be the only college with all the facilities in Hyderabad. At the end of the day, you will realize that you won\u2019t find another college as best as this. BVRIT is one of a kind :)  ",
