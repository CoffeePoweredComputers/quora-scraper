More fun. More issues discussed. Better unity in family. Thus, joint families thrivedOutdoor games dominated. \u201cMy grandfather tells me often that even in scorching summer afternoons, he was dragged indoor forcefully.\u201d Such was the craze for outdoors. This kept them more physically fit and healthy.No smartphones and no internet. Yet, the best of contact across miles. Hearts were together. Feelings were more real.Clothes have seen a great change. Men, here in Rajasthan, used to wear cotton dhotis. Unlike other people of his age, My grandfather hasn't switched to pants or pyjamas. I've never seen him wearing any of these things. He always carry his white dhoti in the same old traditional way.Old generation were lucky to have those strict punishments. They reminded them never to repeat the same mistake even in dreams. And yes, it prevented those pre-mature minds suffer the disadvantage of experience. Cricket bats, shoes, slippers, broomsticks and many other things were used by my mother to punish me. Now, my father makes fun saying, \u201cTeri mummy ne apne bachpan ka badla tere bachpan pe nikal liya\u201d (Your mother took revenge of her childhood punishments in your childhood.)Ladies used to make achaars (pickles), papad, mangodi, etc. This made children have great tasty stuff to eat at home itself.Morals were held very high. Quite a bit more than today.Yes, we have developed techniques and ideologies today. But I feel yesterday's generation has lot more to cherish. :-))_ ",

            "answer_text": "As somebody who\u2019s lived in both eras, times were better back then. Everybody who wanted one had a decent secure job, that most people expected to do for their entire working lives, with comfortable pay and benefits, and usually something of a career ladder. Prices, at least for everyday needs, were fairly low and stable. My college tuition back then was a coupl hundred bucks a semester, and I could pay that myself, with beer money left over with a summer job in a local factory. People didn\u2019t worry much about the future. All that changed economically with the \u201cReagan Recession\u201d of the 1980\u2019s, and seems to have gone pretty much downhill from there. Jobs started to dry up, wages stagnated, factories closed, the cities started to crumble, and ethnic neighborhoods, particularly for minorities, morphed into urban ghettos. Maybe it was fueled by the war protests and race riots of a decade earlier, but anger and protest about just about anything and everything began to rise. I think we\u2019re somewhere now in a process that started back then. The other difference today is computers. My first computer in grad school was a thing the size of a two car garage in a big basement room. You sat at in a cubicle and typed out a stack of punch cards. Then you stood in a long line until you could feed your cards into a little slot on the machine. Then, you stood in another long line at the other end,until, if you punched all your cards exactly right, the machine kicked a sheet of paper into the tray, with the answer to one statistics problem. Any of the devices we carry around in our pockets today are exponentially more powerful and useful than that thing. Computers run everything in our lives today, and we don\u2019t even know they\u2019re there, just take them for granted. Another difference, though, is that people today seem to use their devices a lot for dalliance, amusement, mischief and miscommunication. We seem to be losing the concept, that the things in our lives are tools, to do a job, or make it easier. Computers steal our work, and in the process seem to make the extra free time more frivolous and unproductive. ",
