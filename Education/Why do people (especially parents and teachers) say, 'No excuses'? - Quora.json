            "answer_text": "Hello, As I can answer for neither parents nor teachers (since I\u2019m none of those things) I\u2019ll simply answer for myself. Personally I don\u2019t care much about *why* a person didn\u2019t do what he/she was supposed to do. It is completely irrelevant to me. Either they completed the task or they haven\u2019t. They are I believe also very annoying to listen to. Especially long winded ones, those are the worst. They are also used far too often and are usually rather poor. They might be geniune, but on the other hand it can be kind of ridicilous. Like when you say that you forgot you homework on 3 out of 4 sessions per month or when a person who volunteered to write a short article for a magazine says that they couldn\u2019t find 30 minutes of time in the whole month for doing so. In a way it can be said that those types of excuses mostly say one thing about you: that which I was supposed to do for you is not very high on my list of priorities. Especially when used often. And the sort of excuses teachers and parents hear ARE used very often. Having said that, I still fail to do all sorts of crap myself, though I mostly just say: I haven\u2019t done it. I also absolutely despised homework in school and only really completed it about 1/3 of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably because at some level, most of us procrastinate. So maybe during the a month-long holiday, you wait until the last 3 days to start on a major assignment, and of course, various incidents happen that causes you to lose several days until you have no more time to even put up a half-decent project. Whose fault is that? Some of us will justify to ourselves \u201chey, I started 3 WHOLE DAYS before but I was just unlucky to have my dog die, get into a bike accident and have food poisoning so surely you can\u2019t blame me for this?\u201d That\u2019s not good enough. With an attitude like that, the student is setting himself/herself for more difficulties later in life. Obviously, \u201cno excuses\u201d should only apply to those that sound like an excuse. If you get hit by a wayward bus on the first day of your break and return to school a month later in a full-body cast, only an asshole would reinforce the rule. ",
