            "answer_text": "I will not give my answer in yes or no. When it was in 11th starting 2017\u201318 batch CBSE. Some oversmart senior who even never qualifies JEE told me to follow either pradeep or sl arora for jee prep. I as a stupid blindly follow him as i dom't have much knowledge about it. I used to solve each and every problem of the book called pradeep. I solved it up to Laws of motion chapter. Solving each problem makes me to believe that i can crack jee its very easy. But this is false true. Then one day I was scrolling snapdeal and saw IE IRODOVO and realise its very cheap, so i quickly ordered it. When my book arrives i decided to solve it. Oh f*ck!, Now what? I could able to solve any problem upto NLM. I reopened my pradeep and found there are no such type of problems. Then i realised that this is not enough for my jee prep. No doubt the PYQ give at the back are very good. But there is lack of quality questions and concepts in this book. And now, Whenever a junior ask for a physics book I blindly recommend to take CENGAGE. I personally feels its the best book for physics to take you from level 0 to level of jee. Hoping this would help you. You may follow my space to get updated about books Fore-Aft JEE/NEET This is me\u2026 This is Aayush Ramteke. ",

So,if you are preparing for both board & jee then go for S.L.ARORA..  but If your target is only jee exam then go for DC Pandey /B.M.sharma series books along with H.C.Verma. ",
