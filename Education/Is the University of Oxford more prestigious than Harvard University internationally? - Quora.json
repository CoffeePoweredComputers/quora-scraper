            "answer_text": "You need to make this decision on qualitative factors. Both institutions have fantastic pedigree along with excellent academic opportunities and alumni networks. The world will be your oyster at either school. However, what Oxford does offer is a much greater cultural experience if you desire it. You'll be able to travel all over Europe in your spare time, be surrounded by people speaking many different languages from a broader range of countries and a corresponding variety of perspectives. The Rhodes Scholarship gives Oxford more attention, as well as it being the older one. That being said PPE at oxford is the most prestigious and bad ass course in the world. You can legit do anything after and being interested in politics it can be a real kickstart. For admissions, Oxford is primarily looking for academics. Harvard expects strong academics but also aims for those with excellent extracurricular, athletics, and other traits. Factors like legacy and URM status are more likely to be factored in at Harvard. Oxford has clear admissions criteria for each department it expects students to meet, unlike Harvard, and its applicant pool is cut in half by the ban against students from applying to both Oxford and Cambridge. Due to the stringent admissions criteria at Oxford, its graduates of some (but not all) departments may come out slightly more prepared than those at Harvard. A standard classics major at Harvard, for example, is only starting to translate Greek drama in his/her second or even third year, whereas Oxford classics students annually do a performance of a Greek play in the original language (!) even as first or second year students. This speaks more to the structure of the British educational system, however, than to the relative strengths of Harvard and Oxford. Both universities have virtually no discernible academic weaknesses and absurdly long lists of distinguished alumni. ",
