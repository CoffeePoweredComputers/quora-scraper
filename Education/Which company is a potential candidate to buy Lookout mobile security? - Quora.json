            "answer_text": "Google acquired a security company called VirusTotal. Symantec, has a pretty strong offering with a few functionality gaps, which are not covered by Lookout's proposition, so it doesn't make sense for those folks to acquire them. There are actually major flaws in the consumer mobile security space & the solutions.  1) When you lose your phone and evoke a command from the cloud to kill (wipe) the phone, the SMS from the cloud is not currently reliable or guaranteed - so it may not get to your device to lock, kill or wipe it. You have therefore just paid X for a solution that may or may not work, which is a little disturbing.   2) When you lose or misplace your phone, the time frame between losing your device and realizing your device is missing, you are completely unprotected from data/identity theft. I have lost my mobile many times on a night out and realized in the morning. Too late somebody already has taken the device and copied my data or worse still accessed my identity.  Slight digression - I'm from the industry & we have fixes for those industry problems.  It would make sense for a company with a similar route to market but due to the price tag it leaves only a few players on the table who already have made acquisitions in the space. The next three years smartphones are set to double and after Android's runaway success, I believe all the OSs will open up especially mindful of HTML 5. So,  huge market opportunity, however too expensive (NetQin, the market leader has a market cap of $300Million) - my prediction is Lookout will do an IPO this year. ",

            "answer_text": "One could suspect Symantec. Indeed, Symantec acquired Vontu, a Data Loss Prevention startup back in 2007 (Many of Vontu's employees indeed work now at Lookout). Given that Lookout is in both security and data loss prevention arena, it's a good target for Symantec. However, the company is in reorg mode. I don't think this is the right time to buy nor a cheap target to pay for. ",
