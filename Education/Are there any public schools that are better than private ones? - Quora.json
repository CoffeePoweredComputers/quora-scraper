            "answer_text": "Here in the Chicago area, the answer is yes. Selective public schools are on par or better than private schools. The secret to having a successful school is selective enrollment of students. There are three types of selective-enrollment schools around here: Private schools: selective on the basis of parent\u2019s ability and willingness to pay; lower bar for expelling students for academic or behavioral reasons. Selective-enrollment public schools: Public schools within the city of Chicago that students have to test into. They pull in the best students from around the city, like a magnet. Hence they\u2019re also called \u201cmagnet schools.\u201d De facto selective wealthy suburban public schools: These are public schools whose students all come from more affluent suburbs. The fact that the parents are able to afford those suburbs means that the parents are more likely to be successful and have the time and resources to help their children in school. Selective public schools have the best advantages of both private and public schools. They don\u2019t have to waste resources trying to educate students who don\u2019t want to be educated and cause distractions for their classmates that do want to be educated. They also don\u2019t have to worry about fundraising/getting more \u201ccustomers\u201d like private schools. The combination of more resources (money) and fewer students with discipline issues creates some of the best schools in the area. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of public k-12 vs private k-12, I\u2019d take private as the one that pushes kids harder. I have the odd childhood experience of both. Public schools work really hard for the people at the bottom of the performance spectrum. They don\u2019t do much for high intelligence people. Private schools present children with a more advanced curriculum and smaller class sizes. Sometimes they use new and dynamic methods that public schools can\u2019t use at scale. This is particularly an advantage if your kid has a learning disability. In terms of post secondary education such as universities and trade schools, there\u2019s a huge variety in quality of education. I\u2019ll compare five local institutions that I have lots of information about; Consider the case of OSU Stillwater. This is a public land grant university that does really well at engineering and health sciences. They have the most accredited PhDs within 200 miles of Tulsa. They are considered competitive and a very good school for the region.In contrast with OSU, consider TU. University of Tulsa (TU) is a private university that also specializes in engineering. Their health sciences programs are currently falling apart in a mess of accreditation and trying to close down prominent departments.Now for a trade school, consider OSU Okmulgee. This campus specializes in every kind of technical trade certification available Oklahoma. They also make sure that everyone completing their trade certification gets a bachelor\u2019s degree. This makes them one of the most forward looking schools of their kind.To contrast a private trade school, consider Tulsa Tech. Tulsa Tech has rapidly aging facilities for which they charge 2\u20133 times more per class than OSU. They are also really not competitive. They recruit aggressively and will pretty much take anyone who can apply and pay.Finally to be fair I want to talk about an amazing private university, ORU. While not an engineering school, they do have significant health sciences degrees which hold quite a bit of accreditation. They also are one of the most challenging Christian university in terms of academics. Their business program has an amazing ethical foundation, not something I see much in that kind of department.So your mileage may vary. I advise checking out reviews and outcomes from any potential school. Harvard is very competitive, but then again so is UC Berkeley. I personally would take the public option because it is a bigger school with wider research, which matters to me. ",

            "answer_text": "US News and World and World Report stated doing high school rankings, my high school which is called Hume Fogg and our sister school Martin Luther King Magnet used to rank top 50, as I recall around 25 or so. The ranking has waned a bit to around 60 (with a score of 99.65/100), which is nothing to scoff at. Lot\u2019s of NCAA basketball teams would like to be that close to the field of 64 (65?, 66?, 67?\u2014I don\u2019t know how many will be included this year). I can only assume the ranking system changed. Here is the full ranking: https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/tennessee/districts/metro-nashville-public-schools/hume-fogg-magnet-high-school-18154 This versus private schools like Montgomery Bell Academy, Ensworth, and other private elite schools like University School of Nashville that are quite expensive and whose parents are lawyers, doctors, and university professors and probably financial planners and real estate agents added for good measure. Ours was based on college graduation rate and AP offerings. I\u2019m not exactly sure the other criteria the rankings used. I\u2019m sure our scholarship offerings were fairly high as well. Honorable Mention: Some Charter schools are amazing (and some are really terrible often systematically so). The ranking system certainly points to the former. Magnet schools do quite well in these rankings. ",

            "answer_text": "They outperform public schools in teaching EQ (Emotional Quotient), which is a confidence in oneself, personality, leadership, can-do attitude. This is being touted as far more important than IQ. (Look at the realistic Big Bang Theory\u2026 .Sheldon should be capable of leading a great corporation or university, but he doesn't understand how to get people behind him, so he's at a small college\u2026driving people nuts!) These schools also select the \u201cbest\u201d students in the first place, students dedicated, backed by parents, and have few discipline problems\u2026(although cutthroat, backstabbing seems to be rampant). Public schools take all comers and improve the students' qualities as best they can. However, research shows that the best determinants of good learning is parent support! Our testing programs do NOT test improvement; they test students compared to where students should be. So a school that takes a student from 3rd grade reading to 8th grade reading in 9th grade is considered a 'Failing School'. This data (improvement within one year) would be far more valuable in figuring out what works in improving education, keeping kids till graduation, and making them capable lifelong learning students.

So teachers don\u2019t have to spend time on helping struggling kids. In this comparison, private schools tend to be inferior because private school teachers are not as well trained or experienced as public school teachers. Why? Because the great teachers all teach in public schools because the pay and benefits are far greater. Now, of course, the totally elite and richest parents send their kids to private schools, which are the best of the best. But these schools are VERY expensive, meaning few can afford them, AND the high tuition guarantees competitive pay for teachers. ",

He did not fair well on the AP tests, but did graduate 13th out of 200 in his class. I am fan and a supporter of public school education. The only reason I sent my son to a private school was that is was a more preferable learning environment for him. My two daughters went to my former public school and faired very well. I based my opinion on 33 years of experience and being a former high school principal of 22 years. ",

With the public school, they don\u2019t pay tuition, the money funding the school has already been taxed from the property owners in the school district.

I\u2019m especially fond of Jesuit and Christian Brothers schools - these guys know how to teach and know their stuff. Most of their schools are high schools. Catholic grade schools are usually good. And they don\u2019t put up with any guff, They apply discipline when appropriate. I\u2019m especially wary of charter schools - too often they are not properly staffed or equipped and too many of them have an ideological orientation that results in biased education. Several charter schools in my area were started by well meaning people who didn\u2019t have enough experience to do it right and ended up bankrupt. One had incompetent faculty members. Note: it takes a bad school to ruin a good student. If your child is not doing well in school it could be the school or the other students, but sometimes it\u2019s your child. ",

It could be that those from a different background will mean more opportunities but equally life can be more comfortable and comforting with friends who are similar.
