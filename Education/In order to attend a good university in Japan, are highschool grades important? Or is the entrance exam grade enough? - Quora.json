            "answer_text": "It depends on different school. Each school has her own requirement. Most private universities do not care about high school grades. Most national/public universities require a minimal high school grade. (eg. at least B in Science and Mathematics when you are applying to the science/engineering faculty) But in the end, each school is different.  There is a few special cases where high school grades are more important, it is when you are applying through recommendation, AO, or returnees. You will not need to take the general/national exam or entrance exam. Hence, high school grades and your teachers' recommendations are all that matter.  Just a note, aside from the high school grades and entrance exam results, there is the general/national exam (Senta Shiken, Japanese version of SAT/ACT). That one, matters far more than the two in many cases. ",
