            "answer_text": "I am not a Doctor but I have many friends who are. If you want to study any health related programme then you are better gaining your initial qualifications in either UK or Ireland as the qualifications as our education system, the points system is worth far more than they are in the United States. I have been told it is far easier for Professionals to go from the UK to another country than for them to come from somewhere else to here. As an example, I was friends with an American Nursing Professor once. She informed me that a 4 year Nursing qualification, if studied in the US, due to the overall points awarded to them on qualification, would only be equivalent to the 1st year of a Bachelors programme here in the UK, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to practice over here as a Nurse. I reckon this would be the same for any health related programme that is why I am saying it is better to get your initial medical qualification from either the UK or EIRE than anywhere else. Also, you can study Medicine straight from high school if this is your intention for a career rather than in the US where it is an all graduate programme. Don\u2019t get me wrong, studying Medicine as a post grad is excellent as it means an individual has matured and had time to make sure that this is the career path in which they wish to pursue as nobody would like a 17 year old for a medical student.

            "answer_text": "Romania You get mostly all you'd get in other places, only that at dirt cheap prices. It's one of the best countries in Europe to study medicine, not necessarily the best to go to a hospital.Everything else is dirt cheap, most people in cities know some English, markets are \"bio\". You can easily cover your living expenses with ~ 500-600$ a month (rent, food etc). For this you get your own room in a shared apartment, all expenses paid, and the food (if you cook). If you don't cook, an average student lunch goes ~ 7-8$. There's quite a bit of a community of people studying medicine in Bucharest. There's people from Germany, people from Israel, and many other places :)) - Sorry, it felt a bit like I'm doing an A to Z thing when I wrote Germany and Israel in the same sentence, found it funny, and then my mind emptied. You can start med school right after high school, it takes you 6 years to finish it, and then you take this exam \"Residency exam\", or simply go back home and take it, whatever rubs your buttons.You will get a lot of hands-on experience during your studies AND you can actually do some surgery stuff much earlier than in the U.S./other places.The only issue is that it might be helpful to learn Romanian. Even so, there's a lot of classess that are in English. :D You can actually learn Romanian from English for a price you might find rather accessible ( ~ 20 USD/2 hours session with a 2-5 group of people and a qualified teacher, weekly meetings). I'm actually considering creating a course for \"Romanian from English\" with a substantial follow up on \"Romanian from English for prospective medical students\"There's actual communities of expats/foreigners in Bucharest you can befriend and interact with, so you won't be all alone.When your family comes visit you can take them on a trip around Romania for a fraction of what it would cost you in other places. Seriously, do I need to insert pictures in this answer to give you an incentive ? ",
