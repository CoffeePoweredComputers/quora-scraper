            "answer_text": "I would say it depends on your school and location. It\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll be sent to Summer school and if you pass Math then you\u2019ll move on, it not then you\u2019ll be held back. The more important factor though is not to get down on yourself. Don\u2019t feel because you failed 8th grade math your life is going to collapse. If you\u2019re interested in Math then spend your spare time practicing. Watch videos do challenge problems and so on. If you\u2019re not interested in Math then do your best to pass, not everyone is good at everything. Me personally I could barely pass Biology courses even after insane amounts of studying. None of this diminishes your value, find what you\u2019re good at and stick with it. In your case I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re somewhat interested in Math, so I would say take a look at Khan Academy or YouTube. There are tons of free resources to help you out. Ultimately, try to understand the WHY behind the math rather than the HOW. Don\u2019t memorize steps, but logically think through problems and WHY you would figure them out in a particular way. ",
