            "answer_text": "Rather than asking it on quora ask the same question to yourself. Think where do you want to see yourself in next 10\u201315 years. Research about each course and see if you are comfortable with it and then take the course which you like . Every course has it's own positive and negative things. Eg: Science: NEGATIVE: you have to memorize number of formulas, theorems, tables etc. POSITIVE : If you are good at it then you can work with big companies like Google, Microsoft etc and even become a famous scientist. Commerce: NEGATIVE: memorize formulas, remember economic terms, lots of maths and etc. POSITIVE: You can establish your own business and make people work under you. Humanities/Arts: NEGATIVE: You have to remember two long page answers , getting 6/6 even after writing two page is difficult, full off theory rarely practical. POSITIVE: Can give you lot of knowledge which can be helpful for civil services, there are large number of courses for humanities after school life with good income, you can get to meet new people if you take up the study of sociology. And as people think arts/humanities=politcs/history so you have a better chance of entering of politics or studying history but to be honest humanities is more than history or politics. ",
