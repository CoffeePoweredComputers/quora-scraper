            "answer_text": "There are so many necessary changes in rearing children today versus when I was a child. For example, we were allowed to go outside and play anywhere in the neighborhood as long as we were home before it got dark. No one worried about where exactly we were or if we were safe or not. Today you cannot leave your child outside in the front yard without fear that they can get kidnapped. We walked everywhere and knew where each kid in our school lived. Today kids are driven everywhere as its not necessarily safe to walk and with how frequently people move, we don\u2019t even know our neighbors let alone the entire neighborhood. When I was little, it was rare that both parents worked, hence our moms were home with us when we were home. Today Daycares are the norm for where children go after school instead of to their homes and their friend\u2019s homes. I adapted how my children were reared from how I was reared due to differences in society, just as I watch how my grandchildren are being reared, all out of necessity. What has not changed is how much my parents cared for us children, how much I love and adore my children, and how wonderfully loved and cared for my grandchildren are. Methodologies may need to be adapted, but the love behind our choices remains strong and consistent. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is way better for kids today than it was for my generation. When I and my sisters were born, it was about the late 60\u2019s, early 70\u2019s. We were born in hospitals, barely, because our mother was great at sitting in the car, smoking Winstons during her contractions. She\u2019d stub the last one out when she was about eight centimeters dilated, march in, and calve. Now, less parents smoke. Hopefully, someday, no one will smoke cigarettes, especially while they are pregnant. Kids won\u2019t have to be around it, ever. When I was born, fathers still stayed in the waiting room. They didn\u2019t get to see the miracle of birth. I\u2019ve seen a lot of things, traveling this planet for 50 years. Seeing my children born, was the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen. It made me cry. Every time. By the time my youngest was born, they even let my wife\u2019s mother in the delivery room with us. She got to witness the miracle of birth, and got to help coach the girl she gave birth to, herself! Plus, because she knew things about my wife that I didn\u2019t, she could also stand prepared as a first responder in case the kid came out black. When I was born, it was toward the end of the day where the obstetrician would spank the newborn on the bottom. My father said this was to knock the balls off the stupid ones. It turns out it was to clear the baby\u2019s airways. Now they do that with a suction device. And they have lots of great technology to keep a premature baby alive. There were no such thing as car seats, and no one wore seatbelts when we were taken home from the hospital. Now, all babies are much safer in cars. Our mother bottle fed us. Sometimes, she just propped the bottle. Formula was all the rage back then. Plus, she really just liked me and my sisters as friends. This method of providing her children with nutrition kept her from getting too attached from the onset, so 17 years later she wouldn\u2019t get all broken up when I joined the Navy and left the nest. As I learned in my Developmental Psychology class, the mass marketing of formula, and discouraging mothers from breast feeding, killed more human beings than atomic bombs. It\u2019s probably the reason so many adults have bonding issues. Now women breast feed. Some seem to drag it out too long, like six or seven years, but seriously, formula is only good in emergency circumstances. This is the best example in the universe of a low tech method that is better, by far, and always will be. When I was a kid, I got hit a few times by my father. It was never justifiable. It wasn\u2019t to keep me from hurting myself. He just wasn\u2019t able to manage his anger and stress, that he had no real reason to have. My father was a baby-boomer. So even though he was a high school drop out, he had a union job where he made enough money in a week to pay the mortgage on a brand new house he and my mother, also a high school drop out, bought when they were only 21 years old. My mother didn\u2019t have to work, but she did piece work at home, and later took a factory job, to cover smoking, partying, and gambling expenses. My parents were young, and had plenty of money to party with. I came along at just the right time. My father just got drafted to go to Vietnam. That would have stopped the party even if parenthood didn\u2019t slow it down. My birth let him off the hook. Now, most of today\u2019s parents are poor. So they don\u2019t hire babysitters and go to expensive, wife-swapping, coke-snorting, booze-swilling, card parties like their baby boomer grandparents did. Now parents stay indoors and play video games. They can socialize via the InterWeb, and deal with digital viruses versus biological ones. Now, moms sew custom slings so they can keep one brat on the boob and two hands on the controller. What\u2019s wrong with that? Nothing! Contact parenting is beautiful. Affectionate, appropriate, loving contact, given by Dad when the baby is cold or anxious, and by Mom when the baby is hungry or anxious, is the bomb! Adults should go to jail when they beat kids. They should go to jail when they touch children inappropriately, and while in jail for that horrific, disgusting, crime, they should, as they often are, be beaten until they piss and shit themselves, by adult prisoners who don\u2019t harm children. It seems that more parents got away with abusing and neglecting their children back then than they do today. My generation, \u201cX,\u201d had to deal with two working parents. This was new, and there were not any where near the amount of child care and after-school programs that there are now. We were the \u201clatch key\u201d generation. If you are a youngster reading this, don\u2019t feel trapped by adult supervision. As long as they are doing nothing to hurt you, then you are better off than being left unsupervised. Your best friends will be the ones to hurt you, if you are left alone with them. Millennials are becoming parents. If they can stay clear of the opiate epidemic, and be faithful to their spouses, and be attentive, kind and gentle with their children, maybe they can show their parents and grandparents how it\u2019s done, and get the American family back on track! If they can\u2019t, we\u2019re all doomed. Dear Lord, Give these new parents the strength, the faith, the hope, and most importantly, the love, to properly raise up the next, greatest, generation. Amen ",
