            "answer_text": "A lot of answers to this question quote international rankings, which is a very dangerous game to play if you let it play a role in deciding where to study for a number of reasons Depending on the ranking, education may only be a small part of the assessment on which the ranking is based, so for using it as guide on where to study may not be ideal. For example several of the so-called little Ivy league schools in the US do not have a graduate program and as a consequence do almost no research (which would cost them a lot of points in some rankings), but in terms of teaching they are very good (and within the US quite competitive to get into).In some rankings reputation is taken into account, making the rankings self-enforcingInternational exposure is a large part of the ranking criteria, which means that in terms of actual academic achievement, universities in countries like Germany and France, which have a much stronger tendency to hold on to the local language (in France it is actively encouraged), are undervalued. For the same reason US and UK institutions are overvalued.More specialist places of higher learning can be undervalued (e.g. technical universities), in particular when \u2018completeness\u2019 of the curriculum is part of the ranking criteria. This is even applicable to e.g. Imperial College, which has no humanities department.Beyond the top 20, the differences within the rankings become marginal and a university at 50th place will not be much better than the one at 100th. Rankings that are field specific would be a better guide to distinguish.The best approach is to chose a school of solid reputation with a teaching philosophy that fits you best and do well. ",
