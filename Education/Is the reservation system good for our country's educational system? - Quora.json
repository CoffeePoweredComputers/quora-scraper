            "answer_text": "There was this recent incident in Kerala where a student of CET (College of Engineering Trivandrum) - one of the most prestigious colleges in Kerala and among the top 20 Engineering colleges in India - was run over by a fellow student of the same college, during Onam celebrations conducted at the college campus. While the incident triggered mixed responses from various corners of the society, with a group of people empathizing the incident stating it as an unfortunate, stand-alone accident that was blown out of proportion by the media, the others said the convict was behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol and was driving in a reckless manner with more than 20 people on-board the jeep which rammed the student to death. Let's keep the merits and demerits of this incident aside. Now it turns out that the culprit had scored an enormous rank of 50,000 or so in the Entrance examination but managed to bag a seat in the Institute under the merits of reservation. On one hand, you have a set of students good at academics, who manage to get into such institutes with their years of hard work and perseverance and supposed to be the country\u2019s future brains. On the other hand, you have such unsolicited souls who gain a back-door entry into such Institutions, doing every bit in what they are good at, only to spoil the reputation of the Institution - let alone the dreams and aspirations of the fellow students.  Having said this about our Engineering colleges, I really do not want to quote any incident from our Medical colleges, that could be scary for those visiting the hospitals! Do we really need such a system? ",

            "answer_text": "In 21st century when we are dreaming our country as a 'DEVELOPED NATION' reservation in higher education should be removed. As a result of reservation, many talented students are not getting chance to study in many reputed institute. Students who put in the best of effort to make it in the merit are disheartened if they fail to get an admission in a good college, this demotivates them towards study, that is why selection in higher education should be purely on merit list. I am not saying reservation should totally stop but government should change their policy of reservation. The reservation should be on income based not on caste based. There are many who belongs to the general category but don't have sufficient means for study. We can call them victims of reservation. Reservations introduced for the betterment and upliftment of the condition of SC/ST/OBC's not for punishing the GENERAL 's. ",
