            "answer_text": "With the right amount of dedication, time management and presentation, every answer script marks can turn out to be a high score. if you have studied with focus and along with enjoying the subject, scoring is not a big deal. Tip to study Physics: Go through NCERT book, It is the most important book for Physics board exam of class 12th. All topics in the syllabus for the exam are covered in the NCERT book.Practice each and every worked-out example, graph and diagram, especially- a) Ray diagram for Astronomical Telescope, Compound Microscope and Reflecting Telescope. b) Diagrams for few devices like cyclotron and potentiometer to name a few. Refer a supplementary book like Haliday-Resnick-Walker only if you do not understand a certain concept from the NCERT book and to practice more numerical problems. but remember your book is NCERT.If you do not like the numerical part, start early! Get used to the numerical part. Solve each and every numerical in the NCERT book (both, solved and unsolved)Those who have not good numerical skills need to prepare Semiconductor, Atom and Nuclei, Dual nature of radiation, Communication System and EM Waves which carry 25 marks. Focus upon Optics which also carry 14 marks. Current and Electricity also contains 7 marks.Do Analysis of the Previous 10-years Question Paper. For this try \u201cOye Exams \u201d App available at google play store.Make a complete list of derivations, formulae and experiments in your syllabus and keep that list handy.Practice hard on direct formula and theorem based questionsSome of the important topics in Physics, for class 12 CBSE exams are (As per weightage): Optics (Both Wave and Ray optics) \u2013 14 marksElectrostatics \u2013 08 marksMagnetic effect of current and magnetism \u2013 08 marksEMI and AC \u2013 08 marksCurrent electricity \u2013 07 marksElectronic Devices \u2013 07 marksAtoms and Nuclei \u2013 06 marksCommunication systems \u2013 05 marksDual nature of radiation and matter \u2013 04 marksEM Waves \u2013 03 marksMost of the students spend a lot of time on electrostatics and magnetism leaving behind all these chapters and this costs a lot because the weightage of every section is critical and should be prioritized accordingly. Best of luck ",

            "answer_text": "Don't take tension ! preparing for school exams is not so tough ! Just see the previous year papers and observe the pattern ...First be thorough with the chapters you have already glanced before and then act according to time ! First complete easy and short chapters ... Don't focus on such chapters which are very hard and long / short bcz the probability of losing marks will be greater in those chapters !! For such chapters memorize and practice the conventional questions ( last 3-5 years ) .... Practice numeeical questions from ncert book for sure !! If you have time at the last moment of about 3-4 hours make sure you have sufficient sleep about 4-5 hours and try to revise instead of beginning a new concept !! And most importantly never try to recall or discuss things on your way to school Because if you fail to recall then there are two disadvantages ... Firstly you will confuse a lot in your examinations and secondly your confidence will go down !! Keep calm and be confident ! (Going to the toilet sometimes also releases pressure ) I was also a last night worker and this worked for me !! Hope this works for you as well !!  ",
