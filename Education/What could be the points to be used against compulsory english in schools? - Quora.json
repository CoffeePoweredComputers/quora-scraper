            "answer_text": "Take the example of China and Russia. They prefer their own language in school than English. They have their own search engine and they study everything in their own language including science. According to me, learning anything in their local language can help students understand concepts easily and thoroughly. This can educate more students with low dropouts as learning becomes easy and comfortable. Learning anything in English adds the burden of learning the language first and then proceeding to other subjects which primarily focuses on English as a platform for learning. ",
