            "answer_text": "Yes I agree with most of you and rate Virtual Classroom Software for Live, Online Classes | WizIQ one of the top online teaching tools. I found  it is easy to use and it is compatible to teach any topic, no matter how difficult it may sound. It was interesting to note that author of Scrivener For Dummies, Gwen Fernandez also uses your platform to teach the same. Even the renowned Mike Klinger uses it to teach music to musicians but most of all, Dr Claudia Williams uses it to teach Clinicians about creative arts as well as traditional therapies to meet mental health needs of children proving your teaching platform is indeed versatile enough to teach any subject under the sun!

            "answer_text": "Well, the question seems incomplete because a variety of online courses and teachers are available for online education. If you are looking for a single platform where you can find teachers and study material for school education you can choose from the list given below: Mathletics (for Mathematics)Duolingo (Language learning)Stile Education (Science)Lemonade Stand (Entrepreneurship)Bamboo learningBiology Simulations.For preparation of all competitive exams you can go for self learning platforms like: UnacademyGradeUpmoodleUdemyCourseraMasterclassAlways keep in mind all teachers are good, it\u2019s the hard work and perseverance of a student which makes him/her an achiever. A brilliant student is always self sufficient and not dependent on teacher for completing the course or syllabus. A more clearer answer to this question would be possible if the question was complete. Hope this helps. ",
