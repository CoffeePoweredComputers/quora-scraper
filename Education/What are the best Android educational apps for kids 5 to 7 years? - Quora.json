            "answer_text": "One app I can recommend from personal experience is the KidzByte App. KidzByte is a really good app that can help your children increase their knowledge of the world around them. Curated Content is uploaded 7 days a week across categories like India and World, Science and Discovery, Technology and Gadgets, Sports and Entertainment, Fun and Learn, Health and Lifestyle, Weird and Wacky, Education and Career. And it's not just a news app for kids, the app also has contests, quizzes and prizes to encourage engagement. Here\u2019s more about the app. Language Skills - The app helps to promote a daily habit of reading, increases a child's vocabulary, the audio or 'read-to-me' feature helps to learn the correct enunciation and pronunciation of words. While the app is meant for kids between 9 to 17 years of age, the content is written to suit the reading level of a 12 to 16-year-old which means that every user no matter the age has something new to learn in terms of language development and skills. Prizes and Contests - Like I said, not just a news app. KidzByte has a host of contests. To participate and win, kids need to collect points. And one crucial way to collect points is to answer quizzes, which they need to read the articles for. The contests include - Daily puzzle-based contests, a Weekly Topper contest to collect the most points, and the biggest contest called 15 Under 15 where kids need to earn 50,000 points to win prizes like an Xbox, a Lenovo tablet, a Kross bike and more. There's no better feeling than earning something you've worked hard for, right? These contests teach kids to put in an effort to reap the rewards - steadily collecting points by reading and answering quizzes every day. ",
