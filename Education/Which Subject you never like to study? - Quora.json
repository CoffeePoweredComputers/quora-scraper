            "answer_text": "I have always shown apathy towards physics. It is surely one of my weakest subjects but some days , i find biology boring too, so it depends upon the day i guess. Physics generally is a bit conceptual and many can\u2019t grasp the concept at the first glance. Biology for me is really easy but sometimes memorizing all the details and examples will surely make a person feel tired and bored. Especially in class 11th, you take a giant leap into detailing especially in biology so you ought to memorize a lot and even if you understand, it will be really hard to memorize the plethora of examples given in NCERT. So , in total my least favourite subject to study will always be physics but i got to study it anyway\ud83d\ude14 ",
