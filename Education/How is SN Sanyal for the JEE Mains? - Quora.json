            "answer_text": "If talking about Mains, surley its quite a high end book. It has all the reactions covered that are in the Mains syllabus. You can refer it for theory for Mechanisms. Still it's not quite the book for Organic Chemistry. If you are a coaching goer and the teacher there is nice then the class notes should suffice. For practice u should consider solving your coaching materials and then Himanshu Pandey. If at the end you have covered Organic very well and are targeting Advanced go for MS Chauhan . I once used SN Sanyal just for referring some rearrangements that are solely in JEE Advanced syllabus. For non coaching goers grab a good book for theory like Indian version of Morrison and Boyd or LG Wade. Keep NCERT at your tips{applies for everyone}. This should be your first book for Theory. It will be the biggest helper. For practice again you can go for Himanshu Pandey. ",
