            "answer_text": "Being in the first batch does play some role in enhancing the chances of getting through IITJEE. But then, that's not the only factor. In fact , the chances of getting through the examination depends on the factors like determination,academic discipline and hard work,rather work hard in a smart way. Students in first batch are more dedicated towards their preparation when compared to students in the other batches. That's because,they prepared well for the Reshuffling Test so that can get into first batch. And that determination is seen even after they get into first batch. Let me tell you about my experience when I was in FIITJEE, VISAKHAPATNAM. At present I am enrolled in One Year Extended Program in the same institute. Even I am in first batch now.I was in 3rd batch in the Pinnacle program.Students in the 1st batch were serious towards their preparation for JEE. They used to work a lot . But there were who were not serious about JEE . Those students just worked to get into 1st batch. Such students wont get desired results. Each batch was of 42 students out of them at least 30 students got into decent IITs in 2015. So what i want to say is , the determination you see in the first batch students will make you study hard. Being last in a batch is never a good feeling especially when you are in a highly competitive batch. That will make you study. The teachers teaching in 1st batch also matter. Generally, subject heads teach the 1st batch students. They take care good care of the students. That will also make you study,unless you want them to complain to your parents about your poor performance. But yes, some students may perform really bad on the day of examination. That day, actually decides our future. So many factors like nervousness, tension play a role in affecting your performance in the exam. As a result a few students may end up with a low score. The topper of the batch is as vulnerable as the last ranker on the day of examination. Anything can happen on the day of exam. You need to keep calm. Fiitjee will take care of these things while training their students. So in which ever batch you are in. You have to put effort that is required and the barriers of the batch wont matter at all.All you need to do is to keep focus on your target and try to rectify your mistakes in the exams that you attempt in the institute. All students must do it irrespective of the batch they are present in. That's all I can say. Happy Preparation !!! Bon Voyage !!!You can message me if you have further queries . ",

All the players were asked to drop their identities that they are Chandigarh topper etc. If you want to score better, you need to think raw and work hard for it. Don\u2019t think that being in top batch guarantees your selection. This thought will reduce your efforts and you wont put your 100%.. The best coaches are found on ground MANY TIMES (Like Milkha Singh found one). So just work hard and the best will happen to you. JEE TIPS : Essentials you need to take care of which often people miss to follow.. Giving your 100% and believing that YOU CAN DO IT.Personal attention from a trained facultyA good and huge competition from others in coaching. If you are studying in a small coaching, then join a test series for it.Maintaining a very cool attitude still giving 100%.Solving doubts of other people around. It is very true that whatever you give, increases many fold in your own life. Example: Spread smiles and smiles will come back.Studying in target based manner and not time based. Never look at the time. Have a target (like 100 questions a day) and give your best to achieve it.Appearing for a test series and improving in it each time. Analyzing your mistakes in it is very important..Watch my recent video on our youtube channel (Satnara IIT AIIMS Academy) to know exactly what to do in exam time..

But there were still some of them who were not able to qualify and there were some who did but with not a very good rank and hence considered to select another college over IIT (branch matters).But one thing that a top batch ensures is that you will be in a good company with many brilliant students around which will always motivate you to work harder and perform well. There will be some good discussions and other students can also help you! Knowledge is not to just grab but to share as well. In the end I would just say that being in a top batch proves that you are one of the best among a group of children but doesn't guarantee anything. Just focus in your preparation and try to learn as much as you can! All the best! ",

Although being in a top batch of fiitjee isn\u2019t a cup of tea for all you definitely have a good ability high IQ and do hard labour to get into one of them batch..! but what if you get a top batch and you stop studying and start involve in different things which is lead to distraction? simple.. you\u201dll never get into IIT. IIT-JEE never ask you that which was your coaching and what was your batch they judge you only by the papers and your exam marks..! Please stop thinking like that and trust me it\u2019s never late.. start from today do more labour give best and stay in healthy environment and at last you\u2019ll surely ended up in a good college..

I liked the classes a lot, they were simple, conceptual and were easy to understand. We were given archives, packages, cpps' and quizzes to be solved. I liked them and was content with all that I got. Then there was a reshuffling test and I went to the cmp batch.. Initially i saw that a lot of problems were discussed and lesser time was given to theory\u2026to be honest, I did not like them at first. However, later I found out that it is the question that helps you understand things better and helps you evaluate your conceptual clarity. I doubt whether I could be in IIT without the cmp batch. But I am sure that if someone would have told me about the importance o of relevant questions\u2026. Without Even being a part of cmp 1 I could be in IIT definitely. However cmp batches have their own disadvantages too\u2026.a lot more than what is required is taught which wastes your valuable time. The only thing you have to do is practice relevant questions. Previous year jee advance questions are a good source of relevant questions. ",
