            "answer_text": "On a physical level, most children are not capable of having sex. It may cause significant damage.Most kids don't understand what sex is, and are too immature to understand the possible consequences - i.e., sexually transmitted infections and, if they've started puberty, pregnancy.Sex is an emotionally vulnerable act that requires very good communication skills and comfort with one's own body. Most children are not sure what's good for them and what isn't, and most can't communicate well enough to have a fully consensual sexual encounter.",
