            "answer_text": "90% in Physics and Chemistry is not a very big deal now a days! You'll see every other person scoring 90 above in CBSE Boards ( i don't know about 11th because I was an ISC student ,though we had the same syllabus for PCMB). Most of the people suggest Pradeep for both Physics and Chemistry but I genuinely dint connect with these books. I thought to try some well organised books in my initial days of 11th . I went for SL Arora for physics and Modern ABC for chemistry and today I feel proud that I made the right choice. I followed same for 12th also. Coming back to your question, you may follow any of the books which suits your personality, your mental framework and your understanding pattern but don't switch in between the sessions even if your teachers asks you to do so. Nobody knows you better than yourself. I request you to follow the points I am mentioning below and you'll definitely score above 90: Whichever book you choose, go through its theory ( only the points which are there in your syllabus if you are not preparing for any competitive exams).Solve all the solved examples.Make your own notes , which may include the simplest language that can make you understand even the most difficult topic within a click.After completing a chapter write the topics that were in the chapters and paste that before the first page of your notes, it is going to help you at the last moment.And the last one, enjoy your school life. Don't be a book worm, break some rules, break some records and make your teachers and parents proud by scoring well. That's how you'll be remembered by your school.Hope it helps you. All the best!!

            "answer_text": "To get good grades in physics and chemistry read the textbook four times and make short notes and keep on revising them till the exam day. If you don\u2019t keep on revising the notes you will forget them and ultimate result will be nothing. For physics you should refer many videos on YouTube as reading the textbook won\u2019t give much conceptual clarity. In physics many times we feel that we know the concepts very well but when it comes to problem solving we fall behind. So make sure that you understand the concepts well. After that keep on working out problems from textbook and previous year questions. If you want you can have One reference book also but don\u2019t make the mistake of following tools many books. Follow one book and keep on revising it. For chemistry your textbooks are more than sufficient. It is important to know each and every corner in the textbook.The key to get good grades in chemistry is constant revision. Just do all the textbook and previous year questions. All the best for your exams. Please upvote. ",
