            "answer_text": "Devoted teachers who keep updating their knowledge of the subject they teach and bright students who thirst for knowledge. These are the two essential basics of education. Add to this, well-equipped science labs and computer labs for gaining practical knowledge. In this kind of environment, leave alone the bright students, even the not-so-bright students will be benefit. Let our governments, central and state, and private educational instituions, strive to give the best education to all our students in the south, north, west and the east of the country. Let us not make a distinction here. ",
