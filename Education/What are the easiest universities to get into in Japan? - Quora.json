            "answer_text": "Japan does not have any easy universities to gain entrance. The highest acceptance rate that Japan has in a university is around 40% while in almost all the other countries there are always some universities with 100% acceptance rate and this pretty much tells everything. Also the application procedures in Japan are highly stressful and have multiple stages which include physical documents such as original certified true copies, subject test scores, letters of reference, interviews and generally require a very good background along with other requirements. Finally, the amount of international students that Japanese universities accept is very low (around 10 per year in each program) and the majority of them are usually asian from partnership institutions.

If by easiest, you mean the one with the lowest entry standards, lack of academic rigor, brain dead students, there are several in Kansai can think of. Entry is determined by scores on the central exam and by the individual schools. Dumber students will go to schools that have a lower bar for admission. Is that what you are after? ",
