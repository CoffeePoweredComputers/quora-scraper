            "answer_text": "Yes I Agree the higher education should not be compulsory. And why it should be? Does education makes sense to every individual on the earth, I mean to say there are hundreds and thousands of people who are not not enough qualified but are making good amount of money and living a luxurious life. Also, there are enough qualified people, let's say graduate and postgraduate are not earning as expected, and several are unemployed. Making high school as essential criteria will not solve the problem in any way. Quality of education has to be enhanced. Parents should focus on their kid's interest rather than forcing them to join the crowd. This will help them to work in there field dedicatedly. This was all about the interest and quality of the education system. But people who don't have enough money to pay their education fees, for them this high school criteria will become worse. At least, for now, they have hope, later it will also end. Talent is important to reach the heights, your certificates, degrees and trophies will not always make you win the race. ",

            "answer_text": "In the UK higher education is not compulsory in any absolute sense. However, it is effectively a largely non-negotiable prerequisite for entry to many fields of employment. Those conditions are largely set by employers, industries and professions, not the state. So, higher education is not compulsory, but depending on a student\u2019s aspirations may effectively be so. For example, I was a journalist for more than 20 years. I have a degree, but it was not a condition of employment when I applied for the first reporting job I was offered after university. Employers looking for entry-level journalists in the UK today for the most part specify a degree as a criteria an applicant must achieve to be considered for a job. So, higher education is both compulsory and not compulsory, depending on what one wants to do with one\u2019s life. I imagine that in effect employers today are prepared to waive their degree requirement in the case of otherwise suitable candidates. But in reality it is hard to get noticed by them without a degree, as one could say it\u2019s part of the \u201ctriage\u201d process employers use to whittle down long lists of applicants. I think higher education should not be \u201ccompulsory\u201d in any sense, but in reality that\u2019s hard to achieve when you\u2019re an employer. (In the interests of full disclosure, I\u2019m a university journalism lecturer). ",

            "answer_text": "I think higher education is not something which can be actually assigned as compulsory in one\u2019s life. Actually what we do in higher education we go deep in our interested topic and subject and learn the ins and outs of that subject and also learn the applicability which is more important from practical point of view. Like assume that till class 12th we study computer at a surface level and after 12th when we go for engineering courses we are made to study that in deep that is what actually the deepNess and applicability of topic is. So what is more important here is that how much interest you have in your topic and how much deepness you have in that and how much knowlege and applicability of that knowledge you have in that subject. There are number of person who have not continued their education but are at good post in their life just because of the specialisation they did in their interested subject. So actually what we need is that we should do specialisation and which is lacking in indian education system. Hope you would have understood Thankyou Regards Lakshya kumar ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. School education should be provided to all. However that should not be the case of higher education. Assimilating higher education requires aptitude and effort on the part of students. If they don\u2019t have the aptitude and are not putting in adequate effort, what is `supplied\u2019 would be wasted. (On the other hands, there are social benefits if all children are in schools even if some of them don\u2019t learn much). However higher education should be provided to all students who have the interest and aptitude irrespective of their ability to pay. A situation where only a minority can afford higher education due to the cost is not desirable. ",

If college were compulsory, it would (a) bankrupt a lot of families trying to afford it or drown them in student loans, and (b) it would diminish the educational atmosphere, as you\u2019 have swarms of students forced to attend who did not want to.
