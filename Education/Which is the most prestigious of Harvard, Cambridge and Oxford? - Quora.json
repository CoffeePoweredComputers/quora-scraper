            "answer_text": "It\u2019s got to be Harvard. Period. I know many people like to give neutral answers, but no brand name ripples across the whole of academia like that of Harvard. Harvard is to the academic world what Rolls Royce or a Rolex is to their respective industry. It is a household name. Notice how when you think of tennis you automatically think of Roger Federer? The Harvard brand has the same effect on people when they think about prestigious schools in general. Regardless of what you may think about the quality of education of Harvard, it is a brand that has no equal. Harvard has entered our vernacular as a noun that literally means \u201cprestigious university\u201d. i.e Stanford is the Harvard of the West Coast, Oxford is the Harvard of England, Beijing University if the Harvard of China. People have different perceptions of the group of universities which they regard to be the \u201cmost prestigious\u201d, but in almost every person\u2019s set, Harvard is an ever-present constant. I went to MIT, did an exchange at Cambridge, and graduated from Oxford. I can confidently say that in terms of international reputation, there is a great deal of variance with which people perceive these brands. Cambridge is more well-known in countries which has education systems affiliated with Cambridge. Think of Singapore and Malaysia, whose students sit for the Cambridge A-level examinations. Oxford is more prestigious than Cambridge in the US, because of the Rhodes Scholarship, and because of the publicity that came with Bill Clinton being President. Oxford and Cambridge are equally prestigious in Australia, where the concept of \u201cOxbridge\u201d is alive and well. MIT is only prestigious amongst those in specific fields, such as in engineering and computer science; but in these fields, people recognize MIT as having no equal. Regardless of which country, and what audience, however, people seem to consistently know of Harvard, and they consistently know of Harvard as the best university on earth; whatever \u201cbest\u201d means. Qualitatively, there is a lot to unpack. But in terms of sheer reputation and prestige, if Harvard claimed second place, nobody would dare claim first. ",

            "answer_text": "Growing up in England, I naturally thought that the Open University was the best and most famous university in the world. The Open University was on television, I had an Open University t-shirt and people were always talking about my Open University. Of course, I was very proud of the fact that my Dad worked for the Open University. Then one day, we went to visit some friends of my parents who lived in Oxford. (As it happens, one of them was a Cambridge graduate). My Dad told me that Oxford was even more prestigious than the Open University, because it is much older, and walking around those buildings did feel like walking around a castle. After that, I noticed that we had an Oxford English Dictionary, and that every year there was an Oxford versus Cambridge boat race, which Oxford always seemed to win. (Oxford had a winning streak for a few years during my childhood). Later, I heard about Harvard, Yale and Princeton, and I gathered that these were American imitations of Oxford and Cambridge. Of course, my perception is Anglocentric and biased. Since I was a child, Oxford has had a special aura. I\u2019ve no doubt that Americans are more likley to feel that way about Harvard than about Oxford - or perhaps some other American university. And it is hard to shake off this kind of thinking. But trying to look at things objectively, I now live in the Republic of Panama. Here, we have two high schools with Oxford in their name - the Oxford School, and the Oxford International School. If you want to buy a mini-cooper, you would go to Oxford Motors. (Of course, Oxford has a car factory as well as a university). On the streets of Panama, it is the name of Oxford that rings out. You could say that this is an example of selection bias, or you could say that this is a lesson that life has taught me. Learn and live! ",
