            "answer_text": "I absolutely think programming/scripting should be taught in school, and I even think it should be a mandatory subject. However, I do not believe software engineering should be taught in school, except as an elective. That\u2019s a leap I\u2019ve seen people make. I don\u2019t think we should try to force students to learn how to write the next big app or awesome server-side startup in high school. (As an elective, go for it, but don\u2019t force it.) So how exactly do we do that? I honestly don\u2019t know, but I do have some personal feelings: You should start in grade school with \u201cScratch\u201d or similar. Focusing on fun little games, and build towards a real \u201cproject\u201d at the end of grade school. Let them show off those projects to the younger kids!In middle-school, shift the focus to a REPL-capable language, but keep the overall structure similar. Mix in some computing fundamentals (RAM vs HDD vs SSD) and light history. Include I/O. Build again towards a project at the end of middle-school that incorporates everything.In high-school is when you can dip into meaningful distinctions between collections, some light theory, discussion of algorithmic complexity, functional techniques, recursion, utilizing multiple CPUs and why that\u2019s hard but important.Optional courses starting in high-school can explore specific niches like Software Engineering, Machine Learning, App Development, Web Development, etc. all with the goal of giving enough of a taste to help students decide if they want to pursue that topic more thoroughly.Computers are particularly cool because they mix the intellectual rigour of subjects like Math with the enjoyment students get out of doing something real in a hands-on way, like an Art or Industrial Arts class. In Math, you learn how to do problems, but it\u2019s not clear how that ever could be useful. That\u2019s the reason most of my classmates hated it. In Computers, you learn how to make something that solves problems for you, and can actually make something you enjoy like a game. Then in High School you shift the conversation towards the massive potential that computers have locked within them. We have watches more powerful than mainframes used to be - how do I access that instead of just treating it like a toaster with a \u201cgo\u201d button? Of course, therein lies the hardest problem - how do you keep course-content relevant? How much more powerful will computers be in 5\u201310 years? It\u2019ll require a much more fluid approach than most classes we teach today. ",

            "answer_text": "  As the son of a teacher and a systems engineer I can claim to be genetically qualified to answer. My real qualification is that I've raised two children to adulthood and I did try to teach them something about programming when they were in grade / primary school.  First, be aware that: Not every kid is going to be interested in programming.  You want an approach that will be of interest to a wide range of personalities.  You want them to take something positive away from the experience, even if they aren't the next John Carmack.[1]Children have limited attention spans and quickly lose interest in dry material.  The more you can make programming seem like playing a game, the better.[2]You don't want to rush with brains that are immature - for example, at 11, males may be less than halfway to their peak brain volume! [3] But it's a great time to teach because 11 year olds are approaching the second of their peaks in neuroplasticity.Bearing all of this and more in mind, when the time comes for \"hands-on programming\", the ESSENTIAL experience for kids is \"Scratch\" from MIT.  See scratch.mit.edu or see the review in the New York Times.[4] One of Scratch's strengths is that it  combines teaching with play in an environment that is highly creative and  can accommodate silliness.  If the experience is fun, there's more chance children will experiment with it when they're on their own or with their friends. A friend of mine has produced a stepping stone for kids who outgrow Scratch but are not quite ready for a grown-up language. A key feature is mobile support. See www.s2js.com Notes and Sources: John Carmack of id Software did the programming for a series of advanced computer games including Doom and Quake.I wholeheartedly agree with the other answers that recommend laying a foundation of logic and pseudo code.Lenroot, et al, \"Sexual dimorphism of brain developmental trajectories during childhood and adolescence\", 2007 http://www.boysadrift.com/2007Giedd.pdfWayner, P., \"Programming for Children, Minus Cryptic Syntax\", New York Times, 9 November 2011 http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/technology/personaltech/computer-programming-for-children-minus-cryptic-syntax.html?_r=3",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people have mentioned some really great resources here already. Obviously, there\u2019s no one single resource just yet that\u2019s THE BEST way to teach a kid to program, so you have to be involved and inventive. When you\u2019re teaching a kid to program, the two most important things are: Keep it fun. If it\u2019s not fun, they will resent the process, won\u2019t want to keep doing it, and their ability to learn how to program will be compromised.Assess their skill constantly. This point isn\u2019t as obvious but it\u2019s absolutely critical. Let me break down why this is so important by starting with the concept of flow.Flow and Game Design Flow is that wonderful state of feeling fully immersed in what you\u2019re working on. You\u2019re able to focus, feel involved, and enjoy what you\u2019re working on. If you can keep kids in a state of flow, without making it too easy or too hard, then they\u2019ll stay engaged and learning will feel fun. Flow is a core idea in game design, because a game needs to keep users in this state in order to keep them engaged and interested long-term.  This graph shows how narrow the flow zone actually is. In the lowest quadrant of the graph, where difficulty is low, it doesn\u2019t matter if your child\u2019s skill level is also low. But as the material becomes more difficult, it\u2019s easy to get off track. If the learner\u2019s skill progresses faster than the difficulty of the material does, then they\u2019ll get bored, but if the material gets too hard for them before their skill catches up, they become anxious and begin to dislike the process. Since being in a state of flow is fundamentally motivational, this is really the key to making sure that a child actually learns and remains interested in the learning process. How do you ensure that a child stays in a state of flow as they learn how to program? That\u2019s where mastery learning comes into play. Mastery Learning Mastery learning is an educational philosophy popularized by the influential educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom. The idea is that a student must prove that they have mastered a skill or concept before they can progress to the next level. If they haven\u2019t reached at least 90% comprehension when they\u2019re assessed, they are given additional instruction and practice until they hit that benchmark. One-on-one instruction, rather than the traditional classroom structure, is a key component to mastery learning, since no two students learn at the same speed or will ever be at the exact same place in the flow zone. Bloom proved in his 2 sigma problem that an average child who is individually tutored using mastery learning techniques will perform 2 standard deviations above average, compared to children educated in a traditional classroom. (One of the only true implementations of this philosophy right now is Kumon, an international chain of schools that teach math and language skills. At a Kumon school, there is no one curriculum that every student follows. Instead, teachers create individual learning plans for each student, which are updated regularly based on the student\u2019s progress. A student can\u2019t move on to new material until they prove that they\u2019ve mastered the material they are currently studying.) Assessment As you can see, the ability to constantly assess someone\u2019s ability in a very precise manner is the key to keeping them engaged and in the state of flow. No standardized, non-responsive learning experience can replicate mastery learning\u2019s individualized assessment techniques. There\u2019s not a perfect tutorial or app on the market right now because automated assessment hasn\u2019t been truly perfected yet. In most cases, kids using one of these tools will fall out of the flow state either because the material gets too hard and they don\u2019t want to do it anymore or it\u2019s not hard enough and they get bored. We at CodeFights have made a lot of headway in automated assessments in the past few years, but our focus is still on the top end of the learning spectrum. When it comes to early stage learning, for now, manual assessment is the only true way to accurately keep tabs on a child\u2019s skill level and to keep them engaged in the learning process. This means that you have to be vigilant about testing their mastery level, adjusting the material they\u2019re learning so that it\u2019s in line with their skills. That way, they are able to constantly stay in the flow zone and the process stays fun. While the process of using mastery learning principles and constant assessment to keep a child who\u2019s learning to program in a state of flow will take a lot more effort on your part than just plopping them in front of a browser with Scratch loaded up, it will pay off in the end. The child will remain engaged in the learning process and will be highly motivated to keep \u201cleveling up\u201d. If you\u2019d like to learn more about the topic, I recently gave a TEDx talk on making learning addictive. You can watch the video below:  ",

            "answer_text": "Programming in schools should be taught to fulfil two motives To help students take a base that would help them pursue carrers in programming later on.to develop problem solving skills in themFor the achievement of this, various methods can be taken at school level.        First of all, the correct languages must be chosen for students. It makes no sense to teach BASIC and LOGO at elementary level, and then jumping to Java or any other OOP language. Children who know only printing and inputting if all of a sudden are exposed to functions and objects and classes are bound to dislike that. Its like reading astrophysics without knowing anything about Physics !!!.     The basic thing is that though students get homework, most of the times, they copy the code from other sources rather than doing by themselves. You can't be with them all the times; thus if practice exercises are conducted in the class itself, it would ensure students solve problems on their own. However, be sure they are not peeping into that notebook in their bags or telecommunicating with each other :  I used to think programming is safe from the delimma of cramming. But I was surprised when I saw my classmates cramming codes of programes!!! There has to be stress on algorithm design before any teaching of programming language. This would ensure students to make algos for themselves rather cramming code.        Lastly, students must be motivated that they should remove the spider webs on their PCs and remove the dust on the monitor. Programming is a thing to be done on a PC. What's the good of creating a compiler in the mind when one already has a compiler in PC !!! ",

            "answer_text": "As a former software engineer myself and a homeschool mom, I have had quite a journey in teaching my kids to code. To answer this question, I would split the question to 2 parts. 1. Kids who are less than 9-10 years old These kids are not very comfortable with reading yet. Their motor skills are not well developed to enable them to type well. So, what is recommended typically is using some block based coding applications. Scratch and Learn computer science. Change the world. are some popular websites which use block based coding. While these websites build the logical ability of the kid, I would still consider them more like Math 2.0 rather than coding itself. These websites spend a lot of time on some foundational concepts in computer programming. They have some game based and fun exercises teaching variables, conditional statements, loops etc. I engaged my kids also quite a lot in this during their younger years. Their favorite website was Learn computer science. Change the world. What I learnt though is that these activities majorly contribute to building the cognitive skills and can be at best considered as Math 2.0, not coding. Programming is much more than just logic. Programming is the ability to talk to computers and think from the computer's point of view. It also includes familiarity with the history of how it evolved. It means the knowledge of the environment, networks, OS and much more. So, unless the child takes up to computers intuitively and explores on his own, it is very difficult to teach programming to him at this age. 2. Kids who are more than 9-10 years old This is probably where text based coding can be introduced to the kids. There are different schools of thought when it comes to this. Some people say python is probably the best place to start along with solving programming challenges. I feel this school of thought does not consider what the kid wants. Most of my fellow parents who subscribe to this school of thought also want their kids to become competitive coders yesterday. More often than not, this pressure has resulted in the kids losing interest in coding itself. My take is they should start with web development - html, css and javascript. This means the focus is more on expressing themselves through code rather than making it more like math. They can create fun websites and games. They can relate it to their real life - maybe create a quiz app to be used by their teacher or an e-greeting card for their friend. So, I have decided to do this and have enrolled one of my kids in a company started by some friends of my close friend who are IIM Graduates. You can check them out here. A New-age Online Coding School for Kids They have been in this industry for more than 10 years and I absolutely love their teaching methods and philosophy, so far. My kid is also loving it and it is so exciting to see him learn so many real world things like clean coding practices, code collaboration, understanding of GIT, setting up his coding environment etc in the first few months itself. Now, slowly he is getting introduced to problem solving using javascript and I am so happy to see him love this too. Given he hates math to some extent, this is a pleasant surprise. To summarize, web development is probably the right place for a 10 year old kid to start learning programming and I would recommend A New-age Online Coding School for Kids for the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Programming is a creative activity that any kid can engage in. Your child might not care about writing data processing algorithms, but they might enjoy creating games, programming music, designing websites, or just playing around with code. This time most of the parents like to enroll their kids in Online platforms of learning. There are many reasons for this choice. First one is that edtech platforms have emerged as better and trustworthy choice for learning new skills. Secondly, all the institutes are closed this time due to pandemic. Also in online learning, parents can keep an eye on their kid\u2019s learning and growth. So, teaching programming to kids Online is the best option. Best ways for teaching coding to kids :- Make them learn through games and puzzles.Learn easy languages in starting.Skip some conceptual part in the starting like Data structures and algorithms.Let them show their creativity.Motivate them to learn.Keep an eye if they are having interest in it or not. So for this, you can look out for online platforms that specialize in teaching coding to kids with all these ways. There are a few websites really good out there, but Whitehat Jr. is a kind of a stand-out for me. I find their courses to be creative and conceptual, leading to constant development of the child\u2019s basic knowledge about it, and improving it day by day. They also have a great curriculum, supported by an awesome teaching crew, thereby making the whole experience a special one to begin with. So have your kid, enrolled in such a platform and I feel that would be the best way for them to learn this wonderful subject! There are more sites that provide coding courses to kids :- Blocky.Scratch.W3schoolCodeacademy.Tynker.Conclusion :- According to research, the best online platform to teach coding to kids is WhiteHat Jr. 1:1 interactive classes and specialized curriculum makes it stand-out. You will find it the best one once you attend their demo class. Try it out. Happy learning!! ",

            "answer_text": "Programming in itself could be a very interesting topic if taught properly, it comples children to think creatively and out of the box. Children may not care as much for syntex or coding or algorithms itself, rather they would enjoy more in creating games, applications, or just playing around.  So here are some basic guidelines to make coding more entertaining and appealing: 1- Start with the basics; For younger kids go for basic coding languages, as they might not have as enhanced typing skills required, for this Scratch would work just fine. It has a very friendly interface, that attracts kids to play yet learn. 2- Lesser theory more practical; Kids tend to be more engaged in pictorial discription rather than in the old black and white methods of learning. So it's better to show coding and the working process than just telling them what to do, as we learn from our mistakes, and the best way to learn is to make mistakes. 3- Encourage them to make games, applications rather than stubborn coding; Coding for games, applications is more interesting. It's more satisfying because it's easier to code a whole game, than those lengthy never ending code projects. Don't burden them with the orthodox methods let them be, and let them create their own ways to learn. 4- Keep your adult knowledge to yourself; Conveying your knowledge to your children is the best way to teach them, but here's an exception. Give your kid the time to grasp the basis, common conventions about coding. Let them figure it out themselves. 5- Provide them with their own computer; Some parents must be against this norm, but you have to trust the process and your children as well. Let them have their own grasping time. Let them develop the sense of owing something and taking care of it, and then they would be engaged most of the times. So I also recommend WhiteHat Jr. for teaching your children coding, they are awesome at what they do. Checkout for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology has become such an inextricable part of our lives in the past few years, and soon, laptops, mobile phones and other electronic devices will become pervasive in every aspect of life. Learning to code will soon become the norm, and virtually every job position would require some extent of knowledge of programming languages, irrespective of the field or industry. Computer programming is highly pervasive, and we are already beginning to see it creep into other industries that rely on data and automation. Helping your child learn coding at a young age would equip them to be successful later in life, even if they do not pursue a career in computer science or engineering. It would also make a valuable addition to their resume or their skill-set. Many parents are reluctant to enroll their kids for classes in coding since they are already displeased with the screen time and screen exposure, given that kids nowadays are engrossed with television programs, video game consoles or games on tablets and mobile phones. The best way to teach students would be through interactive offline/online classes where they will be taught to code (live coding sessions), rather than by writing on paper and watching videos online. With the shift to online modes of education due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and the increasing number of jobs created requiring computer programming skills, there is a spotlight on ed-tech startups and platforms that impart the fundamentals of coding to children and beginners. WhiteHat Jr. is one such platform that offers a comprehensive curriculum split into five levels, based on the students\u2019 level of understanding. The courses are meant for students between the ages of 6 and 14, or older students in school as well. The classes are flexible and interactive, and the activities are gamified and enrapturing for the younger demographic. I would recommend trying out their classes (they offer a free demo session) and seeing if it suits your learning trajectory and goals. ",

            "answer_text": "Use mac to Create Something Fun Marius, Lucas, Lambert, Ethan, Andy, Peter, Grace, Elaine, Angie and Hal, ranging from grade 3 to grade 7, live in different places of the world. They are all my \u201cclose\u201d, in the sense of \u201cconnected over internet\u201d, friends, and enjoy building fun things on mac with their math and logic skills. They even push their code onto GibHub regularly like professionals. If they can do it so can your kids. You SHOULD NOT teach them too much of coding. The focus is on problem solving, reasoning, math skill, etc. instead of programming language itself. Set up a working environment, not much work actually, then you can start tackling math problems like \u201chow to centre a grid inside the larger rectangle\u201d, \u201chow to convert screen coordinates (123.0, 234.0) to logical coordinates (3, 5) of chess board\u201d or \u201cwhat features I want to add into my apps\u201d. Let me show you some examples first. Ethan made his first app without writing a single line of code. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Ethan had only \u201crectangle\u201d.  Marius loves chess so much. He was so eager to build his own app to play with.  Lucas used an image of a piece to show whose turn.  Lambert had a much deeper understanding of coordinates system after drawing a game board.  Andy created a 14x14 gomoku board. He had to figure out how to centre the grid using his mathematical still. A simple for loop is needed to simplify horizontal lines and vertical lines.  Peter implemented connect 4 within a few days, completely on his own.  Grace added 2 text fields to save 24 game points for both players.  Elaine would play her snake game using 4 buttons.  Angie tried some circles after drawing lines. Letting each circle sit at right intersection turned out to be a small challenge to her.  Hal wrote tons of unit test cases to straighten out tricky logic of each rotation of layers in Rubik\u2019s cube.  Indexing 54 squares is not a small challenge to Peter.  Grace has a good sense of 2-D layout.  Sometimes they are just kidding.  Huge pieces  or normal ones,  everything is under our control. The big takeaway is that we only care about how to draw a perfect game board, how to centre the board on screen based on calculation instead of guessing, how to draw lines or shapes efficiently, how to sit each piece at its exact location, how to determine which colour square goes where when the Rubik\u2019s cube turns, ..., but NOT the computer, the programming language, the syntax etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to teach programming to children between the ages of 11 and 17 at a summer program at MIT (hooray for jobs which pay for college).  For those kids it was never as much about the tools which they used to program but in getting their attention on a project which they will really love.  One of the most successful ways to do this was to have them program a little RPG game.  First just do it with if statements where it reads from the command line a one line command and selects which branch to follow.  Then eventually the child will ask for items or begin the highly intensive process of trying to make something which resembles a physical map using only if statements.  This is a good time to introduce objects/structs/whatever.  Finally you can introduce libraries when they ask to do things like display pictures.  After this they normally have the basic idea and it is just about supporting them through interesting projects (and occassionally suggesting some when they run out) and teaching them important constructs along the way.  Have a whole bunch of projects, and don't be upset if the kid doesn't like your first project suggestion. Another rather popular tactic for the high school crowd is to teach them how to program their graphing calculators.  A good intro to this is something as simple as a fake basic screen which will give them the wrong answers when they try to calculate math problems.  Kids really love being assholes to one another and find this really hilarious. ",

            "answer_text": "My first thought is this: If he is going along fine and hasn\u2019t learned programming yet, he may just not like programming. It depends how old he is. If he has never been exposed to it, we don\u2019t know if he will like it. If he is in high school, I\u2019d say the odds are good that he just doesn\u2019t have much interest. He has seen it around and hasn\u2019t gravitated towards it. It\u2019s just not his thing and forcing him will never work with such a mentally demanding hobby. Programming is a mentally challenging activity, but it is also a creative activity. It is something like doing math problems with art supplies \u2026 or making artwork with math supplies \u2026 something like that. It takes an eye for design, a feel for efficiency, an intuition for algorithms, fairly sharp math skills, and a brain that can hold a model of an idea very clearly and mold it like clay. It isn\u2019t for everyone. If your son is young, like 5 or 6, then you are at the perfect time. His curiosity will never be so fresh and unspoiled. My dad just bought a computer, showed me a few programs, and gave me a book. I was about 6 years old and I just loved it. I learned how to read this difficult book. I copied other programs. I changed them and learned on my own how they worked. I had extremely limited resources (like 2 books \u2026 one on BASIC and one on DOS), nobody in the world to ask, no website to look at, no forums \u2026 nothing. And my dad was the type who just left me with those 2 books and let me figure it out. Later, he brought home some books about databases, C compilers, MASM, and Pascal. I went to the library and bookstore and ended up finding a book about computer graphics. I learned about projections and matrix translations and all sorts of crazy stuff by the time I was 10. So it is a great way to learn \u2026 but it takes tremendous focus and causes terrible frustration. But this was in the 1970s. Things are so much easier now. The main problem now is that there is too much information and a great deal of it is foisted on us by people who do not know what they are talking about. If you are a programmer, you will know the good YouTube channels. YouTube is a godsend for anyone learning anything!! It is much more efficient than books when you are trying to get past the beginning stages of learning that are so agonizing. It is just painful when you know so little that you can\u2019t even figure out the words to Google a subject! Podcasts are great if you wan\u2019t to learn while exercising or driving or just doing other stuff. Most of the coding \u201cacademies\u201d are geared towards adults and i doubt a kid would enjoy the ones I\u2019ve seen. From a teacher perspective, I think Khan Academy is very good. The main thing is to do your research. Read blog posts, watch a few YouTube videos with your son, check out local coding / robotics / drone building clubs. That is where the other computer nerds hang out. IMO, avoid video games as much as possible. They are horrible time sucks and the little bit you might accidentally learn is completely offset by the huge waste of time and brain atrophy. The best way to understand something is to break it and put it back together a different way. ",

It is helpful to relate programming to similar activities, such as creating a recipe.[1] For activities with young children, one may choose a language specifically designed for such an audience to learn, such as LOGO. There are many successful ways to teach our kids coding, and so I recommend that you research cost and availability in your area, and choose a method that best matches the audience of children in your area. Depending on the criteria, you will find the best method. Certainly one-on-one interaction between a proficient teacher and a single child will provide an excellent experience, and having opportunities for programming as part of a group is also useful, so you need to consider what resources are available to you.

            "answer_text": "Coding is one of the most powerful tool in todays era of Artificial Intelligence. No doubt coding is also one of toughest and the most brain storming thing that one can do. Researchers have found that coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them. Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future. Coding helps children with communication, creativity, math, writing, and confidence. However, the best way to teach your kids something is by not forcing them into it. Firstly, get your kids interested about how these softwares and games that they use in their daily lives really work. Secondly, introduce a particular programming language to them. Javascript, Java, Python, C++, are all languages you\u2019ve probably heard of, and each is used with different goals in mind. Here are some details: Scratch is a block-based coding language that offers a visual learning experience as kids can drag-and-drop code \u201cchunks\u201d to build characters and games.JavaScript is used for things like websites and other client-facing applications. Most any interactive website or game you\u2019ve come across utilizes JavaScript.Java is one of the most popular and widely-used languages. Actually, how about this...Minecraft? Heard of it? It was built in Java, and with Java skills, kids can learn how to build and incorporate their own Minecraft mods.Lua is a great language for game programmers. And if your child is more about Roblox than they are Minecraft, Lua is used for Roblox coding, and be used to create a game in Roblox.Thirdly, take some trial coding lectures on various coding platforms . The one that I would love to recommend you is White Hat Junior . I tried it for my son. It has really amusing and intriguing online classes for young coders between the age of 6-14 years. My personalized experience with this EdTech platform has been really exciting and great. The platform is innovative designed with an eye of what kids will loveThe teacher we had was encouraging and really fun.The homework after each assignment was really very helpful.We loved the hats they awarded for punctuality, etc.We loved the dashboard showing how far we\u2019ve come.Homework is keenly checked by the teacher and the feedback is provided.",

As a parent who spent thousands of dollars to support my son\u2019s love for coding and how much he wanted to learn, it took a lot of trials and errors. It was only last year when we found out about WhiteHat Jr, all thanks to forums like this one. So I\u2019m here to give back to this wonderful community by telling you about what worked for my son. A couple of years back, after watching a coding video documentary on YouTube, my son decided he wanted to learn how to code. He wanted to create games, apparently, because he said those games available in the AppStore are for babies or are just too easy and quick to complete. Being the supportive parent that I am, and after seeing so many successful tech and coding stories, I helped him look for effective ways to learn. No, they didn\u2019t have coding classes in school except for a few hours\u2019 worth of lessons in their computer class. First, he tried learning from YouTube. He got pretty much the idea of how things work and he seemed to understand how to code, but he can\u2019t seem to do it on his own by simply watching a video. Then those apps that cost real serious money overtime with all those premium offers weren\u2019t much help either. Finally, I gave in and decided to get him into a real coding class. Since there aren\u2019t any coding schools near our home, we looked online. We found WhiteHat Jr. With live online sessions, one-is-to-one, my son finally had the chance to ask questions and get real answers. I saw how excited he was. For the first time ever, he built a simple game and another simple app. Yes, they are simple, but my son is only 10 years old. This is a huge milestone for him. I truly believe that the best way to learn how to code is by having a real instructor around. There are tons of coding information online, but it\u2019s hard to determine which one is real and credible. It is best if there\u2019s an actual teacher who will be willing to help. A child, even if he\u2019s very smart, still needs proper guidance. We are happy we found that in WhiteHat Jr. ",

Fortunately, in the last few years, a number of apps, software, and guides have been produced that make the often-complex subject of computer coding easy to grasp for young learners. Programming Tutorials From Made With Code by Google: Google's Made With Code project has a mission of encouraging girls to pursue careers in computer science. The Made With Code projects are easy to follow, and if your kids are completely new to coding, don't fret. There's something for both intermediate and beginning coders. Plus, there are even more tutorials in the Resources section with new offerings released periodically.Resources for Parents From MIT Media Lab's Scratch Team: Scratch is one of the most popular coding tools for kids, and it's designed to help students with little to no coding experience dive headfirst into programming. Essentially, the software lets students create animations and stories with building blocks that mimic the structure of computer code. Luckily, the team behind the software has made it easy for beginners. There's a wonderful web-based beginners' guide that will help students get started, or you can download a PDF version.Courses on WhiteHat JR: WhiteHat Jr is one of the best platform to learn coding and programming. It gives students the best learning experience. It has well designed courses according to the age of the students.Games are fun programming projects: Programming video games is a common starting point for many young coders. Angry Birds, Minecraft, Flappy Bird, Five Nights at Freddy's, and other games are prime sources of inspiration. I've written a free book, Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, which demonstrates coding concepts with the complete source code for several simple game projects (Tic Tac Toe, Hangman, etc.).Show source code for actual programs. Don't just talk concepts at them: Despite its intellectual reputation, programming is a hands-on skill that requires practice, more than just reading books. Python's interactive shell encourages experimentation to find out what instructions do.Tynker's Hour of Code Free Activities: Tynker is a fun, intuitive suite of games that make it easy for kids to learn basic \"computational thinking and programming skills.\" Their Hour of Code feature is a great starting point for jumping into all that the site has to offer. Plus, be sure to check out the Parents section for ideas and tips to get started.Lessons and Tutorials From Code.org: Learn today, build a brighter tomorrow. was launched in 2013 to advocate for wider access to computer science learning in schools and for underrepresented students of color. In addition to their advocacy efforts, Learn today, build a brighter tomorrow. has posted several useful lessons that are great to share with your kids. Aside from popular lessons like K-8 Introduction to Computer Science, there are links to informative tutorials from a variety of sources.Best Apps and Websites for Learning Programming and Coding: This resource from Common Sense Media, featured on their Graphite platform, provides insightful reviews of popular programming tools. All of the reviews on the site are by teachers, and they're based on ease of use, quality, and engagement, among other criteria.Computing Lessons on Khan Academy: Khan Academy's self-paced courses introduce a number of fascinating coding concepts to kids. From learning the basics of computer programming and animation, to more complex computer science subjects, these lessons are the perfect jumping off point for curious students.

            "answer_text": "First, start with drag and drop. This is very important since it teaches kids the principles of control flow, types, and thinking about abstract concepts as instruction sequences. Choose a good one, too, like Scratch. Second, start teaching them Python or JavaScript. These are good beginner's languages, where they don't (fully) have to worry about types. Python is especially good, because it cements the concept of proper indentation (as in, more than an optional to be applied later). Finish with a decently sized project for a beginner, such as a calculator. Third, begin a statically typed, strongly typed language that is more complex than what they've been working with, but not completely off the deep end. If your end goal is high-level, use Kotlin; if your end goal is low-level, use Rust. Make sure you know whichever language you're choosing before you teach it. Again, finish off with a project. The whole way: Explain every concept before you use it, explain not only what, but also how and why. Students should never feel like they are copying down what you said without understanding it.For that matter, impress upon them that if any student doesn't understand something, no matter how silly, they must, MUST seek help from you if they can't figure it out. Even the quiet students. Because they need to understand what they're doing and why, so they can break down the individual principles and concepts and reapply them. At no point do you ever want programming by superstition.Make sure they use good formatting. If you implement multiple projects, add a smallish point section to them for formatting. Best to nip this in the bud early.Use good editors. For Kotlin, only IntelliJ IDEA is acceptable. If you use Python, try to get an educational license for PyCharm; if JavaScript, do the same for WebStorm. There isn't a good JetBrains IDE for Rust, so if you go down that path I would say VSCode with the Rust plugin (not RustyCode) installed.Make sure to take enough time. Programming is slow learning the first part, and takes a while to speed up.There's probably more, but I can't think of them. Happy teaching! ",

            "answer_text": "I started teaching myself around 10 years old. First, I bought books on Visual Basic and just started hacking together stuff that I found.  It was very discouraging as I didn't understand the fundamental ideas behind loops and conditional statements yet. Here's how I would have taught my younger self if I could go back: Start with pseudo-code.  They already understand math, so teach them conditional statements and write short loops that they can practice with on paper first.  Once they've got a good handle on the logic that computers use to tell when to stop running a loop, it will make a lot more sense to start coding.Use the simplest language and interface possible.  When I got to college, they started us out on Matlab. It was nice because the compiler was built in and the language is very forgiving.  You didn't need to write functions and pass variables, you could just type a line of code and it return the results without need for you to learn output syntax.Make each lesson produce something useful.  The thing that bugged me most was that when I started, I didn't want to learn how to make the computer just say \"Hello World.\" I wanted to solve some problem or calculate the number of lego bricks in my castle, haha.  Find a way to show them the real world problems they could solve if they learn to code.Teach them to Google.  I eventually quit buying the books because now you can use Google and Stack Overflow to find just about anything you need to know.  This is by far the most useful tool in the modern programmer's toolbox because even if you code great in one language, you're bound to have to learn another at some point.",

Should I send my child for coding classes? There has been an increase in the number of parents sending their children for coding lessons. While it is a beneficial enriching skill to pick up, parents shouldn\u2019t stress their kids out simply because they want their child to get a head start. If you insist that coding is an essential skill, you can start by introducing coding toys to their playtime. This will show them that coding can be fun and engaging. Once they are comfortable and express interest in pursuing the skill, you can then sign them up for coding classes. This way, your kids will be encouraged to stick to it because of their own interests (and not give up halfway because they were forced to learn it). ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays, tech-based education is more popular than the traditional curriculum. Most of the parents love to join in online educational platforms to start their kid's programming learning.  To get outstanding outcomes, take a little extra time and create a master plan before starting. You should consider these issues in your plan: Age I think you could start early if you have a motivated child, and you have the time and expertise to work with them, maybe from 6-7 years. Perfect instructor and guidance Now decide who will instruct through your kid's programming learning process. If you have coding experience, that's fine. If not, then find some who can help your kid. Otherwise, go for an online platform. Choose a perfect platform, depending on your kid's age and capability. Lots of programming environments, camps and courses are available online for children. You can choose any of this platform to start your kid's programming learning: Online Based 1:1 live coding class (recommended) WhiteHat Jr (curriculum designed by IIT and MIT alumni)- You kid will learn to program in an online live class. An instructor will guide your kid through the programming course. WhiteHat Jr has four modules for 6-14 years kids. Some advantages: WhiteHat Jr will take the responsibility of your kid's learning and guide him to be a creator.Your kid will have an excellent understanding of responsive app development, game design, UI/UX, AI technology, machine learning, and Python programming.Simple enrollment process. You can book for a trial class form here.Some programming environments suitable for children Scratch (developed by MIT) - It's an excellent starting environment, especially for younger children, I would expect most kids 7-9 years old to start their programming learning. As a parent, you should have a proper understanding of Scratch. Otherwise, your kid may start randomly and may lose his motivation for learning. Code.org (developed by Microsoft)- Code.org is a fantastic work by some ex-Microsoft brothers, a non-profit organization dedicated to teaching kids to code. The App Lab and Game Lab of code.org are the popular platform to learn app development, and simple game design for kids. Blocky (Google platform for kids coding) - Using Blocky, your kid can learn Javascript, Python, Lau, and Dart programming languages. Kids like most Blocky Games and puzzle-solving. There are also some programming environments like PyGame, Kudo, Alice, GameMaker can help your kid. Here, Some other open-source programming learning platforms are not for kids but can help them a lot. Codecademy - Codecademy is another popular website dedicated to teaching programming. You can get some high-quality information about Python, Javascript Java, HTML, and CSS, etc. W3School - This website is another information hub for beginner programmers. You will get tons of valuable information about Python, Javascript (jQuery) Java, PHP, HTML, and CSS, etc. Arduino (Robotics)- Arduino is a robotics-based platform. It's not for the kids, but it can help your kid to grow interest in robotics and machine learning. You will also get valuable data from YouTube, Blogs, and the programmer's forum. You have lots of information and platforms to start, and these may confuse you. So, it's better to create your structure of learning for your kid. Bottom line You can start with an online-based 1:1 live coding platform (WhiteHat Jr), which will help your kid to grain the basics. Python programming could be easy to start advanced programming learning. Try to encourage your kid to practice programming problem-solving, because a programmer means a problem solver. Happy programming! Happy solving! ",

            "answer_text": "Programming is an extremely beneficial skill for students. No matter what your interest area is, it will be helpful for you later in life, if you know it beforehand. Kids can be taught in several ways and you should utilize only that method that would suit your target audience best. The methods are: Self-learning: Yes of course this is the best way to learn to code but\u2026 Yes there is a but. It is only helpful if your kids can keep themselves constantly motivated to learn a particular skill. It cant be like one of the movies you start and are unable to finish ever just because it has become a little difficult to understand. So getting the best books for coding won\u2019t be of any help unless your child is dedicated to learning.Tuition teachers: No, I am not self-promoting but I would say it is a good option only if you find someone with whom your kid\u2019s wavelength matches. If the teacher goes on teaching on their own without checking at regular intervals whether the child is understanding or not, it would be difficult for your child to learn. So you need to find the ideal teacher for your child (If someone like that exists? Yes they do)Online platforms: These are one of the best ways to teach coding to kids during this particular lockdown situation. When the schools are closed your child has more than ample amount of time to spare. It's best to search for a good platform that will be able to hold the attention of your child. I can suggest you a particular platform named WhiteHat Jr. which has now joined hands with Byju\u2019s. Together they are the best ed-tech platform in the world. Hence learning from this platform will be beneficial for your kid as well.Try out any of the options suggested and let me know which worked best for you. All the very best! ",

Believe me, it takes a whole lot of patience to teach kids so you need an experienced educator with seriously good coding skills. Kids also ask a lot of questions so it would be nice if someone is ready to give the answers to them anytime. This is something you can get from a coding school like WhiteHat Jr. Time and again, I would recommend WhiteHat Jr to friends and colleagues who have kids. A friend of mine already enrolled his son here and the child is very happy with his lessons so far. I don\u2019t have kids of my own yet but when I do, I would probably enroll them there. They have all the things I would have looked for in a coding school if I had the chance to study in one when I was younger. I was self-educated so I went through a whole lot of trials and errors. It wasn\u2019t an easy journey! And I wouldn\u2019t wish it on others. It\u2019s not like spoonfeeding kids though. WhiteHat Jr takes their lessons seriously. Kids would have to figure out things on their own too. The good thing about it is that the kids would get guidance from real experts who know what they\u2019re talking about. While this isn\u2019t necessarily a shortcut\u2014a full course is 144 classes, after all\u2014it eliminates so much waste of time because of trials and errors. Plus you can be sure they\u2019ll learn something useful in the future. Perhaps some of the things WhiteHat Jr students can look forward to is how they can build their own apps and games by the end of each course. Yes, even the beginners will gain enough skills to be game or app creators! Do check out the WhiteHat Jr curriculum. You can also book a free trial. ",

            "answer_text": "I've recently posted a snapshot of interesting options for parents and kids who want to learn how to code, design and maybe dabble in robotics: \"My latest educational obsession revolves around teaching kids the key tools for creativity and empowerment for the next 50 years: software development, design, and robotics. While a number of governmental and educational bodies have been publishing discussion documents on the subject (read: see you in 10 years or move to Estonia) - there a number of emerging online services and volunteer programs that can accelerate their introduction at home, in the classroom or even in your local community. Here's a snapshot of the current movers: Scratch - a wonderful software development environment for kids built by MIT. Very intuitive, it\u2019s a great tool to teach kids aged 7+ the building blocks of software development while creating their own animations and games. A fun way to start is to combine it with \u201cThe Super Scratch Programming Adventure\u201d, a comic-book like guide written by the LEAD project (Learning through Engineering, Art and Design) - thanks Hilary Mason for the suggestion! Coder Dojo - a movement to create free coding clubs for young people around the world. Taught and organized by volunteers who follow a \u201ckeeping it cool\u201d dogma, this is a must check-out if you\u2019re interested in either joining, organizing or teaching a local dojo. In the UK, a very similar program called Code Club is worth looking into as well. Schools should proactively seek our Coder Dojos or Code Club volunteers to run weekly after-school sessions. Khan Academy - Salman Khan\u2019s brilliant videos have been making advanced education free and accessible to everyone for some time. Computer Science is one of many tracks available and a great way to get started with design, animation and programming basics.  Codecademy &Learnstreet- while not designed for kids, Codecademy and Learnstreet make it dead easy to learn how to code. An hour a week will get any parent or teacher the fluency to support their learning kids (and why not, build your own games, apps or websites). Arduino - and finally, robotics. With the advent of Arduino, an open source hardware and software platform for the creation of interactive objects, a number of kids-centric projects have leveraged the technology to introduce kids to the principles of robotics. The recent highlight I\u2019ve come across is RoboBrrd, a cute bird robot that gives kids hands on experience with mechanical and electrical engineering, and programming.  On a personal wish list note, I\u2019d love to see a rich adventure game like environment where levelling up is achieved by learning principles of coding, design, user interaction, cryptography, machine intelligence and big data. Looking forward to seeing what Kuato Studios comes up with in this space. Alternatively, time to nudge a talented hacker and game designer duo to launch a new Kickstarter or Indiegogo project...\" ",

Especially for those who prefer to understand the concept of coding in a visual format rather than in a logical manner. However, there is one approach that I find quite useful to teach the kids in understanding the concepts of programming. And that is Pair programming. Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. - Wikipedia Using the same notion, I would usually group the class into pairs during the lesson. What I found is that they are able to achieve their learning objective in a shorter period of time through collaboration. I learned this when I was teaching the kids about coding with the inclusive card game, Duck Da Bomb, that my team have designed. The kids would work together to \u2018code\u2019 an algorithm to win the game and they have a ton of fun during the learning process. Personally, the best way to teach coding to children, is through play. \u201cPlay is our brain\u2019s favourite way of learning.\u201d\u2013 Diane Ackerman, Contemporary American author ",

From my experience, although we want to teach kids programming, many parents fear that early exposure to digital devices might be detrimental for a healthy development. There are tons of online platforms to learn coding but I will suggest some offline tools that does not require digital devices. Potato Pirates (card game featured above)Kibo (robot)Cubetto (robot)CSUnplugged (website with offline activities)Robot Turtles (board game)More importantly, programming is about developing a computational thinking mindset in kids. These tools help to get kids to think logically and critically. The skills they acquire will benefit them in all domains rather than just teaching them a specific coding language to develop a website or code an app. There is really no best way but you have to find out the most suitable way for the kid. One thing that I realized is most programming lessons/platforms is reduced to a kid interacting with the computer. Hence, I believe a good balance is to use card games to introduce a social element to learning programming. For beginners, you can start off with Potato Pirates and Robot Turtles to get kids excited about coding, argue with each other about validity of coding concepts and have fun while learning together instead of depriving them the emotional bond they can form with their classmates sitting beside them.

            "answer_text": "According to me the best way to teach programming to kids is to develop an interest in coding. Coding is not about learning syntaxes by heart rather it involves so much more like problem-solving, logic development, and reasoning skills. How kids are introduced to coding can either make them passionate about it or can result in developing a fear of coding in their brains forever. Hence, the selection of the right platform, curriculum, and tutors who can teach the concepts in an engaging and fun way is the key! WhiteHat Jr. focuses entirely on delivering highly engaging and interesting content for kids, which makes learning super-easy and simplifies for the kids of 6-14 years of age. Going to the next parameter, the topics covered in WhiteHat Jr. packages are remarkable. Along with brushing up the coding skills of the kids, WhiteHat Jr. also provides education on other cutting-edge technical skills. Mobile application and website development, AI, ML, Space Tech, and Robotics are some of the most sought after skills and concepts in the 21st century that are being covered by WhiteHat Jr.through its online coding platform. They have segregated their curriculum into 5 sections and the concepts become advanced along with the growing age of the kids.

            "answer_text": "I learned coding from my father, and I think he was the best professor in my entire life. He is the one who motivated me to become a python teacher, because according to him, teaching kids how to code is an art in itself. Unlike any other field, coding requires 50% of teachers' efforts and 50% of students' obedience. The toughest part is to develop an interest in students' minds. He would make me think and would ask me to generate a question key on that specific topic. Eventually, this practice helped me in becoming more curious about the topic. What?, why?, where?, when?, and how? are the basics of learning, and to be able to make kids ask questions is an achievement in itself. Nowadays, in most academic courses, coding is one of the major subjects. The only problem is the approach to teaching it. Generally, until 3rd or 4th grade, students are made aware of the organization of computers, which involves input and output devices and introduction to the CPU and memory structures of the computer and suddenly in grade 5, the students are bombarded with the functions, variables, loops, and iterations. It creates fear for coding in children's minds. Bless the technology, there are several platforms like whitehat jr, vedantu, toppr, khan academy, codemonkey, and so on, which are proving to be a boon in the terms of programming for kids. Some of them have really managed to understand the mindset of kids which is a vital factor in the field of teaching. If coding is being taught properly, it will not only help your kid become a good programmer which is the need for the tech-oriented world but also he will be able to think like a problem solver. Coding helps to build logic and encourages them to think out of the box. It doubles the speed of mental development. Encouraging your child to code can be proved to be one of the best decisions for them unless they want to code and bear interest in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Since programming requires a lot of practise and focus, it has to be taught in such a way that it is easily understandable and also stays in the kid\u2019s minds for a longer period of time. Making use of pictures, puzzles and things which can deliver the message by representing it pictorially, is one of the best ways to teach kids how to code. Most of the online training platforms use such methods of teaching because it is highly impactful and beneficial for a beginner. While teaching coding for kids, make sure that they take regular assignments and quizzes based on whatever they have learnt. Keep a track of their performance and clear their doubts regularly. Ask them to write down the important concepts/topics on a sheet of paper so that they can glance at it everyday and by doing so, they will be able to remember whatever they have learnt.  Make sure that they are enjoying and having fun in whatever they are learning. If they are disinterested, then do not force them. Give them freedom to do whatever they want to as childhood is the only age when a child can explore new things and learn from their experiences. There are many books about coding available in stores and online. Kids can refer to these books to gain more theoretical knowledge about the programming language, or just about coding in general. I think these are some of the best ways in which coding can be taught to kids. You just have to keep the following things in mind: Talk to your children before taking any decision.Enrol them in an online coding class so that they learn the basics really well.Keep track of their performance and do not force them if they are not interested.Get in touch with a mentor who can guide your child to learn coding.Buy a few books about coding so that the main concepts/theory can be referred easily.",

It helps them develop a better understand of their surroundings, allows them to gather information from printed materials, and provides them with a wonderful source of entertainment when they read stories and rhymes. Children develop at different rates, and some children will develop reading skills quicker than other children; however, what's important is that as the parent, you are keenly aware of your child's maturity and reading level to provide them with appropriate books and activities to help them improve. As parents, you are the most important teacher for your children. You will introduce your child to books and reading. Below we have some tips to help you teach your child to read. children reading and learning Teach Your Child How to Read Tip #1 Teach your child alphabet letters and sounds at the same time. Studies have shown that children learn best when they are taught the letter names and letter sounds at the same time. In one study, 58 preschool children were randomly assigned to receive instructions in letter names and sounds, letter sound only, or numbers (control group). The results of this study are consistent with past research results in that it found children receiving letter name and sound instruction were most likely to learn the sounds of letters whose names included cues to their sounds. When teaching your child the letter sounds, have them slowly trace the letter, while saying the sound of the letter at the same time. For example, if you were teaching your child the letter \"A\", you would say: \"The letter A makes the /A/ (ah) sound.\" Then have your child say the /A/ sound while tracing the letter with his or her index finger. children reading and learning Teaching a Child How to Read Tip #2 When teaching your child to read, always emphasize with them that the proper reading order should be from left to right, and top to bottom. To adults, this may seem so basic that anyone should know it. However, our children are not born with the knowledge that printed text should be read from left to right and top to bottom, and this is why you'll sometimes see children reading from right to left instead - because they were never explicitly taught to read from left to right. When teaching your child how to read, always emphasize this point with them. Teach Your Child How to Read Tip #3 Teach final consonant blends first. Teaching words such \"at\" and \"and\" can lead your child directly to learning words that rhyme with these. For example, for \"at\", you can have: Lat Pat Mat Cat Sat Bat Spat Chat For \"and\", you can have these rhyming words: Sand Band Land Hand Stand Bland Brand Grand and so on... You can start teaching blends once your child has learned the sounds of some consonants and short vowel sounds. You don't need to wait until your child has mastered the sounds of all the letters before teaching blends. Learning to read is a long process, but it doesn't have to be a difficult process. Broken down into intuitive and logical steps, a child as young as two years old can learn to read, and older children can accomplish even more. >> Click here to for a simple, step-by-step program that can help your child learn to read, and watch a video children reading and learning ",

It's simple, sure, but it teaches you all the same algorithms that modern, grownup programming requires. The new version of Blitz, BlitzMax, is even more modular and object-oriented, just like its fellow programming languages. These languages are perfect for kids, because they're easy to use, it's real, actual programming, and the results are instantly gratifying. Another way is by teaching robotics, because robots are just awesome to kids (well, and to everyone else). I wouldn't say this is the \"best\" way, though, because of all of the resources involved. It would be much more difficult on the teacher if programming were taught through robotics. If you are teaching kids programming at a very young age (0-9 years), they probably won't be able to do enough to get interested in it. I don't think kids can be interested in such abstract things at such a young age, and even if they were, I don't think this would carry over many years. They would look back on programming as a childish thing, rather than something \"adult\" that they managed to do. ",

One can know the proper syntax used in the HTML language, but what\u2019s the use of that knowledge if one doesn\u2019t know when to use it? At the end of the day, if one doesn\u2019t know what their ultimate goal is when they begin coding, they won\u2019t get anywhere. They need to know why they are coding. What they are solving for. It is only then they will use their previous knowledge (and hopefully, go beyond) to develop a plan on how to solve the problem.Time-management skills are also a very important set of skills to possess when coding. To help students code to the best of their ability,teach them how to take notes. As youngsters learn to code, they realize that coding is much like taking notes in class when the teacher is speaking fast, during which they must take notes in precise jots and leave out the vague ideas and filler words with which only time is wasted. They are taught to break everything down into the simplest form possible, hence, use more of their time for what truly matters. In their free time, they can highlight, underline and make additional notes in the margins. The concept of coding is no different. In short, teach students how to take notes before teaching them how to code to create a program. It teaches you to get to the \u201cbone\u201d of the problem.motivate them to manage their time better. Every time they get stuck, their trigger should be the reminder that those who take less time coding are better coders. That way, they will just want to get the task done, rather than cry about the life God chose for them. That doesn\u2019t mean one should spend less time learning more about what he/she loves, rather, use the time as effectively as he/she can. Treat each hour like the last hour. That will motivate your students to get as much as you possibly can done.show them how to use their creative thinking and logical thinking skills. Those who want to get the coding over with faster are better at coding, since they spend most of their time thinking logically and creatively while coding. They think logically to write in a language the computer will understand. They take the logical information the computer needs and think about how to take all that information and turn it into something that suddenly makes sense. They use their creative thinking skills. They turn off the rest of their brain and senses and focus only on one task. Generally, they work smarter, not harder.There\u2019s no doubt about the fact that coding allows one to enhance his/her computer-use skills. Just like I mentioned (several times) before, having a ton of information in your brain is practically useless when you are not able to use it. Programming helps students get better at using computers and other kinds of technology. It is a good idea, though, to create a PowerPoint Presentation of some sort to introduce students to the differnet terms they need to know and the different parts of a computer. They master what they\u2019re using so well that one day, they are capable of obtaining power over that piece of technology, and many more; enough power to tell the machine what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.This last one may seem a bit confusing, since many believe that coding means sitting in a quiet room all by yourself and typing away. Some say it\u2019s the job for introverts. That isn\u2019t always true, though. Coding requires risk-taking, practice, an open-mind, and curiosity. This curiosity feeds on answers. When one isn\u2019t able to find an answer to a problem, he/she asks others for assistance. This is where the communication skills come in. One must be an effective communicator to be able to ask precise questions and give precise answers. Before teaching kids to code, one must teach them how to confidently and effectively communicate with their peers. All in all, you can see that teaching kids to code is less about you saying and more about them doing. You must act as the trigger for the students to give them the proper set of skills, knowledge and motivation to help them enjoy their programming experience. These skills don\u2019t just develop perfectly overnight. To develop the skills they need in life, they need to be able to code and gain the experience. It\u2019s always a process, it always takes time.  Edit: I thought it would be useful to include some websites which help students learn more about the different programming languages. Every child deserves opportunityLearn to codeHappy coding! :) ",

However, for children, to start with, there are tools such as programming apps and games and specialised toys. Programming is an innovative activity that can be engaged in by any kid. Your child does not care about writing algorithms for data processing, but they may enjoy making games, music programming, website design, or just playing around with code. There are several ways to introduce programming to children- specialized toys, using online tools, encouraging them to play with young programmer-designed apps and games, providing them with educational books to read and facilitate hands-on play. Teach kids how to use code to solve a problem. It is probably the hardest part to understand how to build an algorithm with the help of step-by - step instructions to do the homework and come up with the best way to write this in code. When a kid understands these principles and has programmed effectively for some time in one language, it is not that hard to code in another language. It is not instantly easy to switch languages, but it can be accomplished. The key is to embrace the challenge, take it slowly, and have fun learning a new skill that can really impact the kid\u2019s lives. ",

            "answer_text": "Computer programming is an in-demand and lucrative career path, so parents may hope their children grow up to be software programmers. If you want your kids to learn how to program, where do you start? What programming language should we use to teach kids to code? What is important is not the language, but how to teach students how to solve a problem with code. Understanding how to create an algorithm (step-by-step instructions) to tackle an assignment, and coming up with the best way to write this in code, is probably the hardest part.  The popularity of programming languages change, and there is no guarantee that what we teach our kids today will be used by the time they enter the job market. While it may be good to know that teaching coding is more about concepts, and that you do not need to stress about picking the perfect first language, the question remains: What should a language have that will make it a good choice for teaching kids to code? While programming languages are often evaluated in numbers of ways\u2014 on speed, applications, libraries available, industry support. Why is it a good idea to teach kids to code? We all have come across so many reasons to why kids should learn coding. Those are Problem Solving, Critical thinking, Creativity, etc. But let\u2019s have a look on broader perspective, there are so many other reasons which has proven that coding is a good idea to teach kids. Coding is the new literacy. To thrive in tomorrow\u2019s society, young people must learn to design, create and express themselves with digital technologies. Coding fundamentally transforms student\u2019s thinking from being a consumer of technology to a creator of technology. They start creating solutions to day-to-day problems using technology- the hallmark of a true entrepreneur. Coding gets them started on their journey of entrepreneurship. Coding enhances problem-solving skills and logical thinking abilities. This allows them to learn STREAM (Science, Technology, Arts and Math) topics in much more depth with a holistic understanding. Now, should every child learn to Code? Much like learning a new language, younger children often pick up computer programming more easily. Kids have a wide range of interests and talents, and not every child wants to become a software engineer. Still, we believe it\u2019s beneficial for all kids to have basic coding knowledge. Through coding, middle school students can better understand logic and how important sequencing, or the order of commands, is. There are so many of them who teaches coding to kids and coming across one such company is WhiteHat Jr. Live online coding classes for kids of age 6-18 Why I would suggest This one because best in-class age-appropriate curriculum. Their teachers perform a thorough assessment with each student and design a customized learning path in consultation with their curriculum experts. This ensures that your child receives personal attention and is taught as per his/her requirements. ",

Arduino might also be fun, for a more physical interaction, and although you have to be aware of datatypes, they will be at some point of their programming career. The same is true with Android, but if that's more tempting for them, let them try, you could make HTML5/JavaScript apps in Android too, opening up an opportunity to use what you learned at codeacademy. If you edit question details with what you conclude after reading the questions or comment on this one, I will happily go back and edit this answer :) ",

These all show that how programming is changing our lifestyle and the future is of programming. Programming is a creative activity that a kid can engage in. Your child might not care about writing program or writing data processor alogrithms , but definitely they might enjoy creating games, processing music and more and more around with code. I had search several sites which teach beginners of all ages of kids how to code. In fact , we all know that a kid\u2019s mind is sharper than adults. Kids often can learn to program faster than adults because kids don't know how difficult the coding is. The best way to teach kids is to interact them by things which they enjoy while learning coding. Now coming to learning online programming, I would say that during this time of pandemic, no parents want to send their children to learn anything from outdoors. So, to keep your children safe, you would think of dropping the idea of teaching programming to them. But keeping your child away from his growth would not be correct. So, the best option you can take is making them learn programming online. This will not only keep them safe, but also make your children learn the extremely growing skill i.e. Programming. If as a parent you don't know how to code but would like to learn in order to teach your child WhiteHat Jr. is a best learning online platform for kids of age group 6-14 .

But I was sure to go with online modes only. On a school PTM, I asked her computer teacher for some help in finding out the best online method to teach her to code. He suggested inquiring about WhiteHat Jr. online coding platform. Also, WhiteHat Jr. is putting continuous efforts in improving the methodology based upon parents' and kids' feedback, and the latest trends.

            "answer_text": "I think the best method is to start with an Arduino, using lights and speakers attached to sensors, running simple code. Programming often lacks physical feedback, which children really respond to, unless you are doing embedded or robotics. Luckily things like Arduino and Raspberry Pi have really come down in price. I'm mediocre at math, so don't worry about needing a strong foundation. A lot of modern programming languages abstract away the need to understand complex math. There are a lot of commonly used math based programming solutions, so they've become standardized and easily implemented. This makes it more important to understand the performance constraints of a given approach, versus the details of how it operates, ie. a black-box. Start with an Arduino, and slowly build it up to creating a robot with sensors, motors, sounds, etc. Give them some simple code to copy and paste, then encourage them to move the lines of code around, change the variable values, and experiment. Also, try to use state diagrams, and UML diagrams to abstractly explain the system flow. ",

When I was a kid, I was enamored with tinkering that lead to new toys I could play with or building things that did stuff. It was cool to tweak the gravity coefficients the Gorillas game in QBASIC and seeing how it would affect game play.  Technic LEGOs were also cool for the same reason. In today's world, I would recommend getting an Arduino (company).  This little device allows lets you easily control physical components with code.  They can experiment with if statements and see how it affects the physical world.  Here's a video of someone who built and programed a simple robot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpArtj9D9Go.  I wish I had one of these growing up. Of course, this all depends on the personality of your child, so YMMV. ",

Much smaller, simpler, and easier than Python or JavaScript or Java or C# or C++. Smalltalk is so small and simple that its complete syntax fits on a post card! It\u2019s so small and simple that you can learn it completely in 15 minutes! See Learn Smalltalk with ProfStef. (Make sure you follow the instruction where it says \u201cSelect the text below and click on the 'DoIt' button\". Too many readers overlook this.) Smalltalk was created by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, and Adele Goldberg at Xerox PARC specifically for teaching programming to children. Hey, it doesn\u2019t get any easier than this! Smalltalk makes it exceptionally easy to learn object-oriented programming (or OOP). Learning OOP from any other language like C++ or Java will be much more difficult. See Richard Kenneth Eng's answer to Why is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) the standard paradigm for most software? OOP is the most important and widely-used style of programming in the IT industry, so it behooves you to learn it well. Smalltalk is considered the premier OOP language for good reasons, so make this your main learning resource. ",

            "answer_text": "Teaching anything to the kids ranging between the ages of 6-14 years is one of the most challenging tasks. It is really difficult to retain their attention and interest in something like coding which can be a bit challenging in the beginning phase. Luckily, there are professionals who are trained on how to teach coding to toddlers. One such platform is WhiteHat Jr. This E-learni   ng corporation deals specifically in teaching coding to children between the ages 6-14 years. With over 2.5 Million registered students worldwide, this platform not only sparks the interest for coding among the toddlers but also makes them more creative and organised. It also builds the confidence of the kids which ultimately results in the overall development of the child. So, here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to share with you about my experience with my younger brother. He usually, like most kids, doesn\u2019t stick to one task. For that reason, I decided instead of me, a non-professional trying by myself, I looked for online tutors. The teachers are well trained educators who specialize in young kids. They are sectioned according to their skills and maturity and often given interesting little projects and tasks to keep them on track and interested. On top of that, the curriculum is well thought out and proven to work. The fact that the courses are taught 1 on 1 keeps them clear of confusions and provides clear instructions and lessons. They build their own games and programs and different applications, and that\u2019s what keeps them going. From what I\u2019ve experienced as an elder brother, my sibling got really hooked onto it because it showed him a light at the end of the tunnel, the tunnel being the effort and the light being what he really wanted to do. Oftentimes, if kids don\u2019t get their evidence that their hard work is paying off, it becomes uninteresting. By building these small programs and software\u2019s and constant reassurance that they are making progress and with good feedback, coding seems like a gradual and natural thing for the kids. With the whole world moving towards technology driven stuff, WhiteHat Jr. is ensuring that the younger generation is able make the most out of technological products. ",

There are plentiful options for kids to learn coding. You should strike the one which goes which suits the interest of your kid. First, try to introduce him to the coding books. If he seems to show interest, let him play some games which rely on the formula of coding. After getting clarity that your child is developing and learning some coding techniques, give him an area of coding platforms. These platforms could be online and offline. Since this is a COVID-19 situation, the only option you have is online classes. I would suggest you go for live classes as they are not monotonous. Neither they are recorded. Students struggle to get transparency in their subjects, as there is no place for them to turn to for doubts.  My brother also wanted to do something productive in this lockdown. He then went for WhiteHat Jr. trial classes. He loved the way how the teachers were. They interacted with the kids efficiently, making them comfortable to ask doubts. My brother also went on to generate his app a month later. I was impressed by the kind of expertise WhiteHat Jr. was capable of.

            "answer_text": "The same way Suzuki came up with teaching music. Lots and lots and lots of doing it right. Pretty much the only real difference is that a musical instrument is less physical than programming, but the same techniques work. And, oddly enough, typing in programs really does help the learning process. Because you make mistakes, which have to be fixed, just like learning music \u2018by ear'. You copy what you hear, or in the case of programming, what you see. And that act of copying starts the connections in the brain. Repeating it, and variations on it, ingrain those patterns. Eventually the basic patterns become \u2018hard wired' and can be combined into more complex patterns. Learning a language (including math) or writing works this way as well. Talent only gets you so far. If you don't water that \u2018talent bush' with hours of practice, it won't grow. And that practice has to be spread out. 8 hours once a week won't do it. It takes time for the brain to assimilate new stuff. For example \u2026 I've been programming for oh, nearly 40 years now. Off and on, sure, mostly off, but when I'm working on learning a new way of doing it, I work through problems, focusing on how I'm doing it to integrate the new material. I've also been working on learning French. At this point I have a 1258 day streak on Duolingo. Yup, you saw that right. Almost three and a half years, every single day, at least putting in 15-30 minutes work. \u00c7a marche. Mon fran\u00e7ais n'est pas tr\u00e8s bien, mais c'est bon assez. Nope, it's not the best, but I could probably get by well enough in France or Quebec. Practice. Grab a book with something that looks fun, like game programming, and have at. I reccomend either a simple Python game programming book, or if you're brave, Land of Lisp. ",

But still, these all misery can be reduced if you make your kid start early. And what would be best other than WhiteHat Jr. for this purpose? ",

            "answer_text": "What I have personally done was starting off with some basic programming type games. What I mean is games that essentially have you using something like C+ or javascript (or probably a modification of these as it is way too advanced to just throw a kid who knows nothing about programming into these.) I would suggest finding a programming language or base language to work with, e.g. C+, javascript, html, etc. and sticking to it, at least for a bit but don\u2019t be afraid to also encourage learning multiple types of programming languages later. After trying the programming games and they get a basic understanding of programming allow them to try out some sites or programs that use basic programming tools. A few I can think of are gamemaker, scratch, and neverwinter nights (might not be appropriate for 10 year olds). During this process just kind of help with the understand of boolean logic (if and then statements), and certain programming terminologies. I would suggest against starting any gigantic projects as this might hinder progress and make your kid feel less interested or engaged. Once your kid understands how programming works and how to use some tools try moving to either more advanced tools or creating a small project like a simple platformer, puzzle game, etc. I wish you good luck with teaching your son programming. By the way, I am only speaking from experience as to how I learned so it could be that my method isn\u2019t the most robust way but I think its decent as I fully understand how to program things and find ways of getting past the barriers of programming when you don\u2019t know how to do something.

In this situation to find better career opportunities in the future, having coding experience will always be a plus point, no matter what career a student decides to pursue. Now at the time of the pandemic, it is near impossible to send kids outside to take programming lessons. There are many platforms available online which claim to teach coding to kids. But these platforms don't really have a curriculum designed for kids nor is their content very engaging, which makes kids lose interest fast. The same can't be said about White Hat Jr. The platform is designed specifically for kids aged between 6 to 14 years. The lessons here are also 1:1 taken in form of sessions thrice a week by trained coding professionals. The curriculum is also designed taking into consideration kid's coding experience. The platform has done immensely well going from 1,50,000 learners to 4,00,000 learners in just a year. It is a blessing for young kids as coding improves problem-solving skills in a person and also positively impact EQ and IQ for a kid. Kudos to the team! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to teach kids programming, is by own interest. They themselves should take up interest in coding, and get to hone their talent. A legitimate interest is the only way that anyone can specialize this subject, because it is a hard and highly challenging one. Looking into the specifics of coding, we find that coding is based on complex concepts, to build even more complicated systematization. Thus, a genuine interest is very much required for your kids to learn programming. If your child has a good interest, and he/she is willing to take up a course, there are many ways that your kid can learn. There are many on call tutors, many coaching centres where they teach students code, and so on. But all of these usually cater to elder people, suiting their needs and requirements. Kids, they need a special way of learning, a cool and customized way. Only then they will truly understand the subject and get a thorough outlook into it.  So for this, you can look out for online platforms that specialize in teaching coding for kids. There are a few websites really good out there, but Whitehat Jr. is a kind of a stand-out. I find their courses to be creative and conceptual, leading to constant development of the child\u2019s basic knowledge about it, and improving it day by day. They also have a great curriculum, supported by an awesome teaching crew, thereby making the whole experience a special one to begin with. So have your kid, enrolled in such a programme, and I feel that would be the best way for them to learn this wonderful subject! ",

            "answer_text": "My Dad taught me the basics of BASIC when I was around 8 years old.  I didn't understand even simple algorithms, but I distinctly remember programming games like Blackjack, making the Apple IIe play songs, and other small achievements like that.  While I can't claim he really taught me computer science theory, it instilled in me a love of manipulating technology via software.  Once I started learning real programming languages in middle/high school, I was hooked and pretty much taught myself from then until college. I'm not suggesting you start buying up old computers and resurrecting BASIC, but instead to focus on creating a love of technology in your kid- specifically making technology do cool things.  Once a kid is hooked, there's no stopping him/her.  You won't even have to try :) My guess is Lego Mindstorm is pretty cool for really young children (though I played a bunch with regular Legos, Mindstorm was after my time).  Programming on calculators also introduces kids to non-graphical programming in a way they can easily show their friends and be useful in school.  You also might consider teaching an older child something like Python, or perhaps creating a web page in PHP. ",

Even after learning about variables, loops, and functions, sitting in front of a blank editor and starting a new program is intimidating. Sit with them and describe the code they should write line by line. They need to practise the code multiple times in order to differentiate the functioning of different variables. Or, if you are using online resources to share with your child, look for the source code to small and easily-programmed games. Programs with less than a couple hundred lines of code work best and makes it easy to identify different variables, loops and functions. Platforms like WhiteHat Jr. offer extensive courses to groom children specifically in this domain. Take a step ahead and enrol for the trial class. You will know what I'm talking about. The best thing about this platform, WhiteHat is that they provide 1:1 classes which ensures personal attention to each student.

Offline coaching institutes might offer a great coding curriculum and expert teachers but, mostly, a lack of simultaneous practice spills water over all the efforts. So, in this case, online platforms are the best way to teach coding to the kids. Online methods allow the kids to listen to their teachers, understand the concepts, and practice the concepts almost immediately. This enhances the learning process, and makes the kids remember the concepts for a long time. As a responsible father of an 8-year-old boy, I always push my son towards learning small courses online during his leisure time. I used to buy him small moral story packages and drawing learning packages, till he was 6. A year later, when he was 7, I realized that these packages weren\u2019t enough. I needed to groom his technical skills, along with helping in his academic studies. I wanted an excellent course to begin with. But all the courses and the companies were falling short in one or more parameters. My quest ended when I found out about WhiteHat Jr. online coding platform for the kids. WhiteHat Jr. is a wonderful ed-tech platform that offers a remarkable curriculum for kids above 6 years of age. Their way of teaching and team of expert teachers was enough to convince me of the greatness of the platform.

So, this was all before we enrolled our son with WhiteHat Jr. After a year passed by, my son\u2019s teachers and I are delighted with how he is performing. And happily, the performance is improving regularly. Undoubtedly, WhiteHat Jr. is the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Give your infant/toddler/child lots of open ended toys that challenge them to decide how to use them create something with their imagination rather than push a button and wait for the music/lights. Teach them to do things for themselves, or to ask for help learning how to do something, rather than asking for someone to do something for them. Teach them to ask questions and how to look for answers. Give them self confidence. Don't give empty praise, but guide and help them realise that they are smart and capable of learning things, and that trying doesn't always mean you succeed on the first attempt, but that you learn from that attempt and are a little bit more capable each try, until finally you can do it. Focus on encouraging their process, not just that they did something. Try to limit passive activities like screen time. Encourage them to play outside in the fresh air, and to play with other children in a cooperative manner that will help them grow their social understanding. Teach them to share and to take turns. Challenge them to be silly. To rhyme, to create sequences and patterns. To play games where they have to look at what is missing or different between two pictures. Programming will come naturally to a child who knows how to think, ask questions, and find answers.  *You need to let them learn to be a child first.* ",

I expect you could do much worse than start with e.g. Scratch \u2013 Wikipedie. Or, if your boy is technically endowed and interested in machines, you might even go straight to Python. In any case, you\u2019ll need to explain him the principles of algorithmisation first, with examples.

When I understood, I wasn\u2019t doing great in keeping the continuity and making it easy for her to learn, I got to know about this child-centric program at Home - Coding for Beginners. My daughter has finished advanced batch with Home - Coding for Beginners. I am very happy with their style of teaching. Specifically, systematic and age-appropriate course material, in-class online collaborative learning, specific feedback on every program made by the student. Along with this, that subtle competition they have in the class to do well made it easy for my daughter to submit the projects on time and act on feedback. Overall, I am happy to have my daughter go through this training. I can clearly see her evolution from the day she started to now, where she can comfortably talk about how to make a game or program with me. Thanks to Wibyte, Home - Coding for Beginners. I recommended this to many of my friends. ",

The matter of fact that you have opted to teach your kids programming sort of conveys how responsible and concerned a parent or guardian you are !! Programming ,is indeed very important for kids to learn if you talk abut the present scenario. 90% of the friends in my circle are working for some IT company coding their minds off. I also hear of people who weren\u2019t ever into coding and are doing java classes 8 hours a day. Now , answering your question, I think to teach programming maybe start with teaching them basic algorithms and making them aware as what programming basically. Knowing more than just subject knowledge is always helpful. Tell them how it has impacted the world ,how a major of the houses at least have one person working in this sector . Building up a sense in someone will go way further than just teaching them something. A lot of kids have been doing wonders in coding also nowadays. Tell your kids how they have made applications that have such a strong message carried along with it. Kids 8-9 years old have made apps that help people understand how ISRO builds rockets have helped deaf understand sign language, have spread this unsung message of Donating the unused medicines. There's a website called White hat jr. All these kids I guess were belonging to that platform. Like sure, they're doing a good job. The organisation is specially made for kids from 5-14 and tries to perform the same job as you are aspiring for. They tech kids programming well. Like ,such great message giving works have been put forward by them that is really moves me. They have separate curriculum and plan for kids as they grow up. Its namely beginner, Intermediate, Advance and professional. You could just go and find out how they work . Trial classes must be free there ,I guess. Happy parenting , and congratulations on the epiphany that your kids should learn to code. ",

            "answer_text": "Coding languages are changing, but programming logic doesn\u2019t. For young children, who mostly just started exploring, it is more important to learn computational thinking than learning a specific programming language. And learn it through play. Looking back at what happened in the last decades, new programming languages (Python, Ruby, Scratch) emerge to make learning coding increasingly easier for beginners. Applying that trend to the future, it is safe to predict that the barrier to learning a programming language will be lowered even more. Therefore, teach kids computational thinking. In terms of tools to use, there are many. All the other answers have included great tools built on simple visual programming languages. For kids below 8 years old, start with screenless hands-on options. Check out MangoBot. It teaches computational thinking in the context of all the key developmental areas, like fine motor skills, emotional development and language learning.  You can get MangoBot to do things in a sequence, or with causality. You can also DIY games related to real life, such as taking the food to the dog, or collecting banana, milk, ice and go to the blender to make a banana milk shake. Have fun with your kids. At the end of the day, no technology can replace your loving relationship with your child. ",

The platform firmly believes that technology is here to stay and transform the world. They help children prepare for the bold digital future. Their teaching style is interactive with 1 on 1 live video lessons. They have different course levels to suit and shape kids of different age groups. They have a large library of technology tools available, which can allow you to learn from and develop new products. WhiteHat Jr. has created an environment where you can explore projects and turn your ideas into real-world solutions. ",

Also, I'm not sure how you would pry a student off of Skratch once you got them started. I think if you can get them to think like a flow chart or like legos, they should be off to the races.  Basic HTML isn't terribly difficult once they master the basics of how programming works. I remember one of the CS classes at Stanford having a game-like challenge task they had to complete, which might serve as an intermediary step.  Its basically like helping a robot or avatar through a maze-type task. ",

No matter how excellent the curriculum is, a traditional teaching method will disinterest the children, and all the efforts might go into vain. Kids love to learn and easily understand the coding concepts when taught by a friendly, motherly, or fatherly teacher. As a software engineer mother, from the beginning, I was worried about how my son is going to learn different programming languages and gain expertise simultaneously. A couple of years back, when my son was 5 years old, I was adamant to teach him coding from his young age itself. After much research, and consulting with my husband, I decided to enrol our son with a local coding academy near our residence. Months passed, and I never saw my boy enthusiastic about coding. One day, amidst random talk, I talked about my son\u2019s problems with one of my friends, who is also a programmer. She referred me to WhiteHat Jr. online coding platform for kids. She said that kids often feel low or disinterested if the coding curriculum is not enjoyable, or the teachers are strict and biased. Overcoming such problems, WhiteHat Jr. has a highly enjoyable curriculum for kids above 6 years of age, friendly, expert, and IIT/IB qualified faculty and unbiased 1:1 teaching experience. The topics covered at WhiteHat Jr. are much beyond coding and include software development, mobile app development, AI/ML, etc. I was very excited after hearing so much about WhiteHat Jr. from my friend, and I didn't waste any time to enrol my son on the platform. Now, my son has taken up coding as his hobby and I\u2019m worry-less about his learning. All thanks to WhiteHat Jr.! ",

A good way to test the waters is by getting them started on making maps for slightly older computer games such as StarCraft. Not so much the geographic parts of deciding which tree goes where (although that sort of thing can provide a \"breather\" in between more \"serious\" activities). But let him/her use the trigger system; \"if a marine enters this area, that door opens\" etc. If they don't stick with it, that's fine, but they probably won't have the stamina for more involved, actual programming activities.  If they do take to it, you can gradually increase the level of complexity; for example, StarCraft II offers more possibilities.  At that point, you can introduce them to GameMaker (the free version on Steam). When they reach the limits of that it's time to introduce them to a real programming language such as Python.  In parallel, I would introduce them to the concepts of digital logic, for example nand gates and how more complex devices are built up from them. You can also get a \"getting started with Microcontrollers\" package, preferably one that let's them get e.g.  LEDs to blink using assembly code. Any of these activities can be expanded to arbitrary levels of depth, depending on what they like best. Oh, Mindstorms (Lego robots) also come to mind. ",

I for one, would have really enjoyed this mentoring when I was learning programming. But, If you are not a programmer, do some research for online learning. Great websites for learning programming: SololearnTutorialsPointW3SchoolI personally use Sololearn because of it\u2019s simplicity and great user interaction and design. But sometimes they do not teach advanced topics, so I then go to TutorialsPoint to learn from there. I also recommend books. If I was to learn web development and web application, I would read \u201cRUBY ON RAILS TUTORIAL 4th EDITION by MICHAEL HARTZ\u201d. Other than that, I suggest finding books on your own.

It\u2019s a major difference, especially since computer science classes are actually professional and are taught by experts. But you may need to be in high-school to attend these classes.

It is not just a trending or a buzzword exactly, it is the reality of the future world in which we all are going to reside. Where, many job opportunities will be taken by AI. Hence, it is the need of the hour to teach upcoming generation programming and introduce them to the world of coding. Well, I personally believe that children should be taught coding at an early age in the school itself as these are the building years in which the children learn the most. Hence, I think that computer programming should be included in the school curriculum. But if not learnt through school, parents should take the responsibility to enroll their children in such courses which give these budding minds an insight about the AI driven future to come. There are many online coding courses being provided for young children by Code.Org, WhiteHat Jr., CodeAcademy etc. All these sites provide good knowledge about coding and its know-hows. However, I find the curriculum of WhiteHat Jr., more convincing and well structured. The idea of dividing courses in accordance with the class in which the child is studying is quite efficient and productive as these programs are further subdivided according to the difficulty bar and the level of interest of the students such as Introduction, Advanced and Applied Tech. WhiteHat Jr. is teaching coding to the children in the exact way it should be taught thereby arming them with the weapon called coding in order to make them ready to conquer the AI future by being creators of great and out of the ordinary ideas and products. The world to come will have every product built with the formula X+AI(X being the product). To live and thrive in this world the upcoming generation should be well equipped with knowledge of coding in order to become the lead light of tomorrow instead of being the mere consumers. WhiteHat Jr. is actually working towards creating the creators of tomorrow out of these blossoming young minds. Their way of teaching is one on one where one teacher is assigned only to one student and such sessions leads to maximum productivity. WhiteHat Jr keeps the children motivated and inspired to turn their imagination into ideas which will ultimately metamorphose into capital by introducing challenges like the Silicon Valley Challenge where the best ideas get a chance to be pitched to the investors of the Silicon Valley. I personally believe that a curriculum as that of WhiteHat Jr. should be introduced in schools as that is the best way to expose them to the reality of tomorrow's world in the atmosphere of the school itself. If a child is not able to gather the required knowledge in the early schooling years then platforms like WhiteHat Jr. , Code.org, CodeAcademy etc. are the best resort. ",

I have a non-technical (i.e. non-IT) career but this was a formative experience that has repeatedly given me a leg up over people who have never written a line of code, largely because I can speak with technical people without being either totally clueless or simply afraid.  But I also believe that much of the benefit of having some programming exposure is in instilling a structured way of thinking about and handling data.   Maybe out of the box, but what about MS Excel? Capture data in a structured way, perform mathematical, logical and text-based operations on it, and make decisions about how to output it. Import, parse, process, export. While it doesn't have the visual fun potential of, say, Processing, it has the advantage of being useful for handling real-world information.  For example, my son and I built a miniature trebuchet (catapult). I plan to test the distance achieved using different counterweights, record the data in Excel and plot a graph of the relationship. Though this is a bit different from the text-based, code / algorithm view of the world, it's a foundational exercise in structuring, processing and presenting data. ",

It is possible to make simple games with little effort, although the first few times it is probably simpler to make something like small scripted animations. There are books and courses available, but they are really not needed. Kids tend to (in my experience) prefer to jump in with both feet, hold on to youtube and trying and failing and succeeding. I found this to be a good primer for mine who are now looking for bigger challenges and \"more real\" programming. The other angle is to just push them to Minecraft and see if they develop the wish to mod and change the game as they develop a relationship with it and the community around it.  These two approaches also work well together. ",

I joined the world of software engineering about a year ago, and the school that I attended, Holberton, had us work in C without the use of a standard library. It was super challenging at first, but the reason behind that decision was to ensure that we had a full understanding of that goes on under the hood. We had to write a lot of the standard library functions from scratch, things like strdup, strlen\u2026and the list goes on. This forced us to understand the bare bones, before moving on to using libraries and OOP languages. It can take a little bit longer to approach learning in this matter. A lot of the time, students just want to dive in and start making things - they want instant gratification. Focusing on fundamentals is not going to get you instant gratification. But if you want well trained programmers, you want to make sure they what they are really doing, before they start implementing it. ",

Schools in India rarely offer coding classes to children at an early age and this causes difficulty later in life. For this, students need to look forward to various online platforms for learning how to code. Among multiple ed-tech startups in India, I would suggest WhiteHat Jr. as it offers a high-quality learning experience to students.  My students were unable to visit me for their classes during the quarantine period and so they enrolled in WhiteHat Jr\u2019s curriculum based on the grades they are in. Till now they are satisfied with the high-quality teaching they receive 3 days a week and the undivided attention due to their 1:1 interaction methodology. The courses are worth the rate and are convenient for the students as well as the parents. Timings of the classes can be selected based on the convenience of the student and a refund is provided if the class is canceled with a notice 24hour in advance. These factors impressed me with this fast-growing startup company and hence I recommended WhiteHat Jr. to my niece as well. The overall feedback has been pretty great until now. You can book a free trial class and decide on enrolling for their additional courses based on your experience. ",

Introduce terms slowly, while building on recently-learned terms .Make it interesting as quickly as possible.  Don\u2019t wait.Teach API s early on (as APIs are literally \u201cconnected to the real world\u201d)Incorporate other topics into your \u201cprogramming class\u201d, to show how integrated programming is to our world.Teaching natural language processing?  Teach English literature or linguistics along with it.  Teaching CSS?  Teach design along with it.  Teaching HTML?  Teach it next to history of the web.  Teaching Python?  Mix it up with some science or finance work.Coding can be very tiring to learn all at one go.  The whole idea of teaching \u201ccoding\u201d without integrating it with the real-world doesn\u2019t work.  Coding is a part of our lives, and it should be taught as such. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the kids are interested in making anything \"artistic\" in nature. So simple games and animation are good starting points. Try to search for tools that are related to this. For example HTML5 supports animations and making simple games in it. html is very easy for anybody who knows english. To run html code, all you need is a good internet browser like chrome or firefox.  over a period of time, the kid has to be familiar with basic maths like Simple algebra, using simple formulas, understanding what functions are etc.  Once your kids start programming in HTML(1 year or 2) he\\she would like to achieve stuff that needs complicated technical skills. But as supporting skills he will also need to know some mathematics and science lessons. It does not matter whether the kid learns maths first, science first or programming.  knowledge of these will make him sharp and smart. One important thing to note: Initially you may have to help the kid with setting up of system, connecting to internet etc. But in a matter of few weeks, the kid will be capable of running the computer on his own. Please make sure that  your kid does not join any forum in general that is meant for grown ups(Once in a while there may be objectional stuff put on the forum by others which may not be suitable for your kid).  You need to supervise all his\\her activities on the internet. Maybe you could try putting the computer in a place in your home that is open and easily accessible to all. Make sure you have parental features ON on the browsers and you have parental supervision softwares installed.  ",

So in turn we can create stuff like that. That really got me excited. I saw myself like making games, apps which helped people and enjoying that. This is the only thing that I remember, because it was the something I was interested in, helping people by making fun things. Try to get your child to understand concepts by first getting their interest. Example: -A girl likes to dance. You can tell her that using programming she can make her own music and dance challenge game. If that idea doesn\u2019t work, come up with new ones. -Then tell her to plan out her idea. Help her to make a simple plan. -Automatically, she will start asking about how to make what she wants to make. -This way you can start her off , but remember that whatever you teach has a meaning, so don\u2019t forget to tell her the meaning for what you\u2019re teaching. -If she is confused, she will automatically ask, because she wants her dream idea to come true. But still, ask from your side. -Tell her to always practice what she has learnt. This will help her build up confidence and clarity of concepts. -It will be a long road ahead, but make sure to keep her enthusiasm up, but if he gives up then give her a break. If she doesn\u2019t ask again, maybe this is not for her. This works in any situation, as far as I know. I think this will probably help. ",

There is only one teacher per one student in the online course of WhiteHat Jr. In this way a teacher can give more time to the student.WhiteHat Jr was founded in 2018 with the aim to teach coding to kids of the age group of 6\u201318 years. WhiteHat Jr teaches various programming languages like HTML, CSS, Python, PHP, etc to the kids. WhiteHat Jr develops problem-solving skills in the kids by teaching them various programming languages and also by teaching real-life projects to the kids. WhiteHat Jr makes kids creators rather than just consumers of technology. WhiteHat Jr provides kids to learn technologies like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence which are the most used technologies of the present time. WhiteHat Jr teaches coding to the kids in a very fun way, so that the kids can learn very quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology has become such an inextricable part of our lives in the past few years, and soon, laptops, mobile phones and other electronic devices will become pervasive in every aspect of life. Learning to code will soon become the norm, and virtually every job position would require some extent of knowledge of programming languages, irrespective of the field or industry. Computer programming is highly pervasive, and we are already beginning to see it creep into other industries that rely on data and automation. Helping your child learn coding at a young age would equip them to be successful later in life, even if they do not pursue a career in computer science or engineering. It would also make a valuable addition to their resume or their skill-set. Many parents are reluctant to enroll their kids for classes in coding since they are already displeased with the screen time and screen exposure, given that kids nowadays are engrossed with television programs, video game consoles or games on tablets and mobile phones. The best way to teach students would be through interactive offline/online classes where they will be taught to code (live coding sessions), rather than by writing on paper and watching videos online. With the shift to online modes of education due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and the increasing number of jobs created requiring computer programming skills, there is a spotlight on ed-tech startups and platforms that impart the fundamentals of coding to children and beginners. WhiteHat Jr. is one such platform that offers a comprehensive curriculum split into five levels, based on the students\u2019 level of understanding. The courses are meant for students between the ages of 6 and 14, or older students in school as well. The classes are flexible and interactive, and the activities are gamified and enrapturing for the younger demographic. I would recommend trying out their classes (they offer a free demo session) and seeing if it suits your learning trajectory and goals. ",

            "answer_text": "\"view source\" in a browser or otherwise learning a generally useful language like Python or Javascript strikes me as what I'd suggest to kids.  There are a number of projects from logo to Scratch http://scratch.mit.edu/ that are aimed specifically at kids, but they all have a whiff of \"young adult\" fiction which, at least in my memory as a kid, was not an endorsement.  If a kid is learning scratch, and asks an adult a question, an adult then has to bother learning some scratch to help.  A kid learning javascript or python has an abundance of resources available including people actually using it.  I learned logo as a kid, but could just as well probably have spent all the time learning basic or logo or pascal and just worked through the WIzard book back then to much better effect.   Consider that programming is essentially a form of rhetoric or play, and teaching kids an impoverished language isn't a favor.  Playing with javascript in a web page or browser, or doing a quick appengine app and deploying something with a URL that can be shared with friends or even doing a small game in blitz3d basic is all going to provide more motivation, feedback, stimulus, and flow that downloading squeak or scratch or hyperlogo.

Yes (or true) because the sky is blue today. How about \u201cis the sky blue AND the dog\u2019s name barky mcbarkface?\u201d Instinctively they\u2019ll answer no, as I\u2019ve seen many times. Ask them to explain why the first thing (the OR) is true, and not the second (the AND). Try to get them to say something in the vein of \u201cbecause for the \u2018or\u2019 only one needs to be true, but for the \u2018and\u2019 both need to be true.\u201d To me that\u2019s really the basis of programming is logic and control structures. Loops and O(n) notation and data structures are all things that are definitely necessary, but can be involved a bit later on.

Scratch Jr. and Blockly are two examples, which teach kids coding with a block-based approach. However, these platforms aren't comprehensive when you want to solve real-world problems with coding. As someone here has already mentioned, platforms like WhiteHat Jr. take a comprehensive approach to teach problem-solving through coding to kids. It is essential to apply coding concepts to solve problems instead of passive learning them. WhiteHat Jr.'s extensive curricula aims to transform the lives of millions of students to solve problems through programming. By creating apps and digital products, kids learn to solve pressing problems and develop critical-thinking. ",

Minecraft mods for the very keen, LearnToMod (http://learntomod.com/) is a not-bad subscription service which takes them through it step by step.  I signed my son (12 at the time) for this when it was in Beta and he worked his way through all the examples and enjoyed that; although after that he hasn't gone back to it I'll admit. But there's lots of other options, e.g. Kodu, SmallBasic etc; one problem is that they do appear and there's lots of excitement but then most fade away after a time.  I found this site on teaching kids to program has quite a good list http://www.teachkidstoprogram.com/. Personally I wouldn't start too young (under 8) unless they are really pestering you to do it, get them outside in the garden instead! ",

From teaching basic coding concepts to mechanisms of driverless cars, WhiteHat Jr. has developed engaging curriculum for kids above 6 years of age. I was fully convinced with the platform and decided to sit for their trial sessions to observe my son's reaction. To my surprise, I found that my son was extremely happy and curious to learn with WhiteHat Jr. We decided to buy him a course. Now, he codes even during his free time.

So, Your kid can start coding learning at 6, But 8-12 years kids can show their creativity in coding learning. Now come to the second point, who will teach your kid or help him learn to code? A perfect person who can teach kids in a friendly environment is very important because kids are getting bored quickly. If the instructor isn't well-trained in kids coding, it will be very hard to get the greatest outcomes. To get rid of this problem, I take help from WhiteHat Jr, a 1:1 online live class-based kids coding platform. My kid Aakriti recently completed her advanced coding course from WhiteHat Jr. WhiteHat Jr has 4 levels of structured curriculum for kids: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Professional. Based on your kid's age and capability, you can choose any course from the official website of WhiteHat Jr (all details available here). Aakriti had done lots of exercises in every live class. She made an app, \"Avengers Assemble,\" which is available in the App Store. After completing an advanced course, your kid will be able to create a responsive web app and have an excellent understanding of AI and Machine Learning concepts. You have more options to start your kid's coding. Open-source kids coding environments like Scratch, Code .org, Blocky, Codecademy, etc. can help your kid to start coding. You can also help your kid to learn, but if you are not a tech guy, then I would suggest you - WhiteHat Jr. In this way, you can start and continue your kid's journey in the coding world.

There are several ways to ease into the concepts of programming without having to juggle all of the complexity from the start. Minecraft for example has red stone, red stone switches and logic gates share a lot of the thinking with planning out the mechanics of a program. Knowing you have to start with an inout, connect sensors, and link time delayed peices to each other to acheive a complex result or a simple one that requires complex work behind the scenes. There a number of toys comming to the market that let a kid combine defined peices to produce games or other results, and some that involve programming small robot toys, I don't recall the names of these but a freinds kid Has a few. If they\u2019re old enough theres a virtual world called second life, where the built in scripting language (lsl) controls the behavior of virtual objects, and I found this gave the immediate results for my first stumbling efforts to learn to code that kept me at it through the stumbling blocks and frustrations.. Thats I think the key, whatever method you use should have immediate results that can be played with and enjoyed in order to keep someone pushing through when it gets frustrating . ",

Therefore, to teach them something totally different from that curriculum is a little challenging. Coding is something children aren\u2019t taught in schools at an early stage. So, if you are interested in teaching your child coding concepts it can become quite a tough task. But thankfully in my case, I got to know about WhiteHat Jr., a platform that provides courses to young children to learn coding. The communication modes and program plans are finely structured and efficient for every age group. Their one on one learning experience as well as the interactive approach makes learning for kids new to coding a breeze. A platform like this can help young children a lot in the monotonous world of curriculum-based learning. It is imperative to introduce coding to kids to prepare them for the future dominated by automation and artificial intelligence. ",

Basically, any job that doesn\u2019t involve creation will be automated. Therefore, the need to learn to program is a far-sighted initiative. For this, many Edtechs have emerged to teach and share the knowledge of programming with the kids of the present who will be the leaders of tomorrow. These include Udemy, WhiteHat Jr, Vedantu, Edx, etc. These platforms are initiating to spread awareness and knowledge about coding through the online platform. However, as a consumer myself, I would suggest WhiteHat Jr. as the best out of all. Since my brother is enrolled in one of their courses I have come across how the company provides an excellent curriculum specially designed by IIT and MIT alumni for age groups 6-14 years. It allows children to learn to program from teachers who are selected after a 5-step interview and provides you with one to one sessions, and its modules include lessons on algorithmic thinking, fundamentals of logic, sequence structure, and the basics of UI/UX. Eventually, children are encouraged to create an application, which under the guidance of the tutors\u2014also connected via the cloud, so they can work out of remote locations with an internet connection\u2014is further developed. They\u2019ve repeatedly received some incredible feedback from the parents on the quality of their teachers.

He advised me to join a Facebook group wherein many such valuable information is being posted daily. I joined the group and raised my question there. I have seen many parents spending thousands of bucks on coding classes and courses for their wards. But as of now, the best platform for kids and elders to learn to code is Coding Blocks Junior https://cb.lk/cbjr (a YouTube channel) by Coding Blocks which has free coding courses for students from class 2 to 12.  As now the government has mandated coding from early classes, this will help beginners a lot in every aspect of learning, as it is free of cost as well as curriculum designed for students is too appropriate for beginners. As the courses are taught by highly skilled professionals and experienced instructors.   Their courses cover one of the important language Python which is very useful for software development purposes as well as in every computer science field one will find this language, this Channel also contains many FREE Coding courses in Visual programming (Scratch/Code.ORG), Web development, Data science and Robotics to School students across India and abroad. These courses cover all basic and essential topics to be learned. Completing this you will get a good base in the field of programming. ",

To give you an idea of skills I noticed from my childhood that have helped me every day. Chess, great game if you look at it as trying to calculate the number of possible moves. I always simply tried to brut force and see as many possible outcomes as possible. Checkers is a simpler version of this. Tictactoe even simpler. It wasn't until I started playing go that I started to realize people didn't normally try and brut force the board, I can't brut force a game where no one actually legitimately finishes a game. Rummikub was one of my favorite all time games. I remember one game I had played where I believe I made a dozen or so substitutions just to place a single piece. The ability to keep things in my head help me day in and day out. It helps follow code around and makes it easy to unravel. Especially with the increasing number of layers in modern software. Games like Sudoku help as well. I have not evaluated any of these coding for kids programs so it's hard for me to give advice on them. I would say nothing will ever beat enthusiasm and a huge appetite for learning. Learning basic data structures and algorithms in the form of games is a neat idea. I would love to talk with someone who learned coding that way to see what works well and what doesn't. ",

It\u2019s not like a huge ressource with lots of subsection, much more like a quiz, with easy but very effective questions which help memorizing the information in the long term. As soon as you\u2019re not too lazy, and you know programming is a lot of reading and writing, it\u2019s a really good tool. Obviously it\u2019s not a good way to tip-toe into the world of programmation, so for kids under the age of 10 you\u2019re better off starting with something really intuitive and possibly physical and interactable. A good example would be the Nintendo Switch\u2019s Nintendo Labo, most notably it\u2019s Toy-Con garage in which kids can do block programmation and create their own little machines. Obviously it\u2019s super pricy but that was just an example and there are a lot of great alternatives. ",

In our case, WhiteHat Jr. taught our son how to code by teaching him the different programming languages from HTML & CSS to Python and JavaScript, and having him code an app using a machine learning library. He was also able to work as an Android app developer during his project because of the personalised attention given by his teacher to everything he did. WhiteHat Jr.'s approach to coding curriculum is very hands-on, allowing kids to explore programming by building an app and exploring how data is represented. ",

You can also take up a small project and complete it with the class so that they get a practical hands on experience. Depending on the class in which students are, certain assignments can be given to them to make their mind work in that direction. Junior classes can get to know more about theoretical knowledge and develop logical constructs. Senior classes can be given some small projects to be done as a part of their curriculum which will help them dig deeper into programming. I hope this Helps... ",

Though try to give as much practical knowledge as possible. Also you a good looking IDE when talking about kids and let them play with it a little bit (maybe showing some of it to their friends in order to looks smart). Keep him/her updated to the modern advancements and technologies and let them explore some bits by themselves. Keep teaching and some practicals along with it and you must be good to go. This will lead you to know about their interest in programming and if they would like it to do it in the future or not. Please do not be harsh with them and keep them motivated so they have a good experience with programming so that even if they leave it due to some reasons, they will be wanting to get into it again, and not like most of the things people do in their past and be like that wasn\u2019t good so they don\u2019t ever try to get into it again.

Simple answer will be this - You can opt for some free resources which are available in the beginning and later you can go with paid content on many Online/offline education providers. Additionally, it highly depends on the child\u2019s psychological set-up. Since they are young, they have less maturity. It really matters finding out what type of study child prefers. Some need continuous training where as for others monitoring is not needed. Hope this helps! ",

To learn programming your child first need to learn the basics of it. Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Really, computer programming is thinking like and communicating with a computer, and is most commonly used to make long and repetitive tasks quick and easy. Programming is used in music, video games, smartphones, cars, and much more. So how can you teach your child programming if you don't know it? You should definitely go for online platforms that teach coding like WhiteHat Jr, Scratch, Codecademy etc. WhiteHat Jr is best for kids of age 6-14 years. Their classes are fun and interactive which helps kid learn and grow at the same time. You can go for Codecademy for older kids. Hope this helps! Thank you ",

But researchers have stated that over the course of time, most of us tend to unlearn the important quality called creativity. Sometimes individuals assign the lack of creativity to be a genetic trait. However, the real reason behind a less creative individual is that he/she did not nurture his/her creative qualities. Creativity can be of any form differing from individual to individual. This, however, does not mean that to nurture one\u2019s creativity he/she need to keep working on his/her specific creative domains. It's a great way to start building interest in coding through Scratch Jr. and games like Mekorama. ",

They can create working behavior for their robot, and experience and interact with their program when it runs on the robot. NXT 1.0:  NXT 2.0:  EV3:  If you can, wait for the EV3 units to come out in the fall.  The EV3 runs Linux, with far more capable controller \"bricks\" than the earlier kits, and numerous advancements based on what LEGO learned with the earlier kits.

Digital and traditional institutions are also sculpting more-intimate online learning options, with smaller class sizes and more one-to-one professor-to-student interactions. Online degree options abound and if you can't find the offering you want at other platforms, you can probably find it at WhiteHat Jr. So whether you\u2019re looking to earn your degree to go nab a 9-to-5, or you\u2019re looking to study the code with the world\u2019s largest educational platforrm, you can probably find what you\u2019re looking for online. There are two different sets of students\u2014one group who studied online and the other who went to class\u2014who received the same instruction from the same professor fared equally well in terms of performance. However, many revealed that online students were less intimidated about participating, and that there was a higher-quality of interaction between students and the professor. WhiteHat Jr. is the perfect place for you to find quality programming courses to kick start your coding career. You will have to try out their free trial on your own, to get a catch of what they really offer. Happy Coding to You! ",

I personally prefer C++ in the beginning as it is neither too simple (like Python is), nor too deficient in terms of libraries (like C is). C++ is pretty fast and has good library support too - the best of both worlds! Also, C++ is a good choice for competitive programming because it is pretty fast and has the support of the Standard Template Library (STL). The choice of the first language is highly subjective based on your interests and goals. You may be interested in front-end, back-end, mobile app development, game development, data science, etc. If your main aim is to get a job then do check out on which programming language is best for getting a job? You can start by learning the basics - syntax, data types, variables, loops, arrays, etc. Try to solve simple implementation-based questions so as to get familiar with these basic concepts. And WhiteHat Jr. is the hub of these. ",

After reading the experience and reviews of the kids who have already enrolled in the sessions. This hit me up to get my younger sister to get enrolled for the same as she develops interest in going ahead with technology and IOT based streams. Which begins the start line for her to move ahead with programming language and learn about it. In no time I saw the website of White Hat Jr. which teaches the kids to code using 1:1 methodology to teach kids and as well as have quizzes this way the child remains in proper guidance as well as on track with the subject. Online platform's to learn is making it worth for all age groups to learn with simple modes to operate the same.  Coding firstly is an easy language and can be learnt very quickly, but what makes it more effective is when a mentor, Is there always as a constant guide to them. Having practical sessions with the teacher\u2019s guidance helps the child to be more confident. Me being in medical field yet knowing how important is programming language to one and boosting younger generation to move ahead. Hope this was helpful. ",

Thus, learning coding hold these values for kids:- 1) Your child must understand the importance of STEM-based education i.e STEM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in four specific disciplines \u2014 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \u2014 in an interdisciplinary and applied approach. This type of education has become important today. 2) Thinking about future perspectives of your child Coding provides a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships, and jobs. 3) Your child will learn how to solve real-life problems and coding give them space to generate their creativity by creating apps, games, websites, and software on their own thus this made them contribute to the tech sector of their country.

While I joined this platform at later stages in my life as a student of the Applied Tech course, younger children are better at grasping coding concepts and thinking creatively. Their courses are tailored for every age group, leveraging latest in tech to ensure that kids orient themselves to the ever-changing global educational landscape. ",

Coding/ programming is not an easy task and it takes time to write and execute codes accurately. It\u2019s the era of technology, where everyone even kids are surrounded by tech gadgets 24/7, so I believe that it\u2019s the age where everyone knows about applications and websites. In my opinion, it is your foremost duty to ask him if he is interested. If your child says he wants to learn coding then you are good to go. Otherwise, you must explain him calmly about the benefits and let him take the time to rephrase before you reach to any conclusion. A child needs proper guidance and teaching in order to master any skill. With right kind of teachings and mentoring, your kid will eventually develop interest in programming. All you have to do is remain patient with him and let him grow at his own pace. I would like to share my experience with you on what I believe is the best way to teach coding to kids. I had a daughter named Jiya, and she is 9 years old. Jiya is a bright student at school in both academics and extra curricular activities. She is always ready to take new challenges and opportunities. She is always curious about learning new things. One day she came to me and asked me that she wanted to learn coding. I had no idea where that was coming from because I and my husband, we both are not in software field, neither do we do any kind of coding. However, I was happy to see that my daughter was aware and informed about coding at such tender age. I searched on google and took few recommendations from my colleagues and friends about the best coding platform in India. This is where I happened to know about Whitehat jr for the first time. I booked a free trial session and the results were amazing. My daughter understood everything they taught so I decided to buy beginner course.  The courses include: intermediate, professional and advanced level. The curriculum is well thought of and designed by professors of IITs and MIT. Jiya eventually picked everything just after 1 month. She is learning new everyday and I am really thankful to Whitehat jr for bringing out such an amazing platform for kids between 6-14 years. ",

You introduce a few basic commands and get the student to complete a task by using the commands. As proficiency grows you introduce more commands and then logical branching, if/else kind of flow, variables and operators. Next you introduce loops and then logic controlled loops with conditional execution. Next you can start introducing structure, how to create functions and split code across files.  Now go functional / OOP. At this point the student should be able to program small solutions. Now several directions can be taken, data structures, DB theory, etc. Note: these are just top of my head, there is probably a few more concepts per step than mentioned but this is the basic idea. ",

We had to either be attentive in what the teacher teaches or refer books.  Now since many ed-tech startups are coming together to work and help the young minds to learn coding/ programming language easily. It\u2019s making every student get the excess and gain the best. I have recently seen this website named White Hat Jr. which teaches kids how to code and has divisions in the modules as well. This site also provides 1:1 teaching methodology where student can freely interact with the teacher and get their doubt solved along with upcoming quizzes. This all wasn\u2019t accessible to us when we used to learn programming language. Now since it's available why not get the best of it and make kids learn how to code!! Since all of guardians/ parents get involved in work the kid gets bored at home, why not indulge the kid into learning something new that can be better for the kid in the coming times as well as be active and interested in coding through the online mode of learning.

Many have argued that it should form part of a national curriculum on par with a native languages, math and science . We are surrounded with electronic devices each running uncountable numbers of software that run on code of some kind. Our modern world is also heavily reliant on the internet with workforces being required to be more and more computer literate with each passing year. It is, therefore, as important to making a living in the modern world as having a good grasp of grammar, spelling, and numeracy. But as software becomes ever more sophisticated, the general public is being further and further detached from how they actually work. While they are exhaustively designed and tested to be as intuitive to use as possible, how they work is fast becoming something of a kind of magic for all but a select few. One of the best ways to make your kids learn coding is to make them learn it on an online platform. WhiteHat Jr. is the best site to learn how to code. Byju\u2019s has acquired edtech startup WhiteHat Jr. for $300 million as the Indian online learning giant looks to expand its dominant reach in the country.

I'm saying all this by personal experience, as someone who learned to code in GW-BASIC at 11, then directly VB6 at 12 and then mastering it and completing MCSD at 13.  Once you get hold of the basic concepts like conditions, loops and variables etc. the rest will follow automatically, given that they maintain interest in it.  For me the main thing that brought me close to computers was games, and learning how to outsmart, by learning how they were made. GW-BASIC was a excellent language that was easy to understand at that time and quite straight forward, but at the same time capable of doing a lot. We wrote a 8000 line program that simulated the boot-up process of a Windows 95 complete with desktop and icons using it. I dont know anything iOS specific, but would suggest something that would build strong programming logic first rather than focusing on platform specific stuff. I would recommend GW-Basic or Q-Basic, and then C. ",

            "answer_text": "Lego Mindstorms seems like a pretty good candidate.  I don't remember being a huge fan of their graphical language, but I think I heard later generations got better. There's always good old-fashioned Logo, though maybe a bit dated at this point. There was a fantastic exhibit at the exploratorium maybe 15 years ago called Musical Insects.  A little bit of research indicates it became the foundation of Sim Tunes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimTunes).  This kind of \"game\" is particularly suited for younger children since it can appeal to them both visually and musically while still possessing some of those good programming basics.  Don't know if there's a more modern analog. I, personally, got into MOO's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO) at a fairly young age.  There's nothing better to inspire a young mind to learn to read, type, and program than exploring and eventually creating your own fantasy world.  Once more, probably dated, and the closest modern analog, something like Second Life, seems less than appropriate for young children. ",

            "answer_text": "Teaching Kids (of all ages) to Program We take a different approach to teaching folks how to program here at the Osmosian Order of Plain English Programmers. The Osmosian Order of Plain English Programmers Welcomes You The Interface The first thing we do is remove all unnecessary and distracting clutter. This, for example, is what our full-screen Integrated Development Environment (IDE) looks like:  Alphabetical menus and a status message field at the top, work area in the middle, and tabs at the bottom. No window borders, no widgets, no icons, no tool bars, and no palettes. We thus encourage the student to focus on the content in the foreground, not the background (which we leave in the background where it belongs). Whoops! Almost forgot. No scroll bars. Ever. The right mouse button is used to shove content around \u2014 horizontally, vertically, and/or diagonally \u2014 and an Incremental Find facility is used to \u201cleap\u201d in large files (ala the late, great Jef Raskin). The Home, End, Page Up, Page Down and Arrow keys are also used, intuitively, to change the focus as necessary. The file system is exposed to the programmer using full path names. This is the only view the programmer is given: there are no icons, and no alternate views in \u201copen\u201d and \u201csave as\u201d dialog boxes (because we don\u2019t use or need dialog boxes). The students are thus introduced to the exact syntax that they will need to reference files in their programs, and they only have to maintain a single mental image of the file system in their budding brains. Our student\u2019s applications are also clutter-free. When they clear the screen, it is erased to black, top-to-bottom and side-to-side. Their applications are real, native programs, with access to the whole screen (and computer), so their dreams can come to life exactly as they imagined them. No sandboxes. The Language The second difference in our approach is that we program in natural, English-language sentences. Our \u201ckeywords\u201d are articles (like a, an, the and some), and prepositions (like in, of and with, etc) rather than obscure words like CONST and EVAL and INSTANCEOF (which, technically, aren\u2019t real words at all). We also make a point of concentrating on semantics (WHAT is being said) rather than syntax (HOW it is being said). Routines in Plain English typically have multiple headers so they can be called in various ways. This routine, for example\u2026 To erase the screen;To blank out the screen;To wipe off the screen;To clear the screen:Unmask everything.Draw the screen\u2019s box with the black color and the black color.Refresh the screen.Put the screen\u2019s box into the context\u2019s box. \u2026can be called four different ways: Erase the screen.Blank out the screen.Wipe off the screen.Clear the screen. The skilled teacher, familiar with the way his students normally speak, typically provides pre-coded libraries of commonly used routines with headers in the \u201clocal dialect.\u201d Students are also encouraged to teach the compiler to speak (and think) as they do, by adding headers to existing libraries, and by developing libraries of their own. The Depth The third difference in our approach is that we we use the same interface and language for both novices and experts alike. This is a system for kids, but it isn\u2019t just a system for kids. We used this very interface and language ourselves to conveniently and efficiently create the whole shebang: uncluttered desktop, simplified file manager, elegant text editor, handy hexadecimal dumper, native-code-generating compiler/linker, and wysiwyg page layout facility for documentation and other creative writing and drawing tasks. So when the student is ready to dig deeper, he can simply dig. He doesn\u2019t have to invest in a new shovel or find another plot of land. It\u2019s all in one place, from \u201cHello, World!\u201d to the machine code. Hello World! Speaking of \u201cHello, World!\u201d, this is a version we often use to illustrate the fundamental concepts of sequence, conditional statements, and looping. This is what we tell the students to type in: To run:Start up.Clear the screen.Use medium letters. Use the fat pen.Pick a really dark color.Loop.Start in the center of the screen.Turn left 1/32 of the way.Turn right. Move 2 inches. Turn left.Write \u201cHELLO WORLD\u201d.Refresh the screen.Lighten the current color about 20 percent.Add 1 to a count. If the count is 32, break.Repeat.Wait for the escape key.Shut down. And this is what they see on the screen when they run their programs (using the Run command, which is conveniently and intuitively located under the \u201cR\u201d menu):  Desert Landscapes Programming is a textual, left-brain kind of activity. But students learn best when both sides of their brains are engaged. So most of our introductory exercises produce inspiring, graphical outputs to enliven both hemispheres and the corpus callosum that connects them. Here\u2019s another sample program: To run:Start up.Draw a desert landscape.Wait for the escape key.Shut down. To draw a desert landscape:Clear the screen.Draw the sky.Draw the sun.Draw the birds.Draw the sand. To draw the sky:Use the lightest sky blue pen.Imagine a line across the middle of the screen\u2019s box.Loop.Draw the line.Refresh the screen.Darken the current color about 3 percent.Move the line up 1 pixel.If the line is above the screen\u2019s box\u2019s top, break.Repeat. To draw the sun:Pick a spot anywhere in the top middle 1/4 of the screen\u2019s box.Make a dot between 1/4 inch and 1 inch wide.Center the dot on the spot.Draw the dot with the lightest yellow color. To draw the birds:Pick a spot in the screen\u2019s box about 1 inch above the middle.Use the black pen.Loop.Move to the spot.Face east.Pick a width between 1/8 inch and 1/4 inch.Draw a quarter circle given the width.Turn around.Draw another quarter circle given the width.Move the spot about 1/2 inch in any direction.Add 1 to a count. If the count is 3, break.Repeat. To draw the sand:Use the lightest orange pen.Imagine a line across the middle of the screen\u2019s box.Loop.Draw the line.Refresh the screen.Darken the current color about 3 percent.Move the line down 1 pixel.If the line is below the screen\u2019s box\u2019s bottom, break.Repeat. Note the seamless integration of vector graphics and turtle graphics. Here\u2019s the kind of artwork that program produces:  Optical Illusions Optical illusions are always fun and inspiring. This is one of my personal favorites: To run:Start up.Draw the crooked line illusion.Wait for the escape key.Shut down. To draw the crooked line illusion:Clear the screen.Use the fat pen.Imagine a big box 4 inches smaller than the screen\u2019s box.Imagine a line across the top of the big box.Imagine a small box 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch.Move the small box to the top left corner of the big box.Loop.Draw and fill the small box with the white color.Move the small box right 1 inch.Refresh the screen.If the small box is still in the big box, repeat.Move the small box close to the left side of the big box.Draw the line with the red color.Move the line down 1/2 inch.Move the small box down 1/2 inch.If the small box is still in the big box, repeat.Draw the line with the red color.Use medium letters.Write \u201cTHE RED LINES ARE ALL STRAIGHT AND PARALLEL.\u201dwith the gold pen at the bottom of the screen\u2019s box.Refresh the screen. You\u2019re going to need a ruler to check out this result:  One More Thing This is the advice we give to our teachers: TEACHING IS TELLING When you tell a student exactly what to do, and he does it, you're teaching \u2014 transferring tried-and-true neural patterns from your working brain into your student's fledgling brain. So you tell the student over and over exactly what you want him to know and do; and before long you find him saying, without prompting, \"Alright already! I've got it.\" This is teaching. Asking a student to solve problems that he hasn't seen before is not teaching; it's testing. Asking him to hypothesize about future results is not teaching, it's testing. In fact, the whole so-called \"Socratic Method\" is not teaching; it's testing. And when you use such techniques, you're essentially asking the student to \"reinvent the wheel\" \u2014 to intuitively come up with something that you already know. Why not let him in on the secret? So when you're teaching Plain English programming, don't ask your students to solve problems, or guess what will happen if this or that code is run \u2014 Tell them. Show them. Let them type it in (so it will enter their brains through their hands as well as their eyes and ears), and let them run the programs they've entered (for the fun of it); but don't ask them to \"come up with\" what's already in your head: hand it to them on a silver platter. Teaching is telling. If a student wants to experiment on his own, that's fine. But don't hand out an assignment unless the answer is provided and the student is told to study and ask questions about the answer (not try to reinvent it on his own). A student who is typing in a correct solution is being taught; a student who is stumbling along making mistakes until he stumbles on the answer is just stumbling. Teaching is telling. Et voila! ",

That is when I actually learnt BASIC, then PASCAL and so on.What I learnt from my experience is that, rather than teaching a language it would be better if you teach him the underpinnings. How to think like a coder, how to design good programs. By teaching him logic, reasoning and eventually pseudocode. This may be a lengthier affair than teaching him BASIC or C, but this would definitely help much better. He could think agnostic to any particular language and grasp new languages easily. He would have much stronger aptitude to write good code. ",

The key for us was having something we wanted to do with the computer. We wanted to play games, and games were in very short supply for this computer. Another key was that although my dad knew some programming, he was learning game programming at the same time, just a few steps ahead. ",

Programming actually is a course set in university, why kids need to learn it? I don\u2019t expect that a kid can easily understand data structures, algorithm or something else relate to programming, these are so difficult for kids, even some university students. So basically I think that we do for kids is that keep their interesting of programming, and rise their creative, logic and so on. Of course, if some kids have potential or talent of programming, any common ways is the best way for them. ",

If your child is really interested, she/he will grasp things quickly, but if you\u2019re forcing it on her/him, she/he will never really enjoy it and feel it\u2019s a burden. Buying fat books and banging them in front of your child yelling at her/him to study those will do no good. Instead, the child needs a proper guidance, perhaps she/he needs to be mentored, rather than just \u201ctaught\u201d. If you know programming, yourself, you can try teaching your child step by step while being easy on her/him. It is very important to look at things from the child\u2019s perspective also. You need to have a lot of patience as coding cannot be taught in a day, it is a gradual process. However, if you aren\u2019t a programmer yourselves, you can try professional coaching from websites like WhiteHat Jr which specialize in teaching coding to kids through their live one to one sessions.

This helped him break down his thoughts as a person as well. It helped him pause to think before speaking. WhiteHat Jr. has been instrumental in developing his cognitive and interpersonal skills. I can't thank the platform enough to see the potential in my child to transform his life. ",
