I think it was when our family moved from my childhood home, that I now experience the most regrets, being seventy years of age, now. Buried in the dirt of our back yard must be dozens of those little, green, plastic army men, about an inch and a half tall. There must be countless jacks my sisters used to play. And, there are probably dozens of marbles my younger brother used to carelessly horde. I would be wonderful to have returned to me these priceless mementos of childhood, that aren\u2019t worth a red cent to anyone else. I hope you have a pleasant Evening, my friend. ",
