            "answer_text": "PGDAV is a good college in terms of faculty but has a bad reputation in terms of crowd and infrastructure. By bad crowd I mean that it\u2019ll take time to find like minded people. In sports PGDAV is known for it\u2019s cricket team and in societies Rudra, the dramatics society is considered to be the best. It is coming up with new societies as well (Enactus was started in Feburary 2016). Talking about infrastructure, PGDAV does not have an auditorium but the Principal has promised the students to get one built by the end of 2017. The library is good. You\u2019ll get almost all the prescribed books. There was no table tennis room until July 2015 but it was built soon after. There is a lot of construction going on in the college so it\u2019s in a development phase. I would suggest you take admission in a college where you are getting your desired course keeping aside the factors like crowd and infrastructure. These things play an important role but getting the desired course should be your priority. All the best! EDIT: 1) The principal fulfilled his promise and ensured that a new seminar hall cum auditorium was built before he retired. 2) Enactus PGDAV is fully functional and has even come up with their own set of recyclable notebooks which are made by the underprivileged.
