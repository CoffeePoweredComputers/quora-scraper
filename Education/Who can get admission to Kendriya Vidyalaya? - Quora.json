            "answer_text": "Students offcourse :P Kendriya vidyavalya is a central school. It comprises over 1094 schools all over India and 3 abroad. The main objective of kv is to educate children of the Indian defence army as the officers are frequently posted to some remote areas. But now it has expanded it's admission to the children of government servants too. I have done my 11th and 12th from kv chopan, and according to my personal experience I advice you not to take admission in kv. Following are the reasons- Mostly all the teachers are pedagogue,they will focus more on formal rules and not on academics. Their main aim is just to complete the syllabus.They won't take pain making you understand the topics.Also the teachers specially the senior ones. They are frequently transferred to some other place,this may happen twice or thrice a year. And if you are senior student you will find hard to cope up with the new teachers. Eventually you\u2019ll not get anything and have to depend on tutions.Mostly all the stage programmes are performed in hindi (complete hindi). You will hardly find any student or teacher speaking in english. Though it isn't a bad idea but all the cbse books are written in english and as a result you will find difficulty in writing your answers in english due to poor vocabulary.Moreover the activities held in kv are way too boring. I remember once we had english/hindi writing competition (when I was in 12th). So forget about debates and allocation.However life was fun here as we got two to three periods free out of eight everyday maybe because the teacher was not present or he/she is not willing to attend the class but frankly telling I didn't do anything productive in these two years and I regret it badly. Thankyou :) ",
