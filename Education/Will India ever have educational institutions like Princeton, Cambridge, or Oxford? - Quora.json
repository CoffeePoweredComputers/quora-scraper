            "answer_text": "We have some exceptional educational institutions in India to be proud of. The IITs, The National Institute of Design, the Delhi School of Journalism, the Indian Institutes of Management, the Regional Enginnering colleges and the Indian Institutes of Science, and some very good colleges of medicine and law too. These are exceptional, especially when you consider that the funding that drives these institutions is way lower than the institutions you mention. For Harvard, Princeton, Cambridge, it is important to understand that these institutions represent the cream of the crop on a much wider base of extremely good universities, and competition makes them even better. For India to build world-class institutions like Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard or Princeton is going to take some serious commitment to excellence in education and some real money. However, in the medium term, it is probably more important to ensure universal access to education and free education, at least up to an undergraduate degree, to every child in the country. That takes more money than the former. We don't need a Harvard or Cambridge today, we need more institutions that consistently deliver a decent quality of instruction on a wider range of subjects than the maniacal focus on Engineering, Computer Science, and medicine that we are obsessed by today.  The quality of liberal arts and other subjects in the humanities, and design outside of a few premier institutions is pathetic. So the answer to your question is that we probably will some day, but it does not keep me awake at night. ",
