            "answer_text": "Although I\u2019m sixty-seven (gasp) I can still remember my first day of Kindergarten - Almond School - Los Altos. This was in 1957 and the school had just opened - first year. My mom walked me to school and said goodbye. I was delighted as they had little pedal cars and a track laid out on the playground. Honestly, I had a blast. The only part I didn\u2019t like was the mandatory nap. The first day I fussed a bit but being five (5) years old I didn\u2019t fuss too much. Now here\u2019s what is amazing. About 10 years ago I was playing the accordion at a Los Altos celebration and a very, VERY pretty lady came over to me - she was perhaps 80 or so - and asked if I was \u201cJimmy Thurber.\u201d I said I was. \u201cI\u2019m Miss Sands, your former kindergarten teacher.\u201d I was stunned. I did, in fact, remember her. Like most kindergarteners I was madly in love with my teacher who was perhaps 23 at the time. Amazing how life works sometimes, eh? And I thought she was, and is, absolutely gorgeous! ",

It hurt a lot, but the real reason I cried was because I got blood on my new dress. To this day, I have the scar. It has kept me from impulsively doing many foolish things! ",
