But the good news is, any small part that we play in conserving the Environment we live in has huge repercussions and leads the way for others to follow. You can start humbly by doing your bit in generating refuse as less as you can. Practice composting in your backyard, carry your own bags while shopping, encourage local shopkeepers to avoid giving polythene bags.Recycle clothes, practice sustainable fashion, stop buying unnecessarily and donate clothes that you wont need.Reduce consumption of meat.Use public transportation for majority of your travel or pool with friends and colleagues.These are some of the ways in which you could have a huge impact on the Environmental conservation movement.
