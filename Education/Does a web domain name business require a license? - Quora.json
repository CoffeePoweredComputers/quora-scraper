An easy way to get started is to register as a reseller with a registrar like eNomCentral.com. I would also recommend looking at an automated billing platform like WHMCS.com to make sure your customers can automatically get reminders and pay when it's time to renew. ",

To be an investor, I don't think you require any licenses, although it might depend on the regulations in your local jurisdiction whether you need some kind of general business license. You definitely don't need any domain industry license. If you want to set up shop as a domain name registrar, then you may need to get some kind of approval from ICANN to do that like the companies listed here. ICANN | ICANN-Accredited Registrars ",
