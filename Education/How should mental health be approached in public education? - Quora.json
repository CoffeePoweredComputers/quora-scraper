            "answer_text": "differently. I personally think that teenagers should be immediately made aware of how to get support: This includes places they can go if they don\u2019t want to live at home anymore. Having round table conversations with their brothers and sisters so everyone is clear on how everyone is feeling. KNOWING that brothers and sister\u2019s attitude to each other changes with mental ill health affects them but they can support each other no matter what. be made aware that things can sometimes get hairy when they turn a certain age and dreams and memories can come back at any age about 20 years old.
