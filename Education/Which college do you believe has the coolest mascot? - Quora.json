            "answer_text": "As an enormous supporter of the University of Michigan Wolverines, I\u2019m going to give you a funny answer: none. Mascots are, at best, silly and frivolous. For example, Brutus the Buckeye is just awful:  At worst, they can be offensive, like Notre Dame\u2019s fighting red-headed leprechaun:  Or the Florida State Seminoles\u2019 Osceola and Renegade:  Michigan is one of the only big-time sports colleges without a mascot, and while every once in a while an alumnus brings it up, they are quickly shouted down by the rest of us. (That said, we DID have a live Wolverine for a while back in the 1920s - which, of course, was a TERRIBLE idea.) So, to summarize: college mascots are stupid and sometimes offensive, and they add nothing to any game except a distraction for when the team is bad. And it\u2019s my opinion that everyone should get rid of them. ",
