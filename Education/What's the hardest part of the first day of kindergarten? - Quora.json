            "answer_text": "Anxiety\u2026.teacher and students. We kindergarten teachers worry about having good beginnings wth our students. We want to meet their individual needs, keep them together as a group, solve problems before they grow bigger, get them to the bathroom in time and get them home safely. My best principal said first day goals, meet em and greet em, unpack their supplies, color a paper, feed them lunch, read a story and get them home safely. You want the first day to be easy and successful so they will WANT to come back day 2. We must do all this with not knowing their names. Name tags get twisted around and some children look very much like their siblings. You call a child by their older siblings names and they DO NOT LIKE IT. We also forget our \" control the group\" strategies from being home for a couple of months. We try the echo clap\u2026.I clap a pattern and the kids clap it back and then listen. I clap and nothing happens because they don't know it. Anxiety for children: getting on the school bus at home, getting out of the car and leaving mommy to be directed by nice ladies outside the school. Feeling lost in the big building. Not remembering their teacher 's name. Not knowing anyone in the class, not knowing where your hook is because you can't read your name card yet, not remembering where the bathroom is. Not knowing how to print your name. Not knowing how to cross your legs to fit in the circle together or your legs and bottom hurt for sitting on a rug instead of a couch and not knowing what to do about it. Can't open your drink at lunch nor your bag of chips, not knowing your bus number to go home. I could go on and on. WE know about everything that is new and stressful and we are there to facilitate over the constant bumps of the beginning of school. Every day gets easier\u2026 children make friends, they know their teacher, they home in on their hooks for book bags, everything becomes a routine and we all thrive in our routines. So if it is bumpy and it is, it will soon be smooth sailing so do not worry. I did not have an adult assistant ever in my classroom. I was alone unless I had a parent volunteer. My last four years I had no volunteers to help start school. I did it well anyway. Our county helped everything start smoothly for children and teachers by having only 1/3 of our class attend for the first three days. That gave me about 7\u20138 children each day to help them do every new. It was wonderful. On the fourth day every child came to meet as an entire class. In a small group there was plenty of time to,spend with each child. They went through the schedule of the entire day. There were no surprises, I could remember their names and they knew me. THAT is how Frederick Co. helped their kindergarten teachers and their new students deal with first day anxiety. p.s. There still was one glitch. The entire school had a fire drill on the fourth day of school\u2026our first day as a complete class\u2026.nothing like taking children out of the building past a screaming fire alarm onto the playground in a LINE their first real day of school. Teachers never win. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Robin. Separation anxiety! And let me tell you, it hit my kid and my self the hardest, not on the first day of kindergarten, but four days later! Number 3 attended a full time day-care for almost a year and a half. He was well trained into having a routine day, meal times, nap times etc. And he always wanted to go to the \u2018big\u2019 school.We prepared for his kindergarten from about mid August.The bag, sneakers, water bottle-the frills. He was super excited. Super happy, jumping with joy. Day one he walked with me to the bus stop, another fantasy coming true for him (he loves vehicles-anything that moves and school bus falls in first five category). He stepped onto the bus, sat on the first seat, waved me goodbye and got busy. The bus moved and all my fears went down the drain. I headed to work, all happy and smiling. Four days into the school, fifth was a rainy, bitter cold day. He walked with me to the bus stop, holding my hand tight. We waited for a good 10 minutes at the stop, while it came down like no tomorrow. The bus arrived and it was the first time I saw his eyes wet. He kept turning around and walking out of the line and kissing me goodbyes. He got on the bus and was glued to the window, smiling full, his eyes all welled up. The wet, grey skies had triggered his anxiety and mine, that was perhaps hidden somewhere in the background.  My co-worker showed up for work yesterday, all upset and anxious. Turned out she went to her child\u2019s school to sign some paper and the child saw her car from afar and how he cried, although he has been calm and happy from day 1. Many children who do not attend preschool or any similar activity may experience difficulty with routines and discipline as well. To me, it still is separation anxiety, for both, parent/care-giver and the child! ",
