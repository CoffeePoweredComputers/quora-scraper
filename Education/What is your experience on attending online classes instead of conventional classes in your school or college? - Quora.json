            "answer_text": "Quite a different experience actually (speaking from college\u2019s point of view ) Can take class anywhere, bed, sofa, floor, kitchen, heck in bathroom.You want get teacher\u2019s attention if you don\u2019t try to get that specifically, more on this in coming points.You choose to listen or not to ( it\u2019s not compulsory for us to turn on the camera )If you really want to learn, teachers are really putting in the efforts for that.There\u2019s no barriers as such of communication, understanding , learning until unless some major issue is there, like unavailability of internet or digital device ( and this is the case in rural India mostly )We miss all the fun we used to have in class and college campus, the real presence of humans are unmatched even after all these technological advancements.Lastly but not the least, we are seeing a great increase in misbehavior teachers and troubling them a lot, a humble request is to please respect them, for most of them it\u2019s a new environment and teaching to a camera is much more difficult than teaching the students, so cooperate with them and live this moment of transition, hope everything will be fine soon.Adios Amigos  Image courtesy : Google Images ",
