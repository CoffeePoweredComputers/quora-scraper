            "answer_text": "I copy pasted this from one of my other answers as I don't know how to link that answer here  The paper was quite simple for someone thorough with PCM from a slightly higher source than NCERT, maybe the Arihant Handbook. Here is my review : English and LR: I was quite surprised by the difficulty of this part. The synonyms and antonyms were quite easy ( Exodus, qualms) , but the paragraph based questions were well framed with similar options . LR was a cakewalk for someone similar with the types of patterns and sequences asked. Chemistry: Fairly simple. Mostly inorganic. Barely any physical. Organic was few in number and quite simple.There was only one biology question , even that was answerable with very little extra knowledge ( which of the following are proteins_ hormones or enzymes or both or none). But the lack of biology questions were compensated for by out of syllabus questions from other topics ( something on mass spectrum; another one on X Ray diffraction which was answerable using the options) Other questions were very easy, and not much factual questions were asked ( contrary to the general trends, so don't skip the mugging up) . Attempted around 30 with ease + 5 more with not so much ease + 5 guesses for bonus questions Physics: Similar to chemistry, most questions were from basic concepts but there were a few JEE Advanced level questions. Electricity and electrostatics was prevelant here .Mostly mechanics based. Similar attempt ratio as chem. Math: Not much to be said here.75\u201380%were direct questions requiring one or two steps/ option substitution. Absolutely no questions from conics. Calculus, vectors and 3DG most important. Continuity and functions had quite a few questions as well. Around 38 questions were attempted confidently. Made educated guesses for the other 7. Strong grip on the basics would help a lot. Bonus questions: Chemistry was a breeze, again no organic or physical. Only inorganic.Physics was a mixed bag . 2 questions were giveaway NLM questions , but the other two were of JEE Advanced level. Maths was okay. The questions were tough but the options were poorly framed. Overall difficulty : Very easy for one who is thorough with the syllabus up to JEE Mains level My mark : 362. And for those demotivated after JEE Mains or advanced : I should tell you my JEE Main Rank is 30 K and I doubt I will qualify for JEE Advanced CRL. So keep your hopes up and keep working. Once good exam is all you need . And even if you don't do well, keep working in whichever college you go to. Hard work always pays. ",

            "answer_text": "My bitsat paper was moderate. My exam was on 18th morning shift.The most easiest section in the paper was chemistry. Except 3\u20134 questions that were asked from biology.Coming to physics,there were direct questions from every topic which are mostly conceptual with less calculations.My weakest part was math . It was pretty easy except 10\u201312 lengthy (a bit).Moreover, 2\u20133 questions from linear programming were asked which I have no idea about.My score was 295 . I could have scored better if I would manage time properly.",
