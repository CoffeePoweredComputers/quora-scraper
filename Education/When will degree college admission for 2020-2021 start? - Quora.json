            "answer_text": "As we all know that COVID-19 is spreading in the whole world very rapidly. Due to this, it is very important for us to keep our health safe which can be done by staying at our home. If the college opens then the life of students will get riskier because these diseases spreads by touching anything or any person. Thus, by viewing this thing, it is not possible to open the degree college in 2020 and if the situation will get worst in the future then it can also be quite possible that in 2021 the college and school will not open. But the admission for the 2020-2021 session will start in the month of July the same as last year. But the difference that comes in the previous year and in this year is that the admission will take place with online mode.

            "answer_text": "As per the current conditions there is minimal chance of colleges opening the admissions. Because of following reason - 12 board exams are left. Everything can't be done online. They can't remove remaining exams. 12 lakh students are affected. Those who studied may loss faith. No money and technology to get everything online and verified. Some apps are bane to government. And if they does everything then the classes may begin from September and admission procedure in August starting (which will be very hectic). ",
