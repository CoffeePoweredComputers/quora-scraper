            "answer_text": "1-Be homeschooled 2-Don\u2019t get a GED 3-Do very well on the PSAT and SAT 4-Sit for some AP exams or maybe some CLEP exams 5-Take two of the SAT 2 subject tests. One of these should be SAT 2 Math 2 There is absolutely no reason to get a GED if you intend to further your education. You do not need a high school diploma to go to college. However, it is very important to take a few exams (such as SAT/ SAT 2 Math 2) in order to prove your competency. If you take AP tests, you can test out of many introductory classes when you go to college. Neither of my kids went to high school or got a high school diploma. The first kid got a full ride, room, board, books, and stipend for spending money for his undergraduate college education (he actually got paid to go to the university, and made a profit due to so many scholarships) and is now at a top 10 medical school. The second kid tested into second year classes at an elite university and then graduated early, getting a large cash refund. She now works at a high paying job in a major city, at an age when many of her peers have not yet graduated. Some universities are more \u201chomeschool friendly\u201d than others. But it is not hard to gain acceptances to top universities after being home educated. Create a portfolio of your work, do research, create your own business, get published, do volunteer work, get a job, read a lot of books. Learn to write well. Learning as a homeschooler is exactly like learning as a college student. Nobody spoon feeds you anything, and you are expected to take the initiative. Take it. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want a diploma, there are certainly ways to get one, however, I don\u2019t think colleges will look down on you for having a GED. Mine certainly didn\u2019t, in fact, my great scores on the GED got me a scholarship right after I applied, and, in my opinion, set me apart from the average high schooler because colleges are very big on \u201cquotas\u201d and giving all types the opportunity to participate. Four years later, I graduated Summa Cum Laud. But, that was my school, and my experience, so\u2026 Do you. Whatever makes you happiest is what you should pursue, but being homeschooled and getting a GED was more than enough for me to do well academically. What\u2019s more important is what you major in, what will give you a job, and what won\u2019t make you burned out after a few years. That\u2019s by far the most challenging part. Going to school is easy, figuring out what to do after is very hard. If I could do it over, I would recommend doing as many internships as you can, as soon as you can. Without experience, you might as well forget applying for jobs in the \u201creal\u201d world unless it\u2019s in the college setting as a teacher. Good grades might get you an interview, but it won\u2019t get you a job. Results and doing what the boss wants done is what gets you a job, and they don\u2019t really teach you that in school. ",
