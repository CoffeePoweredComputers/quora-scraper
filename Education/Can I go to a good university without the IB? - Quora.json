            "answer_text": "I dunno. Can you write write a book with a pencil instead of a pen? Ok that was a very crappy analogy I admit but the point is, YES. Of course you can get into a good university without and IB Diploma. Now hold on just a moment. By \u2018good university\u2019 I\u2019m going to assume you mean a decent university with very respectable rankings worldwide and not an Ivy League university. Ivy Leagues need a separate answer because they\u2019re competitive as hell. As long as you mean any other university aside from the top 1% of the top 1% of all universities and colleges worldwide, this answer may apply to you. Also, I\u2019m assuming that when you ask \u201cwithout the IB\u201d you mean that you\u2019re taking another high school qualification and not about to fail or drop IB. ANYWAY. On with the answer. In simple terms, yes. You can get into a good university of your choice as long as you put in the effort and time to really make your application stand out. Assuming you\u2019re doing another high school certification like A levels or AP, you should be absolutely fine applying to university without an IB Diploma. Colleges and universities know that not all their applicants are applying with IB Diplomas. I mean if you go on to any university website and search hard enough, you\u2019ll find the sections of their sites that show which high school degrees they recognize. I mean check out King\u2019s College London\u2019s list of accepted high school certifications. That\u2019s an example of the broad range of certifications they accept. Ok so that was the long answer. Short answer: Yes you can get into a good university without an IB Diploma assuming you\u2019re still in high school and are graduating with some form of high school certification. Oh just as a side note though, some universities don\u2019t recognize certain high school diplomas but that rarely happens. I would double check with the university website or a teacher just in case. Hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course you can any student can go to any good college without IB just because IB has a really high reputation of being challenging and being a different program compared to AP classes doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get into a good college if you don\u2019t take it. if you\u2019re a good student you have good grades and you\u2019re passionate and you know you\u2019re going to do well and you put all your effort in then you will do well and you will get into the college are you want and in a good college there\u2019s no college that\u2019s necessarily good or bad I think it all depends on the student but regardless you will get into a good university all that matters are your grades and that you challenged yourself in high school ",
