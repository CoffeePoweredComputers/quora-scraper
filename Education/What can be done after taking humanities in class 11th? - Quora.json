I am also a Humanities student. I have completed my 12th from Amity Ggn. We all know that Arts/Humanities is somewhat under rated in India.But, ultimately it all depends on your interests & specialities. The choice of career options & job prospects have to be taken into consideration . Jobs like M.B.A (C.A),Engineering (From IITs),pay you significantly high but that does not mean you will have to go for these.You have Civil Services in Humanities.I think one of the most reputed jobs in India more than CA or Engineering! Go for Humanities! Let's together change the thinking . Arts is an art , to be explored.Lets proudly say its my priority and not my last option. Hope that helps:))) ",
