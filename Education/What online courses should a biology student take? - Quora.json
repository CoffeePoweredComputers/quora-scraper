            "answer_text": "I took one online class and hated it because I missed the experience of taking notes, asking questions, and interacting with other human beings. It wasn\u2019t much better than reading a textbook. I\u2019m sure other people have different opinions. You could probably do as well with some directed reading. Take a look at the syllabus and reading lists for classes that interest you. Most people find chemistry more of a challenge than biology. If you\u2019re a bio major you\u2019re going to need it. It\u2019s difficult to answer this question because you haven\u2019t shared where you are in your education or what kind of work you plan to do. Perhaps would be better off talking with your academic advisor. ",
