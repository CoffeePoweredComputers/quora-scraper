            "answer_text": "As someone with advanced degrees in both English and Mathematics, I could say there should be no reason at all for not loving both, like I do. But I have seen plenty of people who love one and hate the other. It might be helpful to look at two conversations I had thirty years ago when I had finished my masters degree in English and was starting a graduate program in Mathematics. I talked to one of my former English professors and one of my new Mathematics professors about my switch. The English professor told me that I would find teaching Mathematics a lot easier than teaching English because math is all about knowing when to add and how to multiply but English requires real thinking. The Mathematics professor told that I would find that teaching English had been a lot easier than teaching Mathematics, since English is all about knowing when to put a comma and the difference between it and it\u2019s, while Mathematics requires real thinking. What I saw was that people who are good in one subject area and take the time to learn it will be able to see the depth and quality of that subject. Often, however, because they tend to look at only the surface of other subjects, they may think they are all superficial. ",

            "answer_text": "Most math assignments have a very clearly defined right answer, so it is apparent whether you got it right or wrong. Yes, you may have to show your work to explain how you got there, but in the end, there is likely only one correct response. English assignments can be very open ended, and there is a lot of gray area between a stellar paper and a sub-par submission. Often times, a student may have the right ideas in their head, but have a difficult time articulating them on paper (or verbally when giving a presentation). Finally, it is easier for an English assignment to be graded subjectively, or even only perceived to be graded subjectively. This can be frustrating to students. This is only one explanation to why you might prefer math to English. There are likely other reasons that go well beyond what I\u2019ve written. ",
