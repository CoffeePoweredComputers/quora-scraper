            "answer_text": "Disadvantages : 1. Course books are bulky. Written with old syllabus about 10 years back, not updated. 2. Some arts books are copied from other country sources & websites, blindly even without editing it properly to be fit to our country. A statement in my book reads like this \u201c our country like Canada\u2026\u201d 3. They have provided 25 call centre telephone nos in prospectus, surely no-one will pick up the call. If anyone attend it surprisingly they would say that, they are not responsible for what you are asking and contact particular section. 4. I ve done BA, passed with 2nd class, done my MA with 1st class (all in IDEUNOM). If any problem occurs visit the university directly, get it solved. By phone or letter, nothing will happen. 5. They didnot send me books for 10 months after I paid fees and sent the challan. I went there directly, with the student copy challan and collected my books after exhausted attempts by phone, email etc. 6. Choose good study centre or if you are around Chennai go for spot admission. Advantages : Fees for each year is comparatively low. I neither informed nor attended PCP classes which mostly conducted in Chennai.Has better reputation than many private universities offering distance education. One of the oldest university of India (since 1857).Exams are conducted with strict discipline without any copying or malpractice so far I have seen.Govt university certificates gets due respect always.If you study with dedication, classes are not required you can pass with the books provided. Check with model question paper provided behind every book & study accordingly.Hopefully semester pattern study is not implemented yet. So, exams are once in a year only.Marks are reasonable to our performance in the exam. So, I think evaluations are done properly.So, all the best. Choose the right degree and succeed, nothing much to worry. Update : Recently, IDEUNOM has revised their books. Course material can be downloaded by entering the roll number, from their website itself. ",
