            "answer_text": "\ud83d\udc4b dear reader, As far as I know,the examinations will be conducted on their respective dates.. my brothers is in class 10 and their registration for class 10 board examination have started and there are 90% chances that the examinations will be conducted on their respective dates but it's not necessary because there are some schools who might not have not completed the portion or there are practical marks which are to be given on the basis of assignments projects and which is not easy to give through online courses so I think there might be some chances atleast 10% chances that the exams might get postponed but let's not wait for the exams to get postponed and prepare for the same as early as possible so that we don't fall into a trouble in the future.. These kind of questions cannot be answered by students in fact this all depends on the academic calendar which is actually released by the government . let's not worry about the future and concentrate on the present keep preparing and keep giving your 100%.. it would be beneficial for you if if you start practicing from now so that in the future even if the exam is postponed you will be able to revise and practice more and more so that you become perfect and score a perfect and a decent marks in your board examination.. All the best and keep working hard \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f Hope my answer helps you ,please let me know \ud83d\ude42 ",
