For example, if we select people at random from a population, their approval for a policy is of this nature\u2014they either approve or not. The probability of picking an approver is almost constant (if the sample is much smaller than the population) and independent of others. The binomial distribution then lets you make inferences about the reliability of your estimate of the proportion of approvers in the population. ",
