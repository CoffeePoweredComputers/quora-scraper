            "answer_text": "1. The syllabus is not crap. If you are attempting to be an engineer, that's the minimum required of you before you really understand anything at all in engineering. The syllabus is simply the Intermediate-level science and nothing else. How do you think you would understand Bridge-Modelling if you did not know Young's Modulus, or how would you get the concept of dynamic programming if you don't know basic mathematics ?2. 'Solving weirdo problems' - signifies that you never really managed to grasp the concepts. People cracked JEE just by studying NCERT thoroughly, and NCERT problems are quite practical.3. People who did not understand the basics of whatever is written in the books never made it to IITs. You need to know some simple calculation and scientific facts at the very least, clearing the cut-off requires a good head.4. Criticizing the system is easy. Initiating the change is not. There's no problem in IIT-JEE process (apart from caste-based reservation).5. JEE does test the level of your knowledge, but it focusses more on the level of your understanding at large, the way you analyse problems and the method which you adopt to solve them, using whatever you already know and your brain. Flukes don't always work for everyone in JEE (for most, they don't - I guessed 8 answers in no-negative-marking questions and none went correct). Without some proper reasoning in at least some questions, I doubt anyone managed to scale the heights.6. Almost 1.8 million aspirants attempted JEE-Mains in 2014 for 9862 seats in IITs and ISM Dhanbad, including almost 50% reserved seats - that's one of the lowest selection percentage around the world. It is reasonable to assume a high cut-off owing to such cut-throat competition, but surprisingly enough (just for you, get the sarcasm!) - 117 out of 360 is quite a low bar set for such a high honour, plus you need to hunt it down in JEE-Advanced after that. You think that's easy - you must be from Pandora ! I would have given you a standing-ovation if you had said \"'I don't want to go to IIT, it's not my field\", AFTER you cracked JEE-Advanced. Why waste your parents' valuable money for something you don't want ? You should have tried to say this to your parents, they would have understood you, or at least you could go into the exam with a clear conscience.  And for the record, JEE-Mains is not really hard. Mock JEE after you have actually aced something else somewhere else, or try for some serious contemplation of your thought-process otherwise. ",

For them it is okay because they are passionate about it and they do work hard for that. But on the other hand students who are not not really interested in studying there JEE indeed is \u201cHARD\u201d. ",
