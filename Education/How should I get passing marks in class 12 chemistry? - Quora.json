            "answer_text": "Passing in chemistry is not a big deal. To just pass chemistry,you have to just study properly.Consider these: 1.Firstly do the chapters- Solid state,Solution,Electrochemistry,Chemical Kinetics.Complete these chapters properly. 2. From solid state,do the full chapter and yes numericals is must on the formula of Density. Solution chapter you have to study full chapter. Electrochemistry,numericals based on nerst equation,E cell,gibb\u2019s energy and also the diagram of a cell. Do the numericals from ncert. Chemical Kinetics,do the full chapter and only ready those topics which is included in your ncert textbook. 3. Now when you are done with those chapters,do polymers and chemistry in everyday life.For these two chapters,learn all the question and answers from ncert coz from these chapters,questions are directly asked from ncert.(Note: From these two chapters,don\u2019t do any kind of structure making or IUPAC type,only learn theory part). If you have learned these two chapters,m damn sure you will get full marks from these chapter.Just do learn the intext+ ncert exercise all question answers(except don\u2019t go for any kind of iupac or structure type question). 5. If you have completed Solid state,solution,Electrochemistry,Chemical Kinetics,Polymers,Chemistry in everyday life. I assure you that you will definitely pass chemistry with good marks. All the best and remember study smart,don\u2019t study hard like all those sticky insects. ",

Look for the formulas of ELECTROCHEMISTRY, CHEMICAL KINETICS, SOLID STATE etc . If you simply remember the formulas and you get a question related to that you can easily solve it. Revise P, D and F block elements along with the coordination chemistry chapters . Also chapters like polymer, biomolecules, chemistry in every day Life should not be taken for granted . All together they can be asked for 10\u201312 marks. All the name reaction should be memorised if possible . There are Chances they can be asked directly . Stick to whatever you have prepared so far . Revise again and again. Keep calm and read the question carefully before writing answer. All the best. ",

Thank you so much \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb P.S : I scored 41 out of 70 by doing just these chapters And try to at least answer every question like write something relevant you\u2019ll surely get marks.

So here is what you can do start with inorganic chemistry NCERT from intext questions to the back exercises just try to memorise them theses questions will give you an insight to the whole chapter , and if you have any reference books then pls do questions from them. One question for sure is going to come form solid state simply learn the basics life formulas and the packing efficiency etc. Learn the basic formulas from electrochemistry if direct question would come then you will be able to answer that. from surface chem memorise the bulk topics like micelle formation, sols, collidal solution, emulsification, adsorption isotherm and enzymes. for org part take one sheet (2\u20133) and write all the name rxns and the catalyst in them pls pls pls laearn them . Make some short points for conversion problems and practice you have enough time. I won\u2019t promise that you\u201dll pass but surely this could help you. ",
