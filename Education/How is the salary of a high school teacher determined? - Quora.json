            "answer_text": "Originally, before the era of contract negotiations, the Board of Educations set the salary schedule. The district had so much income and thetefore money to spend. From those funds the administration has to pay for facilities, supplies, student costs, insurance, food, and salaries. I doubt that any member of a school board would vote to keep salaries low if they had the budget to allow them to pay more. If it costs the school district a million dolars to give teachers a one per cent raise, that means a million dollars less for other costs. Now, of course, salaries are set by negotiations between the teachers association/union and the school board through the administration. Both sides know how much money the district has to work with. We could ask for a ten percent raise, but we know that to fund that, thete would be no heat in our classrooms, no food services, and no paper! At least in my experience, both sides wanted to keep salaries competitive and fair, and both sides knew what it costs to maintain a district. For many years, even before the negotiations era, the district promised to keep our salary schedule above the average of the seven surrounding districts. If the average raise was three percent, the district would give up a raise at or above three percent. When the State of California was in trouble, and didn't send the money we expected and they had promised, both the district and the teachers knew that there was no money for raises. Indeed, there were cuts in personnel to allow the district to maintain the payroll. Everyone kept track of what we would have gotten if the salary had been tied to the cost of living. When, after a number of years, the state met its constitutional requirements to fund schools at a certain level \u2014 the state supreme court ruled that the state had acted illegally \u2014 the district added up all the raises we had missed and that was its offer. It also added enough of a raise to fund the money we had not received the years of no raises. We had pulled together to get through the lean years; we certainly stayed together when the funding improved. an aside. In the United States all states use a unified school district. All teachers are on the same salary schedule. Education, experience, and special duties determine the salary. The level on which one teaches \u2014 elementary, middle schhol or high school \u2014 has no influence on one's pay. ",

            "answer_text": "At my Charter School (as well as the school district we came from), salary is determined by the number of college credits received AFTER getting your Bachelors Degree, and by your years of service. at 20 years and 96 units of credit, you max out, and only get a raise when one is negotiated, or when you reach a 5 year supplement (so you get a raise at 25, 30, 35, and so on). Most schools work on a seniority system or a modified seniority system where you get credit for additional training. This is mainly because this system is the only one that is clearly measurable and not determined by the performance or lack of performance of children on a test. Right now, I work on EDUCATING my students. I am only worried about making sure they understand history. I get them ready for the state tests, but that is not my focus. If we went to a system where my pay relied on the students doing well on a test, you can bet your bottom dollar I would give up this understanding history crap and teach nothing buy test taking skills, and drill and kill on facts likely to be on the test. I wouldn\u2019t give a rats behind if they understood\u2026 My only job would be to get them ready for that test, then do everything I legally can do to make sure they all scored well on that day (and perhaps encouraged one or two to play hooky on the day of the test)\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "In the state of Georgia, there is a state-pay base salary scale. No matter where you teach, teachers with the same number of years teaching and with the same degrees are paid the same amount FROM THE STATE. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you are teaching in a rich district or a poor district; the state pay is the same. However, local boards of education can add supplements to teachers\u2019 salaries, and the supplements can differ dramatically. I retired with 36 years of experience and have a Master of Education degree and a Specialist of Education degree. My local teaching supplement was $1800. If I had chosen to drive 35 miles to a neighboring county to teach, the local supplement for someone with my credentials and experience earns an $8000 local teaching supplement. Additional supplements can also be added for extra duties (coaching a sport, for instance), and, of course, there are administrative supplements. So, the pay a teacher receives from the state is the same regardless of where you teach for teachers with comparable degrees and years of experience, but where you teach can add a little or a lot to your salary. The cost of living in the district 35 miles from me is considerably more than where I live and teach, and while I have never calculated the cost of commuting against the supplement I would receive, I have never been unhappy with my pay where I am.

Usually it is just enough so that the teacher can pay rent on a third class abode and is barely enough to keep a fly alive. How are they decided? A school board is elected\u2014usually formed with doctors, lawyers, business owners [all rich as hell] whose connection with the school is very minimal and they try to lo ball salaries in favor of athletic equipment and other items before looking at teachers\u2019 salaries.

Teacher salaries are also paid by the government. School boards, which are the legal employers of all school staff, have no say in the pay of those staff. Salaries progress with experience and if leadership roles are taken on, in accordance with a set scale.
