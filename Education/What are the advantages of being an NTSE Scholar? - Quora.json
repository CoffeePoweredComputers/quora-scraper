            "answer_text": "I guess I am eligible to answer this because I just cleared the second stage of NTSE.I am yet to experience any pre-collegiate advantages , but one thing I can tell you is that an NTSE scholar tag has great value associated with it. It is a really prestigious affair. This is mainly because over 12-14 lakh students from 36 regions (29 states+ 7 UTs) appear for this exam and in the end only 1000 are selected for award of scholarship. (This year it was even lesser; just 850).This means that only about 0.06% make it through, which clearly shows how difficult it is to crack NTSE. It was also the first competitive exam result that brought a wide smile to my parents' faces :-I guess it was mainly because ranks weren't given ; )It also gives you a reason to be happy for say a week or two after the results :D To sum up, even though the scholarship amount is meagre, the prestige associated with NTSE is something that can never be matched by any other scholarship.

            "answer_text": "In economics, there is a concept called as signalling problem. In a world of imperfect information, it is difficult to distinguish between agents having high potential and those having lower potential. In such a situation, certain actions taken by the individual signal that the agent is a high potential individual or not. Our entire education\u200bsystem rests on signalling. You must have seen investment banking and consultancy firms recruiting engineers from IIT's despite the lack of any formal training in finance in applicants. However, being from IIT signals that the individual has a high potential and can quickly learn on the job. NTSE scholarship serves the exact same purpose. This exam selects 1000 NTSE scholars every year from school level in India. Other than the benefits already mentioned like scholarship throughout your academic career, it acts as signalling mechanism on your CV that projects as you as a candidate with excellent aptitude. It will help you in all future endeavors, be it academic career or in the job market by signalling it to the interviewer that you are a candidate with high potential. ",
