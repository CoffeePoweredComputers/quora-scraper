            "answer_text": "It took me a couple years of college to figure this out, but here's how I ended up getting good grades in my junior and senior years while still having ample time to party and have a social life. (I went to UCSB, a great academic institution and a great party). The first bit of advice I would give is to take classes that you have some interest in. Even the more 'boring' pre-requisite classes offer up some choice to the students of several classes that will fulfill that requirement. Choose the one that is most interesting to you. It's a lot easier to do well in a class if you are interested in the topics. If none of the classes seem remotely interesting to you, then perhaps this isn't a good time in your life to be going to college, as you should be somewhat eager to learn something. Now once you have your classes selected, ask yourself, what is your goal for each class. In general, my experience was that a bare minimum of effort was required to get a C in a class, only a moderate amount of effort was required to get a B in a class, but for most classes, an A took quite a significant amount of effort, perhaps double that of a B. In other words, the effort required to get each better grade often increases exponentially. So if a given class required 2 hours of attention/work per week to get a C, it may have only required 4 hours per week to get a B, but probably demanded around 8 to 12 hours per week to get an A. So, decide how important an A is to you vs. a B in a given class, and remember, unless you plan on going to grad school, your GPA doesn't really matter, just that you got your degree. That being said, pay attention to what is required to take more advanced classes in your major, because sometimes a given grade in a certain class can be very important in order to take the next class in the series, and you always want to leave yourself some margin for error in case you bomb the final or miscalculated how much work was really required. Now, this is how you strategize your time if you want to cut a few corners like I did. (If I hadn't cut those corners, the work load was large enough that I would have had zero social life outside of class). First, and most importantly, go to every class the first week and pay close attention. Get the syllabus and study it carefully. The syllabus for each class should outline the entire semester for you and allow you to start planning your investment of time into that specific class strategically. Put every quiz, mid-term, final, research paper and homework assignment that is due in your calendar and set a reminder for yourself. It is imperative that you do not miss any of these if you want at least a B. Every professor or student teacher is different, but they generally fall into one of two categories. Those who place more value and emphasis on the lecture and those who place more value and emphasis on the textbook/reading. I found that you can usually determine this pretty well after the first week of classes. For those that place more emphasis on the textbook, you may not need to pay as close attention during lecture, for the others, you may be able to skim the reading assignments if you just take good notes in the lectures. Don't skip classes where the lecture is the primary delivery tool of information for that professor. For the professors where the reading assignments or textbooks are the primary tool, you will often be able to tell because they spend most of their lecture reviewing the textbook and from this you can usually infer what parts of the textbook they place the most value in. The easiest classes are often ones where the professor is actually the, or one of the authors of the textbook you are reading because they will more or less duplicate the information in class. Also pay attention to the points structure and see if more value is placed on quizzes or homework assignments. Most teachers will lay this out for you right from the get go. I found that with a basic understanding of what was expected by each professor, which could be ascertained relatively easily after the first week, very little extra effort was needed to get at least a B in a given class. An A was usually much harder and more labor intensive to come by. Now when you take your first mid-term or get your first major homework assignment, you should be able to have a good feel for what that professor expects from you for the rest of the class. Even if you don't do well, at this point there should still be time for a course correction and many professors will not only be lenient, but will place a fair amount of weight into boosting someone's grade who shows improvement from this time on. So if you miscalculated a bit on whether the lecture or the textbook was more important, or how heavily weighted the quizzes and homework assignments were, this is the time to adjust. No two classes are the same and the above strategy works best for liberal arts classes. Hard science classes almost always build on previous information. So you really can't skip any steps there. Just for reference, I got straight C's my freshman year, but finished my senior year with a cumulative GPA of 3.5. There were a few classes that I was really interested in where I can say I went to every class, read and completed every assignment... Most classes I took, I at least cut a couple corners, but that gave me time to have a social life, party, explore and enjoy college, where I doubt I would have had any time to do that if I did everything that was assigned to me on a full time course load. Edit: One thing I forgot to mention but can provide a decent boost to a grade in a given class is the importance of the professor\u2019s office hours. Don\u2019t be afraid or intimidated to see your professor during their office hours (which most colleges and universities require their faculty to keep). First, if you are falling behind or not performing as well as you would have liked for a given class, your professor might be open to creative ideas to earn extra points/credit. Often these assignments aren\u2019t very time or labor intensive and can often mean the difference between a B- and a solid B, or a B+ and an A-. Secondly, your professors are human, (and usually compassionate), and when they can put a face to a name in their class, when they\u2019ve developed a personal relationship with someone, they are more likely to move you up a notch if you are on the cusp between two grades. Office hours are a great way to give your grades a little extra boost without much extra effort, they help you keep track of how you\u2019re doing in a class, and, if you\u2019re going to school for the right reasons, should be relatively enjoyable as you will be having a conversation with someone who is passionate enough about a subject you\u2019re studying that they\u2019ve made a career of it.

            "answer_text": "I graduated on honour roll from college twice - associates in humanities and then a bachelor's in business. For my BA, I graduated top of my major. I also have a professional certification as a Certified Payroll Professional (CPP), which I gained while working full time. Here's what worked for me: [1] Know that Sleep is Unimportant. Time is of the essence in school, and sleep is one of the biggest thieves. While sleep is important, learn to need less and less of it. No matter how early you get things out of the way, there will always be nights when you need to stay up. In college, I allotted 6 hours per night for sleep. I got 2 hours as soon as I walked through the door and then timed my bedtime so that I went to sleep only 4 hours before I needed to be up for my morning class.  This put more hours in my day to get more done, and staying up became a breeze. I also used Twitter and other social media to help me stay awake by engaging my followers in discussions about what I was studying. You'd be amazed to know how much this helps you remember things. [2] Find a Distraction. This seems like an unlikely thing to need in college, but find something that you look forward to doing every day, except school work. For me, I loved to write books and play video games. I used them as rewards for when I completed particular goals. Finished a whole night of studying or completed a whole project? Awesome! That last hour was me blasting away at video games as payment. [3] Join a Study Group. In college, I tutored students one-on-one and in study groups for a number of subjects. I taught everything ranging from finance to law. Not only did it help me stay on top of my work, but all my \"students\" passed all their courses as well. Sometimes you need information related to you in informal language, in a way that you can remember it. Too often textbooks don't do it and teachers don't know how. [4] Write Everything Down. I know a lot of show offs who claim they can remember everything and don't need to write it down. Well... none of them graduated with a higher GPA than I did. I will tell you what my teachers told me, \"The weakest ink lasts longer than the strongest memory\" and don't you ever forget it. In fact, write that down, too.  I typed all my lectures, so when exams came around I had all my notes to turn to. If you are doing technical and mathematical courses, writing down those formulas and calculations is super important. Even if you don't understand it, write it down anyway. You can figure it out later. [5] Buy a Laptop. I don't understand how people write all their notes by hand. It is a slow process. Buy a laptop and learn to type fast. I type at 70 words per minute. I got almost everything my teachers said word for word. I was the go-to person for notes in class. Everyone else wrote them down by hand. [6] Read Over as Soon as You Get Home. The first order of business when I got home (after my two hour nap) was to read over everything I had done in class that day. This really only takes an hour or two and helps to ensure that the notes stick while it's still fresh. You can also quickly correct any mistakes you might have made in your notes. This helps to keep the information familiar to you.  I went a step further by converting all my notes into cue cards. I used those to study for tests afterwards, so that I didn't need to re-read the whole thing. And I didn't have to be struggling to write them up for finals. [7] Three Time's the Charm. When I was in high school, my English teacher told me that our brains only retain 30% of information at a time, so we have to read things three times to score 90%. I don't know the science behind that, but I used that in my routine. My aim is always to interact with the information/material from class at least three times in three different forms. I don't count class time. That's my hidden number four to boost me up to as close to 100% as possible. So for instance, I might read over the notes in class (one), and then read the corresponding chapter in the textbook (two), followed by reading the powerpoint slides we used to get (three).  [8] Stay Single. Relationships are fun and nurturing, but obligations to partners often gets in the way of good grades. If you have a partner who gives you a lot of space and can actually help you or tutor you in school, then you've struck gold. Otherwise, that person will take up a huge chunk of your time.  I was a great student in my relationship in college. I scored amazing grades and my work was often used as quality samples for other students. But, when I broke up with my fiance, my grades got even better. I went from an A/B student to A s. [9] Take Care of Yourself. School is stressful. Boost those feel good hormones with exercise. It will also prevent you from getting that complacent beer gut that many people leave college with. College is a \"sedentary\" job. Get up and run. Go to the gym. Bike. Walk. Do anything but sit all day. Eat healthy and don't use college as an excuse to stock up on junk. The last thing you need is to feel sick the night before your finals. Take supplements to boost your immune system and cook with garlic.  In college, almost every month my group had the cold or flu. Everyone would catch it but me. Also, in the second year of my BA, the whole school came down with chicken pox. It spread through the class like wildfire. The guy behind me in class had it, and so did all my roommates. I didn't get it. So I walked into exams on top of my game, while so many people were itchy and miserable. [10] Be Proactive. It sounds simple, but one of the biggest mistake people made in my classes was to procrastinate. I was team lead for my group so they didn't have that luxury. If we got the outline for a project today, they could count on starting it tonight. At first, it annoyed the hell out of them, but they soon realised how less stressful it was to do things when we had time for it.  When the work load increased and everyone else was struggling to meet deadlines, our work was already handed in and we were tweeting and playing video games. Because our work was never rushed, we had time to do multiple revisions at our leisure and produced high quality work time and time again. One of our teachers actually got audited for giving us 100% on a final project in a course that had one of the highest failure rates. The audit failed to find any fault with her teaching or our project. We kept that A+. Feel free to reach out for additional advice regarding doing well in school. I currently mentor/tutor college students as a hobby. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to have a hard time topping Elizabeth H. Simmons's answer given she's a dean and sees hundreds if not thousands of students a year (Michigan State is a huge school). But, here's the perspective of a college student who almost failed his first year, turned it around, and graduated with a decent GPA. I went on to get a MBA at a top tier school graduating with high distinction. Here's what I learned: Balance your workload. Before registering for a class, do research as far as how much work is involved. That way, you can make sure you can meet the time commitments.Time management is vital. My freshman year, I had a bad case of FOMO (fear of missing out). I had to go to this party or that one. I didn't want to be the one to hear stories about my friends' epic time out. Bad idea. You procrastinate and jam yourself into a corner time wise. I was pretty depressed after my freshman year and realized I needed to structure my week. I set aside Sunday evening to Friday afternoon as school time. No parties. No staying out late. Me and my books. Friday night through Sunday afternoon, I'd go out with my friends.Stay caught up in your reading. Falling behind results in cramming and cramming results in crappy grades. Period.Doing the homework and suggested assignments is basically exam prep. Most professors take modified versions of problems you do in homework for exam problems.Figure out what your goals are before you take a class to determine how involved you'll be. Example: I needed to get good grades in physics but it wasn't core to my major. So, I spent little time in class, but learned from the textbook and did the problems. Aced the class, but didn't afford myself the opportunity to ask my professor, a world-class physicist, questions that would've expanded my knowledge.Sleep. A lot. You can't learn when you don't sleep. Get into a schedule. I started to wake up regularly regardless of when class started and go to the gym for a workout. That helped set the pace for the day.Avoid distractions when studying. Some friends, romantic interests, etc are all bad news when you need to focus. I essentially had two sets of friends: those I could study with and those I partied with. The overlap between those two groups was tiny. A lot of the time, I studied alone.For lab work, choose wisely. Having an idiot or screw around lab partner is a recipe for disaster. Make sure to pair up with someone who takes schoolwork as seriously as you do. I finally found a girl who was headed for the same major, super smart, easy to work with, and to boot, was super cute. I made sure we were in lab together. She saved my ass in lab more times than I can count. I helped her too. We both did great.In the end, with time management, a bit of forward planning, and judicious selection of friends, you can have the time of your life AND get good grades. That's what I figured out anyway. As far as my cute lab partner, nothing became of that because I was in a long-term relationship, but that's a different answer to a different question. ",

            "answer_text": "There are already some great answers here, but I'll give you some of my techniques. I had  a *very* simple strategy for doing well in college (undergrad and grad, both). It goes like this: \"Go to class, do the work, study for the tests.\" I know, it sounds way too simple to actually help, but it works. If you're not in college yet, you'd be shocked how many kids either 1) don't go to class, 2) don't do the work, 3) don't study enough, or 4) cheat their way through. If you do any other those three things I listed, you're ahead of the game. If you do all three, you *will* get an A.  The following are some more details about how to actually accomplish these three things: 1) Go to class This one is easy. Get to class on time. Get a seat in third row in a desk near the edge. You want to sit here because you will be close enough that you'll be forced to pay attention (less phone usage), but not so close that you'll feel self-conscious. Even if you don't think you'll use them, take notes! Personally I remember about 50% of what I read, maybe 10% of what I hear, but I remember almost everything that I write down. 2) Do the workThis one is a little trickier. Don't just do the homework, understand it. That means don't wait until the night before to do the work. Start a few days early and make sure one of the TAs has office hours between the time you start and the due date. If you've been following \"Go to class\", you'll have some decent notes to help you on the homework. Often times the questions are pretty much laid out in the textbook somewhere so keep that handy. If you still are stuck, go to the TA. I never did this much, but I know a lot of people who did and they found it very helpful. Another option is to find someone to work on the homework with. In my experience, though, if you've been going to class from the start, taking notes, learning the material, the homework will not be anything too difficult. 3) Study for the testsThis one is obvious, but people really don't take it seriously enough. Study, study, study! I have a rule when it comes to exams and I want you to really let this one sink in: \"You should not be thinking during the exam\" or, put another way, \"Homework is for thinking, exams are for doing\". If you find yourself \"learning\" something new on the test, you didn't study enough. Too many students will go to exams having only studied the night before (or not at all) and hope to \"figure it out\" as they go. To be completely honest, even I've done this strategy before. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it is never a good experience. Ask your questions, make your mistakes, do your actual thinking during the homeworks. The exams will not be anything too different from what you've already learned and worked on (it wouldn't be fair otherwise!), so use the homeworks as your prep. You want to go into this exam knowing the material so well that you could do it in 10 minutes. How do you this? Keep reading. -> Read your notes at least *three times*. Don't settle for a quick review. Actually read every line of your notes 3 separate times. Once or twice will get you the big topics, but that third time will let you catch those tricky concepts or small details that might make or break the exam  -> Do the homeworks again. The homeworks are essentially sample exam questions. Do them again and then check your answers. Do this at least once, but as many times as you need to understand *all* the problems. Luckily you have the solutions and the work so you can catch any points where you don't understand some things.  -> If this class has any slides, read them over at least twice. Once will be enough to grab the big ideas, but twice or three times is what you need to catch all the details.  -> (Optional) If the class has readings (like books or textbook pages), you can try going over those, but in my opinion this will be too much for you to do. -> (Optional) Go to the TAs again if there's something you *really* don't get, they'll think of a way to make it easy for you to understand. NOTE: Make sure you to give yourself enough time. This process will take about three days to finish if you do one \"run through\" per day, which is what I recommend to let the information sink in.  Okay! Take a breath, that was a lot. This method is guaranteed to get you good grades. Why? Because this is not a \"trick\" or a \"tactic\" or some goofy learning technique that people try to use. This is just you legitimately learning all the material. 5 years from now, in a job interview, on the job, etc you will still remember a lot of what you learned, which will help you. I know this might sound like a lot of work, but trust me, I had a very active and enjoyable social life during college and still made this work. I also played a lot of music and videos games as well, so there was quite a bit of balance in my life. A little about me: I used this method for my undergrad degrees in chemical engineering and economics from Columbia University and my graduate degree in computer science from USC. I did very well at both these schools. Best of luck in college and I hope you take this method to heart. It served me well and it will serve anyone else who decides to use it. ",

            "answer_text": "In 2016, my first year of taking the IB Diploma ended with me obtaining an overall score of 33/45. That year was one filled with \u2018littles\u2019: Little sleep, little willpower to push on, and little clue on what the hell I was doing. One thing, however, wasn\u2019t little: my intense hatred of the IB. (IB alumni all around the world, I bet you\u2019re with me on this one!)  However, somewhere along the lines, something changed. In 2017, I graduated high school with an IB score of above 40. Imagine this: 40/45. A jump of over 7 points within a year. To put this in perspective, in 2016, I couldn\u2019t even get into most courses in most of the universities in my own country. Today, almost all their doors are open. If I tried hard enough for the SATs, the Ivy Leagues like Harvard and Stanford wouldn\u2019t be too distant a dream. Sure, you might argue that high school isn\u2019t the equivalent of college, but boy did the IB Diploma Programme come close. If you aren\u2019t aware of what the IBDP is, according to the official IB website, it\u2019s a programme that aims to develop students to \u201chave excellent breadth and depth of knowledge\u201d that is comparable to that of a college major. So\u2026 how did I do it? How did I leap more than seven overall points in a single year? Handwrite all your notes. Or at least the vital points.As you handwrite your notes, your memory absorbs the information better. If you\u2019d like to take an additional step, I suggest reading every point and synthesising the knowledge in your head, then writing the knowledge down by hand in your own words for maximum knowledge retention. While it takes more time for you to study this way, I guarantee that you will have a better understanding of the subject matter.  Schedule the heck out of your day.I was an Art student who was rushing to complete 6 pieces of work in a year. Then, there was a twenty page comparative Literature essay to be turned in three days from now. Oh, what about that Extended Essay draft? You get the gist - \u2018free days\u2019 are a nonexistent phrase in an IB student\u2019s dictionary. In order to keep track of all my assignments, I became best friends with the calendar on my Mac and my journal. Every single day was scheduled to the hour, like a precisely orchestrated performance. Have enough sleep.8 hours of sleep every night in college? Ha, good joke! But, 6\u20137 hours every night while throwing in an occasional 8 is definitely doable. Throughout my 2 years while doing the IB, I never pulled an all-nighter. I didn\u2019t believe in doing all-nighters because I believed they would affect your entire next day. Why \u201csave\u201d an additional six hours past midnight, only to have the next 24 hours affected with low productivity? Does this make sense to you? It doesn\u2019t to me. Pomodoro TechniqueYou\u2019ve probably heard this one before. Break your study time up into 25 minute blocks - 20 minutes of studying, followed by 5 minutes of break. During this break, get up and walk, get a glass of water, use the bathroom - do whatever you want, except continue to sit on the chair you\u2019re sitting on while studying. By timing your study sessions, your brain gets incentivised to \u201cwork\u201d, like how Journal consistentlyYou don\u2019t have to journal every single day, but throwing in an entry or two every week is a great way to get you pumped and ready for that next study session. How might journaling relate to obtaining good grades? You see, journaling is an opportunity to reflect and maintain a dialogue with yourself. This way, you can actually see on paper where you went wrong, what processes you could have improved, and how you could create more productive study sessions in the future. Tracking your progress and improving your process is fundamental to actively make improvements in your life, be it within or beyond the academic sphere. Have an inspiring whyFor six months while doing the IB, I didn\u2019t know why the hell I was doing what I was doing. I knew that I wanted to pursue something either business or creativity-related. How would atomic structures and periodicity help me in my future career?! Why the hell was I doing it? After months of pondering, I came to realise that my \u2018Why\u2019 was just to prove to myself that I could develop the resilience to power through activities that I didn\u2019t like, and still excel in it. It was to develop an insane work ethic that would benefit me years after I completed the IB. Have a \u2018Why\u2019 greater than your present circumstances, and remind yourself that daily. Learn to love the process. Even if you hate what you\u2019re doing.People tend to confuse and converge \u201clove what you do\u201d with \u201clove the process\u201d. The reality, however, is that these two phrases are actually very different. Loving the process means gaining satisfaction and feeling in control despite how challenging the situation might be. Because I was juggling my Art projects with all my other subjects and assignments, 12 hour workdays were the norm for me. Amidst these 12 hours, there were times when I was struggling with challenging math problems which I hated. I hated doing certain assignments or subjects during the day. Yet, looking back at each day and how I\u2019ve managed to complete all that I\u2019ve planned to do for the day, a wave of satisfaction would tide over me. That, my friend, is loving the process. I don\u2019t believe that you would like every single thing you do every single day, but if the overall experience gives you immense satisfaction, you\u2019re loving the process. And learning to love the process is more important. Find the right environment.During my days as an IB student, I would always head down to Singapore\u2019s National library to study, even if it was 8pm and the sun had set hours earlier. On weekends, I\u2019d get up at 7am just to make my way down so I could guarantee myself a seat. I had such an affinity towards that library despite it being an hour away from my house, because I loved the environment. Between the murmuring walls and amidst the calming rustle of flipping pages, entering my state of flow and concentration was such an easy task.  Looking back, it was insane how I managed to pull through my 2 years as an IB students. Yet, learning to hone my studying processes helped me to achieve the grades that I got in the end. If I can do it, so can you. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "The most important thing you can do to ensure your success in college (which means learning things, not necessarily getting good grades--the two are NOT the same) is to learn how to learn.  For some reason, we spend years and years providing information on various subjects to children, but we never spend any time at all teaching them how to learn it.  We assume it is an inborn ability or something everyone just picks up as they go along, and it isn't.  Shockingly few people actually know how to efficiently get information into their brains in such a way that it will stick in such a way as so they will be able to retrieve it.   There is lots of research on cognition and learning and there are also a number of books written on the subject.  Google \"learning how to learn\" as a place to start. Learning how to learn is, by far, the most important thing you can do to facilitate success in college and beyond, but there are also a number of other habits and skills you also need to apply to get the most from the experience.  You have to want to learn, and you have to work at it.  The harder it is to learn things, generally the better you will learn them.  Go to class, every day, prepared (having done any readings and homework), and be an active participant.  Learning is NOT a passive process, and you can't expect to just sit and have someone pour learning into your ears and eyes.  The way to amass knowledge is to use it, relate it to other things, manipulate it and extend it.  Work on your classes every day.  Do not cram.  It might help a little on poorly designed exams, but it doesn't aid learning at all.  Your brain cannot process information like that.  Work with the way your brain works.  Study a bit and give your brain time to process.  By the way, you cannot multitask, so if you think you have to have music on or noise in the background to study, you are deluding yourself.  Your brain is a single-track processor and it cannot do two things (related things) at the same time.  Try to read and sing a song sometime.  You can do one or the other, but not both. Don't assume that, because you have had academic success in the past, that you already know how to learn.  You might just be really smart, and you've gotten good grades despite not having to work hard.  This is BAD for a new college student.  Just about killed me, because I had no idea how to study and learn when I got to college.  You can also have gotten good grades just by working really hard.  This also doesn't mean you know how to learn.  You might be working harder than you need to, and you will need to be more efficient with more difficult material. Do yourself a HUGE favor.  Do some reading on learning how to learn, believe what you read and apply it to your own situation.  It's a lot harder to change your ways than you might think. ",

            "answer_text": "Many good responses. Truthfully, though, what works for one person doesn't work for everyone. I was an undergrad for 8 years (thanks to my inability to choose a major) and I graduate with a 4.0. Here's what I did: 1) Always go to class. Pay attention to lecture - simply sitting in the room doesn't count. I figure if I learn what the professor is teaching rather than teaching it to myself later, that's time saved. It's also important to not just passively take notes, but to really listen to what the professor is saying. The more carefully you listen, the most questions you'll have, and now is the time to ask them - not the night before the homework is due. (Personally, I make it my goal to spot mistakes made by the professor - not to gleefully point them out, but it makes sure that I'm critically listening and not just recopying.) 2) Always do the homework, even if it isn't for a grade. If you have the solutions, don't cheat and look at them first - as everyone says, it'll be painfully obvious when the exam comes. I personally learn best having the solutions, because then I get instant feedback. To me it's useless to do an assignment, be confused about it, then have to wait two weeks to find out what I did wrong. However, I always try to solve the problem myself first, and only use the solutions if I'm really stuck. 3) Start studying at least a week before the exam. Cramming the night before miiiight get you through the test unscathed, but you definitely won't remember the information next semester when you need to use it again. I usually aim for completing my studying a couple days before the exam - you never know when something catastrophic might come up. For studying, it depends on your field - as an engineer, I would re-do end-of-the-chapter problems until I could do them very quickly, without having to think about them. Also: it's very dangerous to try and guess what will be on the exam. It's necessary sometimes because there simply isn't enough time to learn everything. But I've had classes where the majority of the class crashes and burns on an exam because they \"didn't think the professor would ask that.\" Make sure you at least do a cursory review of everything, so you can scrape up some partial credit if you guessed wrong! It's a common misconception that all-nighters are a fundamental part of college. 8 years and I never once pulled an all-nighter! I like sleep. What's the point if you're a non-functioning zombie the next day? If you keep organized and manage your time well, there's no need. 4) Don't disregard introductory classes. I remember taking Calc I and thinking how silly it seemed; \"when do I need to calculate the rate that water flows out of a bucket,\" but as an engineer I use calculus on a daily basis. What seems silly now is what builds the foundation for the complicated classes later. I think I'm actually really lucky in that I did the whole college thing sort of \"backwards.\" I was most of the way through a degree in biomedical engineering, but starting wishing I had chosen mechanical engineering instead. I started working in a lab, reading an advanced textbook written by the advisor of said lab, and started minoring in ME. In this way, I saw the end-stage applications of ME in the lab, like the cool simulations you can run. I also saw how the things I was learning in Statics and Dynamics were critical, because I needed them in my research. I'm sure this backwards approach wouldn't work for everyone, but it's important to not lose the forest for the trees - everything you're working on now builds up to become cool, applied stuff later. I think it's also important to learn about what's going on in the field these days. The boring introductory classes won't seem so boring if you're excited about what awesome stuff you'll be able to do in a few years.  A lot of people talk about forming study groups, but I have never once studied with someone else. I prefer to work on my own, though I know plenty of people who see the value in collaboration. I also never focused on attending office hours - if I had a specific question, sure, but I didn't make a point to always attend. Again, everyone's different! ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my number 1, super-secret, guaranteed-to-work-or-your-money-back piece of advice for getting good grades. Are you ready for it? Brace yourself, because it might just blow your mind\u2026 Take classes you actually enjoy. I know\u2026 sounds simple, doesn\u2019t it. Almost too simple, right? But, after teaching college classes for over a decade, I\u2019m 100% positive very few students realize this. In other words, a student might love poetry, but majors in some type of engineering because he feels like that\u2019s the only way to get a job. Or a student would rather be studying computer science but her parents want her to be a doctor, so she\u2019s busy taking biology and anatomy classes she loathes. News flash: when you hate your classes, it\u2019s hard to do well in them. The reason you\u2019ll have trouble doing well in classes you hate is underscored by all the other answers to this question. Specifically, do you see how they tend to focus on tactics like studying more, prioritizing work, and other kinds of \u201cwork harder\u201d tasks? Well, working harder in a class is orders of magnitude more difficult when you hate it. Just as importantly, taking classes you hate doesn\u2019t just impact your \u201cchallenging\u201d classes. In fact, working harder in classes you don\u2019t like often gives you better grades in them, but it usually comes at the expense of your grades in classes you truly love. For example, I\u2019m often forced to give bad grades to wonderful students who love my classes because they skipped my classes too often or didn\u2019t do their homework assignments in order to finish work for other classes they hated but considered \u201cmore important.\u201d Mind you, I\u2019m not insulted when students prioritize other classes over mine. But, for the students who enjoy my classes more, I usually feel terrible for them because they can\u2019t see the proverbial \u201cforest through the trees.\u201d They\u2019re so focused on getting better grades in the classes they hate that they can\u2019t see all the opportunities for them in the classes they love.

            "answer_text": "In addition to Cory A. Martin's advice to just show up and do your work, the following will make your professor not curse your name (which will be critically important when grading your assignments and/or deciding if we should give you the last 3 points you need to bump up your grade one level). Read the syllabus. Read it again. If you have a question, read the syllabus. If you still have a question, read the syllabus again. If you really are stumped and want to email the professor: Make sure your subject line is succinct about what kind of question you have. \"Question regarding research assignment for CRIJ 1301 M/W 10:00-11:20 A.M.\" is best. \"IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!\" is a fast way to get deleted unread. Even if you already did so in the subject line, identify specifically which class you are in and who you are by name as it appears on your school records. \"I'm in your class\" doesn't help. I teach several classes. I don't know who Bubba is; I have 5 Roberts in one class alone, and then I have various names starting with a B. Address me by my title. You have not earned the privilege of calling me by my first name or some other nickname, unless I specifically tell you otherwise (and I won't until maybe after you graduate). Succinctly explain your problem. Include the steps you took to try to solve the problem on your own. Wait patiently for a response. It may takes us a few days to sort out how best to help you, or even to have enough time to draft that email. Don't send multiple emails every few minutes asking \"Did you get my e-mail?\" Likewise, don't ask us at 8 AM if we saw the email you sent last night, especially if it is a Monday morning. Now that we have handled the syllabus... Textbooks: get them (buy, rent, borrow, whatever). The one we have listed in the syllabus is the one we want. You might be able to get away with an older edition. Maybe. Sometimes the changes are minimal. Sometimes they are substantial. Any differences are your responsibility, not mine. Don't ask \"Do we really need the textbook?\" Yes, you need the textbook, I wouldn't list it as required otherwise. No, I don't get rich off of these, even if I did write the book. Textbook authors see very little of the price of a textbook. Now that you have the textbook(s), read them. Study them. Come to class prepared to join in a discussion on the assigned chapters. Come to class with questions about what you read. Schedules and Deadlines:Follow them. Don't email me and ask if you missed anything yesterday, or if you will miss anything important if you leave for holiday early. Don't ask if you can turn in something late: if I allow it, it will be in my syllabus, along with how I will handle late work in different circumstances (I'll work with someone who was hit by a bus on the way to class, but if you forgot because you were stoned I have nothing for you). Get a planner. A physical one that you have to physically write it. It will help your remember better, and you can use it to keep track of all of your deadlines in all of your classes. Written work:Follow the directions. Use proper spelling and grammar, even if you aren't in English class. Especially if you aren't in English class. Don't ignore spellcheck. Use proper sources. If we say Wikipedia is a nogo, then don't even try it. We can tell when you copy/paste something, even if you don't cite your source. We're also wise to most other shenanigans you can do to get around the requirements. We've been doing this much longer than you have. General:Don't lie. Don't cry. Don't have your helicopter parents step in when you cry. Take responsibility for yourself like a grown, mature adult. ****All of these combined will help make you be the kind of student who doesn't make a professor cringe when they see your name. When we pick up your research paper to grade it, you want us to think \"Oh, this is Bubba's, this should be good!\" instead of \"Oh, this is Bubba's, I'm going to need some whiskey first...\". With something as subjective as your grade on the line, you want us to be in as happy a mood as possible when your name comes up. ",

            "answer_text": "Others have some excellent suggestions.  Here are mine: Maintain a regular study routine in every class.  Multiple short stints of studying per week are much more effective than are longer bursts of studying at less frequent intervals.  Neuroscience researchers now believe the primary biochemical basis of memory is something called long-term potentiation: when a synapse connecting neurons is used more frequently, it gets stronger.  Exercise the relevant neurons many times a week and you'll form such strong memories that you don't need to do much studying during finals week.Some people find study groups helpful, but some don't.  But if you do join a study group, work all the problems yourself before each meeting of your group, for several reasons.  First, only by working problems without assistance can you avoid fooling yourself into thinking you understand the problems better than you really do.  Second, if you make a serious effort before your study group meeting, then you will know where you got stuck and therefore be able to make more effective use of your time in the group meeting.  Third, if you have made a serious effort before your study group meeting, then you will be better prepared to help other group members with their difficulties.  Fourth, if you have worked all the problems before each study group meeting, you'll soon be able to tell whether the others have done so (and if the others in your study group regularly fail to work problems on their own, you should find a different study group).I strongly agree you should go to office hours regularly, not only the Professor's office hours but also the office hours of your T.A.  I was a T.A. myself when I was a graduate student, and nothing frustrated me more than students who only started asking me for help near the end of the semester when it was often too late to salvage their situation.  Come early and come frequently.  But also come prepared, just like what I said above about study groups.Read each assigned chapter in the book at least twice.  The bare minimum is one reading within the 48 hours preceding the class for which that chapter is assigned, and one reading within the 48 hours following the class in which that chapter is covered.  Some authors also advise taking notes while doing the assigned reading and taking those notes to class, so that in class you only have to write down the differences between what the textbook says and how your instructor handles the content.  But frankly I was a very poor note-taker and I did pretty well!  My notebooks mostly resembled XKCD comics, actually.  But although I didn't take very good notes, what I did right was more important: I read the textbook frequently and I worked the assigned problems.  If you always arrive at class ready to compare how your teacher looks at the subject with how somebody else covers the same material then you will get much more out of your time in the classroom.During Reading Period and Finals week, relax.  If you already know the material, then a quick skim of the textbook to refresh your memory will be more than sufficient.  If you do not already know the material by now, desperate attempts to catch up will only make you tired and even more stressed-out.  The single most important thing you can do during Finals Week is get plenty of sleep, and also get outside a lot!  If you have followed points 1 through 4 above, then you should have plenty of time to sleep and exercise during Finals Week.  I usually found Finals Week the least stressful part of the semester because I had plenty of time to just wander around campus.",

I cannot stress this enough but when I started college 8 years ago I thought I\u2019m just gonna stick to my routine and hopefully I\u2019ll pass. No it didn\u2019t work. Heres how you pass your class or I should say get good grades Ask questions if you don\u2019t understand. I know it\u2019s weird in college but guess what your here to learn no one is going to embarrass you.Let your teacher check your work 1 week before you turn in. Not only this will give you time, but it will refresh your memory of what you wrote. Many times we think \u201cOkay this is good\u201d then BAM ! You got a 65% on your paper. Why? Because what we think it\u2019s right others might not think it\u2019s goodCreate study group. Yup I\u2019d regret that 8 years ago. First day of school find 2\u20133 students that you can work with and exchange numbers etc. Most college student pass their class by assisting one another.Join clubs. Okay this is going to be very opinionated. But from my understanding is that the more your involve in college the more your determine to do well in class.Have fun ! Seriously if you just go to class and go home your not gonna do well. Why because you will be bored shitless by the 4th week. Make friends, it can be any friends gamer groups, music whatever. Unless you think your too cool to have friend like me. HAHA JK !Good luck. I am a returning student and to be honest, it\u2019s worth it because I have this sense of urgency and desire to get a pen A or B+ in my class",

            "answer_text": "A2A Your question makes me want to find a way on Quora to simply link to answers already given. But, here goes. First realize that pursuing good grades and developing deep understanding of the material are often two different things. Others will probably repeat for you all of the standard answers about attendance and proper study methods and habits. Those are good. But, you need to realize this truth. Getting good grades is based on determining what the instructor wants and giving it to them. There should be a syllabus which tells you how the course points are organized and how to obtain them. You get good grades by doing those things the way the professor wants and collecting the points. I had an undergrad professor for basic geology and astronomy who hated teaching lower level courses. His quizzes were worth very few points. Getting A\u2019s on his midterm and final equaled an A in the course. So, you went to class and listened, read the book, and got whatever extra points you could on the quizzes in case you needed them for the big exams. Then he would do a review day before the exams and tell you everything that was on the tests. I got A\u2019s in his course by taking rapid notes on his reviews, memorizing everything he said to know, and giving it back to him on exams. His courses helped me finish my undergrad program with straight A\u2019s. But, I learned very little from him and later had to return to studying the subjects on my own when I encountered things I wanted to know and understand. I had an excellent professor who based grades on papers. In those papers he expected to see that you had read and understood the research, had contemplated it, and could clearly articulate your reasoning and conclusions. He did NOT require your answers to match his answers. He expected you to demonstrate clear understanding of the readings and your ability to write quality explanations of what you learned. If you gave him that, you earned A\u2019s. I learned a great deal from him. I had a professor in my Masters who fooled me for one exam, and I had to play catch up to get my A by the end of the term. His grades were based on essay exams. It was an issues class. In discussions, he usually took a liberal position in opposition to the students who were mostly conservative at that particular school. On the first exam, I gave clear answers citing the source materials to back the views he had argued in class. I got an OK grade, but not what I wanted. It took one test to figure out that he was arguing a side he did not believe in discussions to force people to get into the materials and think. But in the end, he expected to see conservative conclusions. On the remaining exams, I gave him what he wanted and earned my A. I also learned from him, even though I did not agree with his approach or many of his conclusions based on the readings he selected. You get high marks by giving the grader what they want to see. Learning and retaining knowledge and understanding are sometimes a very different and more difficult (and rewarding!) game. ",

            "answer_text": "I had a graduate student who, as an undergrad at Cornell, had more A+ grades than As -- about 15. Once I asked him how he did that. \"I use tricks\" he said. They all seemed so obvious when he told me, that I'm not sure I can recall all of them. Below I'll mix in what he said with some of the things I observed in other great students. He said he always read the assignment before the lecture, not after. Do that, and you know what to pay most attention to. You can ask questions about things you didn't understand. You can't ask a book questions, but you can ask a professor. Moreover, your professor will be impressed that you ask the best questions. Remarkably, it takes no longer to read all the material before class than after class. Visit the professor during office hours. Some professors will just try to intimidate you into not coming so often; ignore them. Some will be delighted to have visitors. It is a great opportunity to interact with a very smart and very knowledgeable person. Don't try to learn what you think is important, but try to learn what you think the professor thinks is most important. That's really why the professors are there; they have enormously more experience in the subject, and know what is really important. You'll discover you do much better on exams. Find other students to study with. College is not a place to try to prove you are better than everyone else; it is a place where, among other things, you can learn how to work well with other people. Try throwing good questions at your friends. It turns out that thinking of good questions gets you very far. Don't be surprised if some of the questions turn out to be the same ones the professor asks. Go to lecture and, particularly if it is boring, try to figure out why the material is actually fascinating. All those courses are there because someone thinks it is important, even if your current professor doesn't. Once you become interested in the material, it will be easy to learn; in fact, it will be hard to forget. Recognize that not all the material is equally important. See if you can identify that. Think hard about the important stuff. Take this to be your top homework design: there is a person who has limited time, not really enough, to learn some material. What is the best way to approach that? Pretend that that question is a homework exercise, and write a page. Then follow your own suggestions. ",

            "answer_text": "I may not be a college student or a professor, might I believe that getting good grades are possible. But how? Stay Organized:Buy binders to organize your notes. Organize using binder separators. Put math notes in math section, history notes in history section and so on. This way, you will not have to take a long time to find your notes when you study or when you are revisingAlso, don\u2019t forget to buy folders to organize your papers. This may include worksheets, home works or anything. I suggest you to buy 1 folder for each subject. As i told you, put math papers in one folder, maybe biology papers in a another folder and so on.Don\u2019t forget to buy a planner. Here, you may list down any homeworks, quizzes or anything that needs to be completed. This way, you will reduce the risk of submitting works lateOh, and one more thing. Buy enough pencils, erasers or any type of stationery.Pay Attention and Attend classes:ALWAYS pay attention in class. If you never pay attention, you\u2019ll never know any information that may be included in future tests or exams. If you are the type of person who forgets easily, this is fine. The purpose of binders is to take notes and revise the notes when you are studyingAnother way is to attend classes. By attending classes, you can pay attention and gain new information. In fact, some schools count participation as a part of their grading system.You also have to come on class on time. By coming on time, you can be more punctual. Also, you might impress your teacher. This way, your grades will increaseLive Healthy:Eat fruits. Fruits contain vitamins, and vitamin makes you healthy. As a result, you can go to school often.Sleep early, as sleeps makes your brain rest. At school, you need to learn and think critically. This will need your brain. If your brain is restored, you can achieve your best. If not, you know what will happenExercise\u2026\u2026 This may be a bit tiring, but believe it or not, exercising makes your mind fresher. This way, your mind will be ready to study.Do NOT hesitate to ask questionsIf you hesitate to ask questions, then you will not get anywhere which may lower down your grades. But, if you ask, then you will get smarterAlso, if you have any questions about any projects, you will have to ask. Why? Well, if you don\u2019t ask, then you will not understand the assignment and may lower down your grades.Last, REVISE:Revising is important.By revising, you can remember what the teacher taught you that day. Whether it is about calculus, literature, or even economics, by revising - especially hard classes- you will retain the information. If do not revise, then, there will be a chance that you will forget all the information taught in classTherefore, we can achieve good grades. With enough effort and perseverance, we can achieve good grades, and this applies to everybody. GOOD LUCK!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I have been a Teaching Assistant in one of the top engineering schools in the United States for quite some time and would like to share my experiences about how you can increase your chances of getting good grades: Never miss lecture.My adviser compiled a set of statistics showing how the grades of the students showed a high positive correlation with the number of lectures attended. Sure, showing up in class in spite of a life threatening medical emergency is not the best of ideas, but never skip lecture because you have to study for another test. The number of hours that you need to put in in order to make up for the missed lecture is far more than what you had initially bargained for. Pay attention during lecture.Again, to quote my adviser, \"The most important part of the class is not on the slides.\" Pay attention to the side information that the professor is bringing to the table. He might mention a seemingly short sentence on an important concept, which might prove to be useful to solve an important question on the midterm or crack a job interview. If they have set certain pre-lecture or pre-lab reading assignments, make sure you read those. The professors are doing this job for many many years, respect their intelligence and experience.  Make the best of office hours.Most of the professors and TAs have a reasonable number of office hours per week. Ask them questions not only on the materials covered in the homework due this week but also overall on the overall course. In fact, the top students I have taught asked questions to understand the concepts more deeply rather than, \"Hey Miss TA, how do I solve Problem 3 b)?\". I have had students drop by and chat with me about the graduate school application process, the PhD experience and which research areas are hot topics etc. I was more than happy to give them my two cents. Plan your coursework.Make sure you set up an appointment with your graduate adviser and chalk out the coursework path not only for the current semester but also for the future semesters. Read reviews on ratemyprofessor or other websites in order to decide the professors with whom you want to take the courses. Do not leave difficult courses till your senior year. That year is spent mostly in applying and interviewing for jobs, appearing for GRE and the graduate school application process. I myself barely got to study during my senior year and it dragged my GPA down to some extent.  Get your basics right.At least in engineering, I see that many of the students do not have the required mathematical skills for certain classes. Pay attention to your calculus, complex analysis, real analysis, linear algebra classes. Having a solid foundation translates to not having to waste time on these topics when you take the advanced upper division classes. In your senior year Digital Signal Processing course, it would be no fun to spend half of the time revising polar representation of complex numbers. Eat the frog.You might hate a certain course because a) The professor is bad b) The course is not interesting c) Both a) and b). In spite of that, this course may be a core requirement in your program. Given these circumstances, it is best to silently bear with the pain for one semester and get done with it. Complaining does not help. Life is never a bed of roses. Study smart.First read the materials and then start doing the homework instead of the other way round. It saves a lot of time. Be comfortable with the types of questions asked in exams by looking at exams from previous years. Form study groups with similar minded students, especially for the tough courses. I have myself benefitted a lot from studying in groups. Prepare for tests in advance.The top students never pull out all-nighters just the day before the midterm or the final. Have a good night's sleep. Do not rush to the professor's of the TA's office hours < 12 hours before the exam to learn important concepts. This only results in you forgetting what you already know. Be good at taking tests. Learn to manage your time well after you see the questions in the exam. Avoid spending too much of time on one problem.  Lastly, don't be a d***.The teaching team is NOT your babysitter. When you walk in through the office door of the professor or the TA, leave your sense of entitlement behind. Just because you are paying tuition, does not mean that the teaching staff is at your beck and call. They are only there to help you find the solutions to the assignments, they won't do your homework for you. Never start the homework during the TA's office hours, it sends out really bad vibes. I have seen some students having serious attitude problems that would have got them fired from their company on the very first day. TL;DR: Study hard and well in advance. ",

            "answer_text": "By making the required effort. When I was studying, my aim was always to get average grade. Didn't care much about getting good grades. I was lazy or more busy with my own interests. My own interests was software programming and microprocessors (I was studying to become electrical engineer but these software programming/microprocessors was not part of my course) When I was waiting for the interview with the professor for dissertation, I heard he was speaking to PhD student. Professor asked the student to do something practical but student was reluctant and insisted that the task was beyond his capabilities etc. I went in to the professor's office next. He asked about what I would like to do. I said I wanted to write 100 pages thesis about communication protocols (which is kind of linked with electrical engineering). Professor's eye lit up. He asked if I knew about programming etc. I couldn't say no even though something inside me said, just lie, don't let him know you know these. I told the truth and when I was going out from the office, my task was to:  develop electronic card (circuit) with a microprocessor+ software which runs on windows 98 (yes it was in the last century) to control the electronics.  Aim was: electronic card would be connected to the PC, user would send commands from the PC to the card and this commands would be sent to remote location over internet. Another electronic card receives the signal and controls the equipment there.  I completed the project, it worked. I handed over the documentation to professor for his review. And then just asked about the grade. He answered, write here whatever you want. I was honored, smiled and wrote A+ as anyone else would do.  I think it was the only A+ I had.  ",

            "answer_text": "Good is relative. Some colleges are more competitive than other. Lot will depend on you current standing (study approach as well as performance) and gap you want to fill with what is consider as good in your academic setting. At the very minimal level you have to master & commit yourself to basic good study habits which includes: a) Showing up: in classroom, in labs, in library, in project meetings. This is 50% of the work. Your lizard brain will find million reason to bunk just 'one' lecture, one meeting, one more session. Learn to quite or ignore lizard brain. b) Doing you homework: Assignments are big part of you grades. Take help, work with a team, join a study group. Do whatever it take to submit your assignments on time. c) Finding right peer group: Spend more time with people who also wants get good grades and who are committed to help eahc other for this shared goal. Peer pressure works both ways. Being part of a competitive yet supportive group will inspire you to work hard & stay focused. Same way wrong kind of peer pressure can be a big distraction. Find your tribe. Align your environment with your future goals. d) Answering 'whys' often: Mindless slogging for grades is not sustainable. Grades are mean to an end. Trying to get good grades just to impress society or parents may not be that inspiring. Right reasons are personal, meaningful and should justify all the sacrifices. Spend some time into introspection. Meet & talk to successful people who inspires you. Volunteer for non-academic work so that you can connect academic understanding with real life problems. That will keep you sane in blind grade race. e) Seeking help. Teenage is turbulent age. Lots of changes inside mind & body. Do not shy away from seeking help. Especially for thing that you have little control on. F) Identifying & eliminating distraction. We fail to realize the commutative impact small distinction (email, calls, gossip) have on our attention span and hence productivity. Sometime identifying a unproductive task can be difficult. Like spending hours on Quora may look productive but it may not be. Track you time. Have a close look at your calendar and understand how productively you are spend your time. All these suggestions look quite obvious (or innocuous) but you will surprised to see how fews tudents are able to commit themself to such a minimal 'get good grade' program. OptimizationOnce you have acquire mastery on above basic you can look for next level optimizations. You can work on personal productivity i.e. getting more thing done in same time. Hunt for good education hacks specific to your learning style, academic needs and your environment. Interview top performers. Make study checklist and review it before every exam or semester. Spend more time with Profs. Also readDavid Koh's answer to Studies and Studying: How do top students study? Study Hacks - Decoding Patterns of Success - Cal NewportHow do top students study? ",

But if yougo through life \u201cexpecting\u201d gifts, you are very likely to be disappointed most of the times. You may have heard people say, \u201cthere is no free lunch.\u201d Of course, most of the world\u2014in most situations\u2014will frown on stealing. \u201cWhat is thine-is mine\u201d is not an acceptable outlook. Cheating is a way to get good grades. I have known students who worked hard to cheat, harder than they would have if they had worked (studied). When we cheat to get good grades, we cheat ourselves not only out of what we would have learned, but from we would have learned from what we learned. Sometimes what we learn is not as important as what we WILL learn as a result of having learned. Knowledge builds upon other knowledge. Things we learn may not seem to have immediate value, but overtime that \u201clearning\u201d will enable you to learn something else. Not all work is fun. Working for good grades is not usually fun. I have had students say \u201cI enjoyed your class\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s been fun.\u201d I always wonder about that because learning is sometimes hard. Learning is also disturbing, especially when we learn that we were wrong. So, in short, just like anything else\u2014you will place a higher value on it, IF you work for it. What do you think?

            "answer_text": "The absolute best way is to attend colleges that practice \"grade inflation.\"  No question. The Ivy League is notorious for this and Harvard made headlines when it was learned that 91% of their students graduate with honors while the median average is an A-. 91 per.cent. While I don't think these colleges work under the same misguided incentives as secondary school \"educators\" that cheat students, this issue definitely raises some red flags.  Keep these in mind when you decide the best course of action for your education and your bank account. Colleges are committing a slow and painful student financed suicide.  Consider: These ivy league colleges charge a fortune in exchange for the title of \"special snowflake\" upon graduationDiminishing returns of a college education aren't going unnoticed.Google (this company that specializes in data) has already admitted that college isn't a good indicator of success.  If other companies wise up and follow suit...pass the popcorn.The government took over the college loan business and without a market backstop or a comparable alternative - colleges have saddled students with over a trillion dollars in debtProfessors aren't subject to quality control, especially once tenured.  This particular professor thought Hybrid meant amphibious.  This is anecdotal, but we place too high of a premium on the instruction of people who don't spend much time in the real world.  The current state of \"education\" is the result.Personally I think focusing on grades as your top priority is bad advice unless you want to enter the same field as those who think it's good advice. (Professors)   I agree with Google's head of hiring who advises that you focus on skills. Best of luck- TJ #OHY ",

            "answer_text": "I can tell you how I did it. First, and as others have said, read the assignment before lecture. It never occurred to me to do it the other way round, so I didn\u2019t know before reading other answers here that this was a \u201cthing.\u201d In any case, if you\u2019re not already doing the reading before lecture, you should start. In fact, at least if you\u2019re majoring in philosophy, you should read the assignment twice \u2013 first just to get a sense of what\u2019s being argued for, and then to evaluate it. In lecture, pay very close attention and take very schematic notes. Immediately after lecture write out a fuller account of what you learned, together with your own comments, questions, and indications of things that are not fully clear to you. Don\u2019t just outline or list bullet points \u2013 indicate the development of the idea or argument and what motivates it, what\u2019s at stake. The point of doing this is not to have something on paper to review later, though that can be helpful. The point is that if you do this you\u2019ll find that you remember everything effortlessly. Cultivate a group of the smartest people you can find and discuss the topics you\u2019re studying with them, both formally and informally. I did this without really thinking about it, but if it\u2019s not happening in your case devote some conscious effort to it. It\u2019s less important that your interlocutors are in the specific class you\u2019re taking than that they\u2019re intelligent and passionate about whatever they\u2019re doing. My own circle of friends in college included artists, physicists, English, Comp Lit and History majors, social science and psychology types, and even an engineer or two. I learned from all of them. Of course, you should talk with people who know the subject you\u2019re studying, but there\u2019s value in trying to explain a problem to someone who knows nothing about it, in part because you\u2019ll quickly identify the gaps in your knowledge. (I felt I learned a tremendous amount as a student, but it was almost nothing compared to how much I learned when I started to teach.) Looking back, some of the people I got the most from when I was an undergraduate were grad students. The beginning ones aren\u2019t much older than you, but for obvious reasons they\u2019re at least a little ahead of you without being as intimidating as a professor can be. You\u2019ll meet them in your discussion sections, but you\u2019ll find that many are also in the social networks of other undergraduates you\u2019ll be getting to know. (Of course, this bit of advice applies only to those studying at a research university.) Speaking of professors, take advantage of their office hours. You\u2019ll find a wide range of personalities: some will be nurturing, others will just shoot holes in whatever you have to say. Don\u2019t take it personally; you can benefit from either approach. What if you\u2019re stuck in a class with a prof who just doesn\u2019t seem that interested in what he or she is doing? Don\u2019t waste time complaining about it, to others or to yourself. He or she is probably having a bad month or semester or year. Find another way into the subject \u2013 a good discussion section sometimes saves an otherwise dreary course. I distinctly remember one particular course in which the teaching assistant was far more effective than the professor \u2013 and the prof was actually very good. ",

            "answer_text": "Attend every class: If you want good grades in college, you must attend every class, not almost every class. The importance of regular class attendance cannot be overemphasized. When you miss classes, you miss lectures, notes, discussions, explanations, and assignments. Do not think that missing a class won\u2019t make a difference. You cannot make up what you miss. Be organized:o   Use a student planner: take this to each class and record all assignments. Also use your planner to keep track of tests and quizzes, activities and appointments.o   Break down assignments: large assignments are more manageable if you break them down into smaller parts. Completing these smaller portions over a longer period of time will allow you more time to focus Manage your time well: with good time management, you have more free time, less stress and a feeling that you are in control.Don\u2019t overextend yourselfSchedule 90 minute study sessions: set a specific time to get your studying done and make sure you will not be interrupted. During these study sessions, don\u2019t do anything else but study!Take Good Notes: tests usually cover material that the instructor has presented in class. Therefore, it is important to have good class notes.o   Be an active listener: when your actively listening, your not just hearing the words, but you are also thinking about and trying to understand the information being presented.o   Taking notes can help you pay attention and stay focused.o   Recognize important information: anything the instructor writes on the board is important. In your notes, underline or star the most important information so you can pay special attention to it when studying. Know How to Read a Textbook: Knowing how to scan, read and review will make it much easier for you to understand and remember what you read.o   Scan: scanning gives you a quick overview of the material you\u2019re going to be reading. To scan, read the title, subtitle, and everything in bold and italic print. Look at the pictures, captions, charts, graphs, and read the introduction, the summary and the review questions.o   Read: when your reading has a purpose, you have a reason to stay focused and your comprehension improves.o   Review: to review, first ask yourself \u2018what is the main idea\u2019 and then go back to the beginning and go through the same process you did when you scanned the material. This time, as you scan restate the main idea of each passage using your own words. Study Smart: students who study smart find themselves spending less time of studying and still getting better grades.o   Find a good place to study: make sure the area is free of distractions. ",

            "answer_text": "When I came to study at Princeton University, I soon realized that studying hard was not sufficient to achieve the best grades. Instead, I had to discover and develop a habit of studying intelligently. For me, this meant moving away from brute-force memorization. I couldn\u2019t simply memorize math formulas and expect to get an A on the final. My study strategies varied by subject, but I discovered some thematic strategies. Split up your time into general (20%) and specific (80%) studies. 20% should be spent on general studies for breadth (e.g., skimming the textbook or building broad study guides). The other 80% should go towards acute reinforcement of the specific topics where you fail (e.g., narrow classes of math problems).Practice and self-evaluation is critically important. This concept is even more important in technical fields like mathematics, physics or computer science. Memorizing concepts will not get you very far if you don\u2019t practice problem solving which involves applying these concepts. This means working through as many practice exams as you can. If there are none available, ask the professor for past exams to use as study material or make your own practice quizzes.During timed exams, focus on packing your essay responses with information and analysis \u2014 don\u2019t worry about the prose or poetry. The graders are probably tired graduate students looking for key points which answer the question. Don\u2019t waste time adding literary flourishes. Be elegant in your writing by being concise and clear. Also, remember that while information is important, analysis of the information is equally important.From personal experience, these three core strategies are very effective. They have helped me achieve academic success at Princeton in a broad range of subjects (ranging from mathematics and computer science to English and Near Eastern studies). During my junior year, I was awarded the Shapiro Prize for academic excellence (top 3% in my class). ",

            "answer_text": "I distinctly remember entering University as na\u00efve as a first generation university student could be. I harbored doubts about how many modules I was going to pass or even the lack of sleep that I was going to encounter. Needless to say that over the four years that I had spent at University, I began to realize just how unfounded all of my doubts were. Over time and through observing some of the most impressive students, I began to realize that they had all adopted certain strategies that enabled them to become top students as well as leaders and agents of change. Once I had started implementing these strategies, I found myself performing at an exceptional level not just within the classroom, but also outside of the classroom, through the various activities that I had been involved in. I aim to share these strategies with you and hopefully help you achieve all of the goals that you had set out for yourself at university. 1. Find your passion and study itThis point may seem rudimentary and somewhat clich\u00e9, yet so few people really study what they are passionate about. There are a lot of reasons for this for example; family pressures, bursary opportunities and degrees that promise a lucrative pay check. However, you need to push against these forces and follow your passion relentlessly.I was fortunate enough to have found my passion for Economics at a young age. Economics appealed to me because it encompassed my passion for entrepreneurship, mathematics, politics and psychology. I found myself being so engrossed by all of the topics that I had covered in class that I found myself thinking about them at a much higher level and applying what I was learning to various real world scenarios. Instead of studying being a chore, I found it to be quite pleasurable. I woke up every day extremely excited about what I was going to learn and achieve next. 2. Believe in YourselfThis point is equally important and I cannot stress it enough. Believing in what you are doing and saying is a fundamental part of success. I found that by doing what I loved and succeeding in it my self-belief was vastly improved. It was this self-belief that I had used within other areas within my life which helped me stand out as a leader and change agent. Belief isn\u2019t something that someone is born with. Rather, it is something that needs to be cultivated and reinforced on a daily basis. Self-belief can be, writing your goals on your wall, befriending confident people or even listening to rap music. Believe you can and you\u2019re already halfway there. 3. Understand opportunity costThe opportunity cost of an activity is the cost of the best foregone opportunity. To elaborate on this topic further, let me use a hypothetical example. If I were to skip my Calculus class on a Friday at 7:30am in order to sleep for an extra half an hour, the opportunity cost of sleeping that extra half an hour is two percentage points on my final Calculus mark. The relevance of opportunity cost is that it allows you to understand that every decision you make has an equivalent cost. Therefore, by understanding that, you are able to approach the decisions you make on a daily basis in a more mature way and one that maximizes your limited time and ensures that you\u2019re able to adequately prioritise your daily tasks and activities. You\u2019ll have a clear grasp of the concept, there is a time and a place for everything and in a world with an array of temptations, that you\u2019re able to make the best decision. If they have a meeting with a multi-millionaire, the opportunity cost of not meeting him would be one percentage point? What would you do?The best students understand that there is a time and a place for everything. They understand the concept of opportunity cost and it underpins their daily decisions. 4. Comparative Advantage Comparative advantage is another important concept that needs to be understood by all. Basically what it means is that, if there are two people who provide two different services, the person who is more efficient, has a comparative advantage in providing that service. By leveraging off one another, they can both benefit.When you are studying and trying to balance various extra mural activities, your time will be severely constrained. The best students are able to acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses respectively and use comparative advantage in order to save time and improve understanding of certain concepts. Moreover, it will improve your communication skills which will prove invaluable when you are in a position to explain complex concepts.An example of the application of this concept is: Assume that you\u2019re very good at Economics and can study a chapter in 1 hour and take 3 hours to complete a chapter of Calculus. Moreover, assume you have a friend who can do a chapter of Calculus in 1 hour and Economics in 3. Therefore, it would take you and your friend 4 hours to cover two topics. By understanding comparative advantage however, you can save an hour by studying the module at which you are better in and asking your friend to explain Calculus to you and vice versa.Throughout my four years at university, my friends and I continuously applied this principle to great avail. Ignore this concept at your own peril. 5. 80/20 principleThe 80/20 principle was first conceptualized by Vilfredo Pareto in 1896. This principle states that 80 percent of the effects can be achieved by doing 20 percent of the causes. Put another way, 80% of the results can be generated by 20% of the work.The best students have either willingly or unwillingly applied this rule to their studies and life in general. They\u2019ve used Pareto\u2019s principle by understanding that 80% of the results can be achieved by 20% of the work. They understand that a lot of the groundwork is done in the classroom, their interactions with their professors, homework and practicals.They understand the importance of group studying, getting advice from students who have done the module before and practicing past papers.It is important to note that every module or task that you will take at university is different. That said, there is still a system that needs to be understood in order for you to make the most of the principle. Why study the whole textbook when only 20% of it is relevant? Understand what is expected of you, ask for advice and use the system to your advantage. By doing this, you\u2019ll have a lot more time to enjoy your university career. 6. Network, Network, Network\u2026Networking is something to be taken very seriously. You are an average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.Over time, I had noticed that people tend to associate with those who have similar interests to theirs. The best students however, understand that they need to have a diverse group of friends. By this I mean, they understand what it means to network with intelligent students, entrepreneurs, artists and leaders. They understand the value that these networks can bring and the wealth of ideas that can come through interactions with these people.Choose your friends wisely. Acknowledge the importance of your networks. I was fortunate enough to have a vast network that I still keep in touch with today. I have learnt and developed a great deal through my interactions with all of these people. Moreover, they have enabled me to have access to various opportunities and ideas that I would never have known about had I not made a concerted effort to develop and maintain my friendships. 7. DO NOT JUST STUDY\u2026 Get involved in activities and societies that interest youIt bothers me when people continuously complain about being so swamped with their studies that they don\u2019t have time to do anything else. One can no longer distinguish themselves by getting good grades anymore. Companies and scholarships are now looking for people who not only achieved academically but those who were involved in social outreach and leadership initiatives. They are looking for the complete individual. I suggest that you continuously get involved in societies and initiatives that interest you. The benefits of this strategy includes; developing a diverse network, learning new skills, CV building and fully exploring the vast range of opportunities that your university presents you with. In conclusion, remember that you are extremely privileged to be able to go to university and further your studies. Take this seriously. You owe it to yourself and your country to use this opportunity in the best possible way. Learn as much as you can and continuously strive to expand your experiences. When you become successful, do not forget to share it with the people who are not as fortunate as you. Our world needs ambitious and skilled young people who take initiative in order to help take us to where we could and should be. ",

            "answer_text": "Good grades is all about focusing on what the professor or tutor is discussing in classroom. No teacher or professor in this world will ever test their pupils on material that hasn\u2019t been discussed in classroom. Attend lectures and pay attention. Do your homework and grades will come. Now, all is not fine and dandy all the time, because in real world plans will fail. And though grades will suffer, you\u2019ll learn some important lessons for the rest of your life, which are much more important than grades. It happened to me during my Master\u2019s program. I had all A+ grades until course in Software Architecture, one of the exams was about designing architecture for some requirements. The question was open ended and I went nuts focusing more on non-functional properties of the system over functional properties. That costed me my A and I\u2019ll remember to this day where the first focus needs to be when thinking of practical software architecture. The second was Embedded Systems course. While most exams were straightforward, one of the major assignments took much time and it was the last quarter so search was jobs was intense. I wanted to not have gap after graduation. That single assignment was incomplete and I could\u2019ve gotten a worse grade if I didn\u2019t engage my instructor and ask for another assignment or work to make up. Yes, it took burning some midnight hours and stress but at least I was left with a B+. So, next couple lessons are, never ease on even a single assignment. Do the best every time. And if things go south be honest with instructor and ask for work to make up for lost chance at excellence. Any reasonable instructor is generally obliging. If not, tough luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Some good advice offered by other Quorans here already so I\u2019ll chip in 2 cents for you, and try to offer you a unique angle; Lifting your academic skill set to high grades is likely to take a fair bit of time. Make no mistake, with some small improvements in how efficent you are each day in your study you can certainly expect to see a quick rise in your grades in any assessment in the weeks to follow. Rather, its just true too - and knowing a little something about this given I\u2019ve written half a dozen eBooks in this field (linked below) - it is important for students to recognise if seeking to go from a D or C grade to A+ that improving your overall academic ability shall take time. Certainly, a student shouldn\u2019t get disencouraged by that - its like how an athlete training for the Rio Olympics took many training sessions of incremental gains to get there - rather may this just guard against a good guy or girl trying one week to lift their grades, the next week finding on exams they were the same, and then going \u2018Oh this is hopeless, I\u2019ll never get great grades\u2019. Concerning specific advice, I would say (alongside perhaps having a look over my eBook to build up these skills in-depth) a focus on efficency and output over time alone is a solid guiding star for lifting your grades. For example, while it may sound impressive if one student studies for 12 hours in the library, if that time is spent just passively reading a textbook a student who studies for only 4 - but does so by intently and proactively seeking to find out what they don\u2019t know, learn it, and then master it - shall always see the better results returned to them at semester\u2019s end. So, may you make it your aim to be that student, and certainly I wish you luck in getting there!:) Ed Phillip Journalist and Author Read more from Ed in 60 Steps to College Success: from First Year to Final Year, Essays, Exams and More! available from Amazon Kindle (download for free until May 9 2017) ",

            "answer_text": "General tips: If you have to take a sequence of classes, schedule them immediately after one another. This may be obvious to most, but it wasn\u2019t for me. It hurt me in German. Learn to take notes well. Don\u2019t use complete sentences. Get the main idea down. Doodle. Leave some white space so you can go over them later and expand them while they are fresh on your mind. Have a notebook with pockets for those handouts and keep them with that lecture\u2019s notes! Read the first chapter of all your textbooks before the first day of class. I did this and it helped me. Sit down the middle or in the first row or two. I have ADD and this helped me pay attention better. Keep your syllabus handy [that sheet with the class outline your professor gives the first class] and do all reading and assignments on time. Read the material before the lecture. Write down any questions you have and ask them. Make sure you pay special attention during the lecture. Any topic discussed will definitely be on tests! Don\u2019t put off starting projects and papers. If your class requires a lab and it\u2019s optional, treat it as vital! I didn\u2019t in German class and barely passed. I did in College Algebra and it saved me! Take advantage of labs and tutoring. If you\u2019re religious, pray and do some scripture study before studying anything when you start your study sessions. You\u2019ll make a grade higher! Read your notes after class daily. Don\u2019t cram or you won\u2019t remember your material after class is over. This is vital if you have subject sequences! Realize that there are different ways to study different subjects. For Math, you learn by doing problems. Do more problems than are assigned. If you are weak in math, get some extra books and do those problems, or ask for extra problems. You won\u2019t understand it until you have done x of that type of problem, and x = different for everybody! Foreign languages are learned by listening to those tapes and speaking. Don\u2019t just concentrate on the written part. You have to write and speak to pass. Listen and repeat. Singing is also learned by singing. Practice practice practice for any music class. For music appreciation. listen to the types of music you are studying. English is learned by writing, especially essays. Remember this formula for essays: Write one paragraph on your main statement. Include at least 3\u20135 points supporting your main statement [odd numbers are better]. One sentence per point. Last sentence should restate your main statement. Write one paragraph on each of your points. Be convincing! Each paragraph should be 4\u20135 sentences. Write your closing paragraph and re-emphasize your points. Phrase them differently. Read your essay. Do you convince yourself of what you\u2019re trying to say? If not, rewrite or pick another topic to argue. History is learned by memorizing facts and dates. Don\u2019t ever think dates are not important. Science is best learned in a study group. If no one is passing around a sign-up sheet for a group when you walk in the first day, pass one of your own around with Name, Preferred Meet Day/Time, and Contact Info across the top. Be sure and put yours first line and identify yourself as leader. If someone else is starting a group and you find out, offer to consolidate the groups. You learn a lot of facts but in science, you are expected to come up with ideas of your own to share. It is a lot harder to pass a science course without a study group to bounce ideas off of and quiz each other. I\u2019ve done it both ways. If you\u2019re still in high school, practice these techniques now! I moved at half-year my senior year and had to do triple homework for 3 weeks to graduate early. Even that was not the amount of work I did my first quarter in college! College may feel overwhelming at first, but don\u2019t give up. Your body and mind will adjust after just a few weeks! It is overwhelmingly satisfying to see how much you can actually make your mind and body do. You learn a lot about your capabilities and what makes you who you are in college. A final word: Decide now not to be bored. Cling to whatever thread in class that is remotely interesting. College is hard, but rewarding if you have motivation. Interest is motivating. I NEVER had a boring class. In College Algebra, my most hated and feared subject, it was our professor\u2019s comparison in graphing to a subway and stops on it. I found some tidbit interesting in every class. In Psychological Statistics, it was our professor\u2019s interesting lectures. He gave examples that were real-world and fascinating. He often brought interesting items to class that gave a way to apply the abstract ideas to concrete activities like rolling dice or flipping coins. In World History, it was my parents\u2019 interest in World War II that made me want to memorize facts about it. And it helped to have a prof who was passionate about teaching it. In US History, as well, my genealogy hobby made it a lot more interesting to me. Ditto German, since I have German ancestry. It helped me decipher some records in German and I felt really good about my struggles. In Chemistry, it was building models with those wonderful plastic balls and stems. In Biology, it was thinking of what animals I could make up for my science fiction writing. And meeting animals brought into the classroom [I love animals!] ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a college teacher, the advice I always gave was . . . The number one underutilized resource on college campuses is office hours. Too many students avoid them, but it's throwing money away. Every day of office hours that your professor sits there without you visiting them is money down the drain. Think about it this way. You're paying $XX,000 to go to college. Most of that money is spent on salaries for people. The main thing being delivered to you is the expertise and lessons you are exposed to by faculty in the classroom. Office hours -- when faculty continue to be paid with your tuition dollars -- are like an extra free lesson. It's more of the thing you're paying for.  That's simplifying. You don't actually get lessons in office hours, in most cases. But what you do get is some one-on-one time that amplifies that value of the classroom time. Students usually leave the meeting feeling more confident, more connected, more prepared to succeed. And they are more likely to end their college careers with recommendations, introduced to the best internship opportunities, etc. Go to office hours! Even if you're not worried about anything in a particular week, stop by and say hello and let the teacher know that you are engaged and eager to do well. ",

            "answer_text": "These are great answers. Rather than attempting to add to an already pretty exhaustive list, I will share my experience. I was not a great high school student. I paid just enough attention to coast through. Consequently, I had little idea about effective study habits..  When I started college my first challenge was how to be a student. Many of these suggestions hit the mark with regard to the necessary behaviors for success and I quickly recognized that I needed to first change my study habits. This was not too difficult. What was far more difficult for me was to learn, \u201chow\u201d I learned and retained information. Let me explain. Because I had coasted through high school, I never learned \u201cmy\u201d way of studying, the little things that helped me really learn. These included: Planning enough time to read (at some point I realized that I could read about 20 pages of technical text with high comprehension and retain the information. Any longer and I found myself having to re-read the information over and over or I would start to confuse the information in one section with another - so if I was assigned to read 100 pages of text I knew I needed to allow myself 5 hours and I would break it up accordingly),How exactly to take notes (I either tried to note too much information during a lecture and consequently spent more time writing than listening or I noted too little and couldn't remember all of the important things later),Sitting in the front of the class to force myself to pay attention and not hide in the back.To attend only morning classes because I just found that I lacked the energy to pay attention in afternoon classes (this was a challenge when selecting classes).Always challenging myself to speak up in class and volunteering to go first with speaking assignments to set the bar for everyone else by putting myself out there.Never attempting to cram on the day of a test. If I didn't know the material well enough before then, it was pretty much guaranteed that I would not learn it 15 minutes before the test.What I found interesting was that I learned more in some classes where I got a lower grade than I did in other classes where I got A\u2019s. I now realize that it was due to working harder for that B than the A that came easy. Of course anybody who is honest will tell you that I also looked for the easy A classes to help keep my GPA up. My friends were quick to point out the easy classes for subject requirements that I had to take but didn\u2019t really enjoy. In the end my grades were not nearly as important as I thought (from a career perspective yes, but a learning perspective much less) and unless you can apply what you learn in life, it is pretty much useless. Of course it is handy in a game of Jeopardy or Trivial pursuit. In the real world you can not wear your grades around your neck or pass out your transcripts during a meeting. People are not really too interested in your GPA. You will be measured by what you can produce, your ideas, your creativity and your work ethic. I have a sign in my office that says \u201cWell done is better then well said.\u201d So, my advice is to learn how to \u201clearn\u201d and the grades will take care of themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "I did very well in university despite being a lousy high school student. Actually I was a pretty bad university student too. In high school I was very hit or miss. I\u2019d either do really well in a class or totally fail it. A lot was dependent on my personal life, drugs, work, and just being plain crazy. In university, I was a near straight A student. I got one C+ in macroeconomics because I slept through the midterm. I SLEPT THROUGH THE MIDTERM (as in didn\u2019t write it), still did so well on the final I got a C+. A lot of people actually found this infuriating about me. Because I\u2019m far from a model student. For one, my attendance is spotty. I\u2019d say I attended 60% of lectures. Some classes I attended just three times. I actually would skip my own lectures to attend other lectures for courses I wasn\u2019t even enrolled in. I never crammed before exams. You know those people who go to the library and sit around and study for days before an exam. Not me. I don\u2019t study. I don\u2019t see the point because I don\u2019t forget what I learned. People taking notes in class. Yup, don\u2019t do that either. I never took notes. Don\u2019t need them. I just sat and listened. And if the professor repeated what was in the textbook, I wouldn\u2019t go to that lecture. Why waste my time listening to something I had already read. When I wrote a paper, I would take my time but I wouldn\u2019t spend that much time on it. Usually I would just start writing. Then leave it. Come back to it in a few days once I had mulled over it some more. I\u2019d revise and revise a little bit at a time. Look for all the sources possible. Search the archives. Whatever. Data, data, data. But yeah. I wasn\u2019t the most hard-working student. I read the material quickly and did my assignments and then the rest of the time was me-time. Write music, go to the theatre (like Shakespeare), play sports, hang out with friends, watch anime. So here, I\u2019ll make a list of tips for getting good grades in college. Read a lot, and then read some more.Prioritize what gets results.Form your own opinions. Make your own evidence.Sleep 9 hours a day.Socialize with good people.No alcohol.Don\u2019t take notes.Don\u2019t take the textbook to class. Don\u2019t take anything to class.Live in the dorm. Don\u2019t commute.Don\u2019t be afraid to challenge your professor and TA.Don\u2019t be afraid to challenge yourself. This is so important. If you assume you know everything, you have no reason to go to university.Be intelligent and have a good memory.Don\u2019t sleep through exams.Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "When I taught freshmen courses I always included a class on how to study and how to get good grades before the first exam. These are the highlights, many others have made similar suggestions. Read all of the assigned readings. I rarely lectured on assigned readings because I thought the duplication was a waste of time for the student who could read it for themselves. I only lectured on assigned readings if the material was a little complicated or if it was essential to the course (really important)Attend all classes and take notes by hand (research has shown this is far more effective than taking notes on a computer when it comes to retention)Record the lecture if you can\u2019t keep up taking notes, so you can listen again and get your notes filled inA week before each exam, type up your notes on a computer then go to the book and type up the major points. Combine the 2 sets of notes into one cohesive study sheet by eliminating the repeated material and organizing the material in a systematic and logical way. Use the combined notes to study the night before the exam.If you are a visual learner or artistic person, make a mind map of the combined material (google how to do it). Use your mind map to study the night before the exam.Now use your combined lecture/book notes or your mind map to study the night before the exam.Get a good nights sleep, do not stay up late studying, do not get up extra early to study. Do not cram at the last minute. Do what you can to calm yourself and reassure yourself that you know the material.Before an exam, DO NOT eat sugar or carbs. Do eat, but lightly and something high in protein and fat (this is not diet advice, rather advice to raise your blood sugar level and keep it up to feed your brain without a sugar crash) i.e. tuna salad, chicken salad, peanut butter on celery, egg salad, fried chicken etc.If you normally drink coffee or tea high in caffeine, and ONLY if you normally drink coffee or tea high in caffeine, have a strong cup before the exam without sugar. NO sodas high in sugar or your blood sugar can crash and your brain will crash in its ability to think.If you must have sugar, then if the professor allows bring M&M\u2019s or skittles and line them up across the desk. Eat one at a time throughout the entire exam, do not eat them all before the exam ends or your blood sugar and thus brain function will crash.Do all of this and I can practically guarantee you will pass the exam. Every semester when I gave this lecture there where several students who said this advice changed their overall grades in all classes by a letter grade or more. I had one student who went from getting D\u2019s to getting A\u2019s in all her classes by doing this.Lastly and most importantly: 12. Do all assigned work and turn it in on time. ",

            "answer_text": "Many good answers here, to which I want to add only one thing. Class time is the key to making every other habit work well. If you leave class confused about the material and about what is expected of you, you will not get as much out of any subsequent hour devoted to studying, writing, doing problem sets, and so on.  And the easiest way to use class time to raise your grade is:Turn off all your electronic devices. If you have the discipline to do that, it's like a free cognitive boost. (If your professor grades on a curve, it will be a double boost, because most of your peers will not have that discipline.) Jen Senior did a nice round-up on the issue earlier this summer (The Case Against Laptops in the Classroom), but in a nutshell... Multi-tasking is harmful to cognitive work (Think You're Multitasking? Think Again). It has negative effects on focussed recall. (Scholars Turn Their Attention to Attention) Heavy multi-taskers are worse at avoiding distraction (Media multitaskers pay mental price) It is so distracting that if you can see someone else multi-tasking, you'll do worse.  (Laptop multitasking hinders classroom learning for both users and nearby peers). Any notification from your phone is distracting, even if you subsequently decide to ignore it. (Phone Notifications Are Very Distracting.)Sadly, for cognitive tasks, there is no multi to task with -- our brains are single-threaded, so multi-tasking is just a flattering word for alternating inattention. As a bonus, if your devices are off, you will have to take notes on paper, which also helps you understand what you're hearing. (The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard) ",

            "answer_text": "From 7.28/10 to 9.7/10, I chalked down this list which actually helped me boost up my grades. Ignore the Bullshit- In my first semester, many seniors misguided us saying \u201cA night before the exams is sufficient to get good grades\u201d. You might end up passing the course but good grades require a little efforts. I\u2019m not saying that you will have to toil and moil for hours daily, but yes, a little smart work and you are there!Why take risk?- Phrases like \u201cGrades don\u2019t matter\u201d, \u201cA single sheet of paper can\u2019t decide your future\u201d are crowd-pleasing and might be true. But not to forget, bad grades can take away good opportunities. So why take risk!?Make proper notes/Get proper notes(beforehand)- Make sure that you have all the notes containing everything the professor says in the lecture. Either attend all the classes and jot down everything yourself or if you miss some classes, take the notes from trustworthy first benchers. Because some of the teachers end up making questions on whatever they have taught in the class.Know your lecturers(from your seniors or your past experience)- Make sure you know what kind of answers are appreciated by your lecturer- Quantity answers or Quality answers. Some teachers prefer lengthy answers over quality answers. So make sure that your answer sheet is as fat and chunky as possible in this case. But yes, if a teacher likes quality answers, write precise points and don\u2019t beat about the bush.Don\u2019t underestimate anything- If you have covered almost every topic in the syllabus and just left 1/32 part of it, then 99% chances are that a question will asked from that uncovered part. How annoying and regretful would it be? So do not undervalue even a trivial topic!Last Year Question Papers- Take the last year question papers from your seniors and analyse the type of questions asked.Don\u2019t wait for the deadline- Complete the homework and assignment yourself on the night it is given rather than copying it a night before the deadline. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to take pressure and accomplish the task a few days ahead of schedule, rather than working right up to the last minute?Healthy Discussions- Three hours before the exams, I and my roommate discuss everything that we have studied. In this way, whatever topics we have missed unknowingly are covered easily and everything is brushed up.Answer sheet hacks- Neat answer sheets with good hand writing, writing down answers in bullets rather than long paragraphs, underlining the important points can work wonders.Each individual has his/her own way of dealing with things. Draft your own plan. All the best! Happy Reading! ",

            "answer_text": "Engage the professors and TAs The number 1 rule to getting awesome grades in college is to always, always engage the professor and the TA of that class, this means:  Do the reading before classPay attention and ask questions in classGo to office hours to clarify your doubts, or enhance your understanding of a topicGo to your Prof./TA after a test to understand why you made certain mistakes - please, please don't ask for more partial credit, it's annoying, and the extra 1 point does nothing for your grade. However, understanding why you made a mistake is immensely valuable. There are many reasons why this works, including:  These are just good habits that will increase your learning in general, like reading ahead and paying attention/asking questions in class.You will build a good reputation with the teaching staff - so in any borderline situations, they will give you the benefit of the doubt. Meaning if you are border of B+ and A- --> you will get the A- 95% of the time. The professor/TA will pay more attn to you and hence your personal learning will increase. Learning from your mistakes/engaging in that way will help you reduce mistakes over time (maybe this is obvious).In general, I believe that study habits really need to be based on your own optimization of how you learn best. However, given that, engaging with the teaching staff will be the biggest way to boost your grade.  I know this works because it was the biggest change in my own behavior between freshman and later years. It made a HUGE impact. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The first time I went to college for an undergraduate degree I flunked out of college. When I finally got my degree decades later I graduated summa cum laude and got an award from my department based in the quality of my writing.  What did I do differently the second time around? Well, here's a list. It may not be fully comprehensive and it is not in a particular order. Start with the basics and work your way up. If something seemed too easy but it was a requirement, I took it. Introductory courses for a field don't give you the enormous depth of knowledge that a specialist has, but it gives you some of the breadth you need to move on. If a course seemed challenging but would build upon something I'd already learned, I took that. Focus on academics. I was less focused in my schoolwork my first time through, worrying more about socializing (poorly, but that's another Quora) and how to avoid campus dining than I was about much of my studies. My most recent tour saw me focus first on getting my studies under control, figuring out my workload, and only then looking for other things to do on campus. Ask questions when you need answers. Good professors and TAs will not spoon feed you answers during an exam, but if you have a question that is not utter foolishness and is within the scope of the class they will do their utmost to answer it. I asked fewer questions my first time through. Take good notes. This does not mean transcribing absolutely everything. It means writing whatever you can that will help you remember key points. Do what works. Learn from everybody. You can learn a lot from your classmates, though not necessarily about that class. Your classmates will join you in study groups and help you blow off steam if you need to. If your classmates ask, teach them. If you have a good handle on the material and your grades have been good, offering to study with classmates and help them understand points they are having trouble with can actually help you more thoroughly understand the class materials. The last time I did a small study group with a couple of classmates they thanked me afterwards, saying I'd been clearer on the explanation than the professor. Read the materials. Some classes will just summarize the materials you read, but if you read the materials you will have a better chance of understanding and organizing it in your head. Other classes expand upon the materials and it will be pretty obvious if you haven't read them unless you already have a very strong foundation in the subject. Be interested! If you are bored with the class you won't do as well. My introduction to political science teacher mentioned that many polisci majors actually got a B of some sort taking that class, even if they got an A in much of the rest of the coursework. Also, if you have a wide variety of interests you can expand your knowledge in each of them. I took courses outside my major in environmental studies, writing, sociology, statistics, and would have taken more economics and business courses if I'd had the time and energy. Schedule wisely. My first time around, the university kept not giving me the time slots for classes that I requested despite having space in those slots. My last place did not do this to me. As much as possible create a schedule that works for you, your sleep habits, any job you might have, your dietary needs and any religious needs. While schoolwork should be a top priority, it's much tougher for it to be the top priority if you are underslept, underfed and overstressed about scheduling conflicts. Do the assignments and do them to spec. This seems like a no brainer but it's not. A few times I didn't do homework to spec when I first went to university, and there were a few times I just blew off my homework. Like I said, there are reasons I flunked out and some of them were all me.My last time around I always made sure my assignments were completed and answered what the assignment asked for. I did not always get an A but I got them more often than not. One time when I reviewed a classmate's paper before it was due I found that she hadn't directly addressed the assignment at all, instead ducking and trying to answer something else. I suggested she rewrite it but she declined. She got a poor grade on that paper. The professor for that class currently has copies of my work for that course as writing samples to show students who need help. Go. To. Class. I skipped a number of classes my first time through, sometimes oversleeping, sometimes socializing. My second time through I went to class every time unless I was very sick or had a major project that could not be done at another time, like a trip to DC or studying for an upcoming GRE. If sick, get notes when possible. If you have a major project, check with your professors in advance if it is OK to miss a class or two. I basically took a week off of some classes so I could study for the GREs, but only after talking with the professors. They all said I was fine to focus on the GREs. Don't routinely overload your brain. You will get overloads at peak periods sometimes, like finals or midterms. That's understandable. If it looks like you are overloading every week then you have a problem. In that case, step back and see if it is something you will get past quickly or if it looks like you'll drop much of what you're juggling. I did drop a class my final semester, not because I was uninterested in it or doing poorly in the class, but because that class was the one that over scheduled me and kept me from focusing on my other commitments. Work with teachers you understand. I had a couple of teachers I couldn't understand my first time through and who couldn't help me with my questions. I should have looked for another teacher to teach me those concepts but I didn't. This is one reason I failed my first time through. I didn't have that problem the last time around. Figure out what you can schedule socially outside of classes and homework. Learning is the primary part of your degree, but making friends and influencing people is another important part. My first time through my priorities were socializing first, schoolwork second, and helping out last. This is not a recipe for success in school, though it might work in some networking meetings. My last time around I put schoolwork first, helping out second and socializing last. Interestingly, I got in more socializing from helping out and I made some good contacts with people I like. This can happen when you work on the school newspaper and serve in student government. When possible, work from your strengths. Your major should be based on your talents and interests, not something other people tell you to do that you are thoroughly uninterested in learning about. You may have to take a few courses like that for your major, and you may have to slog through those. Learning should be more about the joy of understanding than the dull grind of cramming stuff in your head.  You have already gotten some good advice. If my perspective can help then you are welcome to it. ",

Good grades translate to more academic opportunities, job opportunities, and even money. Here are some tips to get good grades in college. Learn how to learn Find out how you learn best. Certain learning methods don\u2019t work for some people. There are audio learners, visual learners, hands-on learners, etc. Find which way you learn best and focus on learning through that method.Read the textbook. It likely has all the information that you have to know to do well on your assignments and exams.Study smart by creating detailed study guides, quizzing with another Learner, and getting help from teachers when you need it.Learn how to research and find information. Being able to research subjects and find good sources is a skill that will help in school and beyond.Stay organized Use a planner. Record all your assignments, quizzes, exams, and appointments in it.Create a study schedule. Designate specific times that you will do homework, study, and complete assignments.Have all the folders, three-ring binders, and notebooks you need. Have these for each class and keep all your notes and assignments in them.Make sure to have a neat workspace. A cluttered desk is a cluttered mind.Prioritize classes, homework, exams, and tasks. Allot the appropriate time for things that require more effort from you.Attend every class (in mind and body) Attend every class, not almost every class. When you miss a class, you cannot make it up, it\u2019s gone. So be on time for every class.Sit in the front of the class to help you pay attention and get all the information being taught. Hey, it might also rub your teacher the right way.Stay engaged in class. Just being there is not enough. You have to be listening to the professor, taking notes, participating, and asking questions to be fully engaged.Taking good notes has multiple benefits. Note taking can help you learn and retain the lesson and you can use the notes later to help you prepare for exams. Good notes correlate with good grades.Learn with others Learning with others can help you get good grades!Find another Learner (study buddy). Here are 6 reasons to find a Learner.Find a Knower (tutor) to teach you. They have the knowledge, experience, and teaching ability help you learn and get good grades.Learning with others brings more teaching and learning opportunities, teamwork on assignments, and better test preparation.Do your work Always complete your homework and assignments immediately. Getting them done early will allow you to focus on other things.Don\u2019t procrastinate; that will put unnecessary pressure on you to complete assignments which will take away from the learning opportunity.Complete every homework and assignment you have. These make up a large portion of your final grade. Ensure that you get all of those points just in case you lose points in other areas such as test and projects.Know how to take exams Preparing for exams happens long before the night before an exam. Throughout the class, you should have taken quality notes, reviewed, as well as completed all homework and assignments. Test preparation should be reviewing what you already know.Know what to expect in each exam; understand the format and subject material on the test.Prepare with another Learner. Combining knowledge and quizzing each other will help improve understanding and retention for exams.Don\u2019t cram and get a good night\u2019s sleep. The night before the exam is not the time to learn the material. Hopefully, you spent the weeks before this point preparing so you can just review then get to sleep early to be at your best on exam day.Getting good grades is not as difficult as some might think, but it\u2019s also not easy. It requires discipline, consistency, and hard work. Qualities such as those are what separates people in the classroom, the workplace, and in life. Do your best to do well in school, it will give you more options in life. Our community has thousands of Learners and Knowers who are all striving to crush it in school and the workplace.

            "answer_text": "Freshman and Sophomore years are tough partly because you need to pass all the required courses which generally have little to do with your chosen major but you can get through it by hard work and time management. By the time you are a Junior you\u2019ll have the rhythms and routines down pat and will know just how hard to apply yourself to get top grades. What is great about being a junior is that the focus changes to your chosen major which if you are lucky means that you can really sink your teeth into the coursework. If you are really lucky you realize that everything that you do is no longer just about the grade but about personal achievement. You might find yourself working harder than you ever imagined you would but it\u2019s okay because you will find that once you reach that level of commitment and interest the grades are besides the point. Once you get there the professors will begin to think of you as more of a colleague than a nameless face. You will stand out not because of grades but for reaching a level of synthesis allowing for mastery. And so how do you get good grades in college? You get good grades in college by not focusing on the grade but rather by focusing on achievement; if you can share the professor\u2019s enthusiasm for the subject, own the discipline and display a degree of mastery the grades will take care of themselves.

            "answer_text": "High Caffeine is just one thing for High GRADES.  I don\u2019t know about you, but this is the time where my stress (and caffeine) levels are at an all-time-high because of assignments and reports and of course, finals. I shifted my stress part (Assignments, reports, etc) onto online study help and I\u2019d share some tips to study effectively for your exams. These tips and online tutorials have really helped me the past year, and hopefully they\u2019ll help you out too! USE FLASH CARDS AND TUTORIALS I am honestly not that good at anything science-related so flashcards basically saved me when it came to History. TUTORIALS are available online in shape of study sets, tests, videos and diagrams to help you better understand and remember the material, which is a life saver, especially if you are a visual learner. GET TO KNOW YOUR PROFESSORS This one is about to get quite sappy. We have all had teachers in our lives that have shaped the way we perceive ourselves and the world around us. They provide not only lectures on math and science, but great life lessons to carry on past the school. PLAN ASSIGNMENTS AHEAD and SET REMINDERS FOR DUE DATES If you can manage it, you want to try to plan every major assignment two weeks in advance. This little piece of advice saved me so much last term. I pinned all the assignments on planner and started working two weeks earlier for large assignments so that I have no burden on deadlines. I used to take help with online tutorials and published materials to get ahead. HAND WRITE YOUR NOTES Then come the NOTES. Your notes are yours only and nobody cares how rough or bad they look. You should from the start day make your all notes your way and only your way. You don\u2019t have to worry how bad your notes look as far as they are helpful to you. Bonus point if you rewrite your lecture notes every night and color code them. STUDY THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE MORNING OF CLASS Not only do I study the night before, but I also study the morning of a major test. Studying the night before and the morning of, right before class starts, allows your brain to retain as much information as possible. I truly believe this is one of the major reasons I get A\u2019s on all of my tests. ",

            "answer_text": "Studying to Learn or Studying for an Exam? Studying purely for the sake of learning is the ideal situation, but in the real world, we\u2019re usually studying to pass an exam. What\u2019s the difference? Strategy versus tactics. Every good Quora post should include a classic quote, so here\u2019s Sun Tzu: \u201cStrategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.\u201d If you\u2019re focused on studying for the sake of learning, it\u2019s all about tactics - otherwise known as study skills. But if you have an exam looming, it\u2019s important to start with strategy. You need to know where to focus your time and effort before you begin using the how. Makes sense, right? If you\u2019re like the average student, you\u2019re probably short on time, which makes a strategic approach all the more important. This video explains the 6 steps for strategic exam preparation.  Whether you\u2019re cramming for an exam tomorrow or you\u2019re super organized and you\u2019re preparing three months in advance, you\u2019ll follow the same steps. So that\u2019s strategy, now what about specific tactics? The ANSWER Method: 6 Essential Study Skills How do most students study? If you took a survey of typical students, I bet the most popular study techniques would include: Re-readingHighlightingSummarizingFlashcardsThere's only one problem with that list... ... none of them are highly effective! What REALLY works? What does academic research recommend you should do? What are the most effective ways to study? Here are the top six tactics.  Now I'm a simple guy, and some of these academic words were too complicated for me. So I've changed them up a bit and put them into an acronym that's easy to recall. Here are the top six, evidence-based study strategies you should make sure you use: The ANSWER Method Ask, Explain & Connect (or Elaboration in academic speak) No Cramming (Spaced Practice) Switch (Interleaving) Words & Visuals (Dual Coding) Examples (Concrete Examples) Recall What You Know (Retrieval Practice) Watch the video above and you'll understand what each of them are, why they're beneficial, and how to use them. If you thought this answer was valuable, please give it an upvote so other people will know it's worth checking out too. Thanks!\ufeff ",

            "answer_text": "In each course in college, do the following: Read the syllabus carefully as soon as you get it, to learn what the professor thinks you should be able to accomplish by the end of the course. Note the due dates of all assignments and exams in your calendar. Do the assigned readings before course meetings so you can get the most out of your time in the classroom. Start course assignments early so you have time to really think about them, set them aside, and return for a fresh perspective.  Do the work yourself:  cheating on homework by looking up the answers online will just make it more likely that you'll do badly on exams. Ask questions in class. Visit your professor's office hours and ask more questions. Join a study group to get practice in discussing the material. Think about how the current course relates to material from past courses or the other ones you're taking alongside it. Putting together the big picture will make each course more understandable. When studying for exams, do practice problems you've never seen before from scratch, try writing timed practice essays, or write up an annotated course outline summarizing what you've learned. Reading over your notes isn't an effective way to study. You have to do something active that forces you to examine or apply the material in a fresh way. Above all, convince yourself that the material is fascinating and that you love it. That makes it easier to spend time thinking about it.",

Its about learning with ever greater passionate determination not because of only attaining higher grades but also for the pure joy of it. As you might have noticed and realized in so many areas of life that we tend to considerably keep focusing upon excelling in areas/dimensions and sphere where we are enjoying rather than just tagging along monotonously. For all of this first of all clarify your perception-practice pure mindfulness mediation everyday morning and then maintain a note book/journal in which you are necessarily making notes of some of the insightful notions/ideas that could help further improve from time to time. You will need to be more well aware-this is the awareness that is fiercely and very resolutely determined and well disciplined since the tendency to get distracted or discouraged might come in between, so well you need to be ever vigilant/wise in how you intend to protectively safeguard your long term - better good willed/pure intentionalities interests. It will take further more essential improvements that you are able to particularly notice and then redefined/reorient the manner in which you are attending towards better understanding/realizing and then intending to make amends; not just charging or getting/experiencing an adrenaline rush and just darting off in a hurry from one pillar to another post without even/ever having actually defined or realize what\u2019s to be essentially done after all?

            "answer_text": "Overall, the key is to achieve and demonstrate a mastery of the assigned subject-matter; by law, they can only grade you on that.  First, I have to refer to http://HowToStudy.com, which contains most of what I explain. Next, you have to take an active role in your academic career, and make it your sole priority. The first order of business is the teacher; scope out the different teachers for each course you want to take next term, by sitting in on classes and students that they think. Also get a look at the class textbook for each class, and consider this as well. Once you know which instructors you like, ask them a few questions about the class during office-hours.  You also need a schedule, to plan what you will do to succeed, and when; a good plan is essential.  For studying, be sure to stay ahead of the class by one lesson, since the purpose of the class is to review and clarify the subject-matter, not to introduce it; I did this by taking book-notes on my notebook in black text, and then during class I'd  follow along with my notes, and write after it in red text whatever the teacher said about that topic, since that's particularly important  (a good way to do this is to have red *'s in your notes, and then copy-and-paste it to produce the red font).  Then right after class, I'd convert all my notes into questions and answers, to test myself on the material, and be sure I knew the answers. I'd also make the questions boldfaced, and the answers in plain text. For example a question from law school Civil Procedure would be  List the things needed for a court to be able to try a case? In Personam jurisdiction, Subject Matter jurisdiction, and Venue. Or in Abnormal Behavior psychology,  Explain Alzheimer's Disease A mental illness congenitally carried in Chromosome 21, responsible for the metabolism of protein A-68, which is necessary for the production of the primary neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Symptoms include.... Etc.  Be sure you can answer all the questions from memory, before reading for  the next class, otherwise you'll lose information. Also try to get hold of past exams from the class, as a source of questions, as well as an indication of what you'll need to study most. By exam-time, you should have a thorough mastery of the class objectives.  A primary element of academic success, however, is the time involved; few academic institutions emphasize this, since they'd have few students if they explained that a standard 12-credit hour semester is a full-time job, requiring over 40 hours/week for class-time and homework; as a result, most schools are rather vague on what's required, leading to late-night cram sessions before exams, which are only marginally effective on the exam, and lead to little benefit from the class itself-- vs. a thorough mastery of the information presented therein, as established by a well-designed program with clear objectives.

            "answer_text": "People always ask how to get good grades, but the never ask how to learn the material. The best way to get good grades is to learn the material. That is also the best use of your time, because it pays rewards for the rest of your life. Here are my standard tips for some behaviors that will help you learn the material: Read the textbook chapter BEFORE the class period where the teacher will discuss that chapter. You are not trying to memorize everything in the chapter, but you are trying to become familiar with the vocabulary and understand how the principles in the chapter relate to each other.Sit in the 2nd or 3rd row in your class, on whatever side of the classroom that suits you best.Raise your hand and answer a question or offer a comment 1\u20133 times per class period (no less than 1, no more than 3 - 2 is really good). Don\u2019t be the first person to raise your hand; give your classmates the chance to participate first. If none of them choose to do so, then it is your turn to do so. You are not trying to dominate the discussion - you are just showing your teacher that you understand the material.Take good notes. Since you have read the chapter, you don\u2019t have to take notes about what all the new words mean - that is in the textbook. Your notes should focus on the examples that your teacher uses to illustrate the principles that you are learning about.Do the homework.Go to the teacher\u2019s (or the TA\u2019s) office hours at least twice per semester. Don\u2019t go the first week. Don\u2019t try to suck up to the teacher. Either go and ask for help learning some of the principles of the class (if you need help - don\u2019t try to fake needing help) or ask about career fields that pertain to the class. Don\u2019t tell the teacher that this is your life-long ambition, just take this opportunity to learn about some possibilities for your future.Learn the material as you go - do not plan on cramming for the exam. Cramming for the exam doesn\u2019t help you do better on the exam, and it ensures that you aren\u2019t learning the material. If you want to do well on the exam, learn the material as you go along, make sure that you are trying to understand the things that are being taught. Read the chapter again, review the vocabulary, and then go over your notes to understand the examples that the teacher used, and understand why those examples are good.",

            "answer_text": "A lot of good advice here. Just a few comments, which maybe repeat some things that some others have said. It is really important to try to get a head start if at all possible. Try to get the textbook as early as possible before the first class, do an initial cover-to-cover skim, and try to at least read the first chapter - it will be a good bet to be your first assignment, even if you don\u2019t have the syllabus yet. If the subject matter is really new to you, take a trip to the library and/or browse the internet (i.e. Wikipedia) to try to get a brief \u201cbirds eye\u201d introduction of the subject. Once you have that head start, try to stay at least a week ahead throughout the semester if at all possible - you\u2019ll be very glad you did when you get to finals.Develop and use a note-taking system that works well for you. The most elegant system in the world is worthless if it doesn\u2019t work for you and you can\u2019t/don\u2019t use it. I would strongly suggest that you come up with a system that combines textbook notes and lecture notes in one place. This will then become what you review before exams. I am not a big fan of marking up textbooks, and not just because of the hit you take on re-sale value; I just doubt that going back through a textbook is a very efficient way to review for most people. A set of really good notes that distills the most important points from both the text and the lecture will serve you a lot better.As you are doing your preliminary reading in advance, make notes of any questions you might need answers for in class. Review your study notes and these questions just before class, so you will be prepared to fully participate and make the best use of class time. I\u2019d suggest sitting toward the front - that\u2019s where the best students sit, and where the profs assume the best students sit.I would also suggest developing a separate system for learning and reviewing vocabulary. Every subject will have its own specialized lingo, and knowing the proper and important terms and what they mean is almost always going to be one of the things tested on exams. Flash cards are the classic study tool for these, and they have the advantage of being handy for drilling yourself during transit or other unproductive moments. Again, if something else works better for you, then use what works.Do all the homework yourself if possible, but get help if you are the least bit unsure whether or not your answers are correct. Don\u2019t hesitate to go to the prof during office hours if you are not sure how to work a problem. I\u2019m not a big fan of study groups (which, unless they are highly motivated students, can become cut-up/goof-off groups) with one exception: it is a good idea for you and several other GOOD students to check your work against each other prior to turning it in. Better to find out if you have misunderstood something or just gotten it wrong prior to submitting it.Consider using supplemental learning materials if they will help you. I am thinking here of Cliffs Notes for literature, Schaum\u2019s Outlines for math, science, and engineering courses, and College Outline Series for many other undergraduate courses. (There may be equivalents of these in other countries.) It is an extra investment of time to use these, and some students won\u2019t benefit all that much from them. If the standard textbook and lecture just are not quite doing it for you, though, then sometimes a supplement will help. Another possibility might be to get hold of a different textbook. There are usually going to be several different textbooks available on any subject. The one your prof (or maybe their department) selected may or may not be the best one for you. Sometimes they pick a text because it is cheaper, or just because it is what the prof is familiar with, or sometimes even because it is what the prof or their colleague in their department authored; none of these assure that it is really the best one for you. Given the choice of struggling through a class and doing poorly or spending the extra money for a much better text, I think I know what my choice would be.Find tutoring assistance if you really need help. I mean it. Especially for the lower-level courses, there are probably tutors available. In many cases the university will have a program where people are lined up to be available for this. If not, then just start asking around for grad students in the subject - there will always be someone interested in making a few extra dollars for what (to them) is easy work. Don\u2019t give up and accept a poor grade - fight and try for a better one.Also get an early start on research papers, and be well-organized and thorough in your approach. Discussing possible topics is a good excuse for meeting with your prof during office hours early in the semester. Most profs will be impressed that you are wanting to get on the ball, and will try to be helpful. It may take several visits, because a good (and high-graded) paper is going to require your narrowing your subject to a much greater extent than you might initially realize. For most students, the subject matter in their class is going to be pretty new, so knowing enough to pick a good topic will be difficult. Talking to grad students and bouncing ideas off them might be helpful as well. Whatever topic you narrow down to, you need to gather as much relevant research materials as you can. ASK THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN FOR HELP! That is what they are there for, and are a greatly underutilized resource. Be aware that not everything is available on the internet or in the university; some materials may have to be ordered through interlibrary loan. This is another big reason why you need to get the earliest possible start. When it comes down to writing your paper, get at it as soon as possible. Be scrupulous in your citations (and make sure you are using the citation style that your prof wants). If you are someone who has difficulty turning out perfect documents that are error-free, then I wouldn\u2019t hesitate about paying someone to turn your draft into a perfect final ready for submission; you need to line up such a person early, not at the last minute.If you do all of the above, then you should be done with your studying and have a complete set of review notes well before your final exam, and you should also have any papers or other final assignments turned in and out of the way. This should put you in a very good position going into the final. Try to be well-rested before exam day. Some of the supplemental materials mentioned above have practice exams, or you might be able to find these elsewhere; for some students, doing a practice exam before exam day might be helpful. If you find you are having trouble with something, try to have one last meeting with the prof to go over it before exam day.Try to find some break time for some physical activity. You\u2019ll find yourself having more energy and better retention if you do.",

            "answer_text": "\"How\" is one question. However, the more important one would be: Why? or What for? Do these excellent grades really lead to better employment opportunities? There is one place where grades do really matter - a graduate school. And a college itself (students keep calculating and comparing their GPA).  The real value of doing these calculations outside of college, however, remains unclear. I am not, honestly, aware of any other place that clearly does differentiate between A plus and C students when they hire them. In my opinion, getting straight As is more of a matter of personal achievement or personal satisfaction. A lot more so than being a critical career-related step. There is hardly any tangible benefit of being an A plus student other than perceptional or psychological (unless you have already decided to go to graduate school). In fact, this \"A plus or nothing\" mentality comes at a price.  The price is time.  Yes, of course, you can beat any test or assignment. But this is never possible without a serious investment of time.  This time can be also spent somewhere else, and in a more productive way for your career - e.g. talking to people, making connections, learning tricks of trade from people involved in this trade. I would certainly think that this approach brings a lot better return on the investment of time than does a personal satisfaction through high grades. In general, our education system should find a way to reward students for creativity, critical thinking and real-life results, and not for robotic memorization just to pass the test.  The problem is actually a lot deeper in many Asian countries, where the system is designed to produce test-taking robots and not people who are learning something to apply it to real-world tasks. This has got to change. ",

            "answer_text": "We should distinguish two things first. Great students almost always have great grades. But, those with great grades do not necessarily make great students. Why? Understand that school is kind of like a game, everyone is competing to get the highest marks. Naturally, those who exploit the system to get the good grades, i.e. cheat, brown-nose, take easy courses, or easy professors, can get away with doing much less and end up being identical on paper. This is also the case across majors being studied. There are many reasons someone might want to do this. It could be because grad schools really care about how nice your gpa looks. It could be for certain internships, or positions in government at the university. Everyone has reasons for wanting this, but it is universally accepted that a higher gpa will gain you better entrance into a number of things. At worst, it won\u2019t hurt your chances or make it worse off than if you had a lower gpa. At Berkeley, you can see that there are quit a few majors with average gpas hovering around 3.0 or less: biology, mathematics, statistics, physics. So relatively speaking, a good grade would be a B in those technical courses. You\u2019d be sitting in classes with some of the smartest kids in the country. If you sift through the majors, you\u2019ll find that you can take languages, visual studies, or education and have an easier time. So to answer this part of the question, I would say that it depends what you want to do. If you want just great grades, there are many ways to do this. Now, if you want to actually be a great student, that requires a plethora of things. The most important, I would say, is an actual fascination with learning. This will guarantee that you are engaged in the material that you are trying to learn. If you truly love learning quantum mechanics, you will probably end up doing well just do to your persistence and engagement. Asking questions, no matter how stupid you think they are, are critical to your understanding of highly complex subjects. Great students are fantastic learners, with an appetite to actually gain useful information that either models the world around them or describes beauty in things that are otherwise invisible to the eye. At the end of the day, it depends purely on who you want to be. ",

            "answer_text": "The transition from high school to college can be tricky, mainly because there is a lot of structure to your day in high school but, in college, you are expected to create your own structure and manage your time well. The good news is that there is SO much more time in college. If you spend a few minutes each day planning, you can get all of your work done, including studying, and also have plenty of free time to enjoy the full college experience. This has become one of the most common questions I get asked. And with good reason. As technology has improved and advanced, it has also increased the frequency with which we are constantly distracted and interrupted. This can make it hard (if not almost impossible) to get your work done while making it incredibly easy to procrastinate! I think you will find my recent answer to this similar question helpful: Sharon Feldman Danzger's answer to What are the best study tips ever?  Photo source: Pixabay Our brains are all wired differently, so a method or system that is perfect for one person won\u2019t work for another. The biggest issue I see is that students believe they can study effectively for long stretches of time. But research shows that our brain can stay engaged and focused for 90 minutes or less. This means we need to plan our days to have frequent breaks so our fatigued brain can relax and reset. Otherwise, we become easily distracted and ineffective. Trying the system outlined below will head you in the right direction. It\u2019s easier to get motivated to study if you have specific time frames and goals and scheduled breaks. And the concepts translate and work great in the working world as well! 7 STEPS TO STUDY MORE EFFECTIVELY IN LESS TIME: When you receive an assignment, break it into small tasks. You know the joke: \"How do you eat an elephant?\" One bite at a time. Accomplishing small pieces of the larger task will empower and encourage you to keep going. For each small piece, estimate how long you think it will take (be generous, most things take longer than we expect.) Then assign a degree of difficulty - you can create your own scale or simply use 1 to represent easy, 2 for medium, and 3 for hardIf you have a big exam to study for, break it into bite-size pieces. If your attention span is 15\u201320 minutes, use that as your guide. List each step and the estimated time next to it as well as the degree of difficulty.Each evening, look at what needs to get done. Each task should have an estimated time assigned to its well as a degree of difficulty. Update the list for new assignments and adjust estimated time and degree of difficulty, as needed.Take out your calendar and be sure to schedule. Fill in classes and other \u2018fixed\u2019 variables. Then, look at your list of tasks and decide which need to get done immediately. By prioritizing your to-do list every day, nothing will fall through the cracks or be forgotten. Your calendar is a great tool and will serve as your road map each day.Consider the times during the day when you are most alert and attentive. Everyone has windows of peak performance. Put simply, it\u2019s the time of day when you find it easiest to focus and get your most difficult work done. Schedule your harder tasks during these times but be sure to allow for regular breaks. If you find yourself tired and sluggish in the late afternoon, be sure to plan easier work to be done during that time.The Pomodoro method suggests 25 minutes of concentration followed by 5 minutes of relaxation. You can use this as a guide or adjust the 25 to 20 minutes if that\u2019s your optimal working time.Scheduling a specific time to study and get work done. Making appointments in your calendar to get your tasks done will enable you to get your studying and assignments done more efficiently. You will also find that scheduling out your time makes you realize that when you work effectively, there is plenty of time to do things you enjoy (dinner with friends, exercise, movies, etc.) It may not be as much time as you would like (especially during finals) but you will spend less time studying and find that the time you spend is more effective.Best of luck!

            "answer_text": "If you are struggling with grades and interested in raising your grade point average, take a close look at these 10 tips for getting better grades. 1. Attend every class If you want good grades in college, you must attend every class, not almost every class. The importance of regular class attendance cannot be overemphasized. When you miss classes, you miss lectures, notes, discussions, explanations, and assignments. Do not think that missing a class won\u2019t make a difference. You cannot make up what you miss. 2. Master Your Professors Every professor has a different personality and system for running his/her classes, so it makes sense as early in the semester as possible to learn what the professor wants. Here are some ways to master your professors: Understand course expectations. Most professors give out a class syllabus during the first week of classes \u2014 and it is your responsibility to know deadlines and all the requirements for the course.Understand professors on personal level. Rather than viewing the professor as some figurehead at the front of the class who decides your fate in some abstract way, get to know your professor as a person. Visit him or her during office hours, or stay after class.Communicate with professors when you are struggling. Especially at larger colleges and universities, the professor won\u2019t know when you are struggling, so if you are having problems with the course work or the tests, schedule an appointment to meet with the professor and get the help you need.3. Be organized: Use a student planner: take this to each class and record all assignments. Also use your planner to keep track of tests and quizzes, activities and appointments.Break down assignments: large assignments are more manageable if you break them down into smaller parts. Completing these smaller portions over a longer period of time will allow you more time to focus.Use three-ring binders for class notes: this type of note book works well because handouts can easily be inserted and if you end up missing a class you can also insert a copy of someone else\u2019s notes where they belong.Organize and save computer work: make sure that all your work on the computer is saved and saved often, and that you have back up files.4. Use Time Wisely Even if you do not procrastinate and are the most organized person in the world, time can be one of your biggest enemies in college. Here are some tips for using time wisely: Don\u2019t overextend yourselfBe organized: see number 2 above!Schedule 90 minute study sessions: set a specific time to get your studying done and make sure you will not be interrupted. During these study sessions, don\u2019t do anything else but study!Make \u2018to do\u2019 lists and prioritize tasks: make a daily list of the things you need to do. Rate each item as an A (must do today), B (should do today), or C (would like to do today, but can wait). Listing and prioritizing your tasks only takes a few minutes but it is a great way to organize your time. Focus on one task at a time until everything is completed5. Take Good Notes: tests usually cover materials that the instructor has presented in class. Therefore, it is important to have good class notes. Be an active listener: when your actively listening, your not just hearing the words, but you are also thinking about and trying to understand the information being presented.Taking notes can help you pay attention and stay focused.Recognize important information: anything the instructor writes on the board is important. In your notes, underline or star the most important information so you can pay special attention to it when studying.6. Know How to Read a Textbook: Knowing how to scan, read and review will make it much easier for you to understand and remember what you read. Scan: scanning gives you a quick overview of the material you\u2019re going to be reading. To scan, read the title, subtitle, and everything in bold and italic print. Look at the pictures, captions, charts, graphs, and read the introduction, the summary and the review questions. Read: when your reading has a purpose, you have a reason to stay focused and your comprehension improves. Review: to review, first ask yourself \u2018what is the main idea\u2019 and then go back to the beginning and go through the same process you did when you scanned the material. This time, as you scan restate the main idea of each passage using your own words. 7. Study Smart: Students who study smart find themselves spending less time of studying and still getting better grades. Find a good place to study: make sure the area is free of distractions.Know your learning style: we all learn differently! Some learn best by seeing the material (visual learner), some learn best from hearing the material (auditory learner), and some learn best by doing (kinesthetic learner). As a rule, the more senses you involve and the wider variety of methods you use while studying, the more you remember.Organize your study time: before you begin, make a plan. Decide exactly what you want to get done. Always allow more time than you think you will need and prioritize your work to make sure that you have enough time for the things that are most important. Do difficult tasks first while you are most alert and fresh and remember to take regular short study breaks.9. Be a Good Test-Taker Just about all college classes have exams, and sometimes the exams are the major portion of your final grade, so it\u2019s important to become a good test-taker. Here are some hints: Know what to expect on exams. Every professor has a style of test development, so obtain old copies or ask the professor directly. Know the types of questions that will be asked \u2014 as well as the content that will be covered.Read questions carefully and plan answers. Take your time at the beginning of the test to read through all the instructions and make a plan of attack.Pace yourself so you have plenty of time to complete all parts. And know the point v alues of questions, so you can be sure to complete the most important ones first in case time does run out.Ask questions. If you don\u2019t understand something, or need clarification of the question, ask the professor. Don\u2019t wait to get the exam back and find you answered a question the wrong way.Here are some tips I think it may help you a lot to get good grades in college. Yet, each one has their own style of learning, there are no fixed rules in learning. Find yourself anyway suitable and sufficient to your own. ",

            "answer_text": "How to get good grades is a common question asked by the students at any level of education. The reason is everyone wants to score good grades in their examinations. It just not provide mental happiness to the students but also play a crucial role in the success of the students. Get higher grades in school can be a lot easier than getting high grades in college. Getting good grades is also helpful in winning competitive scholarships. Today I am going to share with you the best and most effective tips on how to get good grades in exams. Just studying is not enough for getting good grades. You need to have a solid strategy and plan that will help you to regain your focus and help you to achieve good grades. Tips on how to get good grades: 1. Motivate yourself Self-motivation is the key to success for every student. It is pretty often that the students lose their confidence when they don\u2019t get good grades. But you should not make the same mistakes as other students do. You may not get satisfied with your grades sometimes, but at that moment, you should maintain your self-confidence to be in the game of getting good grades. You should believe in yourself to stay focused on your work. The best way to motivate yourself is to create some milestones for yourself. You can create a series of milestones. When you start working to achieve those milestones than in every achievement, you will boost your self-confidence. And this confidence will lead you to get good grades in your exams. 2. Listen and participate in the class A student who does participate in the class always gets more grades than the students who don\u2019t. But listen and participate in the class is not easy for any students, especially for the shy one. But it showcases the teacher that you care about the topic and you want to score high grades. The teacher gives the grades based on various factors. Apart from that if you participate in the class, then you may get more awareness about the topic. Along with that if you listen to your mentor or teacher carefully, then you can learn a lot more than the self-study. It will help you to prepare for the exams more effectively. Thus it helps you to get good grades in your exams. Besides, if you\u2019re a weak student, then you can sit closer to the teacher so that the teacher can know more about you and find your weakness. Apart from that, you can also write down some questions before the class and then ask them to the teacher to clear your doubts. 3. Take thorough notes during a class Notes are quite helpful in getting high grades. You should make notes during the class. Notes help you to cover the important information about the topic. You can create the notes by listening to your teacher. Apart from that, you can also create the notes of the important topic with the help of some reference book of your topic. It will help you to prepare for the exams more efficiently. Sometimes the students just need to have a look at the notes, and then they prepare for the exams within a few hours. Apart from that, these notes are also helpful just before the last few minutes of the exams. 4. Do not hesitate to ask for help Majority of students does this mistake. I don\u2019t why they always have hesitation while asking the help from the teacher. The students need to take help from the teacher. Even intelligent students also look for help from the teacher. Because the students can\u2019t cover everything about the topic without taking help from the teacher. It is quite common for tough subjects. You should ask for help from your teachers and your peers in the class. It helps you to learn more about the topic and clear your doubts without much effort. Apart from that, you can also ask your parents for help if they can help you with the topic. Along with that, you can also ask them for the private tutor, who will help you to learn more about the topic. 5. Stay focused during your homework Focus is the key factor in how to get good grades. Lack of focus will not help you to good core grades; You need to be well focused during your homework. Did you know homework plays a crucial role in your academic scores? Homework helps you to get ready for the exams and learn more deeply about the topic. That\u2019s why you need to stay focused during your homework. Now the question is, how we can do that? The best answer to this question is to find a quiet place to do your homework. Remember that the place should be located in a distraction-free environment. There are some other factors too that create the distraction during your homework writing. Mobile devices are a major distraction for that. You should put your mobile phone aside. You can also put it into the silent or mute mode. Moreover, You can also use some apps that will lock your phone for a certain period. You can also do your homework with the help of some experts. Suppose that you need to have the statistics homework help. Then you can take the statistics homework help from the experts. They will help you to clear all your doubts more effectively. 6. Reward Yourself by taking the short brakes Majority of students don\u2019t give the importance to the brakes between the study. But remember that brakes work as an amplifier for your brain. If you do continuous study, then you may not get the good grades. Because continue study usually tied up the brain. That\u2019s why taking the short break always help you to refresh your body and brain. You should take a break within every 45 minutes during your study. The break should be as long as 15 minutes. During your break, you can walk around your house to get some fresh air. You should also drink some water to regain energy. Apart from that, you can also eat some snacks to fuel your body. It works as a reward for yourself and makes you more productive by doing something that you enjoy. 7. Prefer group study (If Possible) Sometimes group study works better than the self-study. The reason is in group study the members of the group help each other to motivate themselves and make them more productive. It also helps you to clear the doubts of each other if you find any trouble within the topic. Moreover, you can be sure that how much you have prepared for the exams. Because most of the time we assume that we study enough and get ready for the exams. But in reality, we may not be ready for the exams. On the other hand, in the self-study, there may not be any motivation for you. You need to motivate yourself. If the group study style suits you, then you should organize such groups. You can also do group study after class or on weekends. 8. Organize your study space In most of the cases, the students don\u2019t organize their study space. It is a common thing that perfect planning leads you to perfect achievement. You should organize your study space efficiently. You can do this manage all your books and stationery in one place. Don\u2019t you ever try to do not let your desk become cluttered with papers and stationery? Apart from that, you should also make separate notebooks for the separate subjects. Don\u2019t you ever try to make the notes on the same notebook for every topic? Because during the exam sessions, it will be overwhelming for you to study from that notebook. Also, remember that when you prepare for the exams. You should always have your notes and your books along with you at the same time. In this topic, I also talked about planning. You should plan your entire day and divided into small parts. Along with that, you can also write down the important dates for tests. 9. Develop a study schedule Scheduling your study is crucial to get good grades in your exams. Whenever you decide to study. Then you should divide your time into small chunks. Small chunks help you to prepare for the topic more effectively. Suppose that if you\u2019re preparing for the test, then you should divide your time into small chunks and put the small topic into these chunks. You should also manage the time as per the topic hardness. If the topic is hard enough, then you should give it more time, if the topic is easy enough then you should give it a little time. Majority of students were waiting for the last night to get prepared for the exams, but it is the worst strategy. Because no one can get good grades with a one-night study. 10. Take Care of Your health and stay fit Health is wealth for everyone, whether it is a student or a professional. Health is a crucial factor behind how to get good grades. You should take care of your health during the study. Don\u2019t you ever try to avoid food during the study? Because your mind and body need nutrients for study. Therefore you need to make sure that your meals are nutritious, balanced, and varied. Because It works as a fuel for your brain and makes it more productive. Never miss breakfast before school because breakfast provides you the necessary nutrients for study longer. 11. Sleep well It is often that the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep while studying for their exams. It is proven that sleep plays a crucial role in the performance of students. If the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep, then they may not be able to keep their focus during the class study and self-study. Our brain needs proper rest. Therefore sleep helps the brain to relax for a couple of hours. Moreover, it also recharges our body and makes it ready for the study. It has been proven that the students should take at least 8 hours of sleep each night. It also helps them to stay fit and active during their study. 12. Utilize Your Textbook Textbooks are quite helpful in getting good grades. Professors and teachers assign textbooks based on some reasons. The crucial reason behind this is, textbooks works as a supplement to the lectures and discussions of the class. You should buy all your textbooks to study about the topic.Read all the material of the assignment topic it will help you to get deep knowledge of the topic. You should read everything about the topic from opening vignettes to the case studies. Also, try to figure out which topic is most critical. Also, try to highlight the most important materials in the text. It will help you to prepare for the exams. Conclusion Getting good grades in exams is not an easy task. There are some other ways too that will help you to get good grades in your exams. If you will follow these tips on how to get good grades in exams. You should not only follow these tips to get good grades. But you should also try your best to get good grades. All these tips provided by the academics help experts.

Socialize with all your professors (greet them every lecture, go to their office hours, compliment their presentations, etc)Why? Professors are naturally inclined to give more tips and information to those he/she is fond of. It is a human nature. Use it.  Preview & Review (Preview the assigned pages prior to the lecture, and review them after; this is a lot more effective than cramming)Why? This is the fundamentals of success to college. Nothing wins over skimming over the material prior to the lecture, learn, and absorbing the information afterwards.   Do not procrastinate. That is not in your definitionWhy?

I had no business being there; I wasn't especially interested, I had no idea what I wanted to do, besides some half-baked ideas, and I majored in Fraternity.

About 10 years later, I decided to seek a second BA with the idea of getting a Master's so I could teach after I retired from the Sheriff's Office.

            "answer_text": "Getting good marks in any course is not different it actually only depends on ur hard work and attitude towards the subject. Basically what i mean is that what ever u r doing do it with ur ful devotion and up to the ful capacity Now coming to the points what u should do and how u should work on it : First of all i suggest u to b clear with ur concepts and all the basics so that the point of doubt dont remain.... and u dont have and kind of misconceptionOther thing i want to tell u is that what ever knowledge u gain should b logical and always try to find out the reason behind it which helps not only in ur theoretical part of ur subject.... but it will also help u on the part of vocationalisationWhat i mean here is that make ur self capable enough that u would b able to use ur concepts in ur job place and these should b learned in such a manner that i imparts u confidence .Next point on which i want to draw ur attention is on your preparation strategies...now what i mean here is that when u study during the normal course of ur class, just when u r given normal lectures during the class at that time u should go home revise them and have a very deep understanding of the topic. Even if fesible for u try to study it from some external source or from library this will help u to b clearOther thing on what i want to focus is on the habit of writing .... this the most essential thing required for any kind of success in any field or at any place the more u inculcate this habit the more u will b able to laern and retain.Now ill let u know know why i am so much concerned about this point... the reason is that when ever a person writes he actually gets to know his mistake and the the areas where he lacks .Writing helps u to learn and i have heard people saying what is the way to learn things the way is write and learn even if it is a practical subject or a theory one just give ur best and learn it by writing ..... therefore note making is the best process for any one to excel in any field or even if it is in reading news paper because that helps u to retain it more than a normal person can retain in his memoryOther than this writing any sort of thing helps u grab more confidence so u will have more confidence while giving ur examsI want to tell this from my persaonal experience i was also an average student but once i read a blog which actually taught me that writing seriously can make u far Better than what u r. Even if u dint have any thing to write just start writing a small sort of paragraph about ur life or about what have u read this make ms u realise what is u remembering power and how much was the part u have got correct... try this activity u will seriously like it. And when after sime time u will read ur own stuff u will feel happy just the way as i feel nowNow moving one next thing i would like to tell u is that u should make use of some examples to memorize the topic which will fit in ur memory just like glued block.Now coming up to your exam time when u have practiced the above mentioned points it will b the most easy thing for u to appear in ur exam..... but remember never b overconfident.Always b in touch with ur syllabus and u know what ur writing habit will also help u to write a brilliant answer in exam . As well as ur deeper understanding of the topic will help u just to brush up topics on the final day and u will definitely excelAll the best dear",

            "answer_text": "I have found that setting goals can result in incredible behaviour change. Getting a good grades at college boils down to three factors: Consistency: Highly underrated trait, but to really do well at college, you need to consistently put in the effort. Chilling in one semester, or even a course will not cut it. It needs effort day in, day out.Prioritization: You will have a ton of things to do. You need to pick your battles, and you can\u2019t do everything. You need to prioritize, almost maniacally.Time Management: Even if you\u2019re consistent and prioritize well, you need to manage your time. Devote time to personal well being and health, apart from academics. Trying to do any more is likely impossible.It is interesting that if you angle for a good grades,you begin to learn these skills. I call college a microcosm of life, in acceleration, because these are the very skills that really help you lead a happy, enriched life. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of other good advice given.  Here's my answer. Let's work backwards.  To get a good grade, you need to do well on the final exam.  Starting a few weeks before a final exam, I will start to assemble all of the course materials in one place (or folder).  I will then make a list of all the topics covered in the course that will be on the final.  From there, I make sure to thoroughly understand every topic.  I usually need to pay extra attention those that I don't like, since otherwise I would be tempted to skip it.   If I didn't understand a topic the first time, then lectures/the textbook may have simply not explained it well and I will try to find the same material in another textbook or even better online.  There is a huge wealth of knowledge on the internet, and you can use it to learn more thoroughly and efficiently. The best way to learn specific topics is often through practice--especially true for science courses.  I will search out practice problems from the textbook and internet.  Practice exams are often the most helpful.  I will take as many practice exams as I stand or have time for. The final is not the only graded part of a course.  It generally a good idea to go class--even if you are not learning anything from lecture, spend the time reading the textbook.  Then you will not fall behind the course, probably learn the material better, and also hear important announcements.  To do homework, work with other students, get help from the TAs or professor, and start early.   For midterms I use the same strategies as for the final.  Even if you screw up a midterm, professors almost always count the final more heavily especially if you ask them.   Its even better to go the office hours for discussing course material and getting help when you don't understand something.  Professors want their students to learn and succeed.   Summary (this time in chronological order from beginning of semester): 1) Go to all classes.  Even if you don't learn from lecture, read the text during class. 2) Do all HW and do it well.  This way you'll learn and stay on track. 3) Get help from classmates, TAs, and you professor.  They want you to succeed and can explain topics in new ways. 4) Study hard for exams.  Make a list of all important subjects for each exam.  Know each subject and the types of problem relevant to each well.  Use other resources, and practice, practice, practice.  Find as many outside practice problems/tests as you can. Hope you find that helpful!  This is generally my philosophy toward to my coursework, and I would say its served me well. ",

            "answer_text": "I answered this question previously. Here is my previous answer: How I Study to Learn WARNING: This will not prepare you for exams. See the next section. This is the technique that I have developed that works for me. I enjoy a little bit of chaos and I learn by reading better than most people (find out your own learning style). I also generally learn things by myself so I rarely get to study in a group which is something I miss and would recommend if you can find a good study group. I also don\u2019t have the luxury of a fixed time I can study since I have young children and work full time. Setup I make a list of different things I am trying to learn.I find multiple sources that teach exactly the same concept in different formats or different authors. (Textbooks, Books, Websites, YouTube, Online Courses)I try to have a big project of some type that uses what I am learning.Now I have:Multiple concepts to studyMultiple resources for each conceptA project that covers multiple concepts.Study I have my list of resources to go through and I either pick one at random if I have not studies for a while or cycle through them. Then I follow the same procedure: Study the material.If it is too hard go back to easier material or\u2026If it is too easy skip forward.If it is boring or if I am finding it hard to focus go to the next resource.If I feel like I have made significant progress then work on my project and apply what I have learnt.If I finish a resource or finish the part of the resource that I care about I take it off my list and put it in an archive area for later on.Repeat until I run out of time.The aim is not learn everything the first time through (you will probably only remember 25% of it if you are lucky) but to generally understand it. By learning the material multiple times from different sources you increase the amount you retain overall and can apply. There are diminishing returns from doing the same thing multiple times so I generally only have about 3 resources that cover the same thing. Generally you will go over the same concepts again as you cover advanced concepts so I try not to stress about it. Exam Preparation WARNING: This is of limited use if you do not know what you are doing. Preparing for exams is completely separate from learning something. To prepare for an exam you are trying to prepare for the edge cases / obscure questions. To learn something you are trying to learn the general cases. I think preparing for an exam is generally a waste of time / inefficient if you don\u2019t understand what you are being examined on. Focus on learning it first (a long time before the exams) then closer to the exams focus on preparing for the exam. First of all you need to get at least one of the following from best to worst: The Syllabus (What the course is supposed to be about)Rubric (How the assessment is supposed to be marked)List of topics. (What will be in the exam)You may have noticed that your teacher\u2019s advice is NOT on this list. Never rely on your teacher. They are human and make mistakes. You need to take control of your education and be proactive. This does not mean that you should not listen to them. They will give great advice BUT don\u2019t rely on them. This applies to university as well as school. Go through the list and make a list of things: You think you know. Then give yourself a short assessment on them to see if you actually do know them. If you fail the assessment move them into list 2 (below).A list of things you sort of know.A list of things you don\u2019t know at all.You can largely ignore list 3 for the moment. People learn concepts faster if they are related to things we already know. This means that focusing on things you sort of know will: Get you higher marks. A mark is a mark.Make study faster since you will learn these concepts faster.Make study easier since you already sort of know them.Generally things are related so as things move from list 2 into list 1 it will also move some things from list 3 into list 2.Things in list 3 are basically a failure to learn a concept. Take them and go back and learn those concepts (See How I Study Learn). So how do we quick learn things in list 2? Generally they are edge cases, facts that you need to remember or processes you need to apply. Here is what I do: Facts / Edge cases: Flash Cards using a SuperMemo system. You can use the app or use 3 piles. (current, recent, archive)If a card is correct 3 times (I use pencil marks) move it to recent.Once your current pile starts to get smallish go through recent. If any of them are wrong move them to current and reset the counters. The ones you get right move to archive.Once every now and then go through as many archive as you can stand before you get bored. If you get any wrong move them to the current pile.Process: I find example problems (past exams are great) and solve them. Question with solutions are often hard to find so make sure you don\u2019t cheat yourself. If you need a worked example try to go back to a previous answer you have seen and use it to check your process. You can never unsee an answer.Hopefully you will have notices that this is a generic process that you can use to learn anything and you can use it forever. This is called lifelong learning. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey. Thanks for the question.  Honoured to receive Gold Medal\ud83c\udfc5at ECE, NIT Surat! I've always aspired to be best at everything I do. This spirit and thought leadership encouraged me to strive for excellence in my undergraduate college (NIT Surat). Starting from first semester to the last, I employed the following techniques to secure good grades: Maximize attention & retention in class- It was always my first priority to clear and strengthen concepts/fundamentals at the very first attempt while being taught in class. I prepared notes extensively during the class itself, and also always focused attention towards grasping and remembering as much as I could.Frequent brief revision- Not to leave critical portions to the last hour before exam, I briefly revised them once a fortnight to stay in touch with the content and numericals. I used to identify important questions and numericals while reading from the book or presentation for the exam and revise them again during exams.Effort variability- Every semester, I would use the first few days (~2 weeks) to figure around the difficulty and subsequent comfort level of the subject. Once identified, I would focus on difficult subjects more and schedule easier ones during times/moments/days when I felt discouraged or not wanting to study. This way, I ensured proportionate focus on all subjects for consistent results.Exam pattern & expectation- Ensuing from my class experience and previous year papers, I tried to always understand what concept is tested in a variety of tests across all subjects. This way, I knew really what to expect and eventually intelligently prepared.Focus on laboratory and project work- I always exerted myself to understand the application of various concepts through practicals and projects. It is often difficult to maintain motivation consistently, but atleast knowing the eventual deliverable and the enablers required is important towards finishing the same. Taking initiative is of utmost importance, undoubtedly.Time management- It was always important to me that I strike a balance between college PORs, academics and extracurricular endeavors. Being able to manage time and orient efforts efficiently is extremely important to doing well in one's UG college.Really hope this is helpful! Let me know if you need any further help. :D   ",

            "answer_text": "It's possible for anyone to get good grades in college as long as you learn to develop study skills; but it also depends on how much you're interested in the subject at times. Studying a subject that isn't your favorite (or that you aren't naturally interested in) can be more challenging to learn than studying certain subjects that interests you naturally or you're naturally good at learning.  For instance, in the past, I had to take and pass a college algebra class to fullfill a college requirement. Math was never my favorite subject, but I can do the basics an can remember some elementary thru intermediate algebra. I struggled very much in college algebra class, and even tried asking my professor or another professor for help. I believe this was like an introduction to calculus. So, I only got a \"C\" as my final grade. However, I was able to get \"A\" grades in other classes. If you really want to get good grades, you should always aim for an \"A\" grade or at least a \"B\" grade and study hard.  Suggestions to help get good grades for traditional classrooms: - Get to class a few minutes early or on time on the first day and the rest of the semester.  - Attend classes regularly, because the professor typically provide lectures on new topics every class; and you don't want to miss this part, because the professor may mention something important in the class that's not in the textbook. - Read the syllabus, especially the important course information, including class work /homework deadlines, professor contact number,  other resources, etc. - Write notes during lecture in class. - Participate in class discussions, and ask the professor questions especially if you need clarification on something. - Read the assigned chapter readings before the next class. Complete any assigned homeworks on time.  - Having some good time management and organization skill to organize your calendar for assignment deadlines, midterm or final exam dates. - Usually the professor would give a study guide for final exam, and this can help you to review and study the important topics. - Go to tutoring lab in your college if there's one available for your subject,  and if you need extra help in certain areas. Lab tutors usually provide help in Math subjects, English, grammar/ writing, proofreading, reading, and computers.  Online classes are somewhat different, require more independence, and can be more challenging than traditional classrooms as well; but same skills are also required to get good grades. ",

            "answer_text": "In high school, you could pull out your notes a couple of hours before the test, look at them, and get a 100 without really studying at all. In college, if you have a rigorous major like science, you can't do that. You need to do pre- and post- class work. Pre work: What will you be learning tomorrow? Read ahead in the book tonight. You already understand some, and you know what you don't understand. Unless you go to a lecture hall type of school, you are in a classroom and can ask questions. When that topic comes up, don't be afraid to ask your questions. If you are still lost, ask one of your lab group/ study buddies if they get it. If so, have him/her explain it. Maybe a peer explanation will resonate with you better than the teacher's. Also, it will help your friend realize what the gaps in his/her knowledge are. I did my Master's Thesis on this. I called it: Peer Tutoring and the Tutor Learning Effect. You will be helping out your friend, too! Post work: Review notes every night. Internalize what you understand and prepare questions on what you don't understand. After your post work is done, do your pre work for tomorrow! It is a lot of work, but my students get straight As so it works! ",

But i tend to take it in my own version that is the examinner knows nothing. There are two steps you need to follow to get good grades but i have never cared nor got good grades ever. First you need to know the content and as i can see you want best grade you probably have good information base. The most important is knowing the examination and how best to attempt it. How i give my examination is the first step i get the paper i just go through all the questions throughly and finish what i know in a goof way and fast. That way i have time to brainstorm for the unknown questions. I usually finish way too early probably in 1/3 rd of time .but you want good grades so go slowly and throughly. ",

I underlined and wrote in the margins.2. I seldom missed class. I  showed up sick, I showed up when I had to shovel three feet of snow to get to my car.3. I took good notes. I take shorthand, and if I wanted to I could have transcribed the entire class. But I was selective  and copied important points. After class I typed up my notes.4. I paid attention to what the professor was saying and how he was saying it. I looked for what was emphasized, repeated or written on the board.5. I am interested in memory techniques like Loci, Chaining and Pegging. I memorized the material as I went. I made sure to learn each day and each week\u2019s material. I did not cram before tests. I already had earlier material memorized.  6. I played classical music during study sessions. Today I listen to \u201cstudy and relaxation\u201d music on youtube while I am reading. writing or memorizing. 7. I take deep breaths before and during learning sessions. Conscious, deep regular breathing helps me to sleep and to study.8. I used affirmations. Everyday I looked in the mirror and told myself how smart I am.9. I was a vegetarian then and i am a vegan now. Eating right is important too. ",

I will assume you mean the latter (based on the traditional scale). So really, you\u2019re probably talking about an A or A+. Step 1) Go to 100% of the classes. Step 2) Sit in the front of the class. Step 3) Take copious notes and keep them all in one place. Step 4) Develop a rapport with the teacher. Step 5) Contibute to class discussions (avoid being \u201cthat person\u201d who doesn\u2019t shut up, though; there\u2019s a happy medium). Step 6) Do ALL assigned work to the best of your ability. If an assignment falls short (by a low grade), meet with the teacher and find out how to improve for the next one. Step 7) For all upcoming tests and quizzes study with a partner and/or a group. Step 8) Discuss the material of the class outside of class. And use supplementary materials to enhance what you are learning. Step 9) When taking the tests, try and take your time and give it 100% effort. I am convinced that if you do all of these things, you will get the highest grade possible. Good luck! ",

My dad knew I was scared about going to college, thinking I would not make it.  No lectures, no long speeches, he just said, \"I made all A's by doing only one thing: never get behind.  Do today's work today.  If you have a M-W-F class,  don't wait until Tues to do the work assigned Mon.  Research papers have to be planned by dates, then do all the work by those dates.  College is easier than high school in that it is more objective, but it is harder in that the work just keeps coming and will bury you if you get behind.  Stay current, and it will be easy.\" He was right.  I never thought about whether I was working hard or not.  I just did what I had to do on each day to keep current at that point in time.  Social things were determined by that, not the other way around.  I found that I worked much less on weekends than my friends had to, and I never had to cram for an exam.  Grades were great, life was good.  Most stress free time of my life. So, just one sentence: Do today's work today. ",

            "answer_text": "I think I have a high enough GPA for me to answer this with some credibility. The following are things I usually do that I have seen other people with high grades do as well: 1. MAKE A SCHEDULE. 2. MAKE A SCHEDULE. Yes, it's that important. Schedules of when your exams are, when assignments are due, when you plan to study for a specific course during the week - they all help reduce stress and increase productivity. Planning ahead = less cramming = better understanding of concepts, with better grades as a by-product. 3. WRITE WHAT YOU LEARN. I have consistently noticed that when I don't write down information I just learnt about, I forget them ridiculously fast. Writing also helps you notice intricate details in math problems, word choices in definitions etc. which increase your comprehension of the topic. 4. PROCRASTINATE. Yes, please do procrastinate, but \"efficiently\". Give yourself breaks to do the things you want to do (like watching that new episode of \" Sense8\"). Give yourself rewards for hitting your goals (which you listed in your schedule obviously!!), and it will help you relax. 5. DON'T GO IF YOU DON'T NEED TO. I am talking about lectures, tutorials, help sessions etc. I have seen a lot of people attending every single thing their school calendar lists out. I personally think that it's better to study at home  than go to the latest tutorial if you are ten lectures behind. Use your time how YOU want, based on YOUR needs. 6. APPLY YOUR UNDERSTANDING. You just learnt this really cool concept in your calculus course, but have you tried relating that knowledge to what you are learning in your signals course? Making stronger connections across courses boosts your understanding of the concept, so always try to look at a bigger, better picture. That's all I can think of right now. But the above should be a good guideline, one I try to follow very rigorously. ",

Track down the tutoring center on campus whenever you need help, need a refresher on something or just want to review before a big test.If there is no tutoring center, then suggest to the campus to create one. In the mean time, you could ask your professors to recommend resources for study help.Talk to someone in the major you need help inAs mentioned above, professors can help when needed.But also, you could try making some friends with other people. Those in the same major (or even same class) could be potential study buddies/study group-mates. Pick a time & place, sit down together and study! Alternately, you may have a class with other majors in there and you could find someone in the major you need help with. You could ask nicely for help or recommended tips/resources.Cater to your study styleThere are psychological tests online, in doctors offices, etc that can tell you what kind of student you are. Are you a visual, audio or hands-on learner? Do you study well in a quiet place or somewhere bustling? Find your study habits so you can set yourself up to a good study session (ex: if you\u2019re a visual learner who hates noise, study with flashcards in the library)Peppermint oilWeird little tip but this REALLY helped me out during exams and some other people I know like it. Peppermint oil has a strong tie with concentration and memory. Try sucking on some candies made with peppermint oil. If you can\u2019t stand the taste, then buy some peppermint oil fragrance and put a little on your hands, then sniff.Stay hydrated, exercise 30 min a day (3\u20134 times per week) and get enough sleepStereotypical advice but GOOD advice nonetheless. Your brain won\u2019t be able to learn if your body is falling apart. Healthy body, healthy mind.Also research suggests that people have a better study session after they\u2019ve settled down from a work out. Blood\u2019s pumping to the brain, less energy to make you fidget, oxygen circulating, that kinda stuff happening.",

Finish every reading assignment With that, the rest will come easy. But the key is understanding grading. For example, letter grades for projects and exams mean nothing \u2014 at least at Cal. State Long Beach \u2014 because final grades are calculated from a pool of points, and each project and exam is worth a different number of points. To start, calculate the number of points you need to earn an A, which is 90 percent of the total number of points available. Then gauge how many points you need on each project as the semester or quarter moves along. Don\u2019t waste your time translating the points you earned on projects and exams into letter grades. They mean nothing. The only thing that matters is the number of points you earn at the end of the semester or quarter. For example, if you bork a project early in the semester that earns 10 of 20 points, that would translate to an F. But the final grade in the class is based off a larger pool of points, say 600. So you lose those 10 points \u2014 big deal. You can make them up later easily, so don\u2019t get bogged down in the minutia. Focus on the big picture. By the time the end of the semester rolls around, you should know exactly what you need to earn an A. Sometimes you might need to do extra credit or work extra hard on your final project. Other times you might have so many points you won\u2019t need to take the final exam \u2014 happened to me twice. But if you look at the big picture \u2014 the total point allocation \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to create a study strategy that fits your situation, which is how you maximize time in the end-of-semester crunch. Additionally, use in-class note taking as a filter; take notes of the important stuff and leave out the rest. Thinking critically like that in-class will help you absorb the material and take better notes. Also, rewrite what the teacher says in terms that make sense to you \u2014 your notes don\u2019t always have to be verbatim. Finally, take classes that interest you. Sometimes a stinker is required \u2014 take it online, if possible. But when given a choice, take classes you like. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, motivation is everything. If you can\u2019t get yourself to work, you\u2019re lost. Keeping a diary about when you go to bed, when you get up, when you use multimedia and when you work for college helps a lot (in the longterm, it doesn\u2019t change your way immidiatly, but helps getting good habits). Maybe wright down why you have to get the grades and what would happen if you don\u2019t. Get your sleep. Sleeping is CRUCIAL for good study performance, better study 2 hours less and sleep 2 more.Spread the work. You\u2019ll have to spend much less time if you study from time to time, instead of everything before your important moment.Go to the courses, but damn listen and think about what is said, rather than note everything down and remembering nothing. It\u2019s only a fool that goes to the courses and doesn\u2019t remember anything afterwards. Learning starts in the lecture, not afterwards.Make connections with what you already know. You basically remember things by making associations with things you already know. For example, in lectures I always think of words when seeing a formula (have some imagination) and I can remember 90% afterwards. It\u2019s pretty effective, but don\u2019t force it, it must be spontanious.Study 30\u201360 minutes a session and take a 5\u201310 minute break. Only when making exercices you could do some more time in one session, but more than 90 minutes is always a waste of time, ALWAYS. (Don\u2019t be a library fool, drinking redbull and sitting for 3 hours on the desk). You\u2019ll have to STAND UP when taking the break, and don\u2019t youtube, just please don\u2019t.And one thing: please don\u2019t read your textbook, it\u2019s not a novel. You\u2019ll have to THINK about it and try to repoduce it. That way you\u2019ll learn much quicker. Before a 40 min session you should take a 5 minute sneakpeak at what you\u2019re going to do. Looking through the pictures, highlighted text, the titles. It should help you remember (no, didn\u2019t invented this at the spot, research has proved it).You might consider trying some sports, as it will improve your mental abilities as well. A healthy spirit in a healthy body. And some healthy food, well chips is allowed, but take some omega-3 capsules as well.Damn take some free time too. College should be a good time. When studying too hard, you\u2019ll do worse. Our professor said: 2 days of doing nothing during the week (monday to friday) at least.Don\u2019t be a fool and make summaries or highlight. You can highlight or make a summary when learning, but don\u2019t just go through the textbook specially for it, because it takes a lot of time for retaining very little.Using the same pen for studying the course and taking the exam will improve your ability to remember. As well as using a strong perfum while studying and the same while taking the text. And change sometimes from study enviroment, instead of always studying home, go an afternoon to the library, or sit for some hours at another desk, as it will improve your learning.Don\u2019t forget, imagination is the key to everything.Hope this gets you somewhere, and I apologize for my errors, as English is not my native language. Good luck and damn just think about what you can achieve!!!!",

So I did the opposite (except for being relax). Relax: One of the thing that most people forget is this. If you are stressed, you tend to get very distracted to other things than the subject and also tend to forget things easier. Just don't get too relaxed.Never procrastinate on revising or studying: Well I find some people gets good grades when they procrastinate, but the problem is that they might not understand things (because they are likely to copy whatever what they study) at last minutes. When people don\u2019t understand enough, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to explain properly when they come across a question they never know.Don\u2019t become a revision zombie: This links back to the first and second point. One of the reason I wrote not to procrastinate on revising or studying; gives you more time to relax since you have more free time to do.You don\u2019t have to be great to start: If you think that you need those damn-expensive-practice-book-or-something-related, its not really required. You could use plain papers and make up some questions for yourself (and the best questions are probably the ones you don't understand). You could even place sticky notes everywhere in your house with some random info. It makes no difference if you have the damn-expensive-practice-book-or-something-related. You have everything what you need.",

That said, no matter what method you used, it is simply ineffective because you are just trying to remember stuff from whatever notes you wrote or material you watched. The key idea is to have a sense of direction in your studies where you know exactly where you need to study each time in your study session. This will allow you to study to understand instead of studying to remember. Start by setting certain times on certain days that you should be studying. This allows you to be more organized in planning your studies, play time and work. Now I am not talking about a school timetable or a daily timetable where you have to follow every hour of it. What I am talking is that you have to pick certain hours of certain days that you MUST be studying/preparing for exams. Example: Back in my studying days, I have always allocated Monday 11am - 1pm, Wednesday 8pm - 10.30pm and Saturday 9 am to 11.30 am, all with a 15 minute break in between, for studying time. This allows me to be very organized in knowing how much time I need each time to do my studies every week. A three hour long studying time with a 15\u201320 minute break is appropriate. Do not plan or attempt to study continuously for more than 3 hours at a time because you will eventually become disengaged. In the last 10\u201315 minutes of each studying time, you need to do some reflection. This involves you reflecting back on what you have studied or what you have learned and what you still need to learn or perhaps what topics that you may require your lecturer or your classmates to help you. Thus, a reflection after each study session gives direction on where you have learned and where you still need to improve on learning. This will allow you to plan your next studying session that focus more on the topics that you need to improve. So naturally you are constantly focusing on improving rather than reading an entire book or memorizing stuff. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are struggling with grades and interested in raising your grade point average, take a close look at these 10 tips for getting better grades. 1. Attend every class If you want good grades in college, you must attend every class, not almost every class. The importance of regular class attendance cannot be overemphasized. When you miss classes, you miss lectures, notes, discussions, explanations, and assignments. Do not think that missing a class won\u2019t make a difference. You cannot make up what you miss. 2. Master Your Professors Every professor has a different personality and system for running his/her classes, so it makes sense as early in the semester as possible to learn what the professor wants. Here are some ways to master your professors: Understand course expectations. Most professors give out a class syllabus during the first week of classes \u2014 and it is your responsibility to know deadlines and all the requirements for the course.Understand professors on personal level. Rather than viewing the professor as some figurehead at the front of the class who decides your fate in some abstract way, get to know your professor as a person. Visit him or her during office hours, or stay after class.Communicate with professors when you are struggling. Especially at larger colleges and universities, the professor won\u2019t know when you are struggling, so if you are having problems with the course work or the tests, schedule an appointment to meet with the professor and get the help you need.3. Be organized: Use a student planner: take this to each class and record all assignments. Also use your planner to keep track of tests and quizzes, activities and appointments.Break down assignments: large assignments are more manageable if you break them down into smaller parts. Completing these smaller portions over a longer period of time will allow you more time to focus.Use three-ring binders for class notes: this type of note book works well because handouts can easily be inserted and if you end up missing a class you can also insert a copy of someone else\u2019s notes where they belong.Organize and save computer work: make sure that all your work on the computer is saved and saved often, and that you have back up files.4. Use Time Wisely Even if you do not procrastinate and are the most organized person in the world, time can be one of your biggest enemies in college. Here are some tips for using time wisely: Don\u2019t overextend yourselfBe organized: see number 2 above!Schedule 90 minute study sessions: set a specific time to get your studying done and make sure you will not be interrupted. During these study sessions, don\u2019t do anything else but study!Make \u2018to do\u2019 lists and prioritize tasks: make a daily list of the things you need to do. Rate each item as an A (must do today), B (should do today), or C (would like to do today, but can wait). Listing and prioritizing your tasks only takes a few minutes but it is a great way to organize your time. Focus on one task at a time until everything is completed5. Take Good Notes: tests usually cover materials that the instructor has presented in class. Therefore, it is important to have good class notes. Be an active listener: when your actively listening, your not just hearing the words, but you are also thinking about and trying to understand the information being presented.Taking notes can help you pay attention and stay focused.Recognize important information: anything the instructor writes on the board is important. In your notes, underline or star the most important information so you can pay special attention to it when studying.6. Know How to Read a Textbook: Knowing how to scan, read and review will make it much easier for you to understand and remember what you read. Scan: scanning gives you a quick overview of the material you\u2019re going to be reading. To scan, read the title, subtitle, and everything in bold and italic print. Look at the pictures, captions, charts, graphs, and read the introduction, the summary and the review questions. Read: when your reading has a purpose, you have a reason to stay focused and your comprehension improves. Review: to review, first ask yourself \u2018what is the main idea\u2019 and then go back to the beginning and go through the same process you did when you scanned the material. This time, as you scan restate the main idea of each passage using your own words. 7. Study Smart: Students who study smart find themselves spending less time of studying and still getting better grades. Find a good place to study: make sure the area is free of distractions.Know your learning style: we all learn differently! Some learn best by seeing the material (visual learner), some learn best from hearing the material (auditory learner), and some learn best by doing (kinesthetic learner). As a rule, the more senses you involve and the wider variety of methods you use while studying, the more you remember.Organize your study time: before you begin, make a plan. Decide exactly what you want to get done. Always allow more time than you think you will need and prioritize your work to make sure that you have enough time for the things that are most important. Do difficult tasks first while you are most alert and fresh and remember to take regular short study breaks.9. Be a Good Test-Taker Just about all college classes have exams, and sometimes the exams are the major portion of your final grade, so it\u2019s important to become a good test-taker. Here are some hints: Know what to expect on exams. Every professor has a style of test development, so obtain old copies or ask the professor directly. Know the types of questions that will be asked \u2014 as well as the content that will be covered.Read questions carefully and plan answers. Take your time at the beginning of the test to read through all the instructions and make a plan of attack.Pace yourself so you have plenty of time to complete all parts. And know the point v alues of questions, so you can be sure to complete the most important ones first in case time does run out.Ask questions. If you don\u2019t understand something, or need clarification of the question, ask the professor. Don\u2019t wait to get the exam back and find you answered a question the wrong way.Here are some tips I think it may help you a lot to get good grades in college. Yet, each one has their own style of learning, there are no fixed rules in learning. Find yourself anyway suitable and sufficient to your own. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually the best people to ask are 1) your teachers, 2) students making good grades. You should be reading and doing homework on a regular basis. Other than that I can only tell you how to learn and write more effectively. That should help your grades. 1) The best way to learn, is to teach someone else what you are trying to learn. 2) Create tests for the subject. Most students stick with memorization and their \u201cdifficult\u201d questions concern unnecessary details. Create knowledge application and problem solving questions. 3) Condense the information into the briefest form you can and still recall what it is about. One day before the exams review notes. take a small 3 X 5 card and write down everything you think you should know for the exam, but do not know. 4) Convert data that must be memorized into visuals. My daughter had this book with picture images of all the state capitals.

When it comes to writing, I\u2019ve described how to organize writing, without making it dry and boring, in my blog. Deciding on a direction There are other things that go into grades besides how well you do on papers, projects and tests. Teachers and other students would know what these additional expectations are. ",

            "answer_text": "This is effectively how we studied during undergrad and college and applies practically for all liberal arts degrees. 1/ Make friends with all students on your course. Yes I mean all of them from day one, this might be or seem hard to do but you'll realise why later. 2/ Collect everyone's essays (good grades, bad grades, in between, terrible grades). 3/ Read and dissect all of the essays understand why things were marked positively or negatively, start looking at writing styles 4/ Spend time with all your course mates and help them / share the information about what is working or not working across the board 5/ Produce a checklist of what to do / not to do in essays and exams going forward, distribute this to everyone on your course, they will love you for it. You will be able to quickly and clearly identify patterns, writing styles and techniques that broadly cannot be \"copied\" but applied using your own voice, form and tone. 6/ Make friends with students on your course but one or two years ahead. Repeat steps 2 - 5 What this does is help you identify upfront how to spend time and resources in order to do the best and maximise for grades. This will save you time / energy and also let you pursue other interesting activities at College. It is not all about the grades even if it can feel like it. The above advice is not to be abused, do not start blatantly ripping off other peoples work, plaigarism is the biggest academic sin. You also need to find your own writing style, studying habits and build good relationships with professors for references and career advice post-graduation. Good luck! ",

You aren't in competition, and between a group of 5-10 of you, you can cover so much more academic ground, and share the main details with each other. Swap notes, essays, discuss it over coffee. The way the system typically works in the UK (in Arts subjects) is that you cover many aspects of a course and are tested on different bits in different ways throughout the year - i.e. you can do your coursework on x and y, and answer your final exams on a different topic. If you did x and your friend y, why not swap before the exam so you can learn from each other? My best lecturer at university constantly drilled this into me and made it clear that for large and complex courses there was no way we could learn enough by ourselves (possibly some of the brainiacs could for exam reasons, but in general not enough for any of us to satisfy real academic thirst ), but if we worked together everyone would win. At the end of the year he was investigated for cheating after over 90% of the class got the highest grade. Professors from other universities spent weeks double and triple marking our exams, and they all found that the spectacular results weren't down to generous marking but down to great learning and a deep understanding of the course.

Do your prerequisites in the suggested order!Really master the English comp classes, most of your upper division classes will require a research paper.  What was an unbelievable chore as a freshman became a breeze as a senior.  When I could crank out a paper in 2 weeks rather than half a semester, I got much better grades.Use pre-session and summer classes.  I found that concentrating on one subject for 4 weeks was far more effective than 5-6 subjects over a whole semester.  I learned the material better, got better grades and graduated sooner.  I once took a 2 week pre-summer session class.  It was 8 hours per day, the mid-term was the first Friday, the paper was due and the final exam the next Friday.  The second Monday was a holiday; I spent the 3 day weekend writing the paper.  If you do nothing but one subject for 12 days, it's amazing how much you retain.If your school offers video classes, use them for things outside your major.  You can watch the videos while resting or eating and read the chapters the night before the monthly in-class test.  If the videos are available for download, DVD, or tape (showing my age), watch the video for the next week before the test, it often contains a review of the test!",

Your primary reason for going to college is to get your degree and depending on what your academic background was in high school, what you want to major in in college, how fast you learn, and how much time you 're willing to put in to studying determines your level of success. You as an individual have to be willing to put in whatever amount of study time that you need to to make good grades. According to \"Has College Become a Riskier Investment?\" in Econ Focus, third Quarter, 2013, by Renee Haltom, there is a 50% drop out rate of student across the nations college campuses because they're not willing to put in whatever amount of study time they need to to make good grades. You also need to be aware that the decades old high school diploma is being gradually replaced in the United States labor market by the 4 year college degree.

            "answer_text": "Most of my experience is within the American college/university sphere. It\u2019s very hard to tell you how to get high grades because everything depends on the individual professor. Keep in mind that most American college grades come out twice a year, at the end of each semester. The professor has one semester to teach, which is about a 4-month period, more or less. He/she may choose to give one final exam, which counts for entire grade. Or there may be two papers due, one at mid-semester, one at the end. Or maybe five tests and one presentation. It all depends, but as a general rule, there are fewer grades to count towards your average than in high school. If you don\u2019t understand the prof\u2019s expectations, the first thing to do is visit him/her during office hours and ask for help and explanations. Attend every class, every extra session, and keep working hard. If you need general help (how to write a paper, how to prepare for an exam), most campuses offer a study center with people who can give you pointers. It\u2019s all on you to do your best and there aren\u2019t that many opportunities in a given semester. ",

I've got a book: The Academic god. In it, I learnt all I'm gonna share with you. Understand who you're lecturers truly are. What they'd expect from you in answering his exam questions.ROTE STUDY. Take this very seriously. ROTE means \u201cmemorization by repetition\u201d . The courses you'll offer per semester, no matter how voluminous or so many of 'em, they all can be stored in your memory through Rote Study. Here you gotta memorize your books as often as possible. This demands a great amount of discipline.You gotta study all over & over again until you get totally engrossed in and beyond (although closely connected) to the Course Outline. 3) You gotta if you'd want, DRAW UP A PERSONAL TIME-TABLE. Here, you set the time range to study that best suits your daily activities. This had helped a Good number of Academic Giants I've encountered. 4) Always have 1st hand info. On any assignment, Project, anything connected to your coursework. And more importantly, you get to PROMPTLY DO ALL ASSIGNMENTS & avoid copying your neighbor. This gives you TOTAL INDEPENDENCE & CONFIDENCE to excel in your exams even though you're sitting with your Dad as a mate. Lol 5) Study ahead in & out of session to grasp the Substance of your coursework for the next semester. This is gonna give you an edge over those who would be first timers to the class discussion. 6) Understand your body. How you assimilate, what to eat to help you stay up for long hours to study. You also have to know when to eat and what to eat. This is also very essential. For example, here in Nigeria, I love Garri & Soup very much, but I dare not eat it sound 5pm because it's so heavy and when I sleep, if be too heavy too get up. Even though I wake up, I'll be dizzy and I'll sleep again. But when I have just Bread & A gaseous drink, I'd wake up in 1 hr 30mins time. And I'll be greatly energized for the night shift. So it's SIMPLE! HOLD ONTO THESE AND YOU'LL BE AN EAGLE! Yours sincerely, Abam, Miracle. Rivers State University. ",

Since grades are everything in College, take responsibility for your grades in college, know when you need to study, have fun, hang out with friends, visit your professors, be awake at night, do your chores, etc. (more) ",

Good grades at school and college has nothing to do with how successful you\u2019re gonna be at your work. Schools which are preparing for your future job won\u2019t teach you how to do it. So it\u2019s pointless to concentrate on how to improve your grades. You can be a programmer(self thought) with high salary even with an elementary school if you can do the job. On the other hand if you have diploma for being a programmer and your only interest was to have high scores on your exams and nothing else most likely you\u2019re be bad at your job and you\u2019ll get sacked and nobody will hire you afterwards. What good is your diploma with high grades now? Believe me, I was there myself so I can tell you from my experience.. ",

Enough with showing off all-nighters. You won't be able to focus if you don't get your rest. Therefore, you can't memorize or remember as well which leads to bad grades. Use this site to calculate what time is best to go to bed. sleepyti.me  2. Social Media. It's tough not checking your phone every 30 seconds but once again, it wastes time. Better yet, it may waste time your taking away from sleep. Try this: Moment - Track how much you and your family use your phone on the App Store. There are other apps available but if you see just how much time you spend on your phone, it may motivate you to stop. Not completely, but try to check it after a certain time. Like 8:00. 3. Finally, the usual. Don't cheat. Don't wait until last minute. Instead, use the world of Quora to learn in a more interesting way. Most people on here can teach you what you are learning, just in a more fun way. All you have to do it ask. Use the search to see answers on how to study better or tricks to make complex mathematics easy. Now read this post over and over and over until it's drilled into you conscious.  Cheers! ",

Think about the factors that motivate you to perform at an academically high level, and set realistic goals that are challenging but attainable. A few ideas for academic goals include finishing every reading assignment before class, getting straight As in every class for one semester, pursuing extra credit assignments or keeping your grade point average above a certain level. Rewarding yourself is a great way to stay motivated. Rewards can include buying something for yourself or even going out to dinner with friends. You might even involve your parents as accountability partners who reward you for academic success. Despite the challenges you may encounter, such as difficult assignments or a low quiz grade, remember to stay committed. Instead of having a pity party when things go south, chart a path for future success and take action. ",

            "answer_text": "Don't think that reading something over and over again is studying Many students study by simply reading the material they are trying to retain over and over again. The thing is: that is really ineffective. If you read something over and over again you don't memorize the information but you rather just become more familiar with it. That means your brain tells you \"Oh I know this, I've read this before. This is easy.\" when repeatedly reading something. (As you can tell, I'm not a brain expert and this is oversimplyfied) Test Yourself Instead, test yourself on the material you want to memorize. Do that by just flipping the page or covering it up and then asking yourself \"What did I just read? What is the information I'm trying to retain?\"  If you want more tips on how to study better, check out Learn Studying.com - Learn To Study More Effectively And Improve Your Grades!  ",

            "answer_text": " \u201cHow to get good grades?\u201d \u2013 Students often struggle with this question when they sit to study. Sometimes it is hard to adjust to a new environment and score good grades. It is quite evident that every student does not study in the same way. Even the brightest students can find themselves academically underperforming. Make your presence known in the class Most students don\u2019t tend to participate or even skip their classes for one reason or the other. But you need to understand that your presence and attendance points can reap sweet fruits. One of the benefits of regularly attending all the classes is that you build a guiding relationship with your teachers which can have direct impact on your grades. Apart from this, it is equally important to be involved and make efforts in class discussions and debates. Justify buying all your Textbooks Have you ever wondered why are textbooks assigned? They are not for overloading your bag but for a major reason of helping you to score well. 90% of the question papers are set from the textbooks only. It definitely becomes easier during your exams if you have gone through the material of all the assigned textbooks. Therefore, it is important to use the outlining system to help understand the material. Merely reading and highlighting the material is just the minimum. To get the most of what you\u2019re reading, you should also take notes.

Remember that you're not going to college to earn grades; grades are just a way for professors and yourself to keep track of your progress. The reason you're going to college is to learn things, to acquire new knowledge and new skills.  So make it your goal to achieve this! Don't focus on your grades, but instead focus on how well you're doing in each class. Be honest with yourself: are you getting a thorough understanding of the subject? do you remember the material? can you work out (on your own!) the answers to typical homework questions? If you can do these things, you'll get good grades. If you can't do them, the good grades are meaningless. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A This question has been answer many time in Quora, so I am surprised that you didn't check out the many answers including my own. Study habits and hard work is how you get good grades in college. It is understanding what is expected and how you are being evaluation. The latter depends on how well you can learn from your instructors. It is a fact of life that some instructors are better than others. You can find out from other students who have taken the class or google the instructors name and see reviews. What I did to get my A's was to carefully select my course load. It is important that you don't take courses that demand a lot of \"lab time\" at one. You have only a limited amount of time outside of class. Since I was a math/computer science student, I took only two of those classes at a time. Filling in the rest with other courses. I also look for overlap between courses. It is easier to take required course that overlaps so can focus on the readings and assignments with less work, leaving more time for my major. As for as each class is concerned, I interviewed my instructors finding out what was expect as documented on the syllabi. I read all the material before going to lectures so the lectures were review and I took notes. I then review the notes and got help from the instructors in open office hours. I also found the best students and form studying groups with them where we went over the answers and prepared for the tests. This takes a lot of time, so I was in the library everyday usually until it closes, roughly 60 to 80 hours a week including lectures and labs. My solution was to getting good great was hard work. This may or may not work for you. Bottomline: Getting good grades is always to play to your strengths. ",

I'm going to tell you a story. In high school, I had an AP biology class, which was my favorite class I had ever taken. Why is this, because I learned a wealth of things, and so fast. This hasn't happen like that before in any other class. In the end, I got a C+ in the course, but I could explain back everything that I learned. Now in the same course, there was another kid, who looked like he as falling asleep, playing games, and goofing off, but he got an A.  In this case is learning better than the letter grade? Yes it is.  The secret to learning is to love the thing that you are being taught.  I'm not saying be a C student, but I'm saying a grade might not show people's learning gains. ",

Highlight things the teacher repeats (probably important) Get a study-buddy. Test each other. Get a tutor if you really need help understanding. Talk to your teacher.

            "answer_text": "Think of it as a job. A regular job with a 40-hour or more work week. How is that possible? You get classes for 16 or 18 hours per week (perhaps with couple of labs). How is that a full-time job? Because the person who is going to teach you the most in college is YOU. Unlike high school, where the teacher meets with you every day and guides you through the entire course, step by step, a college instructor will expect you to do a lot of the work of learning on your own. That is what your syllabus is about. At the first meeting of any class, you will receive a syllabus. It is a complete outline of the course, telling you what topics will be covered in each class or lab, when all papers are due and when tests and exams will be given. It also sets out the grading criteria, and tells you the office location and hours of the teacher. Each teacher will have a certain number of hours each week he/she is in the office available to answer questions from any student. If the teacher\u2019s office hours conflict with your schedule, the syllabus (or the teacher) will tell you how to go about setting up an appointment when you can meet. It will also list the required reading. And if you look, you will see a lot of required reading. The general rule in college is that for every hour you spend in class, you will be expected to spent an hour and a half studying outside of class. That is why a 16 hour class load is a full schedule: 16 hours in class plus 24 hours outside of class (16 x 1.5 = 24) totals to 40 hours total studying time, in other words, a full work week if you do it the way you should. So schedule yourself those hours of studying time. Get a week planner and lay out, each day, time for class and time for study. Designate which periods of study time will be used for each class. Decide where the best place to study for that class would be: your dorm room, the library reading room, a study room or lab. Then follow that schedule. When your dorm mates come by and say, \u201cLet\u2019s go out on the lawn and play frisbee,\u201d look at your schedule and say, \u201cNope, today I have to work on my (paper for my psych class, reading chapter 14 of Palmer and Colton for history, those calculus problems that are due tomorrow, etc.) There will be times when you will goof off and go play frisbee, that\u2019s okay if you remember that you will need to make up that time later. So play frisbee now, and write down in your schedule a time that you will make it up in the evening or on the weekend. Note: your college may have different expectations. If your college requires 20 hours of class time for a full load, then it expects you to study one hour on your own for every hour of class. If it requires only 12 hours a week. that means the faculty expect you to study between 3 and 3 and a half hours per class hour (to be precise, 3 and a third hours, or 3 hours, 20 minutes). You can find out the expectation of the college by looking at what it considers a full load, and realize that the expectation is that the average student in that college will work 4o hours or more every week on studying. One of the great benefits of this study plan is that it will eliminate a tremendous amount of last minute pressure. It won\u2019t eliminate it all. Sometimes things take more time than you expect and you end up in a rush, but if you stick to the schedule, you will find that happening less and less. It worked for me! ",

There is a popular saying, \"For however many hours you are in class, you have to spend double those many hours after class studying/reading\" While that might be a nice thought, it isn't really feasible in this day and age. What's a more reasonable approach that I tell my students is to just use a factor of 0.5x if you want to receive at least a B+ in my class. A typical student has me three times a week for two hours. That means that the student should spend at least one hour that day after class, reviewing all the notes for the class, and reading further chapters. This is if I didn't assign any homework, if I did, then obviously spend enough time to complete the work well. ",

It is critically important.  Did I mention go to class? Always go to class.  And, if you really, really want to do well, research the subjects beyond what you are reading in class. Form a study group. Work with your peers and learn from each other.  All of the above will not only help you \"get good grades,\" but also prepare you for the world post-college.  ",

Surrounding yourself will help as well to collaboratively achieve better grades. These skills will definitely help you with networking as you matriculate through your university. Lastly, apply yourself a lot more to studying and learning. Instead of studying a subject, actually learn that subject. I believe that this will help with the retention of information. ",

The biggest mistake student make is they keep reading reading and reading and complain \"I did so much and put so many hours in my work yet this is what I get\", and they stop pursing grades feeling dejected.  So the trick or moreover the truth is,  its not completely about reading its analysing! When you study remember its 70% analysing and 30% reading.  When you analyse  the more deeper you dig, the more deeper you dig the more better you remember stuff, the more better you can remember stuff the more you recall, and more better you recall, the more better you write! And when you write better, they have no choice other than to give you marks. Voila! you have your grades :) So remember the rule is 70% analysis and 30% reading!   ",

            "answer_text": "One study method I used consistently, as an undergraduate: I took detailed notes in lectures.  If I did not have another class following immediately, I went to the library or the union (usually, it was too far to return to my dorm room), and finished the notes right away.  I then read them over and abstracted them, for major themes, relation to the course readings, and areas that I did not understand. If I could, I reread the second version of these notes in the period immediately before class section meetings.  I made a short, scratch-paper list of topics to ask about in section, especially areas that I didn't understand.  I them brought these topics up in section, gaining the explanations that I needed, and a reputation for being interested and persisent (as well as, on occasion, dense, when it took me overlong to master a concept).  This is particulary important, since the graduate student teaching assistants have a great deal of influence over final grades, especially in large classes. For exam study, I went over my notes, including my notes on section discussions, ONCE, on the evening before the exam.  This worked well, especially for essay exams, which were the way the majority of my classes were evaluated.  These notes also fed into term papers, though in a less direct way, since research and synthesis, as well as referencing and bibliography, are more important for papers. I maintained the equivalent of a 3.2/3.4 GPOA as an undergraduate, and was, later, suvccessful in graduate studies. ",

Those classes don't respond to traditional techniques of study. For example, higher-level math and expository writing. You have to have some measure of ability to do well in these. School, however, is mostly about discipline not smarts. ",

This cuts down on studying things that won't appear and gives you time to master content that is sure to appear.Write these papers and then mark them. This will help you find answers and show you your mistakes. You should learn from them.Color/Colour People who use their right side of their brains more can study using colour. Use highlighters and colour pens to take notes.Facebook, Twitter , tumblr and instagram (I think, correct me on this one.) use blue as their colour. That is why you can spend so much time on them because blue is a soothing and calming colour. It's not harsh. Use a blue pen when writing your notes and exams papers.Recording Record yourself reading important concepts and notes. Listen to them wherever you go.You will end up mimicking yourself word for word on those notes.Laugh Before a test or exam I'd watch YouTube videos of puppies and kittens. I'd watch funny ones too just to laugh.There are also those videos that make you laugh till you cry. Those ones just help me relax. Writing an exam is stressful enough on it own. So, don't try and act composed, you are just making it worse by worrying. Laugh a little before a major exam.All the best. ",

Maybe everyone's doing it these days with iPads. I never saw anyone doing it in the 80's. Plan and enter in the calendar your study times in blocks and keep to the program. A paper timer is better, because you can \"check off\" your study times during which you are on task. Evaluate after week #1 if you're keeping up, or need to modify the schedule. Self monitoring (i.e., accountability) promotes performance. Get to work on term papers early. Really early. Right away early. This prevents the build up of anxiety, prevents rushing. Let's you do more reading. The more preparatory reading you do, the more those papers seem to write themselves. Exams? I could never cram. I started my review 10 days ahead of the exam. That way, I was nearly done by the time others were just starting. It also unnerved them to say \"I'm nearly done\" when they asked if I've started preparing. (I was competitive back then). Getting the jump on exam preparation really relieved test anxiety, as I just \"coasted\" up to the exams with a little light reviewing the last couple days, to make sure \"I still (had) it.\" Also, once in a while, there's the rude shock of realizing there's something you missed, or really don't understand -- better to find it a week before the exam than the night before hand. Doing these things took me from a B to an A student in university. Good luck in your studies. ",

You will be surprised how much more you will get done away from distractions. Ask questions during and after class. This will not only make class more enjoyable and interactive but will help you fill in the gaps of your learning. Get involved in a study group. Study groups help you focus on the specifics in the subject and can help illuminate your ignorances.  Don't be afraid to be wrong and be open with your study group. Actively try to find a note taking and study method that works for you. These strategies are not one fits all and what works well for one may not for another. One strategy I found that worked was reviewing my notes immediately after class and highlighting what I was not confident in. Hard work. It may seem like a cliche but hard work does often pay off in the end. ",

This will open your mind up to understand the topics more broadly.Solve problems before starting the material: it's a psychological hack. Do problems before learning, like practice tests, and your retention of the material improves.Be strict with yourself and others: when it's time to study, sit your butt down and study. Turn off distractions (like Quora) and try to concentrate for a set amount of time (you'll find you don't have to be up all night if you can spend an hour and a half without getting distracted). Don't let friends sway you into \"leaving for a snack break\" before you're ready; if your Saturday night was dedicated to studying tell them so.",

If you have a difficult course scheduled for the fall, take it at a community's college or online over the summer so you aren't seeing the material for the first time in the fall at your college. Premeds often do this with organic chemistry and prelaw students do it with philosophy. If you have a tough literature course coming up, try to get the reading list from the syllabus and read most of it before the semester starts. Use professors' office hours, tutors, math and writing centers, dummies books or whatever you have to do to master the material and the skills. Do not be afraid to ask questions and get help with study skills like memorization if your school offer students a study skills course. It will help you with time management and study strategies.
