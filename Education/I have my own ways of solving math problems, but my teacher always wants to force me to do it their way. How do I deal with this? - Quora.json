            "answer_text": "Most problem solving is done through logic and knowing the theory. So, essentially, every step you take you should be able to explain as to why you\u2019re doing it and where it\u2019s supposed to get you. That\u2019s the right way to solve a problem. Mental roadmaps aside, depending on your grade, simple logic won\u2019t be enough - you will need to be able to employ formulas along with correct units and present your solution, too. These are necessary skills because outward order on paper is testament of the order in your head - if you understand what you\u2019re doing, why you\u2019re doing it and how, then there should be no reason why you can\u2019t show it. Now, if this is a problem where you have to do, for example, two equations but the order doesn\u2019t matter (do one first, then the second or the other way around - the outcome is the same and equally logical), then I don\u2019t see why they\u2019re being upset about it. I\u2019d recommend you go see them either after lessons or during a break and calmly discuss it with them, why they don\u2019t like your solution and what you can do to make it better and whether or not there are alternative solutions (there very often are). Personally, as I teach chemistry and my students are old enough to handle a little abstraction, I usually show them the right way to do it, with some tips and tricks for formulae, then I show them the easy way and any time there\u2019s a problem with multiple ways to the same answer, I will talk about all of them. Because the world isn\u2019t black and white, sometimes the order isn\u2019t important. What\u2019s important is that you know the formulae, you know how to use them, you understand units and converting them, your logical thinking is up to date and you\u2019re capable of explaining each and every equation. That\u2019s what\u2019s important. ",

Dimensional analysis was a good example. Most of my brighter students could just work out the steps needed for a few conversions in their head. They would translate 25 miles per hour to meters per second in a flash, just punching in the numbers in their calculators and never bothering to write anything down. They would occasionally miss one, because they made a simple mistake, but they were right more often than not. Unfortunately for them, the answers were often only ten percent of the points in my classes \u2014 showing me the steps required for good dimensional analysis was worth most of the problem. Many smart kids were very frustrated with me over that, but I took the time to show them why they needed to work through it the way I needed them to do it. Chemistry problems, for example, could require a dozen steps in dimensional analysis to get to the correct answer. A simple mistake at any step could invalidate the entire final answer \u2014 which was all that was graded on most of the Advanced Placement test! Many teachers, especially in math, do not have the time to stop and explain why you may need the one method they\u2019re teaching you. I do know that I wish I\u2019d spent more time practising my algebra through high school calculus. I could do the calculus and the trig\u2014 it was easy \u2014 but the algebra in college kicked my ass when I was taking calculus in college. And it likely kicked my ass, because I wasn\u2019t taking the time to do things the ways my teachers wanted, from the very beginning. ",
