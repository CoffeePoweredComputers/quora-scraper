            "answer_text": "It requires a certified teacher of the deafblind and usually an intervener, a person trained to help the deafblind person get around safely in the community and who helps the person communicate. Interveners are needed because it is a life\u2019s work, and parents have jobs. They can\u2019t be there all the time. The intervener is a person whom the child feels safe with. A child will have several interveners. Deafblind children are taught using a technique called \u2018hand-over-hand,\u2019 in which the student\u2019s hand rests on the teacher\u2019s hand while the teacher makes finger-shapes in sign language or demonstrates how to do something, like tying a shoe or holding a fork and knife correctly. Gradually, the student learns a sign language alphabet and then the braille alphabet used in their country. From there, the student progresses to basic sign language and braille communication of increasing complexity. ",
