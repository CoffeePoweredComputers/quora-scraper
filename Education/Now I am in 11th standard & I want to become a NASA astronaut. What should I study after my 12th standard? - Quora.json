            "answer_text": "I am not familiar with your educational terminology. I'm going to presume \"12th standard\" has some equivalent to the US 12th grade or senior year in our high schools (a sort of gymnasium, etc.). It will depend somewhat on the course content. Like for instance in my part of the US system in 11th grade I learned trigonometry (a lot of memorization, but also absorbing the concepts).  NASA, for better or worse, does place some emphasis on college degrees (the higher the better). This is less so for military trained pilots. If you are not a US citizen, you will either need US citizenship or have your country's space program develop a joint mission with you representing your country. How do I get a job in NASA from India? for one example. For all hard to obtain jobs: you need to distinguish yourself. It goes beyond classes. You need to developed good study skills and good problem solving skills. You have to see school as a start, not an end in itself.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the way is difficult but not impossible. Eligibility Conditions: You must be a US citizen.You must be a bachelor's graduate, at least.So, first suggestion is go for Engineering (preferably Aerospace/ Aeronautical) in US in some reputed Institute. You must spend 5 years to get the citizenship. So, Enroll for Bachelors, then Masters and/ or if needed enroll for PHD. And be really good at your studies. You should have confidence and talent to convince them that you're the deserving one.  The same can be achieved in other branches as well, if you're belonging to medical line, then you should focus on it. ",
