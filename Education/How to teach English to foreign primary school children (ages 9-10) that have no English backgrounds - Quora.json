            "answer_text": "First thing to keep in mind, most of the first year, your students won't be speaking any English. This is assuming these students live in an environment that has no English language ingrained in its culture, though I've heard that Thailand is actually pretty far in its way towards bilingualism. But that's just word of mouth. My experience in China is, much of the first year learning English children are building up their auditory library, the same as babies do during their first year of life. It's good that you're starting at 6 years old because these students haven't grown out of the Golden Age of Language Learning (that is 2\u20138 years old). So what you want to do is lay down the basics this year, and have lots and lots of input. I'm talking StorybooksAudio and MusicClass TimeVideos (English only cartoons)Among other things. Most parents will argue that they don't understand anything, so how can I read them books!? And you need to nip that in the bud right away. Any parent who thinks a child must know something before they can learn it is terribly confused. What I mean is, you must read storybooks to children for months or years before they begin reading. Children must hear an ample amount of English before they will begin producing it (apart from memorization and mimicking, which sounds great but in the end the students don't really know what they're saying.) That is to say, if a child were to say \u201cThis is a cat\u201d, the words this is and a would be memorized and cat is the only word they actually know, because you taught it to them in class using TPR and a picture. This is what happens in a normal English classroom where Today\u2019s grammar is \u201cThis is a\u201d, next unit: \u201cwhat's this?\u201d, next unit: \u201cI am a boy.\u201d Now, what many English teachers seem to forget about is that language isn't something you can just give to someone, move on, and never look back. But that's how most coursebooks are laid out. \u201cLogically\u201d speaking, it looks like a great courseplan. This year we will focus on 52 grammar points and learn 156 new words. (Or 528 or 830 depending on your age and level), and parents love those big numbers, but what is forgotten is how most language is learned passively, through repetition and real-life use. It's why my students know exactly what to do when I say \u201cwash your hands\u201d, but have a hard time responding when I say \u201cdo you like hot dogs?\u201d The key difference here is my school doesn\u2019t have hot dogs, but we do have a sink and we wash our hands before every class. It's because they actually do it, they can feel the water, it's something they do every day. But \u201cdo you like hot dogs?\u201d? We should never ask that in a classroom. We should, however, when that unit comes around, go to a restaurant and give the kids an English menu. There should be pictures on the menu and the teacher should ask them \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d \u201cDo you like hot dogs?\u201d If we can use the English in a real-life situation, then it will be remembered much, much better. But not all schools let you go on weekly field trips to various locations. So what do you do? You have teaching materials that have full color pages with situations the children would actually be in , that the children can relate to, so that when they find themselves in that situation next time, they will remember the lesson, the grammar, and the vocabulary. It's a way of \u201creeling it back in\u201d from the depths of your mind. The other option, if you don't have those kinds of books, is you create props, create scenes in the classroom, and imagine the scenario. This will take time, cost a little (but not a lot), and your teaching materials should be on a plain white background to leave space for the child\u2019s imagination to flourish. Next, after learning something, the very next unit must be related to what has just been taught. It must use the material learned in order to learn something new. Your courseplan should work in a way that you will still be using what was learned on day 1, on day 300, and everything learned between that has been repetitively reviewed throughout the year, building up to the class at the end of the year. If you find yourself at the end of one year still trying to get your students to learn their colors, you've done something terribly wrong. However, it may not just be you. Do some detective work and find out whether the parents are speaking English to the children at home, reading to them, letting them watch English-only TV, sitting down with them to listen to an audiobook, or whatever kind of input possible, on a daily basis. You cannot hope that a child who spends 1 hour with you twice a week will somehow magically learn English. That's like assuming exercising on Monday and Thursday is enough to keep you fit. Every time you go back to the gym, you're simply working towards regaining what you've lost the past three days, and you aren't actually getting anywhere. Good Luck in Thailand! ",

            "answer_text": "The great thing about teaching kids is that you don\u2019t really have to get serious about Grammar\u2014 they\u2019ll copy the structures you use without having to show it on the board much. They pick up on structures very quickly on their own. Mostly you\u2019ll be teaching vocabulary, which they also soak up quickly! Your list of lesson topics is great. When you\u2019re teaching kids that don\u2019t have any English background, you should think of your lesson as a performance\u2014 you don\u2019t want to use any words that aren\u2019t necessary. For example, don\u2019t say \u201canna, can you do number 4?\u2019\u2019\u2014 just say \u2018\u2019anna, four!\u2019\u2019 (this is a hard habit to break for many new teachers). Use your facial expressions to encourage correction or to praise them. Use songs to help them with memory. Use lots of visual aids. Games like tag and duck duck goose and red rover (questionable safety there I suppose) can all be tailored to practice vocabulary. Spelling competitions are super popular as well. Even board games, and especially UNO can be worked into lesson ideas. Team competitions to identify vocabulary or put together a sentences are popular, too. You can make up a dance to help memorize a list of words or concepts (I\u2019ve used the electric slide for this before). They also love basic things like \u2018\u2019head shoulders knees and toes\u2019\u2019. basically if you know they\u2019re having fun and smiling, and they\u2019re picking up English, you\u2019re doing a good job. Some lessons might flop, and that\u2019s all part of teaching. But every time you try something new, you\u2019re evaluating a new learning tool that you might be able to repurpose over and over and over! Finally, I would check out sites liek busy teacher, or look for lesson ideas on blogs or on pinterest. The internet is FULL of free resources, so if you\u2019re really stuck, see if you can dig up a youtube video or worksheet online\u2014 there\u2019s no need to reinvent a wheel that\u2019s already been reinvented by alllllll the TEFL teachers that came before us! Good luck and have fun! ",

The first thing I immediately think when I see it is: this person clearly has no training or experience in teaching a language. If they did they would be asking more specific questions. The second thing I think is: I really really hope this person goes and gets proper training before teaching anyone. Teaching English abroad isn\u2019t just some fun way to go see the world. Someone\u2019s education is in your hands! Please take that seriously. Teaching isn\u2019t some simple skill that one can properly communicate how to do in a question and answer forum. It\u2019s way too broad of a question. Teaching is an art that is honed over time with proper training and practice. The short answer to your question however is this: You simply talk to them! ",

            "answer_text": "There are actually a few ways to teach English as a second language to foreign students. One way you can teach English is by becoming an ESL teacher at a primary school in the US. ESL stands for English as a Second Language and the job does exactly that. An ESL teacher teaches English to children with little to no understanding of English. For example, I live in an area where English is mostly spoken so at my school, there is an ESL teacher for foreign exchange students or other students that need help with English. This website (https://www.eslteacheredu.org/) provides information on how to become an ESL teacher in the US. Two other jobs that you might be interested in are teaching English abroad and teaching English online. This website (https://expertvagabond.com/best-travel-jobs/ #2 and the one before #2[it doesn\u2019t have a number]) talks about these two jobs and tells you how much they pay, any degrees that you might need, and gives you some resources. I hope this answer helped you and hopefully you were able to gain more understanding with the websites I provided. I wish you the best of luck! Have a nice day/night! ",

I would start them with learning the SOUNDS of the letters and then expand that into three letter phonetic words like bug, ant, pin, cup, etc, while showing them the objects and pronouncing the words sounds, b-u-g, slowly at first and then speeding up until you are saying the word naturally. Also have them trace the letters with their fingers in the dirt if it is that primitive or maybe you will have a whiteboard where you can write big letters and they can use their index and middle finger to trace the letters while repeating the sounds. This way they can build up a way to read, write, and learn the name of objects all at the same time. Good luck. ",
