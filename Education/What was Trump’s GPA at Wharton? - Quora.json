            "answer_text": "UPDATE: It was recently revealed that Trump went to extraordinary lengths to hide his high school and college transcripts (see the end of this post). Gee, I wonder why\u2026 \u2014- If I had to guess, I\u2019d say that it wasn\u2019t all that great. I base this on 4 factors: He transferred after 2 years at Fordham University. Fordham isn\u2019t an especially academically-distinguished institution. Many people enroll at Fordham to be in New York City rather than for academic reasons (it\u2019s easier to get into than Columbia or NYU). Even Trump\u2019s transfer to U Penn\u2019s Wharton is controversial. Biographer Gwenda Blair wrote that his admission was a special favor from an admissions officer who knew Trump\u2019s brother. That would certainly make sense given Wharton\u2019s high standards and Trump\u2019s seeming intellectual mediocrity.Despite his millionaire father\u2019s connections, he went to a mediocre private school in Queens, not some exclusive prep school in Manhattan or even a highly-rated one in Queens. Then his parents forced into military school for disobedience. While disobedience is not a direct indicator of grades, there\u2019s a very good correlation. The key point is that it got bad enough for his parents to take such drastic action. Keep in mind that it wasn\u2019t just boarding school, but military school, where discipline is key and freedom is very limited. Also note that Trump was banished to the New York Military Academy, not one of the more famous military academies (despite his dad being a real estate millionaire). That's another indicator of Trump\u2019s academic mediocrity. Indeed, evidence of NYMA\u2019s mediocrity is the fact that it went bankrupt a few years ago and was sold to Chinese investors. If it was a great school, you\u2019d think that alumni and politicians would save it. Might this explain Trump\u2019s financial antagonism toward China? Did military school change him for the better? There\u2019s no data either way.His present behavior\u2026ugh From the way he talks to his disdain for facts and science, he just doesn\u2019t strike me as especially intelligent or academic. I mean, he doesn\u2019t even lie very well. An intelligent liar would be more careful with his language, and choose lies that can\u2019t be easily disproved. Three of Trump\u2019s early lies were Obama\u2019s foreign birthplace, inaugural crowd size and his margin of victory. All were easily proven against him within hours. As of November 2018, he had told 3500+ documented falsehoods (from exaggerations to outright lies).Furthermore, given his present lack of ethics, my guess is that he was one of the first to cheat when necessary. I base this on all the shady financial decisions he\u2019s made, i.e. paying little to no personal taxes, exploiting the bankruptcy system, and designating his personal properties as farmland to avoid taxes. In the latter, he bought a few goats to graze on his NJ property and golf courses so that he can get farm tax breaks. In other words, he avoids paying taxes even though he provided none of the societal benefits of an actual farm. It may be legal but ethics is another story, since it deprives the community of income. Indeed, it borders on immoral when you consider that Trump is a billionaire, yet he feels fine depriving a town of $79,000??? To a small town, $79,000 can do a lot, but is hardly noticeable to someone worth $3,500,000,000. Even the present Republican mayor thought it was dirty finances. Some may claim that these maneuvers actually show cleverness on Trump\u2019s part. Hardly, since these things are usually devised by accountants and lawyers \u2014 with Trump\u2019s approval. So he should take the ethical blame without getting any of the intellectual credit.Donald Trump, New Jersey Goat Herder?I\u2019ve seen a couple of interviews with former Wharton and military classmates and none praised Trump\u2019s intelligence or academic prowess. In fact, a U Penn article interviewed 13 of his Wharton classmates and only one remembered him. And it was apparently a very different low key Donald Trump. In short, all of the classmates thought that he was probably undistinguished and even an underachiever. Notably, the rather negative article was written in 2015, when Trump\u2019s reputation was nowhere as bad as it is now.All said, although I have no evidence of his grades, I\u2019d say that it was below average \u2014 and that\u2019s including probable cheating. And please note that Trump is fond of saying that he \u201cwent to some of the best schools.\u201d The facts say otherwise. Only Wharton at UPenn fits that description and that was only for two years \u2014 and his acceptance there was likely a favor to his brother. ADDENDUM = as many have pointed out, you can\u2019t compare your MBA grades to his. That\u2019s because Trump doesn\u2019t have an MBA. He attended Wharton for 2 years to complete an undergraduate degree in Economics. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s delighted, however, when people mistakenly believe that he has an MBA, or survived 4 years at Wharton. Why else won\u2019t he mention his first 2 years at Fordham\u2026?  UPDATE -It was recently revealed by Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, that Trump went through remarkable efforts to prevent his military academy and college grades from being revealed. That, despite demanding that Obama release his Harvard transcripts. Hypocrisy! Furthermore, Trump constantly boasts about his own intelligence and education. So what is he ashamed of? https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/05/extensive-effort-bury-donald-trumps-grades/?utm_term=.2544a0e2ca85 Jimmy Kimmel: Trump\u2019s secret high school grades revealed.

            "answer_text": "Donald Trump\u2019s GPA at Wharton was nothing spectacular. A high GPA is usually complimented by graduation with honors. However, Trump\u2019s name was evidently not on the Dean\u2019s list of Wharton.  Does that totally discredit Donald Trump\u2019s intelligence? Not necessarily. Did Trump inflate his own academic history? Yes. Now let\u2019s think of a more abstract idea. How did Trump get into the prestigious Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania? A school with a 9% acceptance rate, getting in is no easy task. Well first off, he only completed his undergraduate at Wharton in two years after transferring.  Trump transferred from Fordham college at Rose Hill. Now, his college years here are somewhat of a mystery. The way I look at it is since he transferred, what exactly were his stats that made him qualified to get in? What GPA did he earn in those two years at Fordham? These days transferring to a prestigious university is extremely difficult. Back then I believe it was just as hard. However, one biographer, Gwenda Blair, claims Trump was admitted to Wharton on a \u201cspecial favor.\u201d That being a possible hefty donation of $1.4 million to UPenn. With that as a part of his transfer application, grades now seem less important in the admission process. Overall, the whole college years of Trump are somewhat mysterious. We are left to assume he must have had good enough stats to meet transfer requirements and was decent enough to graduate with a B.S in Economics in 1968.  I think that when people get wrapped up in who had the highest GPA, people start looking like high school freshmen again. \u201cI have a 3.8 and you have a 3.6 therefore I\u2019m way smarter than you.\u201d \u201cOh and Billy there, he has a 4.0, he's probably gonna be an astronaut or a brain surgeon with those grades.\u201d In the end GPA is one way to measure academic success. Inflating your own grades, that\u2019s poor academic integrity. It\u2019s also inaccurate when New York Times reports in 1973\u20131976 that he graduated \u201cfirst in his class\u201d when his GPA was probably around 3.4~3.5. \"I decided that as long as I had to be in college, I might as well test myself against the best,\" he explains in his 1989 autobiography, \"The Art of the Deal.\" (This was purely a research post, I take no side in political arguments).
