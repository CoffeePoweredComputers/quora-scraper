            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a lot more information being conveyed during an in-person conversation versus online. There\u2019s a lot more than I\u2019m going to list here, but to give you a high level: Body LanguageFacial ExpressionTone of voiceVoice inflectionAll of these are easy to pick up on when you\u2019re face to face with someone, but trying to get them across through text is not very easy. A single statement could have many meanings if the other person could only hear your tone and inflection, but through chat it\u2019s really up to them to interpret. There\u2019s also basically no risk in completely misrepresenting yourself online; just think about the number of times people add smiley face emoji\u2019s, LOLs or HAHAHAs when they\u2019re not really laughing or smiling. How would the other person even know that you\u2019ve maintained the same stoic face while endlessly bombarding them with suggestions that you\u2019re having the time of your life? In an online conversation, it\u2019s more about presenting yourself a certain way than conveying your true emotions. But when you see that person in public and they\u2019re not laughing after everything you say, it could come as quite the surprise. It also takes more skill to have an in-person conversation; you have to be on the spot, you don\u2019t get so much time to sit back and ponder the perfect unless you don\u2019t mind being awkward. Imagine telling someone they\u2019re pretty online vs in-person: In-person you\u2019re trying to sound confident but not too forward, or at the very minimum you want it to come out at the right time where she\u2019s in a similar emotional state. If she reacts poorly, you\u2019ve gotten yourself in an awkward situation that you can\u2019t really just walk away from; it\u2019s not easy for most people to just brush off rejection and move on, so maybe you refrain from saying it all together and just wait for a better moment. There\u2019s a lot more risk to messing up in-person.Online you can say whatever you want, and if you get a bad reaction you can immediately cut off all communication with that person with no repercussions. Now it\u2019s much easier to give a compliment, and if they already like you they\u2019ll probably interpret it however sounds good to them (even if it would have sounded awkward coming from your mouth). Coming out of your mouth the words may sound shaky and awkward, but online the words are just as confident no matter who\u2019s typing them.",

            "answer_text": "Talking online and talking in person is different because 90% of our communication is non-verbal. When you talk to someone online, you only have their words on a screen and a photo to go by. (This, I think, is part of the reason why emoji is such a fast growing language -because devs are trying to create viable virtual substitutes for a range of things you communicate non-verbally in person.) Granted, written words can also tell you a lot about a person, but they can\u2019t replace things like: a) eye contact, or lack thereof b) the nuances of facial expressions c) body posture d) tone, volume, pitch, and hue of voice e) hand gestures and so on. All these elements of non-verbal communication help you formulate a more complete picture of what the person you\u2019re talking to is thinking or feeling, how focused they are on what you\u2019re telling them, whether you\u2019re annoying them etc. Tone is notoriously hard to communicate online, which is also why a lot of people get misunderstood if, for example, they use short sentences. Of course, different people have different preferences in terms of modes of communication. A lot of people feel more comfortable talking online, because talking online helps them feel less self-conscious, freer to express themselves, etc. A lot of people, for example, hate talking on the phone. It really depends on what you\u2019re used to, and how good you are at picking up social cues, both online and in person. Those are my thoughts anyway :) (\u2026smiley face to indicate that even though I might be coming across as an arrogant know-it-all, if we were having this conversation in person I would smile a lot to let you know that I\u2019m open to other opinions.) ;) ",
