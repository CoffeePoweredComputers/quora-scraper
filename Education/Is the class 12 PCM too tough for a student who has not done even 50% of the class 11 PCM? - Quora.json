            "answer_text": "I find myself in the best position to answer this question. Being a topper till class 10th and scoring 10 CGPA in 10th class final examinations, things we're not so easy going for me in class 11th with my new school as I enjoyed till 10th. I myself scored a mere 55.5% in class 11th and failed in Maths everytime except the finals. Anyhow I got in class 12th and am going to have my CBSE board examinations from the 9th of March. Now, the answer to your question is NO. First of all you need to have faith in yourself and stop thinking PCM as tough. Class 12th is very much or totally different from class 11th except for some topics in Maths like: differentiation, continuity, relation & functions and a some of trigonometry; and in chemistry as organic chemistry. Rest all is totally different. Infact 12th is more easy compared to 11th for me atleast as you get used to the hardships and most of the basics and most of the time the sudden fall from class 10th to 11th marks gives you a trauma. What you need to do is start working hard and studying topics on a daily basis. You will feel it a bit difficult to some topics which you were weak in 11th but that all can be covered in a short span. As far as 12th boards are concerned the class 11th marks do not matter but you will find it difficult while preparing for engineering/IIT exam(s) as they require indepth knowledge of both 11th and 12th. As I already mentioned earlier that you just need to have faith in yourself and do hardwork right from the first day of class 12th. You still have a year ahead to prepare and make up for the small concepts and topics of class 12th. Instead of thinking about changing the board and worrying about what you failed to achieve in 11th start preparing about what still you can achieve. ALL THE BEST! You can't have a better tomorrow if you are still thinking about yesterday. ",

            "answer_text": "I was in similar situation like yours. My 11 percentage was 68. I\u2019m giving 12th CBSE boards right now. I will list out the topics which gonna be kind of nightmare for you- Trigonometry- Dude if you don\u2019t like Trigo and planning to skip it. Then I can bet you not gonna score even 50% in your maths. You will not be able to do calculus. In case you are going for JEE then you gonna fail miserably. I cant emphasis more on this. Just know the basics and formula real well. Can easily be complete in 2 weeks by studying 30\u201340 mins a day.Organic Chemistry- Textbook 2 of Chemistry is complete Organic. I too faced the problem in this. So do read Organic chapters of 11th before jumping too Textbook 2 of your 12th. Will not take much time.Chapters like Bonding, Periodicity, Redox Reaction and concepts like Electronic Config- They have their applications in 12th chapters too. So you should know atleast their basics well. And of course one should know Electronic config.Final Advice- Don\u2019t ever think that I\u2019m running out of time and I can\u2019t complete the backlogs I\u2019ve. Go throu the topics I\u2019ve advised above and you are all set to rock in 12th std. P.S- I\u2019ve missed out Vectors. At least know the basics of them or you can initially complete the Vector Algebra in your Maths too. No Prerequisite required. ",
