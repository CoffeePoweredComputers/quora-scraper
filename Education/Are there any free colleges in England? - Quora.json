            "answer_text": "If by the word college you mean university, only people ordinarily resident in Scotland don\u2019t have to pay to go to university. People I the rest of the UK don\u2019t get it for free, but don\u2019t need to pay upfront either. UK graduates not from Scotland start repaying their tuition fees once they are earning just under \u00a326000 per annum. In the UK the word college also means Further Education colleges, aimed at 16 to 19 year olds. Those colleges are free if you are British or ordinarily a resident of the UK and you are in that age group. The unemployed regardless of their age don\u2019t need to pay to attend those colleges either. ",

Colleges are where we study A levels (and other subjects) from 16 to 18 years of age before we go to university (which are currently not free). Some university, such as Oxford and Cambridge are also made up of colleges. As these are universitys they are not free. ",
