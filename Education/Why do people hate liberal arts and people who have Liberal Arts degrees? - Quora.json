            "answer_text": "In my experience most people who have a bad attitude towards liberal arts degrees don\u2019t have an accurate understanding of what the phrase means. The most common mistake is focusing on the \u201carts\u201d in the phrase and deciding liberal arts colleges don\u2019t offer majors in the sciences. The next most common is thinking the \u201cliberal\u201d in liberal arts is related to the idea being a liberal in political views (the opposite of conservative, as in US politics).  Liberal arts is a term that predates both these narrow definitions (I\u2019m not going to delve into the latin roots of these words, but you can find excellent articles on this online). The basic idea is that liberal arts is a phrase that represents the educational grounding across the variety of subjects needed for the citizen of a free society to thrive for the rest of their life. This generally means they will learn how to think clearly, breaking down arguments for both sides, communicate those arguments and conclusions well, and possess the interpersonal skills to work with other citizens to meet all the challenges life in a democracy such as the US might present.  The only people who actually hate liberal arts and liberal arts degrees are those who seek to oppress their citizens, whether through a dictatorship, totalitarianism, or other forms of society that have a vested interest in suppressing the fundamental human rights of their citizens to determine the course of their own lives. Everyone else who says they hate the liberal arts is, ipso facto, poorly educated.  That\u2019s not to say that someone might also choose not to pursue this kind of education for very good reasons. It is a luxury for many people in the world who struggle to meet their basic needs and would be much better off with a trade-school or pre-professional education. Liberal arts colleges in the US wrestle with this idea and, as their endowments and fundraising permit, most make a very sincere effort to provide significant scholarship aid in order to not become a luxury good. Because a liberal arts education does tend to lead everyone involved to believe that our larger society is significantly harmed, both by the \u201chave-nots\u201d missing this opportunity and also by the \u201chaves\u201d learning in isolation.

            "answer_text": "In this day and age, I think people rather more pity them than hate them, but I understand the sentiment. By people, you must mean non-liberal arts majors - namely, engineers and \u201cbusiness\u201d type majors, under whatever moniker. There are actually a few things going on here, in my observation. Classically speaking, being \u201ceducated\u201d meant an education in the liberal arts - education (a luxury enjoyed by the wealthy) being somewhat distinct from vocation (a necessity of the lower classes). Thus, understand, for the vast majority of academe\u2019s history, the condescension has been reversed: if you did not have an liberal arts education, you did not have an education, as it were; at best, you had a trade - such as building bridges \u2026 or blacksmithing. Within academe things have actually changed little culturally. The philosophy professor is substantially more \u2018legitimate\u2019 in his field than the \u2018business\u2019 professor - the latter being a very recent notion in terms of \u201ceducation\u201d, the former existing from antiquity. In the current/modern era, the prevailing notion is that a good \u201ceducation\u201d should translate directly to a good job - otherwise, why get one? A down-side of mixing apples and oranges - of converging the liberal arts with trades - is the risk that one ever mistakes itself for the other, producing a mish-mash that is really neither: nebulous \u201cskills\u201d that have little marketable utility, and an underwhelming survey of leading opinions bearing little long term value as \u201cknowledge\u201d. Few appreciate how new this association actually is, and how - in converging \u201cthe trades\u201d with \u201cthe arts\u201d - we have mixed apples and oranges. ",
