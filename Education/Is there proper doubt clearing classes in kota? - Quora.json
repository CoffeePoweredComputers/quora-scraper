            "answer_text": "There's this coaching called Motion IIT JEE, a pretty small one compared to the other giants you already know like Bansal, Reso, Vibrant, Allen, Career Point etc. They have these assistant teachers who also attend the lectures with students and can provide some help with doubts later when the core teachers are unavailable (which is almost always).  But to be honest anyone is hardly interested. They all eye the students who could produce top AIRs. More than often they will not have time to entertain you. The only people you gotta rely for your doubts are your friends. So having a good company really helps!! ",
