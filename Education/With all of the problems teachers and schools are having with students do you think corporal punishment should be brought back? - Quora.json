            "answer_text": "Actually this is not a easy question to answer once one start to ponder on it. If it is administered properly in respect of set guidelines or policies and it is the consequence of last resort, then it could have a place in schooling systems. There are some issues to consider however; In this day and age corporal punishment cannot be regarded as a \u201cgiven\u201d in any school system. There will have to be a whole-school policy including the local community that support it. Teachers and front-office leadership cannot implement it one-sidedly. there will have to clear and inclusive discussions and consultations.In many jurisdictions such a policy may also have to include the approval of higher authorities, e.g. state-level in Australia or District level in the USA in the case of government/state schools.The students need to be well-informed how this system will work. Will this type of punishment include girls? (In the past it was the boys who copped this punishment predominantly, but would equality demand that girls are also eligible for a few whacks on their posteriors?)I feel strongly that corporal punishment should be a last or close to resort and the worst/final resort could be expulsion.It must never be a type of routine punishment per se, in stead it should act as as a deterrent. The students should not ever be in a position where they \u201care used to it.\u201d An issue here is students (think your more robust, tougher boys), may become too accustomed to bending over to receive \u201chis stripes.\u201d In my day we always had a choice of consequences, but most boys opted to be caned as it was regarded as the \u201ceasy\u201d way out - bended over, received your 2, 4 or 6 lashes, stood up, muttered \u201cThank you Sir\u201d, put your basher on your head and buggered off. And there the matter ended.The ideal should be that such encounters be restricted to about 3 - 5 incidents per term, more than that and it becomes too routine and more of an irritant than a solution.What about some contemporary boys, the products of a liberal, non-violent, and rights-focused way of raising kids? There are some of these types whom I simply cannot contemplate on the receiving side of a cane. Yet many of these types conversely have turned some classrooms into the challenging, toxic places that they are.The thing is that once corporal punishment is adopted as a consequence at a school, it should be there for all, and sch\u00f6ne seelen, to borrow a phrase from Schiller, should not be exempted.Lastly, before corporal punishment gets reinstated, expect heated debates and confrontation. I can already see SJW\u2019s going down violet paths to counter what they\u2019ll see as a violent punishment. It will take much perpetuation and compromise to get this done as we have became used to the absence of corporal punishment in schools, we munched and sang too much Tofu and Kumbaya. I envisage hard work and bold attitudes to change things in this respect. To borrow another phrase, this time from the Zulus, only a brave man or a rogue can take a serious challenge head-on.",

            "answer_text": "Would it be acceptable for your boss to use corporal punishment if you make a mistake at work? How about a spouse hitting their spouse as a form of discipline? If this is not acceptable to adults, why should it acceptable to children? What lessons would the children learn from the experience of getting hit? Perhaps they will learn that hurting another person is an acceptable way to get their compliance. Violence is the way to solve problems. Pain and fear of pain should be the prime motivating force. It just seem so barbaric to me. I think scientific studies have backed up the idea that corporal punishment has negative effects on children. Another concern is that caretakers might not be able to control their anger and abuse their children. According to one study, 54% of the prisoners on death row in a Texas prison experienced violence or abuse as children. From my personal experience with corporal punishment, it didn't make me a better student or person. ",
