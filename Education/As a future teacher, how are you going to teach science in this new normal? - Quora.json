Remember, this pandemic will not last\u2014life will return to some familiar patterns. In the meanwhile, my advice to those teaching students science is to: Get the students to do as many of the experiments as possible at home. LOTS of labs in secondary school science adapt easily to using home equipment. For example, you don\u2019t need graduated cylinders, etc\u2014measuring cups and spoons will do.For those labs that should not be done at home (or even the science classroom), such as the reaction of the alkali metals with water or the reaction of sodium with chlorine gas, refer students to YouTube videos.Have regular contact with the entire class to give the students a sense of structure. PowerPoints work well here, but don\u2019t overdo the content.Adopt a \u201cflipped classroom\u201d approach. I\u2019m going to try that myself this term and we will see how it goes, but the flipped classroom approach really lines up well with an on-line course.Remember for lots of students, science \u201cjust doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d so provide opportunities for on-line tutoring.Don\u2019t worry\u2014this too shall pass. All the best, David",
