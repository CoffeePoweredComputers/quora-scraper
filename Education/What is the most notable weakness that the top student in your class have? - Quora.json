            "answer_text": "It really does depend on who the person is because this is very subjective. I would say in my experience most top students are really humble and down to earth people and will help anyone struggling. As a top student myself, the most notable weakness I have and most top students have is that they feel inferior to other smart people. It\u2019s the reason why they are the top students. They work hard to be the best. Many people will deny this and say their doing it to have a good future and to get good grades but you gotta realise that smart people are REALLY ambitious and this includes outsmarting their perceived rivals. A lot of people think that being smart is something that you are born with but the reality is that is 99% hard work and only 1% is inherited. I have an IQ of 123, which is above average and my dad is a very hard working person, who got 90+ in all his tests but I feel inferior compared to a friend of mine who is very knowledgeable in economics and business and gets As and he feels inferior compared to a friend of his who has an IQ of 162 and is a straight A student. There is also another guy who I know who was the most smartest kid in our science classes. He once got 94/100 in chemistry and 80/80 in maths. He got accepted into a really prestigious school in our town but even he can\u2019t catch up to their speed and feels inferior to them. Whether this is a weakness is debatable. Some people would say that this inferiority complex motivates them into working hard and striving to be better than they were before whereas some people would say that it demotivates students and causes them to throw everything away. I personally think that is is a weakness because it distracts them from their real purpose. They\u2019re so caught up in trying to be better than everybody else and trying to live up to their parents\u2019 expectations because of how insecure they feel that they\u2019re not focusing on themselves. The top students need to realise and accept the fact that there is always gonna be someone who is better than them, in every way possible. You can\u2019t do anything about it, you can\u2019t change who they are. It\u2019s just how it\u2019s meant to be. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on who you mean by top students. There are the top students who get the best grades and then there are the top students who understand the material better than everyone else. To complicate the matters further, it also depends if we are talking about elementary school, high school, or college students. The top students who get the best grades have one glaring weakness. They care about grades too much. They often only superficially know the material and are content if they get an A. This leads them to minimize risks and focus on pleasing the teacher. This might work well in high school and to some extent in college, but these students rarely do as well in grad school or the work place. Eventually the lack of deeper understanding catches up. However, they do very well in office environments since they know how to please a boss. The top students who are smart and understand the material better than everyone one suffer from not seeing other people\u2019s perspectives and boredom. In high school, they will often be antagonistic to create an interesting classroom or disengaged because it is too easy for them. In college and grad school they can start to shine more because they are surrounded by more and more people like them. However, they have trouble explaining themselves because they assume other people think like they do or they do not see alternatives to their ideas. These people general do better in academic jobs, but can be extremely unpleasant to work with (Steve Jobs comes to mind) ",
