            "answer_text": "I have been librarian (real, or at least titular) in three elementary schools, 30\u201340 years ago. I expect that the experience probably isn\u2019t that different now, though. One thing you really need to have is flexibility. For librarians especially, you never know when you\u2019ll come in and they\u2019ll tell you your space will be used, that day or the next, for some community event (voting, for example). You\u2019ll need to figure out, on the fly, what to do for the classes that were supposed to come in that day, and make sure that their \u201clibrary day\u201d isn\u2019t wasted. You also need to recognize what kids can and can\u2019t do. In one of my schools, kindergarten children were not allowed to check out library books. They badly wanted to, though, so I gave them permission check out one at a time for the first semester without taking them home - just using them in their classroom. We had an almost perfect record of on-time returns, so in the second semester I allowed them to take their books home, and they still kept their almost-perfect return record, better than any other class in the school. I have no idea what the next librarian did (I was only there for one year), but that worked very well, and, I hope, made the kids mindful library users for years to come. On the other hand, I did not allow them to check out encyclopedia volumes, because if one volume of the print set was lost, it couldn\u2019t be replaced - you had to buy a whole new set. This was too much responsibility to place on a 5\u201311-year-old. You need a lot of patience. If you\u2019re a classroom teacher, your patience is tried every day, and I have great admiration for people who can do this (I couldn\u2019t!). As a librarian I had to be patient with the students because the library skills I was trying to teach them were not valued particularly by the school or the teachers, so they weren\u2019t really supported by the teachers. I often had to tell them the same things over and over, and, being a very new librarian (or, as I mentioned, not a librarian yet at all), I didn\u2019t always realize that I should cut them some slack. As other responders have mentioned, there are almost innumerable other qualities elementary educators need, but you asked for the \u201cbest,\u201d and these are what came to mind. Thanks for the A-to-A! ",
