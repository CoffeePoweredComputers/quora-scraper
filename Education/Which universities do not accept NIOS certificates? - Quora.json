            "answer_text": "If any university/institution objects in taking admission of a NIOS passed students then it is directly challenging the Ministry of Human Resource and development, government of India as the NIOS is passed through a resolution (No. F.5-24/90 Sch.3 dated 14 September 1990 published in the Gazette of India on 20 October 1990). The University can be dissolved if it tries in any way not to recognize the Senior Secondary course passed by the student from NIOS board. The NIOS board is in no way inferior to other boards like ISC/CBSE/UP board. The NIOS has the same rights and privileges as any other board and is in no way inferior to them. (Thanks for asking) ",
