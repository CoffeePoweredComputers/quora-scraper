            "answer_text": "With effort. I am not sure how else to say it.  I have experience working and going to school- I did it for 3 years of undergrad and 3 years of graduate school (with a year in between).  That spanned two different employers and a career transition (as well as a change in educational focus).  On a personal note, it also spanned the birth of 3 children. There were a lot of days when I woke up and was less than motivated to go to work.  There were days when I got off work and didn't want to go to school.  Most nights, by the time I got home, I didn't want to study. Things I did that helped compensate for the load: I took one day (in my case Sunday) all of the way off.  No work.  No school.  No homework.  I went to church, I spent time with my wife and later with my kids, and we usually went over and spent time with other people we enjoyed spending time with.I gave myself a break after I got home.  No matter how much homework I had, I usually gave myself at least an hour to decompress (which usually included eating dinner) when I first got home.  I did better on reapplying myself to my homework after a break.  Much more so if the break involved physical activity, like playing with my young children.I prioritized like crazy.  Getting things done was a priority, but getting an A on every assignment or exam was a luxury.  I learned to be very happy with Bs during my graduate school years.I looked for easy classes any time I wasn't directly interested in learning the material (which is to say, when accomplishing elective classes).I put off a lot of things.  Many household repairs waited until I graduated or at least the week or two between semesters (I also attended summer sessions most years).  We didn't travel much except one trip a year to visit my in-laws, roughly a 30 hour drive.  We didn't often go try that new restaurant or go see that new movie.But all of those compensating steps didn't make it stop being a huge amount of effort.  So just commit to finishing, then dig in and get it done. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "To study and work at the same time may be difficult.If you have to work, take twelve credits or less depending on the requirements to study at the institution of your choice.That study load will give you some time to work.You can also enroll in evening or in Saturday classes and work during the week.  Cconsider dividing the day to work and study as follows:    About four to six hours to sleep.    About seven to ten hours to work.    About six to eight hours to study.These times are approximate and rotational.That means that you have to accomodate all your daily needs and change the schedules to fit your purpose for each day.If your college does not require every day attendance to classes you may work out special arrangements with your professors to accomodate study and work itineraries.If your college requires every day attendance to classes, consider a free attendance university or internet accredited classes.Any way you go, keep in mind that you need to study most of your time after classes.

In my terms i had to study by myself i did rutine chores at daytime, socializing with family, caring of kids, meals preparing, laundry, ironing, cleaning, dishes eveything. And at night from 10pm \u2014 2am or 3am i used to do self study. This i aplied in both bachelors plus ielts preps. Sometimes when i became sleep deprived i used morning time for revision as for example i use alrm to wake up at 4am when i was max tired n sleepy i do slept and make sure to be awake at 4am to 7am to study revise when exams came near by. Hope it helps. With family time n kids u can spare ur night time for few years u have to ruin sleeps for good grades. ",

If feel energy left, do not load yourself with more other stuff, take it easy and relax or, better, do sports.

Studying involves listening, taking down notes, remembering the facts learnt, short notes, revision, answering tutes, doing practicals, discussions, computer searches, and passing the exam. Employment and studies must be separated by relaxing which includes exercises, pleasurable activities, sleep, personal activities and just relaxing. Dont take your office work home because you lose relaxation time. Do your revision and tutes without delay be prepared even to submit them next day. Identify the unimportant items from the relaxation activities and cut them down. It is not a bad idea to utilize your intermissions in the office work to quickly go through your short notes. Have a good night's sleep. ",

So I will not be able to guide you in detail. But I can tell you my study plan when I was going to Articleship (basically internship) and I had to study for my CA FINAL exams. Here we go: Early morning wake up at 5:45 am. Get freshen up. Start studying at 6am. During initial days of this kind of schedule, I suggest you to take up some practical subject where you can keep your active in solving problems. Lateron our brains get used to the timings, then you study theory subject in the morning because memory power is high in morning time.Plan accordingly and study till 8 am or 9 am based upon your office timings.In office, we all know that not all 9 hours we will be working. We all get some break time, use mobile phones. I am not telling to cut all entertainment activities. Instead reduce it and dedicate that time to revise whatever you have studied in the morning.After you come back from office, DONT take rest. Get freshen up and start studying. If we take rest, usually we don't study. If u are sure that you can study after taking rest, then you can go ahead. Study till 9pm. Have dinner, watch some shows. Then sleep.Revision is very very important. Keep some specific time for revision every day.Entertainment is also important to keep our brain active. So reduce such activities but not Completely remove it.Sunday: Keep your most of the time for studying. If u are able to study entire day, then it's awesome. The topic which you are able to study in 3\u20134 days while working, you are able to cover it in the single day.Hope this content helped you. ",

But it\u2019s important to not get lost in the forest for trees to stay productive.Cut out social media: Deleting facebook and instagram applications have really created more space in my brain and life where I can dwell on things I am currently improvising.Keep your you time on a regular day: Packing my day with just \u201cthings to do\u201d makes my day very productive but depletes me at the end of the day. Remember that all cerebral activities need brain power and we all have limited brain power. I meditate and work out to blow off steam.Reflect back and reward yourself: After a productive week of checking boxes in my journal, I give myself an ice-cream and a walk in the nature.

            "answer_text": "Time management is something tricky to take care of. But it is very easy and entertaining if you are able to do it as it takes out boredom from your life and makes your life more interesting and challenging. How you go about it, depends on how related your job and study are. If they have a lot in common, for example, someone enrolled in a technical course doing similar technical stuff at job would find it easier to manage both. But if your job has nothing similar with what you want to study then free timings are all you need to focus first. Besides, it also depends upon nature of work at job, for example, if it is a desk job, then you can manage to study in free time but if it involves too much physical activity then most probably you will be too tired to do study afterwards. Since from your question, it is not very clear about what kind of job you do, how much free time you get and what course or type of study you want to do. So I will suggest you to usual approach. Make a list of free time you get in a week. Let\u2019s say, you get 4 hours free everyday on weekday and 6 on weekends. Then write down those number of hours in which you can sit and study properly without any disturbance and also think about some hours which you are free but you can\u2019t sit and study ( if you commute through public mode of transport or walk to your office, this would come under this category). Then analyze your syllabus and fix some topics for each day according to available time slots. You can go for some audio/video lectures for the duration in which you commute to office by some public transport. Since, in any study, revision plays an important role; so you can keep those hours which are not that disturbance free for revision and keep continuous longer hours for making notes and reading new things. Hope that helps. Best of Luck! ",

Look at what is left, is there enough space left for your time? Just like you should always pay yourself some of your wages, you need to have guilt free down time. And if there\u2019s not enough time for you, change something. Whether you roster yourself \u2018off\u2019 every second Saturday and Tuesday, or Monday mornings and Friday nights, you have to give yourself a break.

If you don\u2019t give yourself some quiet time to relax and recharge, you wont need to balance the rest, because you\u2019ll end getting fired from work and dropping out of school. ",

It is rarely practical to schedule this, and against all the regulations of universities I know, who usually set a limit of 16 hours per week (paid or not) for students who are registered as full-time. About half this would be reasonable. Note that working students sometimes get conflicts when the employer wants (needs) the student for something urgent.

Otherwise, turn your study time into a fun and enjoable activity. There is really no universal approach here - anything can be fun and enjoyable if you find it to be so. So, this is the first and the essential step - try to find a way to make your studying enjoyable. Once you add a bit of focus to it, and a self-correction of your own mistakes, this will also become productive. Consequently, you will have a reverse situation - you will enjoy learning things so much that you will find it hard to stop. And the advice here would be simple - take breaks, breath some fresh air, do a bit of simple physical exercises after 1 hour of learning and so on. ",

Your dedicated study time should be built into your daily routine either immediately before or after work. Then you can relax.
