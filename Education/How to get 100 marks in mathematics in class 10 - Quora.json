            "answer_text": "I am assuming that you are a student of the ICSE board, although the answer I write is suitable, with minor modifications, for students of any board. The first thing is that you should be able to confidently and correctly solve all the maths questions, problems, theorems, proofs of your school maths text book. Frequent revision and testing yourself would ensure that you can do this perfectly. The second step is to repeat this exercise with one or more of the other textbooks which other schools are using for their 10th standard students. For example, if you are in 10th ICSE and your school maths textbook is Foundation Mathematics 2 by RS Aggarwal then, after finishing this book, you should have a look at other textbooks like Selina ICSE Concise Mathematics and study it. The third step is to go through the reference book which gives additional questions of the same type and that is ICSE Mathematics Class 10 by RD Sharma. Please note that for students of CBSE and other boards they should study the CBSE version of the same book written by the same author. The last step would be to go through the board question papers of mathematics of the last 10 years and make sure that you can solve all the questions perfectly. If you do all this then I am confident that you have very bright chances of scoring 100 out of 100 in maths in class 10. Best of luck! ",
