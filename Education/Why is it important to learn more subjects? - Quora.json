            "answer_text": "Hey, It's important to learn diverse subjects because knowledge builds upon knowledge. This means if you have a wide base of existing knowledge, it will make it easier for you to learn new things. This works so extremely well because you can make connections of the new learnings to the existing knowledge. This is important because it allows you to store and process new stuff way faster. It is actually the way we naturally learn. When we go to school or even as a child, we don't start with the most complicated versions, but we start with a simple model and build knowledge up on this. If you take language for example. A child will use a very simple structure and will fit new words into this structure. In my opinion, one of the most important things is to first learn how to learn. Because it's sort of a meta-skill. Once you know how to learn you learn everything faster and therefore build a wider base which will allow you to then learn new things faster. In a nutshell, practice often Better learn 15 min each day than 1.5 hours at once.make connectionsTry to connect new ideas to what you already know.switch things upDon't use the same learning methods over and over.visualizeIncorporate visualization into your learning to tap into the power of your imagination.teachYou haven't understood something truly until you can teach it to someone else.quiz yourselfUse index cards, trial exams or ask your family to quiz you on the topic you want to learn.So this is essentially the way I learn!
