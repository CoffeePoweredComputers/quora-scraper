            "answer_text": "Yogi, on the face of it, this is an incomplete question which doesn\u2019t really deserve more than a one-word answer: Yes. Annually about 18000 students start a Law degree in the UK, not all of them will complete, but this suggests that at any time there are over 40000 people studying Law in the UK. Most of them will be in England. If you want to know anything more, you will have to write a complete question. Also, after a quick look at your profile, if you are serious about attending an English-speaking university, you will need to improve the quality of your written English. I don\u2019t mean that it is incomprehensible, but that to gain a good grade, you need to use punctuation correctly, and get out of the habit of writing, e.g. \u201cur\u201d instead of \u201cyour\u201d.
