            "answer_text": "I will like to explain this in two points From the difficulty level of paper nothing can be said because NTA has only mentioned that it will provide the paper so that the non coaching students also get equal chance of attempting the questions.This no were means that paper will be easy as 2020.Neet 2020 aspirants who are on the border line and have just missed the cutoff, they are. Vulnerable in the sense that the counselling process will be till mid of December, so if they cannot make it they will have only 4 months left. This is how it will affect candidates 2021 score.Finally concluding i will say that the best thing we can do at present is to start studing if we are well aware of our rank and this year marks inflation. If you get a college the study will not harm you and if you cannot make it you will get a for sure lead on other candidates.I completely understand that it will be difficult to continue your studies but believe me it's necessary. And false hopes on quora will nowhere help you at that time.Best wishes to you, any questions please write in the comments",
