            "answer_text": "This is a rather religious answer, but I felt it needed to be said since no one in my life has really been there for me enough to have a wise answer such as this one. ~When I pray to God and listen, and I mean REALLY listen, I can hear Him. One night in particular, I was wailing to Him about how much emotional pain I was in due to an extensive event involving traumatic psychological abuse, and I finally blurted out something I'd been holding in all my life: \"GOD, WHY DO I SUFFER? WHY CAN'T I JUST BE UP THERE WITH YOU? I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS SHIT ANYMORE. PLEASE JUST KILL ME. WHY WON'T YOU KILL ME?\" And as I began sobbing into my pillow, I heard a deep, gentle voice echo throughout my whole body, my entire being, and it said, \"No. I will not kill you. It is not your time, yet. You are loved, more so than you can ever imagine.\" \"THEN WHY?\" I retorted. \"WHY IS IT LIKE THIS? WHY DO I HAVE TO HANDLE SO MUCH PAIN? WHY IS THERE PAIN IN THE WORLD? WHY CAN'T YOU FIX THIS?\" \"It is not that I am unable. It is that I won't. I have called you for something special, Martha. Something amazing that of which you cannot fathom. You are put through what you see as unimaginable pain because I am here with you every step of the way to see to it that you will learn lessons and secrets of the world that many will not discover until much later in life. With these tools, you will be given an opportunity to serve me with potential that you yourself do not yet believe you are capable of. But it can be done, and it shall, as long as you continue to follow Me.\" \"THAT...STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY EVERYTHING IS SO TERRIBLE DOWN HERE.\"\"Ah, and yet, it does. I do not want weak soldiers, Martha. I want those who are constructed from the ground up, ready to march into battle with love and salvation in their hearts that they have carried from a thousand fires they have survived. Pain is not a punishment, Martha. Rather, it is an honor bestowed upon those who are strong enough to receive it, even though they may not believe it themselves. They will emerge from the fire with something more valuable than anything that could be offered to the flesh from the world: all of the wonders of this life, including kindness, bravery, loyalty, and love. True love. The purest of loves. And that Love is but of the Holy Spirit. And why do you think this is?\" I sniffed. \"Because they're walking with You?\" He chuckled, a beautiful sound filled with endless hope. \"Yes, my child. You really have grown. And had you not been given the trials of your life..\" \"...I would not have been praying to You about this,\" I mumbled, awe and disbelief filling my brain. \"I wouldn't need to learn the answers. They would just be handed over to me already. And there would be no point to Earth, or living on it. Without suffering there is only Heaven, and eternal paradise is something that is earned by having faith in the One who Created me.\" \"Well done, my child. I am pleased.\" \"But...I still don't get something.\" \"Yes?\"\"Why NOT? Why make everyone go through this? Why create Satan knowing what he was going to do to Earth? Why not just create those you know you will cherish and spend eternity with them?\" \"Hmm...Might I ask you the same question?\" \"What? What do you mean?\" \"You are a writer. I have gifted you with the ability to write stories and tell tales of a thousand worlds. Instead of using this gift to only write about good things that happen and lands of wonderful life, love, and happiness with no conflict whatsoever, you have chosen to write about pain, hardships, overcoming struggles, loss, betrayal, life--an imperfect one, at that--and what for? Why do you do this? Why do you create villains?\" \"...Because they drive the plot for a good story.\" \"And? Why?\" \"...And they show how characters develop, how they would react in certain situations, and how they grow and change. And even though I made them, their story is what's most important because it's what continues to build them into better, more four-dimensional characters.\" \"Do you love your characters?\" \"Yes. All of them. SO much. I mean, sure, some of them I sort of despise in a fictional way, but I could never un-love them. They make me happy in a way I can't describe. Although I have to put them through pain to make them better, I still want to hold them and tell them that everything will be okay in the end. I could ever take them out of the story or get rid of them. They've been through so much, and they're still kicking, and the ones that aren't are happy and in a better place. They sort of feel like my...my...\" I felt weak in the knees as the weight of all the stars of the universe crashed down on me. \"Your what, Martha?\" \"...My children.\" I felt my heart skip a beat. \"And that, my daughter, is why you are subjected to pain. Now get some sleep, my child, and be strong, for I am with you. I am the Lord your God, and I love you more than you could ever fathom. Goodnight, and sweet dreams.\" ",

            "answer_text": "The wisest thing anyone ever told me was fairly straightforward. There was no grand lead up, not dramatic story like everyone who\u2019s answers I\u2019ve read so far just so happens to have experienced. I was either fourteen or fifteen, and was in the living room of my aunt and uncle\u2019s house in northern Kentucky. It was a large room with large velvet sectional that took up most of the floor space. Several of us were sprawled across it, watching whatever football game was on that night. No recollection of who was playing, or even if it was an important game. The four of us, myself, two cousins, and my uncle, were conversing intermittently between major plays. And we got to talking about my cousin\u2019s recent work as a volunteer EMT, having just completed the relative coursework. He got to talking about the first time he was unable to successfully resuscitate someone who had sustained severe injuries in a head on collision, and the hopelessness he felt, the overwhelming sense of guilt. It had struck him how, despite all the training he\u2019d relieved, all the mental and emotional prep he\u2019d gone through, knowing that at some point he was going to watch someone die, that when the time game he felt completely unable to deal with the fact that he\u2019d\u2014in his mind\u2014 lost someone their life through inadequacy. It wasn\u2019t that he made any grand point, or espoused some life philosophy, but the way in which he expressed this discord between what he expected\u2014what he\u2019d prepared for\u2014and what he\u2019d experienced that made me realize something. No matter what prep you do, or how accurately you predict how something will make you feel, the visceral reality of experiencing the situation can often overpower any amount of reasoning or understanding on your part. It\u2019s incredibly hard to watch someone die for the first time, as I would find out a few years later at the hospital bed of an elderly relative. And I can only imagine that it must feel measurably worse when there\u2019s the niggling doubt in the back of your mind, tearing away at you for knowing that maybe, just maybe, you could have done something. I say that I must imagine that because I don\u2019t know for sure. And that\u2019s the point of this. No matter how much you take in, how much you prepare, how much you seek to learn, you never truly know until you\u2019ve been through it yourself. ",
