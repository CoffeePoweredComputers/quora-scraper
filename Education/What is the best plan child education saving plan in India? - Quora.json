            "answer_text": "So when you walk into the theater or watching some advertisements on the television you are nothing but pron to watch content which make you probably hit a call where okay tomorrow I\u2019m going to invest in a particular product for my child\u2019s future. There are various products in the market that you might think are suitable for investing in your child's future it could be a fixed deposit, it could be a PPF, it could be ELSS, it could be the Sukanya Samrudhi Scheme or some other government options a recurring deposit. I\u2019m not going to stress upon all of these today but I gonna be talking about the most suited one\u2019s that are ideally invested for children\u2019s education for the goal which is 8 years and beyond. My backing answer for all of these will be NO reason being that the money back plans to offer you very low returns over the period of time that you are investing which is usually over 10 years and upwards and also the life covering such policies are very low. Coming to the products which are called children\u2019s plans or child plans they are nothing but product peddled to us by insurance agents or others where your money is locked in for a period of time. These products might work for people who don\u2019t have the discipline of investing or they can\u2019t manage their money with the help of a financial advisor. My serious suggestion for you would be not to fall on to the trap of these money back policies, endowment policies, or children\u2019s plans. Because they probably not taking you any closer but actually furthermore away from their child\u2019s financial goal. So I wouldn\u2019t opt for to options of Fixed Deposit, a recurring deposit, and endowment policy a children\u2019s plans for the purpose of financial education. I would agree to a combination would probably be investing in a mutual fund and also on the side purchasing a term insurance plan. And I will break it down and tell you how the combination works. When t comes to investing into a mutual fund we often know what is the goal we are heading towards. So for a person who\u2019s a child is say 4 years old there financial goals currently coming up in about 14 years time. If suppose the child is 10 years old then their children\u2019s financial goal is coming up in 8 years time and hence both of them have to probably invest different amounts and have to invest in probably different products. All you have to do is choose the year where you think you might require that fund. I\u2019m putting a case and point 2036 assuming somebody\u2019s child is just born and I\u2019m assuming you might need about 75 lakhs at that point of time for their higher education. What I need to do is a simple calculation set aside 8000 Rs./ month starting now into a combination of various funds which are already recommended to you on the platform and get started on investing into this important goal of your life. I already spoke with you about how you must be investing into mutual funds and how if you\u2019re looking to build a corpus say Rs.75 lakh 18 years from now you need to start something as simple as Rs.8000 into SIP every month. so I did a quick calculation on MyWay Wealth app and let\u2019s assume your 32 years old mal adult looking to take a term insurance policy a 75-80 Lakh policy will come up as low as Rs.900 Per month.

            "answer_text": "I am a low-medium appetite investor and a parent of a single child. The best child education plan for me when I made an investment at age 36 was Canara HSBC\u2019s Smart Junior Plan. The best saving plan for a child is a subjective matter and differs with every parent as well as the goal of the kid. For instance, my child was 10 years old when I invested in this plan as he had a definite plan of becoming a forest analyst. As this is one of the rare and off-beat fields to pursue a career in, I knew I needed a high coverage child education plan for the requisite financial backup. I compared the premiums of similar coverage across the internet and found the one from Canara the most cost-effective choice. Also, it allowed me to determine the payouts as per the educational milestone of my kid. So, before you select the best scheme for your little one, I would recommend you to analyze: \u00b7 Your disposable income \u00b7 Number of years in which you would demand the monetary aid \u00b7 The goal of your child along with alternative career options that would demand additional money \u00b7 Research and compare on the internet to get maximum coverage at minimum premium ",
