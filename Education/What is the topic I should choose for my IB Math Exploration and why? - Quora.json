            "answer_text": "I\u2019d not beat around the bush and give this single trick since it\u2019s already January. Try to search a topic in \u201cPure Math\u201d. Do not combine it with other subjects. This might seem counter-intuitive to you, but here are the following reasons: Criteria A: Communication The coherence becomes easy since you do not have to switch between two disciplines. In trying to explain the theory, people do too much or use too complicated words for examiners (limited knowledge about 2nd subject) to understand. The coherence is poor then. Furthermore, you need to give depth of the other discipline to make sure its complete, hence your non-math mistakes can cost you marks too. Criteria B: Mathematical representation This criteria looks for proper notations, clear graphs, defining key terms, using multiple forms of mathematical representations (formula, diagrams, tables, etc.) This is the easiest criteria to score in, so whether pure math or not, you ought to get 3/3. Criteria C: Personal Engagement (PE) Pure math IAs help here, specially with less time. Some examiners prefer having proofs of actual experiments, or letters from where you have got data. But everyone understands that pure math explorations are largely theoretical. So this criteria simply becomes addressing your interests for the topic you\u2019ve selected. Regularly speaking in personal tone. Less problems with actual evidences, so saves lots of time. (Specially in India) Criteria D: Reflection Relating your exploration to the real-world and identifying possible errors/improvements is part of the reflection. With \u201cpure math\u201d, examiners understand that there is not a lot a student can do in this criteria. A good conclusion with one or two limitations should get full marks in this criteria. Criteria E: Use of Mathematics This is the part that makes the biggest difference (6/20 marks). Now, since you\u2019re doing a \u201cpure math\u201d exploration, your IA must be filled with mathematics. Psychologically, seeing a lot of math increases your chances significantly. In fact, my teacher (HL Mathematics Examiner) says that he\u2019s never found any exploration, except the pure-math ones, that deserves a 6 out of 6 in this criteria. People often get 3/4 here. All-in-all, I suggest one to do mathematics exploration in pure math topics. ",
