            "answer_text": "Philosophy and Logic education is needed almost everywhere. MBA is all about learning Problem Solving, Optimization and Economics Methodologies, which are applied to understanding and planning business and strategy scenarios, using both hard and soft skills. MBA Degree(if you prefer to call it by that name) prepares you to take up senior managerial / leadership roles and further enables you to explore the entrepreneurial side of your personality across different types of organizations. You after an MBA will be a Jack of all trades! the sheer confidence you derive and the Adrenalin rush you will enjoy, is simply not matched by my words. It is special to have an MBA from a world class university or business school. With a sound background in Philosophical and Logical Methods, you will be better able to understand the decision making processes, problem structuring methods, and problem solving models. Also you will be well equipped to do research and understand the moral and ethical dimensions of experiments with a training in Philosophy and Logic. However, it is not the norm for students with such backgrounds, to voluntarily study business and management sciences at Postgraduate Level. Real -World circumstances have pushed many into business schools, as working professionals take up various responsibilities, as they climb the corporate ladder. But, you must also remember, that MBA is a professional training qualification which is not really an academic degree, therefore, you might end up doing a degree or a diploma in Business Studies sooner or later in your life, without any formal training or background in Strategic Management. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "In my perspective there is no real connection between the undergraduate and the graduate courses you are planning to take\u2026 Just my view.. Being an academic related question, the best and probably the most accurate response I believe is obtainable from the school where you plan to your undergraduate course\u2026 Graduate course will be much easier to link if will taken from the same school. Other types of graduate courses are probably much closer like an MPH, or MHA which I believe is a master's in public health administration and masters in hospital administration.. ",
