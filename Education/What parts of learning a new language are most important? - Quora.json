            "answer_text": "I think the most important part is to set your expectation: whether you want to pursue it as a hobby or as a serious investment. That would help to define your approach to the new language. As for my personal experience, I learnt Spanish when I was 20 just as a hobby. I set the target to be able to use it in communication thus I spent 80% of the time talking to my teacher and learn vocabulary. I'm almost incapable of forming proper sentence in writing but quite confident with speaking and listening as from the very beginning that was my objective. So in short, bear in mind that it's nearly impossible to make a foreign language your mother tongue. Thus make sure you know how far you'd want to go with it to prevent yourself from disappointment if you don't see enough progress. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess a lot depends upon what you intend to do with it. To me languages are meant to be spoken and when I start learning a new one, I concentrate on the audio first then gradually shift into the reading and writing of the language. I like to compare it to the way an infant learns its native language. However, I do remember hearing about an official from France who worked in the embassy in Hong Kong who could translate written Chinese extremely well without being able to speak very much of the language ",
