I studied Computer Science in College and I was offered a Tech role and a Corperate Finance role at the same time. Not to brag or anything but to show you that its possible. I focused heavily on step 1 and 2 because it gave me the daily drive i needed to stay focused and confident despite my lack in merit (I went to an unknown state school, at the time I had very little CS courses (3) under my belt and only 1 Finance course under my belt) Also , I love helping people with anything! That being said feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or on Quora, if you need your resume reviewed or something! ",

The list of universities that have recruiters from JPM and GS visit is fairly long and comprehensive. Additionally, outside US they recruit in most major countries in Asia and Europe. In India they visit the Top four management schools, IIMs at A, B C and L. (quite a soup, there are 16 other IIMs) and also fairly flexibly for undergraduates, but I would not buy that profile. In Asia, the faster route would be thru education in Singapore, the best if you are choosing a foreign university is still the USA. There are three management schools of note and two of them have quite a rush of offers from Wall Street ( NUS and NTU) ",
