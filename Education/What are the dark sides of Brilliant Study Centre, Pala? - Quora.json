            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A! Honestly, this is a very interesting question. I would point out a few things that I have personally found \u2018dark', and please do read till the end if you can. The stress - The entrance world is super competitive. You never realise the gravity of it until you are actually there, fighting for the very limited number of seats. This has driven people crazy and I am not joking. Stress is inevitable in the competitive world. In Brilliant, you have exams literally every day, tons of rank lists pasted all over the wall - you find yourself at the top of some and at the bottom in some other.You feel motivated on some days and feel horrible on some other days. Some days, you just want to jump off a cliff. 2. Lack of individual attention - In Brilliant, we have class coordinators for every class - they are extremely kind people that we can always talk to whenever we want. Yet, I have often heard many complaining about the huge strength of the classes (90+ in repeaters) and hence, not everybody gets their fair share of attention or motivation. They try, though. 3. The partiality - I would never want to say this out loud but since you asked I might as well. Like every other coaching institute, the toppers are given a little preference over others; especially when question papers/books are few in number - they just choose to give it to those who come higher in the list. I would also like to mention that a very few number of teachers aren't very good. During my two years at the institute, nearly all my teachers were extremely extremely good but in the repeater's batches, not all teachers are that nice - probably because of the large number of students - so you must always be ready to put in some personal efforts to understand concepts by reading. There is one thing that I have always found saddening about this entrance thing- the false hopes. Its just everywhere. We hear a lot of success stories from everybody, but not many dare to talk about the other side of the coin - the countless people who have emerged unsuccessful despite the years of sweat and tears that they have put in. If you are from Kerala (or maybe, Tamil Nadu) and look forward to pursuing a career in medicine/engineering, Brilliant is always the right place to go to. The above mentioned points are dark sides of every coaching institute and they are inevitable. In Brilliant, the good overrules the bad. The quality of education is not even comparable to other institutes of the state, and you must never miss an opportunity to learn from the highly experienced teachers. Most importantly, Brilliant - in some way or the other - developed me as an individual and I would be eternally grateful to them for instilling in me the love for science. Brilliant Study Centre is a fabulous institute to study in. Joining Brilliant was the best decision in my life and I would be grateful to my parents for forcing me to do so. xD ",

            "answer_text": "Yah. Here is my list. If you don\u2019t have marks above the cutoff marks you won\u2019t get a seat in the Brilliant hostel ( which is a heaven) and you will be forced to take a seat with in PG. the first thing to remember when selecting a PG is to chose the nearest ones, I am referring to the PGs which are less than 500m from Brilliant. This provides you the opportunity to study in the Brilliant itself, uses the Libraries and use the PGs just for sleeping at night. You should spent the rest of your time at Brilliant.They won\u2019t give admission to everyone. Its entirely based on marks due to limit in seatsLast year they bagged around 90% results in Kerala, this means that when you compete with your classmates or batchmates, you are actually competing with KERALA, cause all the students who are going to get merit seats are already a part of Brilliant and are doing the coaching with you.Loosing direction. Brilliant is not an amusement park not they never guarantee you success. They just give you the best training and that's it. Success or failure is entirely depended upon you and your dedication.Never ending exams. Which is not a dark side but actually something I enjoyed. Its very tough when you compare with actual exams. You can constantly test yourselfOther than that there is nothing much to talk about Brilliant. It was a good experience and life turning situation for meIf you didn\u2019t got an admission in Brilliant don\u2019t be sad and loose hope. There is yet another institute with same caliber.
