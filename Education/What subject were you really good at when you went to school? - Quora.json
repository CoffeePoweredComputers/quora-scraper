            "answer_text": "Well I\u2019m still in secondary school (I think junior high in America) and I usually get full marks in Science, Design Technology Graphics, Computer Science, Food Technology and French. I usually get high marks in English, Maths, Drama, Art, Music, History and Geography. Although PE isn\u2019t assessed by exams, I usually get quite high levels in sports; however, in track and field I\u2019ve never been good. I\u2019ve had a lot of changes since primary because in primary we don\u2019t learn Science that often but I got full marks in Maths and Computer Science. In English I was usually top of the attainment ladder. This month I will be picking three subjects for GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) but I have no idea if I will do Computer Science or Geography for option one. Also, for options two and three I don\u2019t know which of these to pick: French, Business, BTEC Health and Social Care or Design Technology Graphics. P.S. Sorry for any mistakes because this is my first answer in a very long time. And I have also typed this on my phone. Have a lovely day! Edit: I submitted my options form a few weeks ago and those who would like to know, I have chosen Geography as option 1, French as option 2 and BTEC Health and Social Care as option 3. My substitute options for 2 and 3 are Business and Design Technology Papers and Boards. Edit 2: I have gotten my options and I received Geography, French and Design Technology Papers and Boards. ",

            "answer_text": "In elementary school, I though I was so good at everything. Especially math- I knew my addition, subtraction, and times tables by heart. Then came middle school. I realized that I can't be great at everything, and started to think I was really bad at math. In elementary school, they bore everyone except the slowest students because they want everyone to be at the same level. In middle school they just go by the curriculum. Which is why my self confidence plummeted in the sixth grade. I got used to it, though. I learned that though I wasn't great at math, I was reasonably good at it, given some hard work and dedication. So I don't know. I consider myself decently good at all subjects\u2014 I just learn what they give me and I pay attention. Cheers, Rose ",
