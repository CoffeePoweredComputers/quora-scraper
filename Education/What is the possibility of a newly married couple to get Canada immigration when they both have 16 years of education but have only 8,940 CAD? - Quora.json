            "answer_text": "You can check your eligibility for Express Entry on this page of the Immigration Canada website. This questionnaire only asks about the absolute minimum requirements to qualify. Do you want to come to Canada as a skilled immigrant? You\u2019ll see that one of the questions is about finances. If you don\u2019t have enough, the program will tell you that you are not eligible. This requirement to have enough money to support yourselves in Canada as new immigrants is mandatory. It is one of the basic requirements. New immigrants to Canada do not qualify for any government support. It can take time to settle in a new country and find work, so bringing savings to support yourself during that time is essential. Immigrants without re-settlement funds are not admitted to Canada. The requirement for re-settlement funds is waived if the arriving immigrant has a guaranteed job waiting. But it is very unusual to be able to obtain a job from outside Canada before arrival. Most immigrants are not able to do that. If you\u2019ve both been in school for 16 years, I am assuming you each have a bachelor degree. Before you go much further with your plans, you should each complete the questionnaire on this page. Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) tool: skilled immigrants (Express Entry) To receive an invitation to apply as an immigrant to Canada, you must score 470 or more points. If you are scoring less than 470 points, you will need to enhance your qualifications. I also saw a reference to a teaching career. Be sure to research requirements to teach in Canada. Foreign trained teachers must complete upgrading before being licensed to teach in Canada. Here\u2019s an example of the requirements from one province, Ontario.Internationally Educated Teachers You can find all the requirements to apply starting from this page. The Immigration Canada website has step-by-step instructions on how to apply. Applications can be made online.Immigrate to Canada Immigrate through Express Entry Be aware that Canada is currently in recession with very high unemployment so you should have more re-settlement funds than usual. It could be very difficult to find a job. ",
