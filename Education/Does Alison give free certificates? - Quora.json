The courses do follow industry standards, but it is up to your particular employer whether they choose to recognize the ALISON Certificate or Diploma as legitimate proof of knowledge.Alison certificates, in the US at least, range in cost from about $19 for the PDF download to $60 and up for a framed parchment certificate, delivered to you.

Most on-line training providers for professional qualifications will give you a course-completion certificate, but that\u2019s not the same as accreditation. The completion certificate simply confirms that you watched the entire course, whereas accreditation in a subject confirms that you passed an exam to affirm your knowledge. ",
