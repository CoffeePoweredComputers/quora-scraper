            "answer_text": "Not at all. Any age is considered appropriate to get a bachelor\u2019s degree. The younger you are (late teens/ early 20\u2019s), the more advantages you have in terms of advancement in the workforce. However, many people who begin college straight out of high school choose a major which they later regret having chosen. I was one of those people who chose something that I later did not want to continue pursuing. Once you reach your 20\u2019s, you usually have a better sense of who you are and what it is you desire to do with your life. You also know the workforce a little better, so it is more likely that you will choose a degree stream that is practical, and not choose something just for fun. On that note, do be intelligent and wise about your choice of majors. Don\u2019t pick the easiest or most enjoyable option. Way too old? Absolutely not. You\u2019ll be 5 or 6 years behind others in getting a career in order, although in the long run, people will be going back to school, regretting their decisions, traveling, finding out their first degree was useless or not right for them, exploring life a little, raising families, changing careers, the list goes on and on here. In short, 24 is not at all old. In fact, no age is too old to gain an education in my opinion. Older students often have more insight and maturity on their side. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. And, the people who take time off enter college with a maturity level, work ethic, and sense of purpose far above their peers. They are almost always successful. when you graduate (say at Age 30), you are about 15 years younger than the point where age starts to hurt you. But even then, if it\u2019s combined with job experience, age won\u2019t hurt you. Especially if you\u2019ve reached the point where you need a degree to advance further. keep in mind, too, that just having a degree doesn\u2019t get you a job anymore. You have to have experience to go along with it. Consider 2 people: guy goes to college at 18. Graduates at 22 with a logistics degree. Goes to work in a warehouse driving a forklift. After 7 years on the job, he begins to be considered for a management job since he understands the company AND has a degree. Degree finally gets used.Guy goes to work in a warehouse at 18. Tops out in pay quickly at age 25. Can\u2019t move up without a degree. Gets a degree. Walks straight into a management job at 29 (Same age as guy number 1).",
