A device or computer equipped with an eye tracker \u201cknows\u201d what a user is looking at. This makes it possible for users to interact with e.g. computers using their eyes. With eye tracking, we can humanize our technology. There're plenty of amazing new functionalities waiting just around the corner with eye tracking. You\u2019ll be able to point, select, zoom and do actions in faster, easier, more natural ways than you would with the mouse or touchpad - also enabling entirely new features. Your cursor is always where you need it and the whole Windows interface seems to anticipate your next action. It can also give indications about the person\u2019s presence, attention, focus, drowsiness, consciousness or other mental states.With eye tracking, we can humanize our technology.

            "answer_text": "Eye tracking is a sensor technology that enables a device to know exactly where your eyes are focused. It determines your presence, attention, focus, drowsiness, consciousness or other mental states. This information can be used to gain deep insights into consumer behavior or to design revolutionary new user interfaces across various devices. Not only is this great for gaming, but I like the fact that continuous eye tracking can be used to identify health issues like mental disorders and detect fatigue and assess effectiveness of stuff like clinical treatments.
