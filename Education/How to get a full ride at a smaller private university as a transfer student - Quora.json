            "answer_text": "Not exactly easy\u2026 but\u2026 Step 1: Start your college career at a Military Junior College (MJC) in the Early Commissioning Program for the US Army Reserve or National Guard. If you have a 3.0 GPA, an 1100 on the SAT, and are in excellent physical condition you should be fine for admission. If you are lacking in one (or more) of these areas, then now is the time to improve. Any of the following schools are fine. Georgia Military College Marion Military Institute New Mexico Military Institute Valley Forge Military College Step 2: Attend ROTC Basic Camp in the summer after your senior year in high school and before your freshman year in college. I think all of the MJCs have a quick introduction on campus before sending everyone to Fort Knox. There are a lot of YouTube videos on this course (which is about three weeks plus in-processing and out-processing). Apparently the Army has a lengthy handbook on what to expect. Step 3: Return to your MJC and do well physically, in military requirements and academically. The institution can set its own definition as to what doing well means. There is a giant Army Regulation that sets some minimum standards. You can read these if you have trouble sleeping at night. Step 4: Attend ROTC Advanced Camp in the summer after your freshman year and before your sophomore year in college. Again, there are a lot of YouTube videos on this course (which is about three weeks plus in-processing and out-processing). The Army has another handbook on what to expect. Note how different the two courses are. Basic camp covers such topics as how to be hydrated and get a haircut. Advanced camp covers a lot of troop patrolling techniques. Step 5A: Return to your MJC and finish well physically, in military requirements and academically. You must earn an associates degree within four semesters of beginning at your MJC. At that point, you get commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in either the Army Reserve or the National Guard. BTW, 70% of the people who showed up at Basic camp with you have now dropped out, so you are doing really well to get this far. Step 5B: Get accepted to a College with a Senior ROTC program. Being responsive to the original question, you want to find a college where the Army will pay for your tuition and the College will pay for your room and board. Norwich University has an elaborate program in place for this and has a nearby reserve unit for you to work at while you are in the Army Reserve. Young officers gain new perspective at NU. Step 6: Finish a bachelor\u2019s degree within three years of matriculating. You only technically have two years to get a bachelor\u2019s degree (which is very hard for a transfer student). But, the Army is merciful and will give you a waiver for a third year if you say please. Now, you have completed your bachelor\u2019s degree with a transfer getting a full ride. Enjoy your time in the Army Reserve or National Guard! ",
