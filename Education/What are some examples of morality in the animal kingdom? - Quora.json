            "answer_text": "Morality exists only in the animal kingdom. Ever heard of murder, arson, rape of theft in the wild? Morality as we humans are made to understand, pertains to fidelity. There are no marriage vows exchanged in the natural world. Sex is for propagation of the species & not dirty as believed in human world. Marriage itself has its roots in economics & is at variance to natural laws. ",

            "answer_text": "Human beings also comes under animal kingdom if you're asking why no sense of morality in animal kingdom except human beings then.. In short- because they are not as complex as human beings. In long- Where ever you are living try to look at people are very very poor or else look at beggers. They don't have a place to stay they don't have food. You don't even know what they do and where they find the food which they eat. So if your need for food or shelter or protection from surrounding doesn't get met. How will you think of all the other matters in this world we call earth and even place outside of this earth. In animal world it is always about fight for survival Even if you feed a lion or tiger an entire wild beast, do have the balls to go into his/her cage? No this is why animal kingdom psycology is not complex compared to human beings . We come in animal kingdom too but we are the apex in the food chain and everything. We are more more complex in thinking and doing things then they are. We think about past present and future. All the animals in animal kingdom not, they live in present only. Although the sheer amount of willpower any mother in animal kingdom has to protect her children is visible and admirable. Morality is a tool for people to construct a better world. If your always thinking of survival then the topic of morality never comes up. I maybe not an expert on the topic but i know a thing or 2. ",
