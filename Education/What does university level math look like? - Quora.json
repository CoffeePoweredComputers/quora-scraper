            "answer_text": "Grade school and high school math includes arithmetic, algebra I & II, and geometry. College/university math includes college algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry, calculus, and differential equations at the base level. Then any other type of mathematics is possible. There would perhaps be 25 different subjects covered in regularly offered courses. Other subjects could be arranged in seminar or individual study courses. Some courses in statistics, physics, and chemistry would overlap with mathematics. You may wish to explore the Wikipedia article on mathematics: Mathematics - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "It's a really complicated question, though I can give you my intuitional discrepancy between the maths in mathematics department and others\u2019. It is that in the latters, math is about how to utilize it in different realms and levels, and in the former math is all about how to prove it\u2014\u2014both the known and the unknown\u2014\u2014 and hence about mathmatics per se. Then, that's why I found it difficult, and switched my major from math to literature. ",
