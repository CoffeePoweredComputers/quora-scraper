            "answer_text": "First, I don\u2019t stare down. I look. I try to have no emotions, I try to show no emotions. I look\u2026 \u201cWe are not amused.\u201d I hardly \u201cLike\u201d it, but it is much better than the alternative. You see, Classroom discipline is like a poker game. The teacher ALWAYS has the best cards, but ALWAYS loses when they have to play them. You see, if a Kid Misbehaves, I can get them quiet by looking at them, talking to them, yelling at them, kicking them out of class, and so on. Everything I have to do costs me time and energy. The less I have to do, the less time and energy I need to spend getting that little idi\u2026 Uh\u2026 Darling under control and back to the lesson at hand. The end goal is to make sure I do not have a melt down (get really angry), because that is how the kids win the game. They get a bunch of time off of work, they get a floor show of me yelling and screaming, and they get to see all of those wonderful colors\u2026 on my face. That is a big loss for me. Now, the point of the game from my point of view is to end the distraction and use as few of my cards while doing so. If I can get a kid in line by looking at him? Big win! If I can keep him in line by keeping an eye on him? BIGGER WIN. Teachers use the stare because it works, it costs us nothing in power, time, or energy, and in most cases, it works. ",

            "answer_text": "Nonverbal communication can be powerful. It takes a relatively large investment (time, energy, motion, closing myself off from helping a student) if I walk over to a student and confront them about their behavior. It also straddles the line between subtle and visible. Anyone who\u2019s paying attention is aware that a student is getting \u201cthe stare-down\u201d, but it\u2019s also silent and non-confrontational enough that it gives students an out, providing an efficient and effective resolution to a burgeoning problem.
