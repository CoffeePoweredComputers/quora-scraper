            "answer_text": "Teachers can see the date and time when something was submitted and worked on. So the system does keep track of dates and times. Providing teachers with documentation to show, this is the date and time, when something was posted or uploaded or completed. Now what happened with you is you didn\u2019t click the \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f button. So the system thinks you were working on it but never actually turned it in for grading. And that\u2019s why the system is saying it\u2019s late. However, your teacher can look at it, see it was fully completed, and just give you full credit by realizing you must have forgotten to hit the \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f button. But then again, your teacher may just see the late submission and date it was last worked on or accessed, yet treat it as late because it was your fault for not hitting the \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f button. If you haven\u2019t already done so, I would suggest you contact your teacher and let him or her know what happened. But it\u2019s still up to the individual teacher how to handle it because it was your own fault for forgetting to click the \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f button. So one teacher may understand and give you full credit. Another may understand yet still not give you full or partial credit because it was your mistake not a system problem or teacher error. ",

            "answer_text": "It shows the submitted date which will be considered late. You may have a way to show it was completed before the date depending on the nature of the document you turned in. If the program used to create the document has a last edited or saved on date and time you could at least show it was completed, but not turned in on time. We could also open a debate on what is the most important, your mastery of the assignment or the amount of time it took you to finish? With many of my students receiving extra time, I've allowed all to take extra time and grade primarily on how well they master the subject. ",
