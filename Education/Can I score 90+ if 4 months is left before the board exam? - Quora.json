            "answer_text": "Surely , there is no one in the world who cannot achieve this 90+ in 4 months before the boards (Exception if you scored less than 25%, please just think about passing the examination than). But as you are asking this question , you surely are from those lot of people who are too skeptic about their capabilities , Throw all the negative thoughts out of your brain and start working . A man who thinks much does not end up doing much . Please avoid yourself in a situation where u will be asking the same question 3 months before the examination , according to one of my great teachers every delayed month in your preparation from henceforth will result in a decline of 4 percentage .
