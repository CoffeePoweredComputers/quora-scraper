You'd gladly suffer no end of torture, and come back for seconds, to spare your child's life. You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.  Knowing that my child had hurt or killed someone else would break my heart, keep me awake nights, and require a lifetime of therapy to unpack what I had done wrong as a mother. But compared to my child dying, knowing my child hurt or killed someone else would be a mere blip on the radar. Losing my child would end me. ",
