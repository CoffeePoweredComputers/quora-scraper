            "answer_text": "Ah, yes. It is completely okay to do BBA after your 12th. I was a PCM student preparing for my engineering entrances when I realized that it didn't really interest me and it was then that I realized I wanted to do BBA. Now, you may face a little problem when it comes to accounts in the first year because your classmates from commerce backgrounds have prior experience, but don't worry. Putting in even a little extra effort and you can easily do well in your exams. I had a problem only in the first semester of the first year and I scored well without any tuitions and people who did join tuitions for accounts scored even better. So don't worry about it and given your science background, your analytical skills will be far superior compared to anyone from the commerce background, so when it comes to stats and operations etc., you will definitely score well. I would highly recommend doing BBA after 12th. Do let me know if you need any other help, cheers! ",

If you are going to opt BBA then there will be normal subject but in honors you are going to get on extra subject which would be considered as kind of specialization. There are various universities which are providing this course. But it will be advisable if you do your degree from a well known university and that provides prime placement opportunity, outstanding exposure and professional enhancement training. I can enlist some university for your help - Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar SRM Institute of Science and Commerce-Chennai Institute of Management Studies-Noida Mount Carmel College-Bangalore - Bangalore These universities provides extensive learning programs and exposure to the students. They also provide worthy scholarships to its students depending upon the entrance test taken of the university or board result. I hope it helps. ",

BBA is a good option if you are planning for a career in management, want to take over your family business or start your own company. It is a very good option in the current scenario where non science and non engineering programs are getting recognition in terms of rigour and opportunities. I would recommend to try a non traditional BBA, like the one we offer in VIT-AP School of Business. The students go through many liberal education courses, workshops and field work which builds a strong foundation on which management courses are built using experiential learning approaches.

This also opens up multiple channels for you, as you are in a very good stage of a career to decide the path and direction of your career. You can switch to commerce background courses like BBA, B.Com., also go to the professional courses like CA, CFA, CS and ACCA.
