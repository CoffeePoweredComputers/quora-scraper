            "answer_text": "I'm kind of already a teacher, but as a substitute teacher I've never been with one class for longer than a month. So, here's what I'd love to teach full time: Psychology: this is what my college degree is in, what I taught as a teaching assistant, and what I absolutely love to talk about. I would be thrilled to teach high school AP and regular Psychology.Speech/Public Speaking: I was a super shy kid, and only in the last few years have I discovered how much I enjoy teaching students how to present their thoughts and ideas. I\u2019d love to show teens how to shape their message for the audience to understand and remember it, or ways to work through anxiety.English: especially British and American literature and non-fiction research, but I would teach anything to do with reading and writing. I actually like editing and grading as well, which is a plus when students turn in hundreds of pages of essays every month.Health and Sex Education: which might surprise some people who know me. Guys, American schools have horrible sex ed. Even the kids tell me that they can get a better health education by going to Urban Dictionary. I know how to openly talk to teenagers about their health and bodies without getting embarrassed or flustered\u2014 which, where I am, seems to be the main requirement of a health teacher. The rest is just staying informed.",

            "answer_text": "Life & Common Sense. Yes, I made that subject up. But I really think this is a course that kids need to learn nowadays. We teach many things in school, but we don\u2019t teach our kids how to get through their everyday lives. This problem is getting worse and worse\u2014 even college graduates nowadays have trouble managing their own finances, filing their taxes, or buying a house. They don\u2019t know anything about the skills that any responsible adult should know. Ask a fresh MIT CompSci grad to explain the difference between a 1040, 1040a, and 1040EZ\u2014 you\u2019ll be shocked that they don\u2019t even know what the hell you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s a serious problem. Life insurance, home insurance, health insurance, car insurance, retirement prep, daily communication skills, etiquette, emergency prep, first aid, changing a tyre, cooking, laundry, sewing, healthy eating, exercise\u2026 you know, basic life skills?
