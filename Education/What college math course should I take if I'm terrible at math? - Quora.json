            "answer_text": "The one you're prepared to take and succeed at. The information you've included in this question simply isn't enough for us to know what course that would be. What does \u201cterrible at math\u201d mean? If I ask you to find fifteen percent of twenty dollars, can you do that? Can you figure out how many square feet of carpet you need for a 10\u20326\u2033 by 11\u2032 room? If I say 2x = 3, can you tell me what x is? Can you graph an equation like y = 7x + 2? Do you know what distinguishes a rhombus from a rectangle? Can you find the length of a hypotenuse, given the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle? Do you know how to calculate compound interest? Can you factor polynomials? Did you do any trig? Universities typically offer a math placement exam, which will assess what skills you currently have, and which ones you still need to develop. If you can't figure out on your own which course you're ready for, take the placement exam and see what it suggests. Then there's the question of why you're taking a math class at all. What do you want to learn to do? Do you want to calculate velocities of tossed baseballs? Understand surveys and polls? Use spreadsheets to balance business accounts? Determine how much of chemical A you need to mix with chemical B? Different math classes serve different goals. Speaking to a counselor at the university can help you figure out which pieces of math you need for the fields you're interested in studying. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on why you are taking the course, and why you are bad in math. If you actually wish to improve, the answer will differ, and a tutor might help a lot. If all you want is to pass a required course, business math could be worth considering, if you are good at memorizing, but poor at concepts. When I was a teaching assistant at Ohio State, I taught Business Calculus, before I learned to avoid it. Nearly all concepts were censored out of the course. But it did actually require more memorizing than the calculus taught to math, engineering and physic majors. Rather than teaching any real problem solving, they taught you a formula to memorize for each topic on the exam. If your memorization is no better than mine, you would be better of in another math course. ",
