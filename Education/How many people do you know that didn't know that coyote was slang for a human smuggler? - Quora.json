            "answer_text": "(A2A) Not many. This meaning of \u201ccoyote\u201d is not on the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue here in the northern Northeast, but most have heard it used in that sense. I live in the Northeastern region of the continental US, right up in the northern tier. We don\u2019t hear about human smuggling very often around here, although I have no doubt that it happens. Nearly all of the illegal migration that occurs in the region is in a northern direction, out of the United States and into Canada. Most of the migrants trying to enter Canada are undocumented individuals and families who have been living in the US illegally. The Canadian government does not like this activity one little bit. They really do not like people entering their country without permission, and this was true even before the border was closed due to COVID. They promptly arrest anyone who they catch, but in contrast to the practice in the US, they treat such people humanely and do not go to extraordinary lengths to torment or terrorize them. The language associated with human smuggling is not a regular part of the vocabulary here. With that being said, most people in this region are aware of the slang meaning of \u201ccoyote,\u201d although they may need to pause for a second before they recall it. It is a word that they associate with activity on the Southern (US/Mexico) Border, which is in the southwestern US and thousands of miles away from them. Problems down along that border have been a prominent part of the national news for several years, so even people in parts of the country that are this far north and this far east have been getting informed about them all along. The language of border control issues has accompanied that steady influx of news coverage. So yes, people living along the northern tier of the Northeastern US have been exposed to slang terms like \u201ccoyote.\u201d The word normally conjures up images of the wild canid among North Country residents, because that is something they encounter every day. Canis latrans is all the place. But if you make the context clear and give them a second to think about it, residents in this part of the US will recognize that other meaning of the term. ",

We were hunting in south Texas when one of our group was approached by a group of 65 illegals with their Coyote leader. They ran into the brush and waited for us to leave. A border patrol agent showed up and spoke out into the brush. Five of the illegals walked out. The agent strapped each one into a seat belt and waved to us as he left. I asked what just happened since I didn\u2019t speak Spanish. The border agent told them he only had seat belts for five. If five gave themselves up the rest could go. The talked among themselves and five walked out. The most fit five of the group. They would be sent back into Mexico. As soon as they could they would recross the border and rejoin the group and continue north into the USA. ",

I know quite a lot of people, none of whom live in the US or Mexico, let alone in that border region. I can therefore state with some degree of confidence that, out of the several thousand people I know, none of them knows about this specific piece of slang usage. The world is quite a big place, and most of it\u2019s inhabitants don\u2019t live in America. I know - weird, isn\u2019t it? ",

I\u2019m sure that even in the US the term might not be well known as you go awy from the border states\u2026. you would have to poll people in Montana and Nebraska to get an idea. ",
