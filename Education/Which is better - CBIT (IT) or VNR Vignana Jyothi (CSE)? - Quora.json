            "answer_text": "Keeping the college aside , I can safely assume that you completed your +2/intermediate just now and you are in a very confused state .. and the pandemic just made it worst .. I passed out from vnr vjiet so my answer maybe a bit biased towards it .. CSE or IT have the same subjects ( maybe they differ by one or two for the entire engineering course ) so whatever you choose you\u2019ll be studying the same .. coming to the key differences between cbit vs vnr, both are autonomous colleges and have a good reputation , cbit is affiliated to OU( Osmania university) and vnr is affiliated to JNTU . let\u2019s come straight to the placements .. in the next coming years the placement into this IT will be purely on skill set ( it\u2019s been always the skills from day one ) but companies like tcs , Wipro , Infosys etc have made their placements online , i.e you should pass from coding rounds and interview with your skills , they don\u2019t care which college you\u2019re from .. so regarding placements both offer good opportunities. I don\u2019t know much about cbit eca and cca but , vnr has 28 student clubs , a good sports complex and everything for your eca and cca stuff .. coming to your answer , I would choose anytime vnr CSE .. it\u2019s better with syllabus , faculty , placements, eca,cca and everything.. you can enjoy your life hat vnr hope you got your answer. peace \u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Well, IT and CSE are quite closely related branches. So what you should consider is the value that the college will add to your engineering. Although CBIT does have a brand name, being a student of VNR and having seen closely how CBIT works as well, I would suggest you to join VNR. It has got a better campus (personal opinion). The placement/Internship opportunities are well off. Also, the senior support is strong. Also, it is quite important that you know this, at the end it really doesn't matter which state college you study in, what matters is your knowledge and enthusiasm to learn and do something. ",
