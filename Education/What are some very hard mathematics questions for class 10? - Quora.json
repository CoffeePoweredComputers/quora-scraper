            "answer_text": "There are no hard questions, just the important concepts, what cbse does in mathematics paper is that they mark concepts from different units instead of whole syllabus, now after they have marked the concepts they ask questions on them with a allround approach they would twist the concept ( it doesn't mean changing values of example of the concept) but they would change how the concept would appear in a question, the concept will be same in book and exam but the question asked will be of different pattern, cbse does this to check the understanding of the student about the concepts, the easiest way to crack any cbse class maths exam is to go through some previous year paper and instead of checking the repeated questions look for repeated concepts on which the question are asked.
