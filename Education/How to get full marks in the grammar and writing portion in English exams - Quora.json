            "answer_text": "Grammar is all about logic and rules. There are many simple ways to tackle the grammar part of any paper. The first technique is to choose an answer and try it. Try reading the sentence and see if it makes sense. If your english skill is sufficient to understand complicated texts, this technique is a winner. Another technique I earlier used was to translate the text mentally into a languahe I was more comfortable with, then use trial and error again. This also works provided you are proficient in another language. Now writing questions are subjective i.e. there are no \u201cPerfectly correct\u201d answers, and it is the examiner's discretion to award whatever marks he or she sees fit. Having said that, there are certain pointers to maximise your score: Formatting is everything. Follow a proper format to the t.Creativity matters here. Both what you express, and the way you express it, carries marks. \u201cContent\u201d and \u201cLanguage and Expression\u201d are actually prescribed scoring criteria.Try to make it enjoyable. Most examiners will enjoy reading well-written answers, and this may incline them to a little more generosity.Hope that helps. Good luck. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no way of mastering your grammar other than reading lots and lots of English text. This will be much, much easier for you if you have an inclination towards reading story books, grammar will be a piece of cake in that case. Grammar is like instinct, if you go wrong somewhere, you\u2019re gonna have an idea instantly, that something\u2019s wrong. I am a fan of fiction, thus grammar never really posed a problem for me, in fact, it was my strength. My teachers used to praise me for the perfect grammar in the tests I wrote, you couldn\u2019t find one mistake in that department. If you are a student of organic chemistry, alongwith English, I would like to point out a common thing both possess. If your knowledge is complete, there is no problem that you can\u2019t solve. However, if it isn\u2019t, you\u2019ll keep faltering. ",
