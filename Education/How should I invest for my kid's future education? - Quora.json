            "answer_text": "Not sure if you're looking for financial advice or early education advice. I have no expertise in finances but I can help with early education. The biggest thing you can do is read to and with your child. Start young, before they have any idea what you're saying, if only to establish the habit. In my experience, this leads to children reading early and more important loving to read. While no one really loves reading textbooks, all the practice will make it easier to get through the countless textbooks they will read over the years. Reading also exposes kids to new ideas and helps develop critical thinking skills. While many will suggest limiting or eliminating television and video games, it's been my experience that the amount of time (within reason of course) matters far less than the content. Especially when they're quite young, choose educational content for your kids\u2019 screen time. There is plenty of this available these days and it's all pretty easy to recognize. For me, I chose everything my kids watched and played until age ten or so, easing in more \u201cfun\u201d stuff here and there. Now they're still really receptive to educational content. The last thing I'll suggest is involvement. It can be really difficult if you're working but every little bit counts. Get in touch with your kids\u2019 school, the teachers and administrators and ask what you can do to be involved. Ask your child about their classes and help with their homework. Do your own refreshers as they get older so you can help them with their geometry or chemistry. The more involved you are, the earlier you will figure out when your child needs extra help. Even the brightest kids have weak spots so being able to identify those sooner rather than later will give your child the best chance of overcoming them before they become a problem. Your involvement also tells your child that their education is important to you and thus is more likely to be important to them. ",

By the time Bill was 20, he was by far the youngest computer expert in the world. Gates seized the day, making the most of the opportunity, and revolutionized our world. Think about this: The private school Bill Gates attended as a child was one of the only schools in the world with a computer! How different would our world be today if Bill Gates had had no access to these computers? What would his career look like? Could he have revolutionized a different industry? Maybe or maybe not. To answer your question, how should we invest in our kids\u2019 future education? Bill Gate\u2019s story is the perfect example. In our changing world, today it\u2019s more important to expose our kids to future opportunities versus giving them more worthless \u2018information\u2019 found online (traditional education.)

            "answer_text": "I presume this question is being asked from a financial perspective, as opposed to education advice. If it from a financial perspective alone, then the easiest way is just to get started asap. If you invest over a period of 16, 18 or 20 years, you have a much better chance of paying for college or university fees due to compounding. The problem is, education inflation in the US, India and beyond is much higher than general inflation:  This chart shows the situation over a long period of time:  So it is best to: Start earlyStart with an aggressive asset allocation which is aligned to stocks more than bondsOverestimate how much you will need as opposed to underestimatingNever panic if markets are down and your accounts are suffering for a few yearsMake sure you are investing in a tax-efficient structure such as Junior ISAs if you are living in the UK. Most governments have similar schemes.On another point, the world is changing at a quick pace. These days people need a combination of formal and self-education. So some of the kids that are best prepared for modern life aren\u2019t just focusing on conventional education. A lot of research has came out which has shown how activities like learning languages, instruments and reading can be more vital to kid\u2019s development than merely focusing on academic abilities. And let\u2019s not forget that teaching kids early on about financial literacy, if done in a fun way, is one of the best gifts you can give to them long-term.
