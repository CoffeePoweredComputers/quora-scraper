            "answer_text": "The IB program is a huge benefit, especially when it comes to applying to Universities internationally. It is recognized very highly and many universities prefer a student from the program. Additionally, a lot of the first year university courses are taught in IB. So, university will be much easier for you compared to if you were in a regular program. More so, a student getting a 90 average in the regular program compared to a student getting a 90 percent average in IB. The IB student in the IB program will have a much higher chance of making it. IB could easily be a deciding factor when universities are going over your application. I would highly recommend joining the IB program if you have the chance, it is an amazing that you will not regret in the future. That is if you re willing to work extremely hard, the program is very intense and rigorous, there is a lot of workload. Though, it is very beneficial in the long run. ",
