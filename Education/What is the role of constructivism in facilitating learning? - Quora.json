            "answer_text": "Constructivism is often misunderstood - the belief behind that being that children are just put into a room full of materials to explore with no planning or guidance. In reality - constructivism supports planning and guidance. The main idea behind constructivism (constructing one\u2019s own knowledge) is that children are offered open-ended materials to explore and discover (we all learn better when we can use all of our senses). However, the materials are chosen intentionally and purposelfully to meet the needs of the individual children in the classroom and the overall age group. Guidance by teachers is also based on what they know about their students and the age of children they are teaching. Constructivism is NOT a free for all. It involves planning and assessment and more than just putting out paper, pencils and books. ",

            "answer_text": "Constructive and destructive learning are both dangerous. Construction gives value and destruction destroys it. See the world most of the beings are in either modes. The only way to learn clearly is observing by neither constructing nor destroying. The world will be a better place to enjoy life. ",
