Even if you fill up the form & anyhow qualify the written exam then during the documents varification at the SSB centre you'll be returned back & will not be allowed to give the SSB. During my 1st SSB at 4AFSB VARANASI, there was a boy who had just started class 12th. He was sent back from the gate itself during the documents varification. You can appear for NDA (II) 2019 though.
