            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an assault against a minor who cannot consent to the action. If the minor cannot drink, smoke, puff, or indulge in sexual relations (all good laws) they why should they be allowed to consent to being punished? The answer is they cannot, so any punishment of a child is perforce an assault, whether law will prosecute is another question altogether. Another reason to not punishing children is for many of them it will trigger behaviors later in life that they may not have control over, and they may choose to avoid. As for many of them: The upshot is: the creation of a large and thriving market for BDSM videos and the services of professional dominatrixes. Many men and quite a few women love fantasizing about being punished by an authority figure. In my case I have a wife who enjoys playing mommy and teacher to me as much as I relish the feeling of being bare bottomed over her knees while she lectures me telling I\u2019m a naughty boy as she stings my ass with her hand and then a ping pong paddle \u2014 and sometimes harsher implements! Just writing these words is exciting. Had I not been punished by my parents, two teachers, and a friend of my mother\u2019s (from church \u2014 I spent many hours as a teenage boy over her lap), I might have had a more vanilla sex life. I\u2019ll never know. I am a being open and honest because if I can convince one parent, or authority, to think about how they are affecting the sexuality of young people under their charge, and not to physically punish them, then I will be happy. Every child should grow up and make their own choice regarding their sexual desires and activities, and not have some adult make it for them before they can consent. ",
