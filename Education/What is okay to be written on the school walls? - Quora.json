As mentioned by Maxene Kupperman-Gui\u00f1als, inspiratinal quotes an interesting facts are always uplifting. Other things that could be done. Those old things called borders, that used to be either painted or papered just below the ceiling. One could use those to say put up the alphabet of different languages or basic words and their meanings in different languages.Student general use (with guidelines) bulletin boards and permanent notices for regularly occurring school and community events are great things too.Tasteful student made art is a must have feature of a welcoming and warm hallway. That being said turning the whole hallway into an overtly large and/or messy art collage may have the opposite effect. The goal is to show coordination, bonding, and communal ties between students and the school.These suggestions are all things I\u2019ve seen at learning institutions I\u2019ve attended both exceptional and lack luster. Even in the lack luster ones these things foster a much more productive environment. ",

            "answer_text": "In one school where I taught, I hated the blank walls in the hallways. Kids pass them every 45\u201360 mins, and they might like to look at something fun. I checked with the administration, and I took a lesson from billboards and put up posters about subject matter. So every month or so, I would put up little factoids or quotes from subjects kids were studying. They liked it! Emily Dickinson wore only white and stored all her poems in a trunk. \u201cI cannot live without books.\u201d Thomas Jefferson Ask your math teacher about Gauss! Lewis Latimer worked to develop the light bulb. 61 degrees F.=16 degrees C.; 82 degrees F.=28 degrees C. Easy way to remember! How many months have 28 days? (All of them!) And like that\u2026 You can\u2019t write directly on the walls, but you may be able to enhance the environment! ",

It is vandalism to write anything on the school walls, because school walls are part of the public school property and not your property, thus writing on school walls is considered defacing school property. I don\u2019t care what you write on the school walls or what you use to write on school walls, I don\u2019t care whether what you wrote on the school wall was nice or not, I don\u2019t care whether you wrote on the school walls in pencil or not, IT\u2019S STILL VANDALISM!!!!!
