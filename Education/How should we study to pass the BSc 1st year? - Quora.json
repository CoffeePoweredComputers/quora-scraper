Coffee shops, libraries, parks, or even just moving to the kitchen table will give you a change of scenery which can prompt your brain to retain information better.Keeping a calendar helps you plan ahead\u2014but you\u2019ve got more going on than just homework assignments! Make sure you\u2019re marking your extracurricular, work, and social commitments, too. (Tests, band practice, away games, SAT dates, half-days and holidays are just a few examples of reminders for your planner.)If you\u2019ve got a big assignment looming, like a research paper, stay motivated by completing a piece of the project every few days. Write one paragraph each night. Or, do 5 algebra problems from your problem set at a time, and then take a break.Come up with a system and keep to it. Do you keep one big binder for all your classes with color-coded tabs? Or do you prefer to keep separate notebooks and a folder for handouts? Keep the system simple\u2014if it\u2019s too fancy or complicated, you are less likely to keep it up every day.When will you take the time to do your homework every day? Find the time of day that works best for you (this can change day-to-day, depending on your schedule!), and make a plan to hit the books.When will you make the time to do your homework every day?

            "answer_text": "You can definitely get a good mark in the first year of Bsc if you studied Hard. According to me, \u201cHard work is the Pilar of success\u201d. I can give you a real life example which happened in my own life. I am a B.Tech (information technology) student. In my 1st semester, there is a subject called \u201cEngineering Mathematics\u201d. The subject was not so much Hard. So one of my batchmates(He is a very good student and he got an impressive percentage in his ICSE higher secondary examination) started neglecting this \u201cso called easy subject\u201d. But I studied Hard and practiced all topics of maths with attentive mind. When the results came, my \u201cthat batchmate\u201d got supply in the \u201cso called easy subject\u201d and I got the highest mark in \u201cEngineering Mathematics\u201d. Last but not least, Don't neglect any subject and don't neglect your study. Best of luck for your future journey. Hope for best. ",
