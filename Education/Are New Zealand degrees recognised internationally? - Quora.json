            "answer_text": "John Godfrey\u2019s answer/link is good, but there are several issues to consider. First, as his linked article points out, for the purpose of professional accreditation, there will probably be problems, to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the profession. Obviously a NZ lawyer would be ill prepared for the totally different legal system in the US, but a doctor would have (should have!) fewer difficulties, and so on. Worst case scenario, you could find yourself having to redo perhaps all but one of your years of study to \u2018transfer\u2019 a NZ professional degree to another country. Second, if you have a more general degree, there is little problem getting it recognized as a \u2018real\u2019 and bona fide degree, particularly for immigration purposes. But what I have found, in my own experience, is that both my NZ educational qualifications and also my NZ work experience are of little value here in the US. A degree from the University of Otago, for example? Who in the US has heard of that university, even though it is one of NZ\u2019s only two medical schools and has an excellent business school. A degree from Yale? That\u2019s an easy sell. Or even a degree from the University of <insert any US state name> at least has some sort of name recognition. But NZ? Note also this comment is shaded further by NZ\u2019s educational \u2018inflation\u2019 such that what used to be polytechs - something akin to perhaps US community colleges - can now award degrees. There is also the surprising situation that in the US, most undergraduate degrees are four years in duration, whereas in NZ they are only three (although I doubt few employers dig down that far or even know that). NZ has good educational standards. But, internationally, while NZ is definitely not viewed as a \u2018degree mill\u2019 that includes \u2018print your own\u2019 degree forms with every box of cornflakes, it is also not viewed as a country with outstanding educational excellence. TL;DR If you simply want to get a generic degree, NZ\u2019s moderate educational costs and three year degrees will quickly get you there. But if you want an internationally recognized prestigious degree, perhaps NZ is not the place to go to. And if you need a degree as part of a professional qualification, be sure to understand how your country will treat a NZ qualification. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Are New Zealand degree's recognised internationally? I worked for a few years as a teaching fellow at Otago Uni, then 12 years or so as a lecturer in a polytechnic degree program. I know a LOT of people who went to work overseas. It\u2019s a kiwi thing. So far, I have never heard of anyone saying that their degree wasn\u2019t fully recognised. I\u2019m sure someone might come up with an edge case anecdote - it\u2019d be extremely rare. It just doesn\u2019t happen much. Yes NZ degrees are recognised all around the world. As for snipes about Polytech degrees, the entire time I was there our programme had more than 90% employment of graduates by the start of the next academic year. Much higher than any university success in the same field. I actually do value a broad uni degree over the focused Polytech approach (selecting many topics outside major - anyone doing compsci+infosci+math etc is doing themselves a disservice). However the Polytech degrees are valued as highly by employers as any university one. Academic snobbery doesn\u2019t actually pan out to be true in reality. ",
