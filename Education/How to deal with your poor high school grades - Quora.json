            "answer_text": "A2A Work harder and smarter, or\u2026 Lots of advice in the world about working harder \u2014 spending more time studying, less time on things that keep you from studying or use up brain cells for chemical recreation, getting a study group together or hiring a tutor, etc. If lack of effort is the problem, they can help. I always advise working smarter. Talk to your teachers! Let them know you care about doing better and listen to their advice on how to focus on what they want to see for the grade. If they are creating their own tests, learn what parts of the material they tend to focus on for exams. If they are using exams from the textbook company, pay attention to section headings and any review questions in the book. The grade game is about giving the grader what they want to see. You can study until you have deep understanding of most of the material and still get a bad grade if you miss the part the teacher is looking for you to show. My lowest grade when earning my doctorate was in a course I took in the evening 3 hours from home and work. I could barely make it there in time for class and then would get after midnight. The problem was that the prof made heavy use of materials they put on reserve to read at the campus library and I could not get there. I went to the local professional library for the same subject and worked hard. But, there would always be some part that was in her materials and not in what I found on my own. I learned a lot from her and invited her to the celebration when I passed the final exams on my dissertation. But, the point is that I failed to get the grade I wanted because my studying was not matching exactly what she expected to see in the responses. Grades are about giving them exactly what THEY want to see, not what we as students think is important. See if there is a way to know your teachers better and focus your work on what they want. The or? If you work as hard as you can, work as smart as you can, and still get low grades\u2026start planning your future accordingly. And, I DO NOT mean the smart aleck, \u201cGet ready to dip fries for a living.\u201d Some people wisely choose a high paying trade that matches their ability to do things instead of academic work which does not match their best way to perform. But, some just need more time working on the foundational material and do well at a community college, then decide whether a degree from there will get them where they want to go or else transfer to a better university when they are ready. Sometimes we are asking people to learn things at an age (even in high school) their brain development is just not ready for and there is nothing wrong with the student. Some people find that mathematics that refused to make sense in high school becomes much easier to learn in their twenties. Best of luck whichever plan fits you! ",

            "answer_text": "I struggled with some subjects in high school. Finally, I figured some things out. I realized why I was very good in my favorite subject. I used the skills in that subject and applied them to my weak subjects. I accecpted help. Sometimes I just needed things explained in a way the teacher could not express. Sometimes learning from a peer was easier than learning from a professional. I started from scratch. This was very simple, yet very difficult. I began from the beginning of the textbook reading the introduction. I had a fresh notebook in front of me. I read carefully, and took careful notes. These notes were for me so I used methods that made sense to my brain. I did every end-of-chapter task. I began to grasp the subject. I kept doing this every free minute until I was caught up to the class. It meant that I did my chores, my schoolwork, and nothing else. What got me through it was knowing this would not be forever. One of the most important things I learned was understanding how my brain liked to learn. I also learned that if I was not comfortable with a subject by the second week of class, that was when I needed to ask for help; for me, things would not improve on their own. I learned the \u201csky would not fall;\u201d although life would not be fun if I messed up, I could learn to adjust and to cope with difficulties. ",

I decided not to care for school grades - after all, school grades can\u2019t feed me, right? If you want to go with the second option, it requires making a Plan B. Your parents are not going to subsidize you forever, especially since you don\u2019t \u201cstudy\u201d in school, and finding a decent job is very hard without formal education and without skills. To put it simply, you need to show your employers you will be a better candidate than \u201ceducated\u201d people. Here is my Plan B:  Learn to code Make a game, app or a website to demonstrate my skills Start a company or get a job in software developmentSo far, this plan worked flawlessly. Thanks to my disregard for school, I found many great people from many different industries who have given me job offers and helped me expand my horizons and changed the way I think. If you want to follow a similar path, you must look for alternative ways to get skills, network and make money. The path to success is long and sometimes frustrating, but it is very rewarding. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m extremely perfectionist. Wich is great and awful at the same time. So I don\u2019t deal nicely with bad grades and bad results. I usually push myself as much as I can to do my very best. And when I don\u2019t do great I punish myself maybe to hard. Sometimes I put college above my family, my health (physical and psychological), my love life, my friends. And that sucks, and sometimes I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m doing it until I blow. I\u2019ve been observing that every day, that we students have been killing ourselfs over grades. We are more depressive and suicidal than ever. THAT\u2019S NOT EVERYTHING LIFE IS ABOUT you know? I think we need to care less about theese number (or letters) affect us. A test result doesn\u2019t define you, doesn\u2019t make you a better or worst human being. It\u2019s hard to realize how much we are not gentle to ourselves, and we should. It\u2019s hard to change habits, specially in such a competive society. College and school should be PART of your life, not what all your life is about. ",

Haven't they talked or mentioned anything to you? If not, you could mention that you need help. Your guidance councelsor should be involved. Have you talked to him? The basic questions are: are you reading and thinking and then understanding the material presented in class, are you doing the homework assignments, taking notes, paying attention in class, asking questions? Also, not everyone can get terrific grades, either. It takes effort-- and sometimes even with effort you may just get by. Instead of trying to tackle all of this at once, ask one teacher\u2014 the one that seems that would help you the most \u2014 and ask if she could set aside 10 minutes to discuss a strategy or a step-by-step process to help you improve your grades.

Maybe you could focus on something else, if academics aren\u2019t your forte. Like a hobby, or extracurricular. Also, remember that your grades won\u2019t be very inportant down the road, unless it\u2019s for your last year in high school and your grades are very bad, in which case you might consider repeating the year or really dedicating more time to study for the rest of the school year.

Drink lots of plain old water! At the very least a liter of water a day. Cut way back on the caffeine! Get some exercise. Walk, outside. Get lots of fresh air. When you do these things you will physically be ready to learn. Sit at the front of the class. Take lots of notes. use a highlighter to note things the teacher repeated. Ask questions and participate in class activities. Get a study buddy. Get a tutor. Talk to your teacher about extra credit work. ",

Then, figure out whether you are reading for comprehension, retaining information, understanding how to express yourself in writing, etc. In other words, so many steps go into learning and passing tests, and hence, earning grades. Get someone to help you sort out where you\u2019re going wrong so you can start working effectively and competently. I wish you well. ",
