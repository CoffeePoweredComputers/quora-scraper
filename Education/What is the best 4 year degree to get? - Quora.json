            "answer_text": "The best degree to get is the one that satisfies the following criteria: It must teach you something that you have an interest in learning regardless of all other factors. This requirement needs to be fulfilled to help sustain motivation for the long four years of hard work. It will also help you from dying inside.It must be something that the applicant has the aptitude and skills to accomplish. There is no point in doing something if you will fail from the start.It is economically useful. Excluding the rich and exceptionally gifted, most people can not afford to just go to college for personal discovery.It needs to be affordable. Sinking thousands of dollars into debt can cripple your long term future.If the degree in question satisfies the three criteria mentioned above most for an individual, then that is the best degree for themselves. Not everyone is the same, so there is no perfect one size fits all degree that can be above all others. With that said if I had to rank the best classifications based on my personal view: Pure Mathematics \u2014 The hardest degree to obtainTheoretical Physics \u2014 The second hardestEngineering: \u2014 The perfect mixture of Business, Science, and MathsThe other sciences \u2014 Chemistry, Biology, Ect.Medicine \u2014 Very honourable, but a lot of pain and memoizationLaw \u2014 Some people are just made for it.Business and Economics \u2014 This has the potential to change the world.Some liberal arts. \u2014 There must be some that are good.Accountancy \u2014 Will always be needed, but the job seems soul-crushing, only some should apply.The rest of all other degrees.",

            "answer_text": "Whatever you do, figure out what you are passionate about. Also, figure out what you are good at. Combining the two is a powerful combination. To make the big bucks, you really need to stand out in your career. That\u2019s why it\u2019s absolutely critical that you are passionate about what you are doing and that you excel at it. My best college mate majored in Political Science. For a couple of years he worked on political campaigns making hardly any money. But he was really passionate about what he did and was going to do it anyway. And he excelled. In a few years, my friend was earning over $200,000 per year as a political consultant. A few years after that, he started his own political consulting firm and now brings in over $1,000,000 per year in revenue. If you want to make the big bucks someday, there will be times throughout your career that you\u2019ll be relied upon to absorb a lot of information quickly, all on your own, and to act on it to make decisive decisions. So you better love what you do! Further, grades are only a tool to see how much knowledge you obtained and a tool to get you into graduate school. Keep in mind that learning is good for you. If possible, acquire a broad education. The more knowledge you obtain, the more it will only help you throughout your life: college, graduate school, and long career. Often by overspecializing too soon, your focus becomes too narrow too quickly, and that severely limits your knowledge. It is important to note that the biggest scientific discoveries often come from an interdisciplinary approach. That means broad knowledge. ",
