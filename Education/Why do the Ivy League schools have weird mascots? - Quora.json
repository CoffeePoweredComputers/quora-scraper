            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say the Ivy Leagues have any weirder mascots than other schools\u2014 Yale has a bulldog, but MIT has a beaver. Princeton has a tiger, but Northwestern has a wildcat. And so on. The main point of having mascots is to inspire school spirit. It\u2019s a rather American tradition, but at any large American university, particularly one with an emphasis on sports, the mascots are hugely important in showing pride for your school. The Ivies tend to have more recognizable names, which is perhaps why their mascots are more well known. ",
