            "answer_text": "Indrani, An environment that is consider BAD for learning is one that is NOT conducive to learning. An enviroment that is BAD for learning is automatically DOOMED. You need learning settings (stations) with ample teaching materials and tools to match each student learning needs by grouping them. Outstanding teachers use a nice low voice tone -that will cause students a must to listen quietly. Seeing progress is wonderful from the teachers\u2019 labor and showing care for the students as to making sure they can comprehend well enough to make the lessons more fun and not Boring. Student involvement helps to make a positive impact in & on the lives of all -whereas a good teacher uses probing to get students to understand very well. The learning environment must always be CONDUCIVE TO LEARNING> Parental involvement is also important for the parents visiting the classroom to help encourage the students to do well. this is more so to : References to Elementary grades, Middle grades, and High school. Do please note that all learning environments should be CONDUCIVE to learning for any age group. A clean spacious classroom that can allow students to be placed in the appropriate learning groups to benefit them comfortably without stress is also important. Not an overcrowed classroom of no substance. Lessons taught should be revisited to make sure that ALL the students can teach it back to the class & teacher as a way for a teacher to be able to evaluate the students progress as to whether students gained an understanding about lessons taught. All above plays a major role in making a classroom environment conducive to learning for each student to accomplish a goal succesfully and the teacher as well will also shine brightly as an excellent classroom teacher.

            "answer_text": "Hi. I'm not a teacher, just wanted to answer the question. When we talk about bad environment for learning, two scenarios come to mind.  Scenario 1: When the teacher is solely focused on how to get you through the examination. There was this teacher at my school whose motto was: MUG-UP THE ANSWERS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING. She would make us read sections of the chapter out loud, mark the portions from where questions frequently come and just never bother explaining what the hell we were studying. She would skip entire sections because she felt too awkward about teaching the topic. Yes, she was a biology teacher. The worst thing is if you ask her something you were genuinely curious about, and she didn't know the answer to the question (which was quite often), she would just dismiss it as unimportant. If that isn't crushing one's curiosity then what is?  Scenario 2: When teachers are overly interested in the student's personal lives. Let me say it once and for all: what a student does in their spare time, out of the school boundaries is none of the teachers\u2019 business! This teacher saw my friend with a girl, on the weekend and just straight up assumed she was his girlfriend (she was not). AND THEN HE CALLED OUT MY FRIEND IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS, \u201cI saw you with your girlfriend yesterday. She's pretty.\u201d I kid you not, then he smirked. Creep! My friend was so embarrassed he couldn't even speak up. I lost all respect for the teacher at that instant. ",
