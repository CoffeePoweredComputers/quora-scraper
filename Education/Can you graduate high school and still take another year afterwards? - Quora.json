            "answer_text": "Yes, you can still graduate and still return to high school for either a semester or another year. It\u2019s not considered to be a bad thing to take a fifth year of high school as most students don\u2019t really know what to pursue once they\u2019ve finished high school and enter adulthood. This is what some students will often call a \u201cvictory lap\u201d. If you don\u2019t know what to pursue in post secondary education, or wanted to get into another program, or boost your GPA to get into college or university, then some students will often take an extra year of high school. Another reason is you didn\u2019t meet the 40 hours of community service needed to graduate. In my case, it was a bit of both along with student apathy or burnout that set in senior year. Even if you graduated and met all of the requirements needed, then you can still come back for a victory lap as a part time student as the Ontario government has set a limit of 34 credits for students taking a extra year after earning the minimum of 30 credits needed. Either take two courses per semester, or four courses for the semester for students who do take a extra year as a full time student. Even though Ontario got rid of the fifth year of high school and reduced it to four years along with reintroducing standardized testing, about 20,000 students who graduate high school in Ontario often take an extra year. In Toronto, that\u2019s about 2,000 students who do graduate and return for a fifth year. They do make up about 86% of the graduation rate while students who only take four years of high school make up about 79% of the graduation rate accross Ontario. \"Victory Lapping\" in the Time of Austerity Getting Results ",

            "answer_text": "The only people who would be able to really answer this would be the guidance counselors at your high school. All I know is that \u201ctook 5 years to graduate from high school\u201d is not a credential most people would want. That being said, my question is why you would want to do an extra year at all. As a rising sophomore, you still have plenty of time to improve all of the things you listed. Even if you totally blew your freshman year, you\u2019ve still got three more years to go, and I\u2019d personally assume that taking full advantage of that time and dedicating yourself to succeeding both academically and in some extracurriculars would be much more impressive to colleges than taking a whole extra year just to marginally improve some of your statistics. Think about it; as soon as the admissions people at [insert your dream college here] see that you needed 5 years to graduate from high school, they will immediately want to know why, and if you don\u2019t have a good reason (which this really isn\u2019t), then that will reflect poorly on you, and might actually hurt your chances. Another issue that you might face if you were to pursue a fifth year is one that I and literally everyone else I knew in high school faced as well: burnout. Senioritis is real, and, odds are, by the time you get to your fourth year, the mere thought of going through another one will make you physically ill. You will get tired of high school, and nothing would suck more than watching all of your classmates graduate and get on with their lives while you have to sit and rot for another year. My advice is this: Most people don\u2019t really try that hard in high school. So, if you really buckle down and dedicate yourself to both your studies and to any extracurricular activities, you can do more in the next three years than most people do in all four years, which would of course make a fifth year completely unnecessary. Also, if you get to your senior year and still don\u2019t think your stats are good enough, do what lots of people do and graduate anyways, then take a gap year, during which you could get a job/internship, volunteer, take community college courses, etc. This would give you plenty of extra stuff to put on your college application without having to wither away for another year in high school. My point is, there are many ways to try to shore up a college application, and a fifth year of high school is probably one of the worst. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Once you complete your high school requirements, they\u2019re going to graduate you and you\u2019re stuck at the class rank you earned. The school district won\u2019t get any more money to let you stay in school. And, frankly, they don\u2019t want you there anyway. I have a grand nephew in Oregon, who do to the pandemic, essentially was done with classes when school closed in March. A few weeks later, he received notice that he was considered graduated. Done, that\u2019s it. Not even an opportunity to finish what was started in January classes. What you could do, is to take some community college courses. Go in person if you\u2019re close to a school. Definitely take online courses if it\u2019s not feasible for you to commute. By the way, check into your state\u2019s Dept. of Education programs. In my state, high school Juniors and Seniors can take two community college courses for free. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely. In many cases, there are good reasons for doing this. A high school classmate of mine was a very good halfback. He got in with a sketchy group who had a bad influence on him. His grades declined until he barely passed Senior year. He did a PG year at a local private academy. He did well enough as a PG that he was recruited by Columbia University to play football. Subsequently, he had a very well-paid career in financial services. ",
