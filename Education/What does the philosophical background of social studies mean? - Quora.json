            "answer_text": "Each person understands and interprets their own philosophical backgrounds when it comes to studies. I would say that the general background is an understanding of humanity, its interaction within the environment, geography, history, sociology, other cultures, political studies & sciences, religious influence, and an overall understanding of the human psychology. People have constantly yearned for more information in their conquest & exploration of their existence. The idea of critically analyzing their circumstances and finding solutions to their problems is usually essential to the human curiosity. These advancements & explorations create a more productive way to live in a society that meets each person\u2019s essential needs. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a convoluted way of saying someone is studying or practicing philosophy with a historic perspective. Which is saying nothing. Everyone gets their perspective from history, they either blatantly copy a historical perspective or disagree with it to try and come up with their own. But history defines your philosophy no matter how you try and approach either topics. ",
