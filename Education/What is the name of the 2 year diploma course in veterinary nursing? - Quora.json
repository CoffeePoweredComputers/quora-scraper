            "answer_text": "I am going out on a limb because I am confused with the veterinary and nursing combination. I believe the 2 year veterinary program would produce a veterinary tech to assist and work with veterinaries in the pet care area. The 2 year nursing program would produce a nursing degree as a ADN or ASN. ADN is Associate degree in nursing and ASN is a Associate in Science Nursing both of these produce RN\u2019s who are ready to walk in a hospital and begin caring for patients. I started with a EMT, LPN, ASN and then BSN and a year toward my Masters in nursing. ",
