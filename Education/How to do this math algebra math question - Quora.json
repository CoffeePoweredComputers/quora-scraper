            "answer_text": "(i) Find a common denominator, then combine and simplify: f(x) = 3(x + 1)/(2x^2 + 7x - 4) - 1/(x + 4) =3(x + 1)/[(2x - 1)(x + 4)] - 1/(x + 4) =3(x+1)/[(2x - 1)(x + 4)] - (2x - 1)/[(2x-1)(x + 4)] = [(3x + 3)-(2x - 1)]/[(2x - 1)(x + 4)] = (x + 4)/[(2x - 1)(x + 4)] = 1/(2x - 1) (ii) swap x and y, then solve for y: y = 1/(2x - 1) x = 1/(2y - 1) 2y - 1 = 1/x 2y = 1/x + 1 y = 1/(2x) + 1/2 (iii) The range of f(x) is the domain of f inverse. For f(x) = 1/(2x - 1) on the restricted domain x > 1/2, the range is y > 0, so the domain of f inverse is x > 0. (iv) f(g(x)) =1/7 = 1/(2g(x) - 1) 1/7= 1/(2ln(x + 1) -1) 7 = 2ln(x + 1) -1 8 = 2ln(x + 1) 4= ln(x + 1) e^4 = x + 1 e^4 - 1 = x ",

            "answer_text": "A good place to start: the way the problem is written suggests 2x^2 + 7x - 4 = (x+4)(2x-1), though I\u2019d suggest confirming it first. Part (i) involves finding a least common denominator, but with polynomials instead of integers. Finding the inverse function will just require solving for x in terms of f(x), and then swapping their places; remember that with rational functions, the domain is all x values where the denominator is not zero.
