            "answer_text": "When you get a loan from any one an interest will be charged on that. For example if you got a loan for Rs.10000 , the agreement will say you have to return with an simple interest of 12% p.a. Then you have to pay Rs.1200 at the end of the year till you repay the principal. But if the agreement says the interest rate is compound interest of 12% p.a. on half yearly rests, then you have to pay Rs.600/- at the end of the half year , if you failed to pay the interest the 12% interest will be calculated on the unpaid portion of interest till you pay it off. If you pay the total interest at the end of the year in this scenario then you have to pay Rs.600 for the first 6 months interest + you have to pay an 12% interest on Rs.600 which you did not pay till the end of the annum i.e. additional Rs.32/-(interest on interest for the 2nd half year) + Rs.600/- on the 2nd half year period. Totally it would come Rs.1272/-. In compound interest , it is dangerous when you fail to pay in due dates.  jovially we say in Tamil \"Vatti Kutti podum Iyya\" meaning \" Compound interest will deliver its children if you not paid the principal and interest in time\".  So one must be careful. ",
