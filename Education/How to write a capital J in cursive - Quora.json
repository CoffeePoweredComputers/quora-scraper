            "answer_text": " Cursive \u201cJ\u201d is part of what I call the KaZAKHI Family, a series of similarly-shaped capital letters. Lowercase \u201cj\u201d is part of the \u201cJupiter\u201d family:  The letter shapes include what we call plein and d\u00e9li\u00e9 strokes. Plein strokes are thick downstrokes made by holding the pen (a fountain pen with a square nib or a marker) at a 45 degree angle, and d\u00e9li\u00e9 strokes are their thinner partners.  This style of writing is taught in French and other European schools starting in kindergarten (many French people are uncomfortable with crude American-style print writing). The stroke diagrams above are taken from a book I have composed in reponse to a similar Quora question (soon ready for publication).
