            "answer_text": "I think it's hard because most people don't understand what math is. What is math? Very early on many people end up on the wrong track thinking that it's about correctly applying the rules. But what math is all about is actually very different, it's about asking \"what are the appropriate rules?\". For example, many people will just learn that a negative exponent means flip the fraction... but why? Why is this the \"correct\" way to define negative exponentiation? Because you want [math](x^2)^{-2} = x^0[/math] and so  [math]x^{-2} x^2 = 1[/math]  which means [math]x^{-2}=[/math][math]1/x^2[/math] (bonus question: why should [math]x^0=1[/math]?). People should be doing this from elementary school. You shouldn't be memorizing the cross multiplication rule for adding fractions, you should understand why it works. You shouldn't memorize the quadratic formula, you should know how to derive it using \"complete the squares\". You shouldn't memorize FOIL, you should know it's just the distributive law. When people get to calculus, the number of rules that start piling up are too much to simply memorize. The thing is, mathematicians aren't \"memorizing\" them, they just understand why they have to be true, and if that's the case remembering mathematical rules is like remembering where you grew up: how could you ever forget something that's obviously true? But if people were on the wrong track for so long, it becomes hard to ever get your brain working correctly. If they do make it through calculus, when you finally get to theorem-proving mathematics, the entire study is about making definitions and understanding consequences (i.e. making sensible definitions and deriving the appropriate rules). Some people have been doing this their whole life. Others were just memorizing rules... and it is hard to ever overcome. I think this really shows that early on we should focus not on students \"learning\" so much math, but rather understanding the math they know. You should be able to ask a 3rd grader \"why do you flip fractions when you divide them?\" and get a  sensible explanation. If they say \"because the teacher said that's the rule\", that's a warning sign. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a boy, a long time ago now, I was a happy go lucky lad and I knew I had to go to school. When they brought out reading, and writing, I did very well. Art, well, I did okay, Geography, History, Science - I always aced these subjects. Arithmetic, math, algebra, and all of their relatives were beyond my ability to understand. I am not a stupid person as my IQ was measured at 123. My brain just hated to wrestle with numbers when I was young. So in my case, math was hard because I had a disability. Today, I still can\u2019t do algebra, calculus, and whatever comes beyond that but I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide with the best of them and so far in my life no one and I mean no one has ever asked me to multiply two negative numbers or do much of anything in base 12. So, if a person is having trouble with math, that\u2019s OK. Do not give up on it, I didn\u2019t. Rather learn the basics and you probably will be able to make it through life with that. ",
