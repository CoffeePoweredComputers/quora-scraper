            "answer_text": "Because in 90% of the time, that's the only social interraction students get with people outside their class. Japanese students start school at 8 o'clock, usually finishes at 16 o'clock, then they either go home and study, or go to their club, actually have a social life, untill about 18 o'clock, and then go home and study. It's basically the only time not spent eating, sleeping or studying for the poor bastards, and the schools know that, which is why most schools encourage club activities ",

What is seen as a problem?\u3000I'd like start thinking about it if you tell me. ",
