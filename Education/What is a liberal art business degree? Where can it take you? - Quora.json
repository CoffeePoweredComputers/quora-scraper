            "answer_text": "I have an AA in liberal arts and an AS in business\u2026 I paid ~$20k for it and I am now working in the goulags at a factory\u2026 $15 an hour. It\u2019s not a glamorious office job or whatever, but I earn my keep. I can also (shocking) afford my lifestyle. The bachelor\u2019s gets you into a damned if you do situation\u2026 I kept my debt low so I could fall back on high school jobs. Once I pay that debt off, I can go again\u2026 or not. It\u2019s nice too because you gain experience while supporting yourself. You appreciate people who bust their asses every day to put food on the table\u2026 With a Bachelors being almost 66% more expensive you are in a situation if you\u2019ve borrowed where you are desparate for a \u201chigh paying\u201d job. So, 4 years at university put you at the point where \u201chigh school\u201d jobs wont pay the bills. You gotta play smart. As to your question, liberal arts (if done right) gives you immense soft skills\u2026 while the business gives you money prowless. So you are literate as much as a 4-year student, and have a smidgen of a specialty. The business part teaches you the way to invest though they wont outright tell you\u2026 you can use ALL of it for investing\u2026 I got informed for a 1/3rd of the price of university\u2026 I can afford living on high school job wages\u2026 and use my \u201cuseless\u201d education to put myself ahead\u2026 ",
