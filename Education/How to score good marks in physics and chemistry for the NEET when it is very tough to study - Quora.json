By concentrating more on specific areas you can score 120 plus in physics and chemistry in neet by concentrating more and working more on specific areas . When you give a reading of a particular chapter in any of the 2 subjects first practice previous year questions to know where to concentrate more . Concentrate more on physical chemistry and organic chemistry to score more and work more on these. In physics know the trend and weightage of each chapter from 11 th and 12th grade and work on 100 marks worth chapter severely. By practising hundreds of mcqs in those chapters. Make short notes for each chapter during coaching time for easy revision. Doing these can guarantee 100 plus marks in physics and chemistry simply After having grasp on the basic concepts of NCERT the more helpful option is to opt for the \u201cM-learning study material\u201d because its one the best platform to get a shear Knowlegde for the preparation of the medical entrance exams and it just gives you a better level of preparation and proper guidance.
