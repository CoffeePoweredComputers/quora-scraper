            "answer_text": "Well, in terms of course material, IB courses - especially at higher level - will cover material that you would take in your freshman year of university, and even to some extent some of the material you'd take in sophomore year - but this obviously depends on your major and what courses you take in particular. For example, Math HL and Physics HL have helped me a great deal with Calculus 3 and Electromagnetism (a third of the material in Calc 3 was something I'd already taken in math HL), not to mention that I could skip Freshman year. In terms of all the coursework (IA\u2019s and EE), I think that's where the IB helps the most. It improves your time management skills whilst also teaching you the skills necessary to write detailed reports and essays, A LOT of which will be done in university and to a more rigorous extent. But, you will already be more or less prepared - to a decent extent - and won't have to learn things from scratch. While the IB DP is only somewhat comparable to university, it is that \u201csomewhat\u201d that really prepares you for what awaits you in university, in terms of course material and more importantly, the workload and coursework.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that there are any perks as commonly understood. The main advantage is that the student has been challenged and can be proud of not only having been but having succeeded. Colleges also like it when you apply or admission, and parents get to brag. Maybe you get a special shutout at graduation, something that will be meaningless in about 2 weeks later ",
