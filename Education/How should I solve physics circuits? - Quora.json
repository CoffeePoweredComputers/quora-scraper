            "answer_text": "Methodical approach . Set out what perameters you do know and those that you don't \u2014 next set out rules; usually in formulae format. Depending on the physics problem: Forces, Electrical, energy conversions etc. the rules will be set out with forumulae. Work through the indivual problems until each unkown variable is solved. There are usually more than two ways to solve particular problems so use all \u2014 you should reach the same answer if you've done the excercise correctly. good luck! ",
