            "answer_text": "Zero effect. Same for my college grades and my grad school grades. That doesn\u2019t mean yours won\u2019t have impact. Not suggesting you should not put forth considerable effort. But grades count in school and for school. If you need a high quality degree from a name school\u2026but do you? If you are going for a job in academia or research, maybe so. But if you plan on getting a job once you have one job under your belt it\u2019s all based on what you\u2019ve done there. You get hired based on what you can do. Grades are utterly irrelevant, in over forty years I cannot once recall being asked about my grades, and not one time did I ever ask any potential employee about theirs. If you did poorly, then get into whatever school you can, and focus on doing well. One year of good grades and you can try applying to transfer to a school you\u2019d rather be in. Unless you were going to be all A\u2019s all the time, and that\u2019s ok but it\u2019s grind and not all fun, there will always be someone with better grades anyway, and competitively you won\u2019t be chosen for that. So be chosen because you\u2019ve lived an interesting life, done interesting things, or just learned to work hard and do the academic thing. There are lots and lots of second chances here. But if poor high school grades have ruined your life I suggest you look up \u201clife\u201d and see what it means. Your life isn\u2019t ruined by your HS grades, and even if it\u2019s affected by them, you might instead think on how you have DIFFERENT opportunities and how you have learned from your mistakes. There\u2019s a heck of a lot of life after high school, and I\u2019m telling you this as a 70 year old man who graduated more than fifty years ago. Now I just hope I don\u2019t screw up my dotage\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "My high school grades definitely permanently changed the trajectory of my life. My favorite music schools rejected me or accepted me with poor scholarship offers and I couldn\u2019t afford to attend, so I went to CU Denver instead. I hated the music program there for a lot of reasons, and I continued to do badly because I had no idea how to study, so I switched into English and continued at UCD. I could\u2019ve transferred somewhere else, but my grades weren\u2019t good enough until late in the game, and by that point I figured it was easier to complete the English degree I had an overwhelmingly positive experience in the English department there so I figured I\u2019d keep the party going. But, this would've been avoided had I done better in high school. So, no one cares what I did in HS. I can\u2019t put any of that on my CV and be taken seriously. But the grades did have an enormous impact on the rest of my life because UCD was life-changing for all sorts of reasons, which are far too personal and off-topic for me to share. I\u2019m not restricted from doing what I want now, though, because there is a life outside of schools and I\u2019m blessed with amazing friends who helped me along the way, for friends offer a wealth that an education can\u2019t provide on its own.

I did dual enrollment from very young, and my transcripts showed that I went to college before I went to high school. There were some very awkward interviews and some not very nice things a few of the interviewers said to me when it came up. Let's just say some medical schools don't like driven, smart people very much... PhD programs seem to be a lot more interested in enrolling profoundly gifted individuals who have a non-traditional education. ",

No one cares, no one asks, no one wants to know. (Your high school aged children will want to know, but they will be the only ones.) Having or not having a diploma will matter in the job market, but otherwise, to be honest, the letters on a transcript don't matter. The acquisition or lack of knowledge indicated by the grades might matter, but not the grades themselves. *With community colleges available to anyone over eighteen, you can get into college even without a high school diploma. The admission office doesn't even care about your grades. After two years of success at a community college, you can go to most any four-year you can afford. With apologies to all the high school teachers, but what you teach is important, the grades on a transcript, not so much. ",

Will it prevent you from achieving your dream job to have low high school grades? Depends on what the dream is. If it involves something where \u201cwhere you went\u201d is as important as other parameters of your resume, then they could. Alma mater in fields such as Wall Street/Banking is much more about your MBA or graduate degree, but your entrance into those grad programs can be influenced by where you earned your BA/BS, so ultimately, it can have an impact. Bottom line, even if you think you\u2019d never want to go to college, or never be interested in something that might require a marquee name on a piece of parchment, working to your best ability in high school has rarely been a detriment for anyone.

Sometimes it makes it even better and makes it poor as hell.
