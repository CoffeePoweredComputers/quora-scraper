            "answer_text": "If you want to graduate early, it's all about the English (or other four year requirements). Complete one over the summer, and you're ready to graduate early. Use your \"electives\" to take other required classes. No need for Keyboarding when you could take an AP class, or another science. Also, consider your reasons for graduating early. Is it because you dislike your high school, the stale intellectualism of your classmates? If so, do everything you need to graduate - EXCEPT the English - and use senior year to take English and a slew of Community College classes. This helps mature your college applications a year, gets you out of the high school setting, and advances you in your college studies. Make sure to get all A's in C.C.! (Are you a \"university-only\" snob? Nowadays, the CCs are accepted by the universities, and if you're worried about what your 17-year-old classmates will joke you about, you're not ready to break the mold - stay in high school.) No Community College nearby? Then try a different strategy - plan your required classes for senior year, and free up your schedule junior year to take a lot of AP classes (or self-study AP classes). Your junior year results appear on college applications, while senior results arrived the day I attended College Freshman orientation. Score well and often junior year,  and then use senior year to clear up your high school required classes like P.E., Personal Finance, etc.   The added AP scores to your junior year makes you look like an advanced student, while not changing anything but scheduling order in your high school schedule. Don't graduate early just because you can. Your diploma will be worth less to colleges. Find ways to regain the value that you give up by graduating early - internships, or other pursuits (if a child actor graduates early, it's whatever, they have other marketable skills), or volunteering, or Community College classes. Make sure to get the math, science, and English training needed for acceptance to your intended college major. Are you trying to get away from high school AND your home? That's different. Graduating early was great for my sanity - I remember crying in September because of the freedom and love I felt from college and my roommates, compared to the ten-hour bureaucratic  days in high school and the mild but sustained abuse I suffered at home. Here are the drawbacks:Lower college acceptances - I had SATs the surpassed a college's top scores, a ton of APs, and I got rejected. My counselor inquired, and the school said it was because I was a \"junior\". Um no, I'm receiving my Advanced diploma and an IB diploma... I need to go to college somewhere next year. Fix this by staying four years (don't accelerate English), but using the fourth year as a \"gap year\" taking college classes and pursuing interests. By the way, life benefits those who practice their interests, not those who power through their classes. My pursuits are things I draw on daily in my career, while those high school and college classes aren't as useful - they provided me with trivia and advanced knowledge sets, but no real-world hustle skills. Under age - You will be 17 at freshman year (I had to fax permission slips to my parents.) 21 in the last months before you graduate.  If you aren't going to college, some workplaces may not accept you as a minor. I looked into a trade school (to fill in the \"gap year.\") They wouldn't accept me because I was 17. Child labor laws have a diploma exception, so jobs shouldn't be a problem, just training programs might feel legally they don't want to deal with you yet.  College is fun, and largely about the social experience. It's where you make most of your life-long friends, and where you learn a lot about what kind of person you want to marry (there is a quality dating pool in college - all intelligent, 18-22, single, and your job is just to sort the good characters from the not-great).  Don't shortchange yourself in this environment by speeding through it, and don't resign yourself to a lower-ranked university in exchange for getting out from high school a year early. One Benefit of Graduating Early: another year of pay. If you already know your occupation, graduating early gets you there a year earlier. My retirement accounts were started at 20, as soon as I got my first post-college job.  I will probably be able to retire about six months sooner because of my early start in the workplace. Pretty cool, I guess... ",

            "answer_text": "This is how I did it. Ill try to keep it simple. You probably will have to be in a good place academicly in any case. I hate to say it but if your GPA is a brick in the ocean they are probably not going to let you graduate early. In my case my GPA was fine and I had fulfilled all requirements to graduate by the beginning of senior year (whatever the hell they were) so to some extent senior year was kind of a waist of time. Second is your plans for when you are out. They in my case only let me out early because I had already been accepted to college and pretty much knew what I was going to do. The bottom line was I didn't spend a semester playing Xbox and sleeping till noon. So if you know what you are doing after you are out that will help. The third thing is I was already a senior and pretty much was done anyway. If you are lower on the grade scheme it will be less likely although I have heard of Juniors graduating early though it is very rare and typically they are geniuses. One of my good friends always got out of stuff because he was doing literally graduate school level math and physics at mit. But this is very far from common. Now the 4th aspect of me getting out early is they simply did not want to have to deal with me for a entire pointless year. Me and the school did not get along in many aspects and I don't think they fancyed the notion of me being there all that time any more than I did. We had a history of seniors not being very open to staying till the very last day. One group put dead animals in the ceiling and just vanished off the face of the Earth. Anyway I think one aspect that I take the most pride in they cut me loose largley because I would have had a whole year to plan a very very large and ornate and complex senior prank. Instead I was studying at college. Good luck and keep at it ",

            "answer_text": "You can do what I did and become homeschooled. I was able to skip a grade by doing this, and if you haven't heard much about it yet, it's perfectly legal and is really very fun! There are many advantages of taking this route. You can work at your own pace and not be hindered by the \"one size fits all\" school system that most students have to go through. If you are willing to put forth the effort in arranging your own courses, you can come away a good bit smarter than your classmates. It's a proven fact that homeschooled students tend to score higher on SAT's and other standardized tests. I believe I came out pretty well with a 1600 (give or take twenty points, can't remember exactly) on the SAT and a 3.95 GPA. Also, homeschooled students are preferred by a lot of colleges. If you have a stay-at-home parent, homeschooling is very advantageous, but even if you don't, teaching yourself from home is very rewarding and is not nearly as hard as it might sound. I had a stay-at-home mom during my high school years but still taught most of my classes to myself. On another note: there's a generalization that get passed around about homeschooled students being socially awkward -- not really true. Yeah, if you lock yourself away in your room and never socialize, you probably won't end up as much of a talker, but homeschooled students have plenty of opportunity to be around other students. First of all, you can keep hanging out with your friends from your current high school, and second of all there are local homeschool associations in most places in the U.S. (assuming you're from the U.S.) that meet and have activities such as sports, PE, specialized classes like Spanish or Biology and some stuff just for fun. And there's nothing at all wrong with being a quiet person anyway -- most of the time that's best way to be so that when you do talk people will really listen. Being homeschooled also gives you ample opportunity to discover yourself -- to find your passion and figure out exactly how you want to pursue it. It allows you to shape your own beliefs and interests more freely because peer pressure is not pressing on you as much to conform to what is \"popular\" at the time. From my experience of both public school and home school, that peer pressure is a good thing to do away with, or at least minimize (some peer pressure is good to build character). Sorry to go off on a tangent of life advice, lol. I can get carried away sometimes when I'm on Quora. But all in all, I loved my time as a homeschooled student. It's not for everybody, but if you're willing to get ahead in high school as evidenced by the question, you might want to look into this because there's a pretty good chance that it is for you. ",

I cannot stress the enough (btw this is from my perspective in a northern Californian school ) OK you need a certain amount of credits to graduate school. They are called your A-G requirements. In order to earn these golden points you pass the class with a final grade with a C or better . You also can't be like \u201cI just earn all my credits by taking art class all day \u201c . There are certain core classes you must take math ,English, history, science, foreign language, and pe. ( this is what we call gym class in California ) ( stand for physical education ) So the to graduate early is to get all your classes out of the way and earn all your credits . Oh you thought we were done ,but no I bet you are kid who would rather not earning the $7.25 federal minimum wage in the good ol USA. So in that case what you is look at your report card (or ask your teacher or counselor ) what the college requirements are . In most cases it will say \u201crecommend \u201c but take the dam classes anyway. Just because you got all the basic class credits does not mean you can go to college so just a tip. Yes you can graduate early and go to college. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to earn the required number of credits to be graduated. Your school probably has a handbook or information on its website that will give you some clue as to how many credits you earn with each class and how many credits are needed for graduation. To be graduated early, you usually have to take extra classes or earn dual credit through a community college program or attend summer school or night school. Some schools offer online programs (beyond online classes due to Covid-19) that offer credit. Do a little research with your school\u2019s information and find out how many credits you still need to ear and chart out a plan that you think you can realistically work. Be clear about why you want to be graduated early. Then contact your guidance counselor and let him/her help you finalize the plan. Keep in mind that the guidance counselor may spend as much time trying to talk you into staying in school. That\u2019s why having a plan\u2014 even if it\u2019s not complete\u2014 and your reasons in mind will help if the counselor tries to persuade you to complete the 4-years. You might be told that there\u2019s no advantage or that most early grads don\u2019t do anything in the extra months they earn. Be clear in your plan about the why and the what you plan to do once you are on your own. ",

            "answer_text": "Its not that hard. Check with school about dual enrollment if you just want to not be in high school classes. If you want to leave to go to a specific college, check if your state has an online public school. I know from experience FLVS - Florida Virtual School is Florida\u2019s. I accidently graduated early ,because the classes bored me in high school so I wanted to do dual enrollment. I went to a poor high school so there wasn\u2019t many choices. However, they would only let me take all the college classes I wanted if I took the high school classes I needed. Before I knew it, I graduated high school a year early with 60 credits. Online classes are pretty easy if you can teach your self things easily. They have modules online instead of text books. I highly recommend it if you don\u2019t like high school. You can work at your own pace. You don\u2019t have to be a genius but the ease of which your brain learns information will determine the time it takes to complete courses. But if you can put in the same amount of hours for regular high school as online you can graduate early. This does mean that you have to do classes during breaks. I wasn\u2019t really sociable in high school, so I didn\u2019t really mind just focusing on school. Some people say you\u2019ll regret skipping traditional high school stuff and its possible ,but I didn\u2019t. ",

Everyone has that point in high school where they are ready to go off to college and it could be as early as the end of freshman year that they want to do this. However, think about it- is there really a point? Can you just let yourself finish high school like everyone else, take the four years. After sophomore year, you only have two years left. Just continue to do the best you can because there is really no sense in rushing it. There are VERY smart students in my school who take all AP classes and Latin and Spanish (our Latin teacher is very hard), but they aren't considering graduating early. It's really not that realistic. Trust me, I'm going into my junior year and I've seen the smartest kids graduate out their 4th year- barely anyone leaves school early like that. Especially if you want to get into an Ivy League- it's all about state and country testing such as ACT and SAT. They're looking at that more than anything else.   If you really want to, you can go to a college prep school, but that is a boarding school and you'll be away from your parents a lot- probably a lot more than you think you can handle. Also, most prep schools cost a pretty penny for admission.    My advice, don't grow faster than you have to. Just make the next three years of school even better than the first.  ",

With only one additional class I could have made it a whole year early. Never looked back, never went back for graduation. Never regretted it. Don't think that you must use the time in a serious way.

I could have, I chose not to \u2014 which I\u2019ll get into in a second. There are other reasons which I\u2019ll also get into. Some of it is figuring out the system: for instance, for my province, it required a minimum of eleven 11th+12th grade subjects including 11th and 12th grade English, 11th grade Algebra, one 11th grade science, 11th grade and 12th grade French (Canada, remember). The rest is up to you. Some have requirements, like 12th grade English requires 11th grade English. So here\u2019s a possibility: finish 9 subjects in 11th grade, then take 12th grade English and French in summer school. Another possibility: work really hard and get A\u2019s in lower grades and try to do two grades of (lower grade subject) in a year \u2014 you can use summer school to do that. So in 8th grade: I finished 8th grade math in one month and spent 9 months finishing 9th grade math; I did both 8th and 9th grade French. In 9th grade, I started advancing in science. I figured out during 11th grade I could have graduated early if I had taken 12th grade English in summer school. I mentioned I didn\u2019t do that. Sure, I did have a 4.0 GPA (11th grade), I got scholarships to local universities/colleges and decent ones. However, I wanted to go MIT, and I wanted to prepare myself for that. Other people have other reasons for not trying to graduate early \u2014 including maturity (especially emotional maturity). Another reason is that on average, an 18-year-old will be a better athlete than a 17-year-old: you have an extra year of physical development and training. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm from Canada, but I imagine it's similar other places The rules for graduating arnt just based on your year, so the good news is that it can be done. To graduate however there are some requirement, for example you must take grade 12 English. The first step then is to figure out what you need. If you have a certain idea for university check their requirements (some programs for example require one grade eleven science class). In addition there are a number of course credits you need, you can get those the traditional way or you can take them outside of school during the summer or through online correspondent courses. If your in America there may be a few other things like taking the SATs, a certain number of volunteer hours, etc. Now that that you know what you need, the trick is to go and get them. Communication is critical for this, maje your plans then talk to your councillor. Since your a good student, I think you could convince them to alter the schedule a bit, letting you take two English classes in a year, as well as confirming that they will accept correspondence courses. Get them and your parents on board. The third step is the hardest, this when you actually do the work. Its going to be a lot of work too, and it's important not to sacrifice quality for quantity. Your transcript won't directly say you skipped a year. It says when you graduated, what classes you took, and what grades you got. When i applied to university that's the only info I had to input. Graduating early is for you, it won't mean as much to anyone else, this has to be for you. ",

(They college classes usually count for twice the credit in high school) And by your Junior year it will be like butter. Due to all those credits you build during your first and second year of high school. I wished someone had said this to me 13 years ago! I went into high school, goofing around, not really working like I knew I could, I thought it would be easy to lack and then pick it up in the final years, and I did do that. But boy was I wrong! It was one of the worse things I did. I almost didn\u2019t graduate for my lack towards my school work. My credits, had been so little by the time I was a junior, that I had to work my ass off three times more my senior year. So I recommend to grab high school by the horns since you step foot in there and just work your ass off. If you do, you might have to go to school your senior year but only for ONE CLASS!!! But there\u2019s a high chance you might be able to graduate early. Good luck and remember to study hard! ",

If you want to go to college, consider in which colleges you\u2019re interested, which major and what high school course work would help you for these majors. I graduated high school early, at the end of my junior year, because my situation at home was difficult. My parents were fighting, blamed it on me, and threatened to kick me out of the house. I offered to finish high school a year early, and leave in a few months. However, I really did not take course work that would have helped me in college (I attended Reed college, a tough school). In high school, I had time for only geometry, trig, and algebra 2, but not pre-calc, which I would have taken my senior year. If I\u2019d had pre-calc (or better yet, HS calc - not offered then), it would have been very useful for my college courses. Also, I\u2019d taken biology and chemistry, but not physics. Again, taking HS physics would have made my college course load easier. I did well in high school - in my junior year, I had the top scores, in my school of about 2,000 students, in both the math and English SAT tests, as well as a 5 on my English AP exam. (The only AP course offered at the time in my high school in California in 1969). If you can take courses at a nearby college, you may make friends there with whom you are more compatible. This could help you decide on a college major, and better prepare you for college studies. Good luck! ",

These are classes offered by a university or community college and once complete give you credit for high school and college. Classes you can take this way include math, science, English, history, and in someplaces things like automotive technology. Make no mistake, these classes are college level. The professors won't care if you are really a high school student; they will expect the same quality of work as they do for college freshmen and sophomores. i recommend this because dual enrollment classes are sometimes paid for by your high school. And unlike the AP clases, they are on a semester schedule just like college. Less time stuck in class. And before you dismiss \u201ccollege\u201d please keep in mind these institutions are not just for wannabe doctors and lawyers, etc. Colleges, especially Community Colleges, offer certificate programs that train and help with licensing for police officers, fireman, radio/x-ray technicians, cosmetology, culinary arts, auto mechanics, flabatomy, nursing, home health aid, construction manager, welding, etc. ",

If you can take classes online, do that. Don't take on more than you can handle, though, because failing a class means that you won't get the credit necessary to graduate. Do what you can to meet your credit requirements first, before anything. Credits are what allow you to graduate, after all. If it's too much to graduate a full year early, consider graduating a semester early. Keep in mind that graduating early just so you can be out of school is not a valid reason to graduate early. Only do it if you feel that you're capable. ",

I would argue that most students would be better off not graduating early. Unless you are both extremely smart and very mature you would be better served by getting as much out of high school as possible. The social learning is just as important as any classwork. I will admit there are valid reasons to graduate early but consider carefully. In many cases going away from home to college at a young age is not the best idea. ",

Here you would need to take English, Math and Physical Education earlier than others, but the semester system and summer school would allow for that. There are also special language exams that would allow to challenge the course. I am not sure if this is recommended, but it would not be difficult to do high school in 3 years as opposed to regular 4 years.

You are able to apply for University/College via the 2 diplomas. Some university in my country(Thailand) had a very high minimum score for applicant with GED diplomas due to the difficulty when compare to the IGCSE is much more difficult.

If you're trying to go to college that young, you're going to find yourself rather retarded in terms of social skills/practical knowledge. Plus you'll be restrained by the 18/21 age limits to get into places. Relax. Enjoy it. You'll regret it if you don't. ",

You will technically have achieved the required amount of credits to graduate, but you still have to take state tests and the state also requires you too spend a cearyain number if days in the classroom per year per grade. So you may be able to take some extra classes over the summer, you may not. It all depends on what type of school you go too. ",
