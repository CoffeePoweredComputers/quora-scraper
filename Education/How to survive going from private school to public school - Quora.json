            "answer_text": "Public schools have school counselors. They tend to be overworked but at least you can sign up for help that might not be available to you elsewhere. Since counselors are also doing academic advising (and are assigned too many students) I would advise getting a session in to get an idea of what your graduation requirements are, advice for college bound, and a copy of your transcript(s). Transcripts are not always available right away when you transfer, but go back in a couple of weeks because not every single class you took will get credits at the public school anyway. If your private school was not accredited then you lost those classes altogether - maybe. In certain states public schools have State Exit Exams that private schools may or may not be participating in.  Class sizes are bigger. Teachers have too many students. Try to make a good impression the first month, be on time, follow dress code, have supplies, turn in work on time, ask for help if you need it but if you feel really lost wait until the teacher has a moment and ask when is a good time to get more help to get 'caught up'. The ecological niches for class clown, crowd pleaser, attention hog, naughty kid, laggard, napper, rude person, and stoner have probably been already taken and the teacher will appreciate to no end if you are not competing for those spots.  I think there is probably a wider range of types of students for you to pick friends from. If it was hard to make friends at your private school perhaps it will be easier at the public school. If you are uneasy, for example if the student population is 3 or 10 times bigger than what you are used to, then keep in sight of the adults who are supposed to be monitoring students during breaks. Since you say 'survive', I am hoping you have not been bullied. I was 'new kid' A LOT as a kid, and that was never a problem for me, maybe I was just oblivious. But if you are confident (fake it) and walk with a mission to get to a definite place, people will tend to leave you alone. Observe who is nice to you, who they hang out with, how they are in the classroom, how they are with teachers. If you like all that, then that is a good person. If you don't like any of it, not a great person. Another thing I learned; the person who gossips to you about everyone is looking to find out stuff about You to share with others and not to your benefit. Overly friendly people usually have a purpose. Quietly friendly people that take longer to get to know usually are the better friends.  ",

            "answer_text": "Public schools are more strict in terms of rules and regulations. The rationale is so simple. Private schools run by the payments of the parents whereas public schools run by the payments of \"the public\". That causes two things in public schools: \"job security of teachers\" and \"less parent and student involvement in planning\". Even there are private schools which favor a specific community; namely, relatives of graduates, donators etc. In public schools, (1) you will get less feedback from teachers and need to be perfectly punctual to deadlines; (2) criticism of the weekly schedule will make no difference; (3) the substitute teachers might not be so helpful, etc. As a result, to survive in a public school, study more and if needed be an adulator.
