            "answer_text": "I was a kindergarten drop-out. Michigan did not have mandatory K in 1970, so after I was miserable and suffered long enough, my mom let me drop out and spend the rest of that year back in my pre-school. I can\u2019t remember many specific negative details - but I know the teacher did not like me and was very hard on me - or maybe I was hard on her. At any rate, once my mom saw a lot of bruising on my upper arm from being \u201cplaced\u201d back in line so often and so roughly, she finally understood what I meant and let me stop going. I recall weeks or months of asking if I could just go to the classroom on \u201cRomper Room\u201d, or back to New York City and be one of the kids on \u201cSesame Street.\u201d You see, we had moved from Greenwich Village in NYC to East Lansing Michigan in 1969 when I was four and my parents divorce was for real. It was quite a culture shock, and early on it looked like I was going to struggle in school and maybe even in a larger social sense. One specific kindergarten memory I had was at Christmas time: I got picked out by a visiting Santa to get some super secret santa gift (I can\u2019t recall what it was). At some point I figured out that the few of us that got the secret santa gift were the poorest kids in class. I attended Spartan Gardens ES on the Michigan State University campus, not some middle class or elite neighborhood, but they picked me out as being needy. It was actually kind of awesome to get the \u201cprize\u201d of the day and I got excited - and I definitely recall the teacher grabbing me by the arm (and I mean hard) and placing me back in line so we could go on with the whole scene. I think it was after the Christmas break when I returned to \u201cAll Kid\u2019s Day Care Center\u201d full-time. Before the next school year, my mom had moved out of \u201cSpartan Gardens Student Married Housing\u201d (though divorced) and into a house in East Lansing with some roommates and I just started first grade at Central School. I have a lot of funny memories from that house and school, many involving my own mis-behavior or observing hippies in their natural setting; but just two years later, we moved across town when my mom re-married my step-father and I spent grade 3\u20135 at Bailey School. These early academic experiences were really challenging for me and my ADHD-type behavior but eventually I found my academic self and academic success followed. Most people don\u2019t get so many chances to have academic failures and still find academic success later in life, especially today. ",

            "answer_text": "Peeing myself thrice, and throwing up, on the same day. The school gave me two sets of spare clothes, but the second was all they had and I was required to remain in the cold, soiled clothes, which had not only pee like my original clothes and the first spare set, but also vomit, on them, until my mom came and took me home. I was not incontinent. The first time was a genuine but mortifying kindergarten accident in the middle of a spelling test (this was private school where they gave kindergarteners actual work for a grade) right after lunch/recess. The second was the same, after returning to class freshly changed, but I began to find it amusing to think, what would happen if I were to pee my pants just once more? The third was because I was exactly the sort of horrible snickering sadistic imp of a child to do that, and in the closet of the principal's office no less, but didn't think about the consequences, and eventually, I didn't know why at the time but in retrospect I probably threw up from inhaling four-hour old piss fumes.
