            "answer_text": " Here\u2019s a question I get asked all the time: \u201cHow can I get motivated to study?\u201d And the honest answer is that motivation comes and goes. Some days, you probably wake up feeling motivated to crack on, sticking to your beautifully crafted study plan. Many other days, you probably feel like staying in bed, eating Toblerone and watching Netflix\u2026 \u2026 Or maybe that\u2019s just me!? The first thing you need to realize is that it is OK not to feel on top of the world the whole time. Humans doubt themselves, they feel like they might be wasting their time, they question whether their goals are achievable. I do it all the time, so know that you are not alone in occasionally (or regularly) lacking motivation. And that brings us to the first key idea\u2026 Don\u2019t Rely On Motivation! The best advice I can give in order to get yourself \u201cmotivated\u201d to study is to not rely on motivation at all! Instead, get into the habit of studying hard. I guess this is kind of a bit of a trick answer. However, the reality is that motivation is a temporary aid (as we\u2019ve just seen) that can really help in the short-term (as we\u2019ll get onto in a second), but that is nowhere near as powerful as a habit in ensuring you study hard day in day out! Build a Habit of Studying Building a habit of studying means that you get used to studying at certain times each day. Humans are inherently creatures of habit. Have you ever thought something along the lines of the following? \u2026 Well, then you are very much mistaken about the cause of your inability to get to studying straight away when you get home. The reality is that I very rarely come home from lectures feeling full of joy and motivation about the prospect of doing lots of homework.  However, I have built a habit of always doing assignments and homework as soon as I come in (or at least within the first 20 minutes of getting home), keeping relaxation time as a reward for after I finish studying. The amazing thing about this is that, once this becomes part of your routine, you will actually find it hard not to study before you allow yourself to enter relaxation mode! What Can You Do To Build A Habit Of Studying Before You Relax? Step 1 \u2013 Improve Your Routine  I challenge you right now to think about how you could improve your routine to help you get to studying right away. How could you change your routine to help you resist the immediate satisfaction offered to you by distractions and to reward you for studying productively? Could you plan to get to studying right away and keep longer breaks for once you have finished your assignments?Could you tell your parents or roommate to take away your TV remote until you have finished studying for the day? (My friend Rohit talked about a similar tactic in his article: he banned herself from using headphones so that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take them to the library and get distracted watching TV.)Could you only allow yourself to eat chocolate as a reward for completing each of your study sessions?Step 2 \u2013 Think logically: Relaxation With Guilt, Or Relaxation Without Guilt?  Once you\u2019ve decided how you can improve your routine, the next step is to start thinking to yourself: When I was younger, I used to LOVE playing Call of Duty Zombies with my friends. However, I got into a powerful habit of feeling guilty about playing it until I had finished all of my homework. That way, I knew that once I had finished my homework, I could enjoy playing Zombies totally guilt-free for as long as I wanted (within reason!).   So, whenever you sit down to play a video game or to watch TV or to scroll through Facebook when you should be studying, take a second to think that you should be studying, feel the guilt and use this to kick you out of your demotivated slumber! If you ask yourself the above question, the reality is that the logic makes sense. It is more enjoyable to be able to relax in the knowledge that you have completed your assignments and studying than to try and watch TV with a slight feeling of guilt pestering you in the back of your mind. Ultimately, the work is going to take you the same amount of time whether you do it now or after an hour-long episode of Game of Thrones. So, get to it, and then bask in the glory of Westeros feeling as much of a boss as Daenerys Targaryen riding around astride her dragons. Step 3 \u2013 Kick Yourself Out Of Laziness With Motivational Techniques  Obviously building a habit of studying before you allow yourself to relax does not just happen overnight. There is considerable scientific evidence to suggest that for many habits to be formed, you need to perform the action for around 20-30 days. Once you reach 30 days, if you have performed the action every day, you will have built a powerful habit that is actually pretty hard to break. So, while you absolutely should try to improve the way you structure your routine to make you study before you allow yourself to relax, ultimately you will never be able to get rid of all of the possible distractions that surround you. This is where motivation comes in right now. You can use temporary motivation throughout the first 30 days (and beyond that if your positive habits start to slip) to overcome your desire not to study! Just remember, once you reach 20 days (ish), it is going to start feeling a whole lot easier to start studying, even if you don\u2019t feel that motivated! . Again, remember that if you can keep this up for 10 days, you are really getting towards building a positive study habit that will dramatically reduce the importance of motivation in your ability to study! That means that you will no longer have to consciously take action to overcome your desire to watch TV instead of studying. This is because: You will have created a habit of getting on with studying before you allow yourself to relax.You will feel guilty about not studying and you will have no choice but to get on with your studying before you can enjoy your relaxation time.What Do You Need To Do Right Now?  Realize from now on that no one feels motivated all the time and that, if you struggle to get straight to studying, it is because you need to change your habits, not increase your motivation.Take 5 minutes to think about how you can improve your routine and plan exactly what you are going to do tomorrow in order to ensure you get straight to studying. Repeat every day for the next week. Then the week after that. And the week after that.Think logically and remember that relaxation after a productive day is so much more satisfying than relaxation marred by the guilt you should be cracking on!Kick yourself out of laziness using motivation techniques, such as positive and negative visualization..

            "answer_text": "I think this will really depend on whether you\u2019re studying for something in the short or long term. Short-Term If you are studying for something coming up soon, like a test later in the week, my motivation is generally the urgency. Procrastinating stresses me out more than anything. I know some people are the opposite though, they procrastinate to avoid what is stressful. One strategy I use if I am struggling to find the motivation to begin, is to set myself a small goal such as finishing one programming lesson, or one chapter in a book. If I reach that goal, I\u2019ll give myself a small reward or take a mini break, like getting a latte at Starbucks. Then I\u2019ll go right back to work. I find this helps to break things up, and prevents me from burning out after only studying an hour or two. Your environment is also a big factor in motivating yourself. You are a lot more likely to study if surrounded by like-minded people. Set yourself up for success here. If I\u2019m sitting down to program, it helps when I have Slack open so that I can see other people online engaged in coding and asking questions. It\u2019s also a supportive community. In high school and college, it\u2019s always a great idea to form a study group with your peers, that way you\u2019re all focused on similar goals and can answer each others\u2019 questions. At the very least, you want to make sure you\u2019re not in a distracting environment. If I\u2019ve been at home a lot, I\u2019ll start to lose focus and get distracted by my dog, my boyfriend, and the very computer I\u2019m trying to complete my work on. At that point, I stop, grab my laptop, and head to a nearby coffee shop where many locals go to study and work. Long-Term These are the most difficult to stay motivated, and something I still struggle with. I\u2019ve been part of a coding bootcamp for nearly a year now, and I was highly motivated at the beginning, but it is a challenge to maintain that same motivation. I find the most success when I use these strategies: Remind yourself of your end goal. You can even write it on sticky notes, and leave them near your work space. Ultimately, your motivation comes from the reason you\u2019re studying, so you need to remind yourself of that whenever possible.Make a daily to-do list, and ensure that the items on there are small manageable tasks. If everything on your list will take you hours to complete, it\u2019s hard to find the motivation to even begin. If you find yourself in that situation, break down the tasks even more.Set short-term goals, and give these a due date. My online code bootcamp is self-paced for the most part, but they give weekly targets of what you should accomplish. Even if they hadn\u2019t done this, I would have set my own weekly goals to keep myself on track.I hope this helped, good luck in studying and reaching your goals! ",
