            "answer_text": "How exciting (and scary)! Without knowing where in Japan your family is looking to go, there\u2019s not a lot of advice any of us can offer about specific schooling options. That said, I\u2019m going to be asking the impossible here, I know, but don\u2019t worry about college. Don\u2019t worry. Just do your best. If you go to a Japanese high school and your grades take an initial hit and then improve, that\u2019s something incredibly positive you can address in your admissions essay. Any worthwhile college (or future employer) will look at your experience and say, \u201cWow, this student was thrown into an overwhelming situation, but kept cool, stuck with it, and got results. That\u2019s the kind of person who will thrive here.\u201d In a sea of kids with high GPAs and tons of extracurriculars, your application will stand out. If you go to an international school, don\u2019t fret. There are many international schools (particularly near the big cities) that offer AP and IB courses, and even if yours ultimately doesn\u2019t, you can still get to where you want to be. As an applicant from overseas, you will still stand out in a sea of applicants, especially if your standardized test scores and admissions essay display your potential. If you have a particular college you are interested in attending, once your future plans are hammered down a bit, research their admissions process and contact their admissions office if you anticipate any bumps in the road. Maybe something like, \u201cHello! I\u2019m a junior interested in attending ABC University for your outstanding computer science program and I have a question about the application process. I am currently studying in Iroha City, Japan. I understand that your application requires sealed recommendations from two of my teachers; however, none of my teachers speak English. When it comes time to apply, may I submit my recommendations in Japanese? If not, may I have a translator open the letters to translate them for you?\u201d If you ask a pertinent question, not only are you unique because you\u2019re in Japan, you\u2019re unique because you\u2019re proactively planning and reaching out.

            "answer_text": "Why would you want to? The fact of the matter is, unless you were raised in Japan, you aren\u2019t going to be able to handle a Japanese high school as a regular student, both linguistically and culturally. You simply aren\u2019t going to understand what\u2019s going on, and if you went to school in America, you are going to be bumping up against the walls of social appropriateness. Further, Japan is infamous as having one of the worst and most stressful education systems in the world, so why would you willingly inflict that on yourself? Japan isn\u2019t the promise land. At best, it\u2019s just another place to live, and at worst, it is a severely damaged country desperately in need of change to fix its many socio-economic problems. If your reasoning for wanting to come to Japan is because you think it\u2019s like what you see in anime, you will be unpleasantly surprised. ",

            "answer_text": "I went to school in Japan when I was 16 and I didn't speak Japanese. My suggestion is that you go to an intensive language school for the first month or two before you start normal school. Within 3 months of being at school you language skills will improve dramatically. Within 6 months you'll be the family translator. Within 12 months you will have forgotten that you didn't speak Japanese. At least that was my experience. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have a valid visa to be in Japan, your district high school has to accept you. Nowadays, there are many foreign students in the Japanese school system. Of course you will have to learn Japanese without a doubt. If you go to an \u201cinternational school\u201d, there are good ones and bad ones but nearly all of them are very expensive. If you are going to an area with a large Indian minority population, I suggest you go to an Indian school. You will have to learn Japanese and possibly Hindi, but at least the schools will not clean out your parents' bank account, or so I have heard. Personally, I suggest going to a Japanese school, learn the language, and do well there. ",
