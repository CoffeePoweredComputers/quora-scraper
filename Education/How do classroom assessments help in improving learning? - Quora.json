            "answer_text": "In this context, it comes to my mind about the CCE pattern,being implemented by CBSE schools, with RTE act, 2009 in India. Mission was to banish rote learning. Instead of taking only formal examinations at the end of a session/term to score how much the student has been able to mug up, CCE pattern was introduced. It means continuous and comprehensive evaluation which was supposed to be taken more informally throughout te periods in the classroom. It tried to focus on the all round development of a child, i.e. how a child is developing in various aspects, such as social,intellectual,emotional and physical. The teacher is supposed to observe or assess, how a particular child is participating in an group activity, whether he/she is answering to questions with confidence or lacks confidence, which particular area or lesson he/she is weak in capturing, so that it may help the teacher, then and there to help the child rectify his mistakes or improve upon his/her weak areas. Thus classroom assessments help in improving teaching learning process as a whole. Through this, children are able to learn and improve more than they do at the TERM end examinations. At best ,how can a teacher help a child improve, just by showing report cards at the end of the session to parents??? ",
