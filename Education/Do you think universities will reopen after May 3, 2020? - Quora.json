Areas which are in Green zone may Open Universities but that will also take at least 2 weeks after 3rd May. I think it is best not to speculate anything now as we all know very well Corona virus numbers can be changed Quickly. So,Kindly stay home as much as you can and Please follow rules of lock Down properly so we can end the game of this Pandemic named as Corona Virus aka Covid 19. Thank you ",

As most of university students belong to different distinct it will take time for them to come back. You know Indiana parents they will not allow their child to go. I think everything will be normal in July at least I hope so. Wishs for everyone\u2026 ",
