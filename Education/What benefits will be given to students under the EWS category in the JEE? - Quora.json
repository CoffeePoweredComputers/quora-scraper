            "answer_text": "Last year MHRD has decided to give 10% reservation to general candidates who comes under the rules of EWS ( economically weaker section) ,who studies in central educational institutions. There are certain criterias to get that facility. Althouth last year in some of the states like west bengal had not implemented that EWS scheme and nobody was able to issue that very certificate. Even I couldn't issue that certificate. So I could not report to NIT durgapur. Coming to the point there will be a very slight difference between cutoff's of general and general EWS. although there will be a 10 percent reservation for general candidates. I think it is not very much benifitial to the candidates as total no of seats under this category is not very much . But if you comes under this, please apply for it if you can issue it before time. It may help you. ",
