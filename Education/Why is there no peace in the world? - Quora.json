            "answer_text": "It is simple, really. Ask Darwin, or, rather, ask today\u2019s evolutionary biologists. DNA will not be here unless the phenotype is successful in propagating the genotype into the next generation. The environment contains lots of different phenotypes competing over limited resources. Surviving DNA is good at creating phenotypes that compete well. Competition is a sort of war. We are programmed to propagate our DNA and DNA that is very similar to ours. This means making more children who are like us and not like them. We call this behavior xenophobia. We are at peace when we are assured that our progeny are secure. After WW II, we experienced a brief period of peace. However, the forces of greed for money and power pushed us into a cold war. Look at all of human history. You will find this theme every time. Protect those like you, and destroy those unlike you. Joshua did it at Jerico. The forces of unthinking self-protection and exaltation tend toward a homogeneous world in each pocket of uniformity. Donald J. Trump has been exploiting this attitude. He tells his followers to be angry at (even to hate) those who are different. They are, he says, the cause of their woes. He is lying, but he is playing to an innate gut feeling for the survival of the genome that has been programmed into every creature on the planet for billions of years. Unlike other life, we can think and plan. This ability makes us capable of great evil and of great good. Real thought will lead down the path of good. A lack of thinking can take us the other way. Trump asks us not to think. He is not alone in this. Neither is any political party free of it. Watch the ads. Do they call on you to think or to act blindly? Think! What is good for you, for your family, for your extended family, for your community, for the people you care about? Is it conquest and the degradation of others? That is a short-term solution that contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. Read history to see this. Peace will come when most people think well. Poor thinking results in pain and conflict. Until we no longer feel the pressure to struggle to survive, we will have conflict. We must have a sharing society. We must wrest the control of our society from those who were fortunate enough to become wealthy and powerful. They say that they worked hard to get there, but their work is nothing compared to a poor man and/or woman working three menial jobs to support a family. To fix this problem, we could tax wealth. In fact, Henry George proposed something similar long ago. Tax the source of income rather than the income. Only one tax would be necessary. Peace! ",

            "answer_text": "Because Humans. But before you start blaming humanity for all the chaos in the world you should know that we actually cant help it. Its called the Human Condition. Unlike Human Nature which is a fundamental philosophical element into why we do what we do and why the way we are nurtured determines our nature, the human condition is a set of broad characteristics that make us humans, and not just bipedal mammals. Our need for growth; the never ending technological curiosity, need for building bigger skyscrapers, driving faster cars, owning a bigger house than the last, space conquest. Our need for individuality; starting families as opposed to roaming the Savannah in herds, race, ranking in every aspect of life (employment, military, money, etc) fashion. Our need for emotionalism; falling in love, marriage, partying, music, poetry. Our need for purpose; religion, democracy, currency, God. All these factors define each and every human being that has been in existence. And the biggest one yet, our need for conflict. This is more of a trait of evolution left over from our true animal nature. However, War is not a direct consequence of the Human Condition. We all have a peaceful, rational, altruistic nature called Conscience. So why is it so hard to have World Peace? Why cant we use all the wonderful characteristics to better ourselves as a race? It is because of one fundamental principle that nature cruelly dealt us as humans, Intelligence. The higher brain function in humans transforms the characteristics of the Human Condition from being simple traits that define us into basis for competition. We always want to outdo each other. And its not just governments, but from the most basic family unit. Developing twins have been documented to exchange blows and kicks in the womb. From birth, we are conditioned to know that its every man for himself, its a jungle out there and so forth. World Peace at this point in history is the responsibility of every individual person, and having 7.4 billion human beings quit the rat race and think alike is going to be one tall order, but not impossible. We cant do anything to change the Human Condition, but we can see it from a different perspective. ",
