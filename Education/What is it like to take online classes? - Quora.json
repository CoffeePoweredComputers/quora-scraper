            "answer_text": "ONLINE CLASSES \u2014 The New Normal and let's hope that this \u201cnormal\u201d is TEMPORARY. Of course the trend of Online Courses is going to be permanent, but let's hope that Online Classes will eventually dissolve into history.  It is 7.30 A.M. The alarm is shouting like hell to wake me up. Finally at 7.40 AM, I finally wake up to full consciousness and realize that I have a class at 8.00 A.M. I rush to washroom to fresh up, dress up suitably and attend that class 2 km away from my hostel at 8.05 AM. The generous teacher allows me inside and I am headed to the back benches. My friend asks me the reason why I am late. The class starts while I complete explaining him the reason why the menu of the hostel mess should change. (A long explanation of why I am late \ud83d\ude05). I pull out the notebook and start taking notes whatever the teacher is teaching. I pull out my phone during the boring lectures and scroll through Facebook, instagram or Quora. Out of the blue the college administration announced the exams. But I got no fear, instead I got notes of my own. And I had paid a little attention to boring classes, so they can be easily managed. I share my notes with my friends, wake up the whole night if that's what it takes to clarify doubts of mine or my friends and in the end I get good and fruitful results. Summarizing the stuff, the life was like this  (You will understand the Barney-Robin reference later in this answer.) This was life before March 2020. It changed drastically and went down the hill. Lemme rewrite the above story after the start of Online classes. It is 7.30 A.M. My phone is as silent as a brick. I am comfortably lying on my bed still. The clock ticks 8. I somehow wakeup at that time login to the 'online' class and resume my sleep. There is a feature called \u201cRecording\u201d the session where the entire 1 hour lecture is recorded and it is saved in cloud. So that students can have access to the lectures even long after they are taught. Another feature is that the teachers can download the attendance list of the class. At 9 AM, I finally wake up to conscious logout of the class and immediately login to the other one. During this class, I brush my teeth, have a long hot water bath, have my breakfast. I need not pull out my notes anymore and just waste time and when there are \u201conline\u201d exams around the corner, I get terrified like hell, but prepare bits and pieces anyway and appear for the exam. Ahhh.. the exam. Need not worry. I got good friends who share everything on WhatsApp. We need not turn on the microphone or the webcam during the exam. So we are safe - copying. Thus I get good marks. I should summarize this story as\u2026  Got the reference ? If not please continue. (People who didn't watch How I met your Mother TV series yet.. go watch it in your free time\u2026 PLEASE) See the difference in the stories ? Online classes suck to the greatest extent of they are not used properly. See the pictures again. Life was happy both ways, but the second one has hell lot of mess in it. It all seems good \u2014 I am at home lying on a comfortable bed, getting good marks even with minimal knowledge. \u2014 But deep down there is some kind of dissatisfaction for the deeds I do.  What is it like to take Online Classes ?It feels boring, exhausting and feels like the end of the semester.It feels useless to attend all those pointless classes.It feels frustrating that you are not able to catch up with the teacher.It feels good that you are at home enjoying your time of life.It feels sad that you are going to achieve nothing with your lazy attitude towards online classes.Complete mixup of feelings. That's a lot of clutter to deal with at a same time.  These are 2 random \u201cstories\u201d, truly based on REAL INCIDENTS. I wrote them in first person perspective in simple present tense to describe the stories as a personal routine. Well! This is one way of how it feels like to take online classes. Some might be enjoying getting the most out of those classes. Some might be the people like the guy in the second story. And some others are somewhere in between these extremes.  In case you have related yourself to the second story even for a while, there is a solution to get out of it. Step 1 - The realization  Step 2 - Have one last frustrating class before weekend  Step 3 - Get over with everything to start over in the weekend. Start organising things. I am not saying how to organise things because that's completely personal.  Step 4 - Start the Monday with a fresh energy. Pull out the notes, stay on track with the classes as if you are in a real offline class. Isolate yourself from all the disturbances. Happy learning. Stay awesome  I might have gone off track for some time, but it's all related to the question. After these \u2026 You would surely get the most of the online classes. Thanks for reading till the end of my answer. Dharani Sathwik \u270d\ud83c\udffb ",

            "answer_text": "For me, I have only done the ones that are completely online and have no face to face interaction. On the flip side, I have been on some coaching calls via zoom, etc so I will give an overview of what that is like! The online learning experience I found really good because I could fit it around whatever I was or needed to do. My method was to sit down for a good 3 hours and smash out as much as I could, but they recommend for sitting down for an hour or so a night. The feedback was quick and the tutor was really helpful. the tutor can spend more time with you because they aren\u2019t travelling to see students. The online zoom coaching calls are fine as well, for me, they don\u2019t replace being in person. They are good because again you don\u2019t have to travel anywhere and it can give you more time to prep and then you can be where you want, for example, you can be in your home, a coffee shop, in an office or anywhere. It just has to be convenient and fairly quiet! Etiquette You will always talk over someone accidentally or have to wait that bit longer in order to get your say, you will misjudge some comments and it can be tricky at first because a lot of how we communicate is body language and if we are online, we can\u2019t always see facial expressions and hand movements! don\u2019t be fearful of it, it is a good change, one that will save you time, enjoy just as much but don\u2019t rely on it solely!
