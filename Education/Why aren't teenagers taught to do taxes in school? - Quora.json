            "answer_text": "They are taught but only if you take an accounting course. Why don\u2019t parents teach their kids to do taxes? That is a parent job or the employer\u2019s. It has nothing to do with the education system. All of these things like taxes, mortgages, investing were all jobs that parents taught their kids. They never dumped it on the education system. Theses all belong in the socio-economic levels in society. The average parent does have knowledge about finances. It\u2019s not that hard. Most of the time interest in taxes, mortgages, investing happen when the kids are out of school. Some teachers did teach some of this in a high school careers program but at 15\u201316 they weren\u2019t interested. When instructed to keep their notes they just snickered. Since it wasn\u2019t in the curriculum the parents and administrator slapped our hands. The age of teaching your children about personal finances is 22. Then it means something to them. But realistically it goes in one ear and out the other until they need to do their taxes; they have money to invest; they wish to get married and start looking at a permanent home. If you wish personal finance to be in the school system then it should be in the graduation year as a compulsory course at college/university so you get all students. it would be a 1/2 credit program for 1 semester. Or you put it in every business for 1st time employees teaching them to do personal income tax. It would take 2 hr of instruction or they get an instruction booklet with the tax form and a sample form completed for them to follow. Less time and less expense for the employer. The schools of business teach their students to do income tax. In an introductory course of economic there is a small section on global taxation. The rest of the student population gets the knowledge from their finance major friends, internet, accountants, or the instruction booklet that comes with your taxes (that doesn\u2019t exist anymore) and mortgage bankers or brokers. Investing is mostly taught through the internet now and friends or a financial advisor if they are willing to do so. The bulk of these items are generally taught by parents. There are courses in the community centres that are offered as well at minimum cost. Time for the kids to start asking parents to teach them or to search the information out themselves. Stop thinking that the education system should be preparing your for your own self needs. Asian parents are really good at teaching their children about personal finances. Find an asian friend and ask their parents to help you. The education system has a hard enough time scheduling in basic information and teaching the process of thinking and creative thinking as well as all the other social behaviours that parents have dumped on the system because \u201cthey are too busy\u201d to take quality time and teach their children. In the last 3 decades schools are providing breakfast and lunches. \u201cWhy?\u201d Feeding your kids is a parent job not a educational systems job. In very poor areas yes there is that need but in areas even minimum wage districts, schools should not have to feed children so that their brains can operate properly. Why is there not a question of: Why does everyone think that the school system should be teaching children common courtesies like blowing your nose, covering your mouth when you cough or wearing a mask, saying please and thank you (yes a North American etiquette), respecting others and teachers in the classroom, respecting public property, how to manage their anger? In the past people went to church and the church provided all the guidance and advice and had the programs for them. The trend of not to affiliate with religion, also meant that there was no where to go for those needs. That\u2019s when everything got dumped into the education system. Not only is it not teachers and schools jobs but the cost and time has pushed the education systems to their limit. ",

            "answer_text": "I was actually taught to do taxes in Grade 6. We were all told to go down to the local post office and pick up a tax return (actually two copies). We worked thru a couple of examples in class (simple stuff, salary, bank interest, married, two kids, no other deductions) and were then given a test where we had to do the same thing with a set of imaginary number that had been put on the board. Fast forward many, many years. Not only were my kids not shown how to do this but, when they headed off to university I had to show them how to write a check for their rent. They hadn\u2019t even been shown that much. ",
