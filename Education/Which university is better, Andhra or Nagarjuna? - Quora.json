            "answer_text": "I have Mater's Degree from Andhra University I have some friends in Nagarjuna University. Let's talk about dark sides first\u2026 My friends said that when you first enter into ANU, you will be received by two groups of seniors(Remember,these groups are formed by Caste Bias) who are eagerly waiting to show you how the Hell feels like. It's very common to occur group wars and sevior ragging (for example,Rishiteswari case).you get lectures only when the professor feels boring. To be honest, I never asked about the premises. In AU, there is no such things like Group wars and Caste.But ragging used to be there but now it's almost gone,you must call any senior with word sir/madam which is not a problem(for Btech, most of the juniors will cry, for others, it's nothing but fun ).When it comes to classes, in my department CS&SE, classes will go on and no matter what,most of the syllabus will be covered. When it comes to sports,we can't say one University is better than other. AU has a very well organized infrastructure for studies(dedicated buildings and halls for everything), sports(Two biggest Grounds in vizag belongs to AU)and Pleasant environment (3 Open Air plazas with 100 seating capacity in North Campus only and Dept Of PE gives free and we'll training in gym and any sports). And the Unparalleled thing is that, It's in Vizag. Many good beaches, Parks, so many tourist places with almost no cost and CULTURE. People are well mannered and welcoming. If you are lucky enough to get seat in AU, Never miss that. You will learn so many things for life too. ",
