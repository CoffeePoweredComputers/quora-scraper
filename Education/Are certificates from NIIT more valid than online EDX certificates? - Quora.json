NIIT is based on comprehensive learning in a classroom while edX is an online course. I personally feel that NIIT would be a better option as NIIT has a curriculum which is designed comprehensively. Also,NIIT is the best in it\u2019s field as it does a good job of creating a positive and encouraging learning environment which is unparalleled by any other technology institute and obviously a digital platform can\u2019t match that environment.
