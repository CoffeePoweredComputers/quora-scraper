            "answer_text": "It depends on your Board, stream and most important of all your future plans. See, I was a student from the CBSE board. As per the Board rules, apart from English, no other subject is compulsory. So, in theory you are free to choose whatever subject combination you wish. However, in reality, it\u2019s rarely the case. Irrespective of what the board rules states, you ultimately need to study and appear for the exam via a school (unless you intend to appear as an independent candidate). Schools in India tend to be very antiquated in their approach to education and design their curriculum based on prehistoric norms of accepted subject combinations intended to support for very specific careers. If you are in the science stream and choose not to take Maths, chances are you have to select Biology instead. I am a Bio student and I can tell you reading a class 12 bio book will put me to sleep right away. They contain almost no relevant information on modern Biology that will scintillate someone to dive into the subject. So, leaving maths, you will be stuck with Bio, well atleast its easier than Maths. If you are from a commerce stream, maths is not mandatory, but if you wish to pursue the academic line, having maths as a subject in your 12th will help a lot while seeking admits in good colleges. Same goes for humanities. Maths is a difficult subject ( atleast for me and numerous other people I know) thus it is treated with deference in the academic sphere and students not of the science background willing to take it up are respected as well. Finally, ask ourslef what is it that you wish to do in the future and which instititutes you wish to apply to, if you intend to  stay in the field of academia. Different fields and the institutes that offer them have different criteria of pre requisite knowledge they seek from applicants. See if Maths is needed. Base your decision on these aspects. You have the full liberty of repealing maths, just be confident in what you wish to do in the future given that India is still stuck in arcane ststem of careers and their pre requisites. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly it depends upon what are the subjects you have taken together whether you are a Medical or non-medical student. If you have biology than still you can think of doing the same as in drop the subject while filling up the subjects for your board exams. Also consult the same from you school and teachers because every school has their own guidelines. But if you are a non-medical student than I fear you can not leave mathematics because for non-medical student PCM is compulsory. Will suggested you to go start studying math if you are a PCM student. All the best!!! ",
