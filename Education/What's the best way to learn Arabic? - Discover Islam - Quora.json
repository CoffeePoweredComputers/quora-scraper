            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat's the best way to learn Arabic?\u201d I taught myself Arabic, and I was literate in about twenty minutes. So how did I do that? Well I didn\u2019t have a leg up from knowing some other language if that\u2019s what your\u2019re thinking. At the time I only knew English. Also this was in the days before the internet and I was serving time in prison. Nobody in that prison was teaching Arabic at the time although there were a few that understood it after years and years of formal study in a college classroom (I didn\u2019t know that at the time). In fact I wasn\u2019t even Muslim at the time. I had only started asking/learning about what Islam was. In the process of trying to learn about Islam one Muslim gave me a copy of The Holy Qur\u2019an, translated by Mushaf Al-Madinah An Nabawiyah. He taught me how to make wudu before handing me that book, but other than that I only intended to read it cover to cover to learn what was written in it. Occasionally, I asked questions only later to find the answers were right there in the Qur\u2019an (similar to Moses in 18:71\u201382, which once I reached this part of the Qur\u2019an I really appreciated because I could relate to the people of the cave and basically the book was telling me to seek understanding within my self rather than relying on explanations from others). No one encouraged me to convert to Islam and at the time that wasn\u2019t even thinking about anything of that nature. I was simply taking advantage of the opportunity to learn about something I wasn\u2019t normally exposed to. What I was invited to do is attend Islamic services and study groups and it was during those experiences that I first discovered that Salat was performed in Arabic because they were reciting the Qur\u2019an and the Qur\u2019an was revealed in Arabic. Translation was unacceptable because translation opened the door to changing the words for comprehension and could lead to changing the words, but leaning the chapters word for word in the original text prevented that. Now in the Qur\u2019an (mentioned above) that I\u2019d been offered was included a list of the Arabic alphabet along with the transliteration to assist me in correct pronunciation. So what I chose to do was attempt to learn that alphabet so that I could practice reading the Arabic itself directly instead of relying on transliterated chapters. I studied that alphabet the same way I was taught the Roman alphabet. I listed out each letter of the Arabic alphabet and learned the names of each letter.I recited the Arabic alphabet over and over and wrote it over and over until I learned the order and how each letter was written. I learned the vowels and other punctuation (which are not letters).Then I went to the text and tried to read surah Al Fatiha, which I was familiar with from hearing the Muslims pray.I didn\u2019t have surah Al Fatiha memorized at the time, but it was a homework assignment I\u2019d accepted. I was only familiar with it from hearing it repeatedly spoken in Arabic during salat. So from what little I\u2019d taught myself of the alphabet and trying to recognize the letters in surah Al Fatiha I read the Arabic over and over until it became natural. As I said, it only took me about twenty minutes of studying the alphabet before I was capable of recognizing the letters in text and being able to pronounce them. Being literate in Arabic did not mean that I automatically inherited an Arabic vocabulary. I would still have to read the translation to understand what the Arabic was saying, but over time I quickly picked up on the Qur\u2019anic Arabic vocabulary. Note that this is not the same as conversational Arabic, but that it is sufficient for a non-Arabic speaking person to quickly understand what is being said in the Qur\u2019an. I did eventually convert to Islam. I even was given the responsibility to teach other Muslims how to read and write the Arabic themselves so that they were unshackled from the dependence of transliteration when learning to recite more surahs for salat. Later I started meeting a lot of native Arabic speaking Muslims (from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Morocco, Lebanon, ect.) that were surprised by my pronunciation. The reason my pronunciation surprised them is because non-Arabic speakers that learn surahs exclusively via transliteration commonly mispronounce the phonics, but if a person is literate in Arabic (even if they\u2019re not fluent in Arabic) understand the way it is expected to be pronounced because the Arabic alphabet is very specific on pronunciation. After I was released from prison I eventually met and married an Iranian girl. Now she did not know Arabic but she was fluent in Farsi (of course she was shia and I was sunni) but we both recited the Qur\u2019an in Arabic. Arabic not being her native tongue there were times when she\u2019s question my pronunciation. So I tried to show he in the Arabic exactly how it was spelled. Until this time she was unaware that I could read the Arabic. This surprised he not just because I could read the Arabic but that she who was very fluent in Farsi wasn\u2019t literate in Farsi. Now Farsi does have a very similar alphabet so she asked me if I could read it. I\u2019d never tried to read Farsi before, and although she couldn\u2019t ready it she would know if I could because of my ability to pronounce words that she\u2019d be capable of understanding. So I tried it. Farsi does have some addition letters that Arabic excludes that I couldn\u2019t pronounce, but because she could understand the words I was saying and help me overcome these extra letters I quickly discovered what they were \u201cP\u201d, which is similar to a ya but with three dots underneath instead of just two (\u0640\u067e, \u0640\u067e\u0640, \u067e\u0640, \u067e). \u201cC\u201d, similar to a jeem but also with three dots instead of one, (\u0640\u0686, \u0640\u0686\u0640, \u0686\u0640, \u0686). the \u201cG\u201d in gaf, pronounced more like the English \u201cg\u201d distinct from the gayn which is the only alternative in Arabic. The gaf is written similar to the kaf (which is something I really like about both of these alphabets because letter that sound similar look similar) so the gaf looks a lot like the kaf but with a line that an Arabic reader might mistake for a fatha (\u0640\u06af, \u0640\u06af\u0640, \u06af\u0640, \u06af). There is also a sharp \u201cZ\u201d in Farsi that doesn\u2019t exist in Arabic (\u0640\u0698, \u0698). This is a copy of the Arabic alphabet to get you started  ",
