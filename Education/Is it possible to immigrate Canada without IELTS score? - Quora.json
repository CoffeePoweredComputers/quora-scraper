            "answer_text": "I migrated to Canada without IELTS. They gave me an exemption. Likewise, they exempted me from the personal interview. So in my experience, it is possible to immigrate without an IELTS score. I don\u2019t know their basis or reasoning, as I only received letters of exemption each time without any explanation. (I applied under the federal program under professional/skilled category more than 15 years ago). At the time of my application, IELTS and interviews were mandatory part of the process. So I was glad to save myself of precious time. ",
