            "answer_text": "The first thing you have to figure out is whether you are studying enough, or at all. Many people think they \u201cknow\u201d something, when they really don't. I recommend to my students that they study a little every day; read over their notes while eating, resting, whatever. Areas that they find confusing should be investigated further by rereading the text in that area Or consulting google. If you are still having difficulty understanding an area, you should reach out to the instructor and go meet with him or her prepared. have specific questions to ask in areas that you are confused. to study, you should test yourself. Give yourself problems, questions, etc (often these can be found in review sections of the text) and practice answering without consulting your notes or the text. Dont try to blindly memorize. Try to truely understand the topics you are learning. There may be some topics that lend themselves only to memory though, and these you should develop mnemonic devices for to assist in Retention. you can get tutoring for areas that you struggle in. Check if your school makes that available free of charge. You can also ask classmates to form a study group. lastly perhaps you should be assessed for anxiety or depression issues that might impact your ability to learn, study, and retain. good luck ",
