            "answer_text": "Yes, you will go on to 9th grade. Last time I looked, colleges do not look at grades prior to 9th grade anyhow. So the bigger question is, why did you get an F? Sometimes students just don\u2019t get it. If so, get a tutor. Sometimes teachers are impossible (yes I said it). If so, better luck at the next school. If standard schools are just overwhelming for you, there are many alternatives today to high school. There are online schools, weekly meeting schools, and community colleges that allow you to transfer credits back to graduate while moving on to college. 9th grade is still young, and you may change your mind about what you want to do many times, so keep your doors open, but don\u2019t worry too much about one class.

            "answer_text": "You shouldn\u2019t keep asking the same question, as roughly the same question was asked 6 hours ago: First: No One should ever get an F in a course. An F means that you Don\u2019t Care and did Not try. So, please, learn Now to Care, Try and seek assistance from the teacher during her/his open office hours. By the time you are in 7th grade, you are Not in a grade, but moving through courses. If you \u201cFail\u201d one course, that merely means you either have to re-take it the next year, or during this Summer. Or it could mean, that you will be taking the 9th grade Remedial version of that course next year, while you will be up-to-date in all of the other courses. And Once you are in a Remedial version of a subject, you will do Anything to get at Least a B and back on track again and Out of the Remedial group. All the best. ",
