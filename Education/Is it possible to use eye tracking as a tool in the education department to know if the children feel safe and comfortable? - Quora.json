            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. Many decades back, I was involved as a technician operating the apparatus in the earliest eye movement studies that were done on athletes in action. I still remember the gasps at the conference when we put the output of the eye tracking system on the projector as the athlete tossed a ball back and forth with the presenter. When we showed the pre recorded footage from a hockey forward out maneuvering two defensemen and scoring a goal, you could hear the jaws hit the floor. Measurement of eye movements has come a long way since then. The modified motorcycle helmet we used then has been replaced with headbands and glasses, so the technique is now feasible. What is not clear is how eye movement studies can determine if children feel safe and comfortable. Individual variations in eye movement habits are too great to infer that your of information. In one of the studies I participated in as a subject, they were attempting to measure the difference between an expert and novices eye movements in performing tasks on a computer screen. They thought the machine was malfunctioning because I did a pattern matching task without moving my eyes measurably, so we had to interrupt the test while I checked out the machine, to confirm that I was really doing the task almost entirely with my peripheral vision. Since my time on the task was so short and my eye movement were so minimal compared to the rest of the year subjects, we ended up throwing out my data, which was kind of funny because that was exactly the difference we were looking for. (As an aside, look up the \u201cquiet eye\u201d concept Dr. Vickers developed later - had she been that far along in her sports research she may have recognized the quiet eye and kept my data. Sigh.) Later, I took up karate. One of the comments I often received was that when I was actually most prepared I looked like I was falling asleep. Again, under pressure of competition I used my peripheral vision almost exclusively, so my gaze didn't scan. To summarize, you can tell what a person is optically focused on, and measure the time they remain optically focused on it, but you cannot derive the object of their attention or their emotional state from such measurements.
