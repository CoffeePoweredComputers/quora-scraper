            "answer_text": "Yes. You\u2019re probably asking \u201cIs there any hope for me without college?\u201d And yes, there definitely is. You don\u2019t need college to learn skills. In the U.S.A. college is something so ingrained in our society that many kids go right after high school despite not having any idea about what they want to do. It\u2019s a great way to waste 80k+ over the course of 4 years. Figure out what you want to do in life. If you need to get a job in the meantime to pay bills and survive don\u2019t let that job take over your life. Set aside time to think about your future and figure out what you need to do to get there. Also, live frugally so that when you figure out what you want to do, you can begin to freely navigate towards it. Trying to escape debt then get to what we want is difficult. Debt starts to dominate our thinking because it is scary. ",
