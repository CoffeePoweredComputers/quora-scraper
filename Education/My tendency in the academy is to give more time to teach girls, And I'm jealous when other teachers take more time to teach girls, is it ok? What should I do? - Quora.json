            "answer_text": "Hmmm, this is similar to what used to go on at my academy. I don\u2019t give more time to girls, but I have a preference for my girl students, they are adorable and smarter for the most part and the other so-called English teacher gets jealous. He especially gets jealous with the adult students.  That teacher introduced me around 14 months ago, saying he was friends with everyone and there are 4 young, beautiful vocal music teachers he said he was friends with too, but\u2026he\u2019s not. So, over the last year I have all the advanced students, all the adults, including the music teachers next door that come to me for English. What can the other jealous teacher do? Nothing, except on trying to learn to teach more effectively, be humble, and practice his English\u2026it\u2019s lacking to say the least. Also, since I\u2019m Korean and I speak both languages, it\u2019s a \u201cno contest\u201d situation.  My room is always filled with 5\u20137 students. I teach in and out of the classroom, I reward them with meals, ice cream trips, and take them outside working on applicable English. The bottom line is that I\u2019m more effective and innovative, maybe you can try some new ways to attract students to you!     ",
