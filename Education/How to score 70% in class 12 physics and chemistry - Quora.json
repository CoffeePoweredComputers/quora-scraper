            "answer_text": "Hello Parveen, I am going to give a few tips. If you follow them you can even score 90% in exams Physics: Get a grip on the fundamental and concepts of the subject to acquire an extra edge over the competitors.Generally the exams contain a number of questions that are direct formula- and theorem-based. Therefore, make sure to revise these as many times as possible.Repeated practice is the key strategy here. Use the formulas and theorems extensively in solving different problems of last years' papers and model papers, making sure to time yourself. Try and solve at least five numerical problems daily.Some of the relatively easier topics are Modern Physics, Optics, Oscillation & Waves, and Heat & Thermodynamics, which are more based on theory and direct formula. Preparing these well will get you sure-shot marks.Chemistry: This is a high-scoring subject while less time-consuming compared with other subjects.The questions on Organic and Inorganic Chemistry can be attempted first as these are fact-based and can be solved very quickly. This will boost your confidence and give ample time for rest of the paper.Speed with accuracy in solving problems can only be acquired thorough in-depth study of the subject and extensive practice.Thoroughly study the name reactions in Organic Chemistry, along with examples, as these are extremely important.Write down all the important formulae on a piece of paper and paste it where you can't help seeing it on a daily basis.Hope this was helpful.If so then please upvote:).Feel free to ask me for further queries.Remeber the old saying\u201cEarly to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise\u201d ..so wake up early, take proper sleep and study wellALL THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "answer_text": "You should rather aim for 90+ BTW you can get good marks in physics and chemistry if you work on these points during preparation - In physicstry to focus on numeric portion more. Practice derivations, numericals and never forget to write unit in your numerical answers, in derived formulae.Always satisfy your definitions with examples, formulae and fig. if possible.In chemistryWrite chemical equations to support your statement.Write chemical name or IUPAC name of compounds in reaction.Always write catalysts, temperature, pressure (if specified for reaction ) in reactions.Must remember named reactions.Practice numericals and balancing of chemical equations, they make solid marks.All the best.
