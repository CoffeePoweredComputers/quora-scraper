            "answer_text": "What I noticed the most were my own perceptions of the event and the 24 years that led up to it. It was surreal in that, we didn\u2019t technically attend my 10th reunion. We crashed it. But we fully attended the 20th. And I remember it, as well as writing this, like it was yesterday. I wrote it in 2012, a year after the 20th reunion. I honestly didn\u2019t notice much outside of my own head. And that\u2019s been typical of my life. After more reflection, I have a bit of melancholy about the experience we shared. I truly enjoyed visiting with you who blessed me with your time and conversation over the weekend. I am further grateful to you who accepted my wife (and the spouses of others!) in the weekend\u2019s conversations, goings on, and even friendships. However, I feel like I really missed out on knowing you throughout high school; I mean REALLY missed out. I missed out on truly showing you that I was actually capable of caring what you were going through. I was told by one of you what you thought of me in high school. Wow. I confess I did not take it well at all. Moreover, I regret not apologizing for my poor response at that time. Please forgive me. I was conversing with a dear college friend (also someone with whom I regret not spending enough time) about this phenomenon. It is not so much that I regret where I am at 38 years old (although, central New York winters are the bane of my existence!) as much as it is that I took very few photos and really have only fleeting memories of the events of so long ago. Those of you who I would classify as \u201cnew\u201d friends \u2013 you who ran in different circles 20 years ago or were involved in other pursuits. You are the ones I missed out on. Your dreams, your interests, and, yes, even those silly things that seem now to have been the vapor of that era. I, for one, had hidden myself in my pursuits. Musical programs and various academic pursuits, a part-time job, and a handful of dating experiences that left me empty. I still hide. Social and extroverted is not who I am, despite what I have portrayed, however successfully or otherwise. I thank you for your patience and gentleness when we talked. I regret not knowing some of you better than I do and I regret not keeping in touch over the years. I hope to take action on that, keep better in touch, and keep you in my prayers and thoughts. Some of you have reached out to me in your need and even in your pain. I pray that I offered you hope in your time of sorrow and struggle. Some of you have shared your joy with me for which I continue to celebrate with you. Regardless of where you go or what you do, I wish you all your dreams and aspirations to come to fruition. I wish you the promise of friendship and fulfillment in your relationships. Please know that this is not a letter of regret. It is a letter of reflection, for me, and of gratefulness. I am taking a big risk that someone will read this wrong, dismiss me, or even consider calling my wife to have me committed. This type of transparency is rarely welcome in today\u2019s relationships, but I find that it is often worth the risk. Nevertheless, I write it because I care about myself. I also care about you. I write this on the heels of the reunion because I just sense that this may well resonate with at least one of you. I ask nothing but your consideration of what I write, not seeking a reply \u2013 simply that you take a moment, breathe, and remember. ",

            "answer_text": "I graduated June 1980. As far as I know, there have never been any organized reunions for the school specific to any class. There was one grand reunion organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary open to all alumni. I did not attend. I looked at the pictures posted on social media. I started at that school after it existed for about 9 years, so there were many graduates older than myself in the pictures. Not too many names or faces that I recognized, nobody I really knew attended. Just as they are impossible to find on social media now. What did I notice? That I did not care\u2026I did not get nostalgic, nor did I even want to attend\u2026NO regrets for not going. On that weekend I celebrated my 55th birthday up at our summer residence way off in the bush. What did I notice? A total absence of any high school memorabilia on my shelves. No yearbooks. No newspaper clippings. What did I notice? I do not tell my grand children about the wonderful high school times I had and what a joyful time in their lives the can look forward to. What did I notice? that the best time of my life, that I did not peak in any way shape or form was not over 40 years ago within the confines of high school. What did I notice? That I am eternally grateful for the previous paragraph! ",
