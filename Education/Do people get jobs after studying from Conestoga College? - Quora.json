            "answer_text": "Yes they do. It all depends on you and that's empowering! There are job fairs organized by college, during school year. They, also, have job search service on campus, free for students, that helps you write your resume and prepare answers for job interviews. Instructors work in their filed of study so they can give you a job reference. Moreover, if someone is looking for an employee they often call Conestoga College and ask professors directly to reccomend their good student. By good I mean good work ethic but also a friendly attitude toward others. Happy studying! \ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf93 Edit: Please upvote if answer was helpful so I can have a feedback. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a ",
