            "answer_text": "Hi I am currently Pursuing my MBA in retail management at Andhra University.. Coming to my case i have completed my B.tech and thought of doing M.tech in some universities and later i took Icet examination and i got placed in Andhra university.. Andhra university is the one of the Top, Best and oldest university in India and one of the best one when compared in Andhra Pradesh.. But while coming to the education, teaching and classes regarding \u201cMBA\u201d it is not upto the mark and it is not in that level of IIMs, Private universities, B schools and Some of the good private colleges. Classes wont be that regular, and the faculty are less concerned about students.. It is all about our interest, our dedication and our Goal!.. MBA is all about learning Management and Communication skills and to learn and achieve independent life... At AU there is very less scope and chance to learn and communicate.. There wont be any extra curricular activities like PPT presentations, Class Presentations, Debates, Group discussions.. And it all depends on the batch, friends you get in your class.. In case if you don't have any other best option to join other than AU .. You can confidently take this decision.. I assure Studying in AU adds your weightage in interviews when compared with other government universites in AP.. AU is having very good fame.. Your image will get high when people, friends, relatives get to know that you are studying in andhra university.. AU will be conducting many sports activities, and other cultural activities.. You will be enjoying like anything and you will be entering into new atmosphere.. And it has very Vast Library\u2026 All the best.. Take a wise and smart decision.. Feel free to contact me if you have any doubts regarding MBA in Andhra university. ",
