            "answer_text": "This reminds me of a story about Mahatma Gandhi. Once a young boy was obsessed with eating sugar. Exasperated with this habit of his, his mother decided to take him to his idol - Gandhi, hoping he would put some sense in his mind. After travelling for hours they reached Gandhi's ashram. On meeting Gandhi the woman pleaded - \u201cPlease can you tell my son to stop eating sugar\u201d. After giving some thought to the woman\u2019s request Gandhi refused to do so and asked her to come after two weeks. After two weeks the woman returned with her child to Gandhi's ashram. This time Gandhi looked the boy in his eyes and said - \u201cBoy, you should stop eating sugar, It is bad for your health\u201d. The boy nodded and promised to do the same. But the woman was curious as to why Gandhi had taken two weeks to dictate such simple words to which Gandhi replied that he needed that time to cut back from sugar himself and he could not preach what he did not practice.

            "answer_text": "It can be stamped as harmony or oneness capability ! Eliminating the gap between thought, speech (spoken or written) and action is what makes a man/woman perfect - obviously perfection is a goal. Definitely very few countable across the globe will fit to be called Perfect (like Gandhi/Vevekanada etc.,).But we need not get discouraged since we being imperfect neither condemn us to be like that forever nor it can hamper us from making the effort to perfect our self which is the JOY of LIFE. To give one of the finest example of Harmony or oneness of thought,speech & action to capture what is perfection the below famed incidence is given. In 1893 September 11 in Parliament of World Religions when Swami Vivekanada rose to address his speech(he was allotted just 5 minutes I think) and uttered the phrase , 'Sisters and brothers of America\" the full house of thousands of audience went on a rampage with continuous applause -clapping which came to halt only two minutes after Vivekananda had to make sign efforts to calm down. Remarkable it is because Vivekanda was never known to them earlier. Most importantly the same phrase 'Sisters and Brothers of America\" was used in the same dais on the same day before Vivekananda by other eminent speakers(three I think). But why only Vivekananda received the applause and not others is a Billion $ ?. Answer is simple - Vivekanada had thought,spoken and lived(action) as ('as if\" is superflous here)every human being is his own sister and brother - not easy though for practice !  Any human being(however low they are in harmony/oneness capability) is capable of sensing and picking such greatness when found in others illustrated by the audience applause - Human technology ? So you will also able to sense to a certain extent the \"oneness\" whenever your hear or read some one. But I suggest we focus on improving our capability /perfection which should be helpful to us and others. Visit ;Humanity thanks page https://www.quora.com/q/qgdurvdsnfmmtdtd ",
