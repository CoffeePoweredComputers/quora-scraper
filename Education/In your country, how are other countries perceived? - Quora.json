            "answer_text": "Georgian here. I feel like it\u2019s better to divide the answer into 2 parts - frivolous and serious. The first one will be based on some Facebook page map that carries more or less common associations with certain regions in Europe. Auxiliary translations and notes are provided below. Warning: the answers in the first, frivolous part are neither my personal opinions nor are they meant to be taken seriously. So, 1) the frivolous answer:  Georgia on the map: Gross exaggeration of medieval borders. Turkey: Swarthy. Azerbaijan: Mameda (a common name for an Azeri dude). Slavic world: Hot chicks. Scandinavia: Hot chicks + welfare and good living. Baltics: Bros. German-speaking world: Good for shoplifting (apparently for some thugs who reside there illegally). Side note: I don\u2019t know why Denmark is lumped here instead of Scandinavia. Iceland and Greenland: Icebergs. UK and Ireland: Cool folks. France and Benelux: Fags (pardon my French. More on this in comments). Spain and Portugal: El Classico. Italy: Similar to us (especially Southern Italians). Balkans (excluding Greece): Gypsies. Greece: Fellow Orthodox, but asshole (once more pardon my French. I assume they wrote this due to Byzantium historically being perceived as insolent and bossy). Maghreb: Ghaddafi? Middle East: Dubai. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2nd part - serious answer: Turkey: Close partner in trade and energy, frequent travel destination and transit hub. Some nationalists perceive it as a threat (due to historical grievances). Armenia: Often teased on accent, appearance and even on some random issues. Due to Armenian merchants being privileged in Tsarist times, they used to be perceived akin to Jews, but nowadays most Georgians (especially young ones) are neutral and the relations between countries are normal. Azerbaijan: The only neighbour we never had a war with. The closest partner in energy, trade and involved in a number of important joint projects. Russia: their government is viewed extremely negatively (mostly due to its involvement in 1990s events; Civil war, Abkhazian and Ossetian wars, 2008 war and subsequent occupation of Georgia\u2019s 20%), but normal Russians who are not chauvinists or imperialists are welcomed very warmly (actually a huge number of them visit Georgia as tourists). There are still many cultural/family ties. Ukraine: Perhaps one of the most well-perceived ones. Loads of business, family, cultural, religious, political and other kinds of connections. A lot of Georgians love Ukraine and sympathize with its struggles. Poland and the Baltic states: Historically, Georgians and Poles had similar struggles and relations were always very positive, many Georgians fought in Polish resistance during WW2. Baltic states were massive supporters of Georgia too, their demeanor during the collapse of USSR was exemplary. Many tourists from these countries like to visit Georgia and on the other hand, many Georgian students go to study there and the relations are excellent. Belarus, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, FYROM, Serbia, Montenegro: Culturally similar Orthodox Christian countries that also experienced Communist rule (Orthodoxy is actually a rather big deal for conservatives). Czech Republic: Havel envy. Greece and Cyprus: Historically strong cultural and religious ties (Georgians even have a monastery on Mount Athos). Nowadays, increasingly popular for summer vacations and also a destination for some singers, sportspeople, female domestic workers (heavily concentrated in Athens) and criminals who got kicked out of Georgia by the previous government. Italy: Beautiful sights, great cuisine, dream holidays. France: Historically, Georgian kingdoms had contacts with France and it was perceived as a \u2018window to Europe\u2019. This was facilitated by a small group of Georgian converts to Catholicism (that often happened to study in France) who accomplished a great deal of intellectual/artistic work. Also, when Georgia was invaded by Soviet forces in 1921, the government was exiled in Paris and therefore France once more became a harbour of Georgian political and intellectual elites. France is also esteemed as one of the leaders of EU (notably during the ceasefire negotiations after 2008 August war). Benelux and Scandinavia: Neat, tidy, high income countries with polite people. Germany: Highly developed, industrialized and technologically advanced democracy with decent social security and admirable discipline. An exemplary country in every way. United States: Important strategic ally. Alongside with EU, a guarantor of Georgia\u2019s state sovereignty. Has provided a great deal of support (especially in the field of medicine). Commonly attributed images to US are those found elsewhere (Hollywood, Times Square, American Dream, fast food, etc). Latin America: Football culture and telenovelas. ",

            "answer_text": "Please take this with a grain of salt, but this is how people from the Netherlands see these countries: Belgium: the Ardennen are a prime summer holiday destination. Good for camping. Flanders is like us but with better food and the people are nicer. Beer!! The best beer in the world. We don't know anything about the Wallonians, because we ne parlons pas fran\u00e7ais. Sorry. Luxembourg: the part of the BeNeLux we know embarrassingly little about. They invest in space programs? They're pretty well off? They drink a lot?? Germany: we don't mention the war, but some older people will grumble they stole a lot of bikes when they retreated. They are our arch-enemy in football, you bastards, we will beat you (we just have to qualify first). Denmark: you're like us but you've got your shit together more. We also appreciate that we can cycle in your country when we visit without fearing for our lives or having to wear a helmet. UK: you get nil points during eurovision, and you'll definitely not get them after brexit. For real though, England is just a ferry ride away so it's the more hipster-cheap holiday destination. Has the better series (thanks BBC). We fought a few wars once but nobody remembers that. Stephen Fry played the main character in the movie adaptation of one of our most beloved books, so we like him. Canada: Canada is the best. They freed our country during the war, they sheltered our royals, they even declared a hospital international ground so the princess that was born there could be of Dutch nationality (or something, I'm blanking on the details). We send them tulips every year as a thank you. My cousin lives in Canada (everyone has a cousin that lives in Canada). We love you Canada!! Spain: we fought a war once, for eighty years, to get rid of you. Now we invade your beaches every summer. Poland: a complicated relationship. Lots of people don't like the Polish workers that come here (because there is a suspicion they will steal your bike), but the country is so lovely. Everyone wants to go to Krakow, and other cities are also really hip (Wroc\u0142aw is lovely). People are very religious? The government is not so good and people protested last summer? Indonesia: we did some bad stuff in the colonial days, and afterwards, and there's guilt there. But your food is so good. Indonesian rice table is the best (even though it's probably as authentic as Chinese food in the US..). We love to holiday in your country. I'll see if I can think up some more later. ",
