            "answer_text": "First thing you have to do is to make yourself confident that you can still do it then comes other things ! Then you must get rid of more than one problem book you might have for a subject ! It\u2019s not always how much you do but how well you did whatever you did okay ?! The extra books might be causing more harm to you than you can imagine as they take up time ! Prioritise ; jee has been kind enough to hint a general trend almost every year to students that some topics have better chances of coming in the paper than others so it must be your goal to be well versed in these first ! Not asking you to ignore other chapters but learn these ones with more attention ( ex-calculus/organic/electromagnetism) Also you must be completely well versed with the problem solving of these ! At the end of the day Jee is a competitive examination ( score matters a lot ) but people generally tend to leave these scoring areas ! But I suggest you to identify these and become stronger \ud83d\udcaa one last advice is we often feel we are losing because there is a lack of time in our lives \ud83d\ude43 obviously we can\u2019t create more time but use the already available 24 hours much more efficiently ! In short study more ! ",
