            "answer_text": "I gave Anthe that year. That exam was a bit tough as I was unable to answer some of the questions. I was only expecting to get a maximum of 80% scholarship because of bad performance. Then, the result day came, I didn\u2019t check my result on the night, it was released as I was determined that I wouldn\u2019t get that much scholarship which will make my expenditure at Aakash feasible. So, I checked it on next morning, I was amazed because I saw \u201c 100% scholarship on both tuition and technology fee. I was suspicious about my result then. I thought that it is a technical error and would have been showing a 100% scholarship to everybody. That day, when I asked about this result from my school friends, they got less scholarship than me. I then realized, \u201c Hey boy! you have really got that result.\u201d What was left then? I took admission to Aakash Preet Vihar Branch which gave the NEET and AIIMS 2019 topper (I think you know his name). One thing I would say to you is that in these types of competitive exams, your performance don\u2019t matter, your relative performance matter. A paper that is tough for you, would be tough for everybody. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all they do it for their business ,they collect 500 per student,so only by this they earn 20 percent more than their original spending , questions are easy I was confident to score about 70 % but they give 20 percent to most of the students. And give 80 percent to 3 percent student for publishment ,if u r crash course student then u get extra 10% that is 30 percent only. after this u will pay 1 lakh 30000 annum that is equall to Allen fee so it only for business ",
