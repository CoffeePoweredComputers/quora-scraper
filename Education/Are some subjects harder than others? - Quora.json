Don't worry about that; that's normal.  If anything, it'd be strange if you found every subject to be of the same difficulty. Don't worry if a subject you find difficult is considered easy by most of your peers; each individual has their differing strengths. In addition, there is very likely a subject where the opposite occurs (one that you find simple while many others find challenging). All of this is normal and is no reason for concern. A personal example of this: I achieved 5 in SL geography, often considered by the majority of students to be one of the easiest IB classes one can take at my school.

Some have a better grasp of hard sciences and math than \"fuzz\" subject like economics and other social science topics. In my case, I always found social science topics more understandable than math, especially.   IB is designed so that each topic provides a high degree of rigor.  No IB study is designed to be harder than another. ",
