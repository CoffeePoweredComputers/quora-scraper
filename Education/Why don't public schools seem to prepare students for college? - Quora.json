            "answer_text": "After teaching college business courses (full-time) for 28 years, I\u2019ve formed some strong opinions on this subject. But they are, of course, just opinions! And while many freshmen arrive on college campuses fully ready to handle their college classes, I believe that there are at least four inter-related reasons why so many students graduate from high school unprepared for college-level coursework: Lack of effective discipline in many K-12 classrooms (partly due to school administrators that don\u2019t properly support teachers who try to enforce the rules). Unruly students make it much harder for the serious students to learn!Semi-involved parents who don\u2019t ensure that their kids complete their homework assignments or study for tests; and who don\u2019t support teachers who attempt to maintain the classroom discipline necessary to foster an effective learning environment.A bloated, mandated K-12 curriculum that often attempts to cover too many things that could (and should) be taught elsewhere by parents, grandparents, pastors, coaches, scout leaders, and other adult relatives, friends and neighbors who want to see kids grow up to be responsible and successful as adults. I believe that this bloated curriculum (plus other added responsibilities that teachers are now expected to shoulder) has reduced the classroom time spent teaching the (so-called) \u201c3 Rs\u201d \u2014 the necessary basics of Reading, Writing and Math that are prerequisites for academic success in college.And resulting \u2014 almost inevitably \u2014 from reasons 1 through 3 above are a significant number of incoming college freshmen:whose reading comprehension is so limited that they often don\u2019t understand a lot of what they \u201cread\u201d in their textbooks \u2014 or can\u2019t properly comprehend the meaning of many questions they see on tests;whose punctuation, grammar and spelling skills are so poor that many of the written assignments they submit border on being indecipherable;and whose basic math skills are often so deficient that it can be mind-boggling! For example, while teaching the most basic college business course (Business 101), I\u2019ve often said something to students such as, \u201cImagine that you own a business that had $500,000 in sales last year and you ended up with $50,000 in profits. What was last year\u2019s profit margin?\u201d After seeing dozens of blank stares throughout the classroom, I\u2019d give them some help by saying, \u201cJust divide $50,000 by $500,000.\u201d And after more blank stares (and watching several students pulling calculators out of their backpacks), I\u2019d say, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a calculator for this! It\u2019s the same as 50 divided by 500 \u2014 or 10 divided by 100!\u201d At that point (in a class of 35 students) a single timid voice might ask, \u201cIs it 10%?\u201d Since students usually took Business 101 a semester before taking Business 121 (aka \u201cBusiness Math\u201d), this sort of thing happened often enough that I began spending class time each semester teaching students some rudimentary math \u201cshortcuts\u201d \u2014 and how to do basic calculations like computing percentages. But needing to take time out of a college business course to cover grade school arithmetic definitely \u201cbugged\u201d me!So, while I may be wrong about whether or not I\u2019ve identified all the \u201croot causes\u201d that underlie \u201cwhy\u201d so many freshmen do poorly during their first year in college, I believe that I\u2019ve listed the majority of those reasons that can be traced back directly to the formative educational experiences that those struggling college students had prior to graduating from high school. But again, these are just my personal opinions! ",

            "answer_text": "Many public schools do well preparing students for college, so the question contains an over generalization. Some public schools don\u2019t prepare students well for college. Reasons may include: Educational Gaps: Their pipeline of education from kindergarten through high school is weak. Students are promoted for social reasons rather than mastery of course content. This makes teaching in upper grades extremely difficult, since students aren\u2019t able to perform at their official grade level. They lack the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform in high school, so they are not ready for college.Parents: The parents do not have the skills or resources to compensate for poor public schools. They don\u2019t have time or money for tutoring, high speed Internet, and supplemental readings. Thus, they can\u2019t patch the holes in a student\u2019s foundational knowledge so they can catch up and excel in higher grades.If parents have not attended college themselves, they don\u2019t know how to tee their children up for the competitive process. They don\u2019t know what to ask of the high school, and the high school doesn\u2019t get a demand signal for college prep services.Resources: Schools are often funded by property tax revenues. Economically poor communities tend to cluster in Areas with lower assessments and thus less tax revenue. When schools are financially starved, they lack resources for facilities, technology, and extracurriculars. That affects the ability to attract and retain Highly skilled teachers. The poor schools are often plagued by low expectations for the students, who don\u2019t get support or encouragement to excel and aspire to college. Available resources may go to remediation rather than achievement. Social order may also be wrapped up in gangs or crews that discourage academic achievement.",
