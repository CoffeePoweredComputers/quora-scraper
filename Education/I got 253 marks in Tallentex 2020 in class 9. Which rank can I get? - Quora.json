            "answer_text": "See Tallentex is just a basic aptitude exam, not the JEE/NEET exam you are actually preparing for. It just explains that you have a certain aptitude for the JEE/NEET exams and are in no sort the rank explanations anyway. It is no way an index for rank. I personally know people with near 260 scores who\u2019ve not been even in the top 50 k of India whilst I someone with just 198 made an AIR 703 in JEEA 2019.

All I will advice is take up some good coaching; prepare and try to make a great rank. Rather than calculating your rank already. ",
