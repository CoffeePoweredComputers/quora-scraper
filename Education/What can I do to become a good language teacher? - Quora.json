            "answer_text": "The most important thing you can do to become a good language teacher is try! Therefore, by simply reading this answer you\u2019re improving. Putting in effort goes further than any other endeavour. Try to get certified. If you are not certified, consider an online certification course, or if affordable take classes at your local university. Only seek out trusted ESL advisors, such as UNI-Prep, as the Internet is awash with companies selling \u2018lessons\u2019- be careful. Try to improve your discipline. Hopefully you\u2019ve realized the carrot goes further than the stick. Hopefully there is not an actual stick ( you\u2019ll be arrested!). Have you tried a reward system? Or a system of teams? There are numerous trusted internet resources focusing on discipline. Better classroom discipline will make your day easier and your pupils learn more. Try to learn from your mistakes, not every lesson goes perfectly, however there is no such thing as a failed lesson if you learn from that lesson. Try new things. Have you brought videos into the classroom? Watch a child watch cartoons, you\u2019ll wish they\u2019d listen to you like that, hungry eyes pinned to the screen; lapping it up! Similarly, you can introduce new pop songs or comic books. Try to find things students like. Comic books, videos, and games are your friends. Dry text books, dictionaries, and memorization is your enemy. Finally, Try new things! There are plenty of websites providing tips on how to teach ESL. Give one a try. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. I\u2019m not one, but I\u2019ve known a few, of both types: classroom and more private (TEFL). If you want to teach a language to largish groups of people in a classroom setting, you first and foremost need to be a good teacher, in addition obviously to knowing both the language you are teaching and the one you are instructing in quite well. If you want to teach languages more individually, and above all more to a wider range of learners, your ability in your own language not to make mistakes is more important than your ability in that of the learners\u2019, yet at the same time you will need the ability to come up with the right word if they either try to describe the concept they lack a word for or simply use their own language. You can really help by just giving them the word they need at the right time. The reason I wrote \u201cmore individually\u201d is that you may want to pair up individuals of similar ability for conversation practice. It isn\u2019t very hard to be part of a three-way conversation where two students are just practicing at an intermediate level, but the more pairs of students there are in a class, the harder that becomes. However, we all have an ability to tune in to multiple conversations; how good it is is a different matter! Perhaps most importantly, being a patient and friendly coach will help your students get comfortable with their acquisition of your own language. All of these things take practice to get really good at, but remember that good teachers just help other people learn more effectively, and that you\u2019ve learned your own language effectively already. Last but not least, don\u2019t be an evil language teacher. Teach the write antonyms, and don\u2019t use the wrong homonyms, as I just did. Don\u2019t juggle kittens, either. ",
