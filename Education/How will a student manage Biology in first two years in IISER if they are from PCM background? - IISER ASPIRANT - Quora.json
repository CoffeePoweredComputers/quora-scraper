            "answer_text": "Quite easily, if you would ask me! There are 2 really good things, that play in your favour: Everything is taught right from the basics. While it may seem too easy to people who had biology in 11th and 12th, you still are getting an opportunity to catch up, while taking the support from your PCB background friends, faculty members and seniors.Everything is taught in a much more detailed and interesting way. Particularly the 2 courses of genetics and evolution, and ecology at IISER Mohali, are known to even make people who intended to major in physics/mathematics to change their minds and go into biology! Both these courses are in the second year, and were extremely fascinating and enjoyable.However, I would warn you: if you go into the course with the assumption that you cannot do well, or that you would hate the subject just because it is Biology, then yes, you may not do well. Some students indeed do not put effort because of such assumptions, and thus underperform. But if you approach the topic with an open mind, and persevere even if it is not as much fun as say your physics course, you can definitely do well. From the 4 biology theory courses in our core years, I managed to get an A grade in 3 of them, and got a B in one of them by just a whisker (the possible grades at IISER Mohali are A, B, C, D and F). For the 4 biology lab courses, I got an A grade in all of them. And all of this is despite having been from a PCM background, and I do have several batch mates who have performed similarly (some have even got all As!) and were from a PCM background. So quite simply, be open-minded, and don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance, and you will be fine. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I ended the last semester in which biology was compulsory with an \u2018A\u2019 grade. And I belong to PCM background. I used to hate bio when I was in school. I enjoyed the subject so much that I was considering of taking it as my one of my premajors in second year. But the point is not the grade, IISERs promote interdisciplinary research and for that you need to know basics of biology and every other discipline of science. Coming to the answer. Profs are super friendly in case you land at IISER-Bhopal Dr. Jeet Kalia, Dr. Vinita Gowda and Dr. Varun Chaudhary are some of the very friendly profs of IISER-B who taught me in my first year. I owe them for changing my perception towards biology and science in general.Concepts are taught in a very different way than they are in schools and coaching trust me I used to enjoy almost all my bio lectures more than maths lectures in my previous semester.Make friends who have strong grasp of biology. I was lucky to have the support of Raghav Galgali, a KVPY fellow and my seniors from bio department.Ask questions, IISER-B profs love answering back to back doubts if required they will call you to their office and solve your doubts or mail you the explanation to your question, considering how busy they are this is a big thing. In fact in both my semesters profs used to allot one day every week for doubt discussion.If you find yourself struggling at any point in the course simply mail your prof and he/she will surely help you. Just don\u2019t be anxious about it, it will all gonna work out just fine.P.S. - I am writing this based on my experience at IISER-Bhopal. ",

            "answer_text": "You will manage just fine or even better in some cases! Professors do know the fact that some students do not have a biology background in 11th and 12th. They start from the ground-level basics which makes it easier to understand (this will help you in the long run). Biology is an amazing subject, you won't have any trouble gaining interest. Additionally, there will be tutorials that will help you clear your doubts and you can always ask TAs for help after classes. Do not perceive the lack of biology in 11th and 12th as a disadvantage, rather, grasp it as an opportunity to learn a new subject from a research perspective. You might even end up choosing biology as your major (applies to other fields too). I personally know a senior from PCM background in 11th and 12th (and that too JEE channel), who later fell in love with biology during the first two years and took it as a major! He is now pursuing a PhD at Cornell University in the field of ecology. ",
