            "answer_text": "Let A\u2019s age be x and B\u2019s age be y. Then, x/y = 4/5 Therefore, 4y = 5x Therefore, y = 5x/4 15 years later, their ages will be x+15 and y+15 respectively. According to the given condition, x+15/y+15 = 5/6 Substituting y = 5x/4, we get x+15/(5x/4)+15 = 5/6 Therefore, x+15/{(5x+60)/4} = 5/6 Therefore, 4x+60/5x+60=5/6 Therefore, 24x+360 = 25x+300 Therefore, x = 60. A\u2019s age is 60 years. ",
