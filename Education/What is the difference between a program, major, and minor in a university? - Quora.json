            "answer_text": "Franck Sandwich\u2019s answer is basically correct, except that the term \u201cprogram\u201d may have different meanings. His definition says that each student\u2019s program is the set of courses he or she chooses to take. That is correct. But there\u2019s another definition. An academic department will define what is known as a \u201cdegree program\u201d , which is a collection of courses that a student must take as well as other requirements a student must satisfy in order to major (or minor) in a particular field. For example, a department of computing might offer a program in information technology, a program in computer science, and a program in computer engineering. These programs share some courses but have some differences. Perhaps computer engineering requires a circuit design course that the others do not. Perhaps computer science has a different set of elective options than the others. In order to graduate with a degree in computer science, a student will have to have satisfied all the requirements of the computer science degree program. But that does not mean all computer science majors take exactly the same courses. There are typically many elective courses in a degree program and different students may elect to take different elective courses. ",
