            "answer_text": "The concept of examination exists only to keep a check on lazy bums like us who tend to get deviated in the vast syllabus. Some seek knowledge while some seek marks in exams. A student appearing for any type of exam (entrance/board/scholarship/school/college) must keep in mind, that gaining marks shouldn't be their only purpose; gaining a certain amount of knowledge and development of applicative skills become much more vital. However, a student must also be aware of the truth that their small platter can't accommodate the vast ocean of knowledge, thus, some or the other thing is bound to fall off from the edge of your plate\u2026.. which is completely normal!!! Students are blessed with the chance to try again and again (and that is the actual purpose of education) STUDY PATTERN AND METHOD : Make it a habit to revise a topic taught on that day itself, highlighting of important points in your text book can be done here. Review of the day's topics shouldn't take more than 2\u20133 hours (regardless of your field)Try to be active in your class and answer as much as possible. It might help you to reduce your revision time.Don't compare your study pattern to others' . You are aware of the study pattern that suits you.Avoid procrastination!!!!! Keep 1 day in a week (preferably Sunday) to clear the week's backlog.Utilize 1 hour of focused revision of volatile topics.Enjoy your study. Understand its purpose. Understand your purpose in life ! Indulge in some sport or art.WORDS OF WISDOM : If you wish for success, then aim for 100%, work for 150% and expect only 75% !! Education is the stuff retained by your brain after the process of studying !! TIPS FOR EXAM : Start revising topics 10\u201320 days prior to your exam.Frame your answers mentally by preparing a framework/skeletal structure.Keep away from distractions.Take utmost care of your health.Practice a bit on presentation skills.Calm down ! This is just a test for you to know how much you know !! People may judge you with respect to your marks, but remember that your marks are only for your self-analysis.Don't ever think that you can perform exceptionally well in any exam !! Students are only able to score because the teachers allow them to. Your primary priority should be knowledge and not scoring in exam. If you are receptive to knowledge , you will be better than the past-You \u2026which according to me, is the single best thing about learning. GROWTH !! ",

            "answer_text": "Doing well in tests and exams requires planning ahead and studying smartly. There is no magic fix\u2013\u2013the effort and will must come from you but if you wish to succeed, it's worth it. Part 1 of 2: Studying Beforehand  Revise properly. This means setting up a revision timetable up to days, weeks or even months before the exam or test. The amount of revision time needed will depend on how big the exam or test is. You should revise the main topics for at least 20 minutes a day the week before the exam.  2.Listen to what the teacher is saying. He or she might make it very clear what to expect in the test.  3.Study in sections : Take the material you are provided with, including any revision notes and flashcards, and divide the material into sections. A good way to revise is to make a knowledge organizer with the topics that you need on it. If you have learning outcomes, then try to make sure that you know all of them. \u2022 Study by understanding key points. 4. Take a practice test. 5.Look at where you went wrong in the practice tests. Focus most on revising those sections. 6.Take a practice test again (with some different questions if possible). Continue until you return really good results. 7.Continue to take multiple practice tests. Do this regularly, until your actual exam or test.  8.Deactivate your social media while revising. It will only serve to distract you. 9.Eat and sleep well. If you are too tired then you will forget everything you studied and if you don't eat well your brain will not operate smoothly. 10. Do not cram right before a test. Instead, say the formulas in your mind or the properties and its names instead of just reading the textbook all over again. Rereading the textbook right before won't do much good, but a bit of last minute refreshing on what you memorize can be helpful. Stay calm. Try to relax and take a couple of deep breaths, if necessary while writing your paper. 11.Think about your answers. Make sure it is the right answer. If you are not sure of an answer, skip it and come back to it. Chances are it might be addressed in a different question, so keep your eyes open for more clues on the same topic as you complete the rest of the test. 12. Don't listen to what others say after the exam or test. If you think what you have written is right, do not stress if others wrote something else. Get on with your next sets of revisions, knowing that you did your best. Only your actual test results will confirm how well you have done. 13. Make sure to review your test results patiently. This will help you to see what you got right, and where you were incorrect, to help you to improve. Do this when in a calm state so silly mistakes can be fixed. Also, try and always be motivated as it will help you do better. So this are things which I do follow to get good marks. Hope it will help you also \ud83d\ude0a. P. C source http://google .

            "answer_text": "1 Pay attention in your classes. The best thing you can do to raise your test scores is to pay attention when you're supposed to be learning the material: in class! Letting your mind wander or not showing up at all are both likely to make you miss out on key information that will later appear on tests. 2 Take good notes. This is important if you want to have an easier time studying later. Not only will writing the information down as you learn it help you in absorbing the information and paying attention, but you'll have a reference for when you go to study later. 3 Do your homework. Homework, such as assignments and at-home reading are where you will find the rest of the information that will be on tests, so doing this homework is important. Schedule time and set aside a quiet place just for homework to help beat the procrastination blues. 4 Use mnemonics and other tricks. Various memory tricks really can be useful for remembering certain things like numbers, categories, and lists. Just make sure that you learn them correctly and don't mix them up! Mnemonics are phrases which can help you remember the order of certain things. For example, \"Katy Perry Came Over For Great Songs\" is a great way to remember the biological classifications (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species). Another memory trick is if you have to remember a string of numbers. Instead of trying to remember 2537610925, for example, break it up like a phone number: 253-761-0925. You can break up dates this way too. 14 Oct 1066 (the Battle of Hastings) can become a locker combination: 14-10-66. 5 Do practice tests. Ask your teacher or go online and print a few practice tests. Taking a practice test will help you figure out how much information you actually know vs how much information you think you know. Knowing your weak spots before a test is crucial! Method 2 Studying Like a Pro Study frequently. Studying hard for only a few hours the night before the test isn't going to help ensure perfect scores. If you really want to ace those exams, study old and new material every day, or at least several times a week. This will make test-taking a breeze. Take study breaks. When you study, make sure you take a 5-10 minute break after every 30 minutes of study. This will help keep your brain from getting overloaded and give it more time to absorb the information. On study breaks, try not to fill your brain with more information, even if that information is more about your favourite celebrity's latest concert rather than Winston Churchill's foreign policy. Study according to your learning style. You may know that different people have different learning styles. Some people are visual learners, some people prefer sound, some need physical motion, and so on. Know how you learn best and work that into how you study. For example, if you learn better by physically doing things, try walking around while you study. If you learn better with sounds associated with the information, listen to music while you study. If you're a visual learner, make a chart of the information you have to know. 3 Take advantage of sense memory. Your brain is pretty good at associating smells or sounds with ideas or memories. You should take advantage of this! While you're studying, wear some unusual cologne or perfume (with a smell you don't usually encounter) and then expose yourself to that smell again right before or during a test. 4 Listen to music. Your teacher probably won't let you have headphones during a test, but you should at least listen to music, specifically classical music, right before taking a test.[1] Studies have proven that exposure to certain types of music right before rigorous mental activity can really help, by waking up your brain and increasing your awareness. Good Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Q- How to score good marks in exams? Purpose should always be to gain knowledge and not marks, but passing with good marks is equally important in India. This answer will apply on all branches/ stream / college/ school. Classes/Lectures- You have to attend them no shortcut in that. Many times teachers emphasize on things which can be asked in exam specially if he or she sets the paper.Practicals/ clinicals/Lab- Practice all tests because if you don't you'll not be able to perform in exams. Also, practicals always carry good amount of marks which are easy to get.Important points- You need to know the frequently asked topics or questions. You cannot mug up everything specially if it's a vast course like MBBS.Notes/ Marking- Mark underline your book. Our brain stores things better if we write or mark them. Don't keep them blank. Make notes if writing makes you register things , notes should be handy.Complete course- Do not leave behind anything that can be asked.Reading and revision- There's no benefit of reading if you don't revise. Our memory is short lived in first reading. It becomes long term after multiple revisions. This is the key rule.Discussion- If you have a good friend circle discuss the topics you studied. Ask questions to each other.Now comes the examination day- Attitude- Don't be scared or overconfident. Take a good night's sleep. Eat breakfast. If you have prepared above steps well no need to panic.Handwriting- Now I know most students do not have a good handwriting. Try to write legible. Practice it before hand when you make notes. It's logical if I can't read something I'll give you less marks. Because examiner has to check thousands of copies. No need of calligraphy but legible.Spacing- You have ample amount of paper. Leave a line between questions. Draw a margin.Presentation - Write in points wherever possible. If not, make short paragraphs. Leave a line with new paragraph. Draw diagrams. Flowcharts.Color- Use colored pens if allowed. Color pencils for diagrams. Label correctly and neatly.Mug up- Few things you have to mug up. Formulas, equation, chemical reactions, laws, lots of things. Revise them a day before exam. Or an hour before.Viva or practicals- Dressed up- Please iron your clothes, polish your shoes. Comb your hairs. Presentation matters. If your Viva isn't going well they are gonna point at this for sure.Be confident- This is possible through above mentioned points of revision and notes. Take your time and answer.Don't panic- Every time in college exams I was doing blood group examination ( odd/even roll number system). But during university the tests interchanged I got Hb estimation. There are chemistry( school)/ biochemistry ( mbbs) tests which you get perfect color/ reaction regularly but on the day of exam you don't get it. So don't panic.Luck- Got 10/10 on histology spot examination, but two slides for detailed examination I couldn't identify. Picked up wrong chit or wrong option. Got the only question I didn't study. Some things are just out of your hands.Lastly, you get good marks by accumulation of everything. Theory, practical, files, Viva, conduct, attendance. Every aspect has to be perfect if you want to top the exam. As we say, be in the good books of your teachers. It works too. Above mentioned things helped me score cent percent in Mathematics and computers in school, distinction in pharmacology in college, and good marks in rest of the subjects. I never topped as it takes continuous efforts, a bit crazy attitude and high devotion. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "I will offer you four. Remember that the examiner is a person. He or she will be marking literally thousands of scripts. They will be bored. Tired. Underpaid. So make their job more fun. If you're writing an essay, don\u2019t be afraid to put in a joke or two. If they laugh, they\u2019re on your side. Also, make sure your handwriting is legible. It's a small thing, but it matters.Stand out. When I was 12 and we were discussing my upcoming exams, my mother came up with the phrase the \u2018killer fact\u2019. A killer fact is something you get into your answer that no-one else in the country will say. A date of birth. An obscure term or word. Something interesting and impressive which will really set your work aspart from the rest. It'll take you 15 minutes of extra research to find something that fits and to memorise it, but it will seriously elevate your writing to the next level.Focus. The most important time in exam preparation isn't the week before the exam, or even the day before. It's the hour before. If you're head isn't, to quote Troy Bolton \u2018in the game\u2019 you\u2019re likely to waste all your hours of hard work and underperform. So get relaxed. Listen to Whale Music. If meditating\u2019s your thing, meditate. It isn't mine. Get psyched for the battle ahead. An exam is a fight between you and the questions, so get the adrenaline pumping. Listen to some Eminem. I personally imagine myself as Theoden before the Battle of the Pellenor Fields as I walk into the room. Also, if people are stressing you out beforehand by talking about the questions or whatever, get out of their fucking earshot. You don't need them. Being relaxed and focused is so important, I just can't stress it enough.Brain dump. Connected to the last point, I've found holding a handful of words or useful phrases in my mind literally as I walk into the exam room and then scribbling them down on the front of the exam paper as soon as I sit down helps focus my nerves and also gives me a bank of information to draw on if I get stuck during the exam. A smaller tip maybe, but it can be really useful.Good luck! ",

A lot of unexpected events can happen on your way there and you do not want to be late! Exam Tip #6If there are people around who are panicking, avoid them. They are not doing you any favour! Exam Tip #7Go to the toilet before the exam starts. Exams can be quite long and there is no time to waste. Exam Tip #8Remember to write your name on the exam paper. You would not believe how many people have forgotten to do it! Exam Tip #9Read all the questions carefully before starting and quickly plan how much time to allocate to each. Exam Tip #10Start answering the questions that you feel most confident about. There is no need to answer the questions in order. Exam Tip #11If your brain freezes, just start writing anything and you will soon start remembering more details. Exam Tip #12Don\u2019t spend more time than you planned on a particular section/question or you might run out of time to answer other questions and gain those extra marks! Also,  leave any questions that you are unsure about for the end. Exam Tip #13Don\u2019t be afraid to ask the examiner if you are not clear on a question. Exam Tip #14Use every minute of the exam and if you have time left, review your answers before handing back the paper. Exam Tip #15Stay calm, you have done your homework and have nothing to fear!

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know the way they rate your schoolwork, but when it all depends on exam results, consider the lessons purely in function of the exams. Read the chapter that will be the subject of the next lecture/class/lesson. Take notes during the classes in draft style. Back home, integrate your notes with what\u2019s in your textbook. When you write in your textbook, do it neatly. If you have time, summarise the chapter, otherwise don\u2019t wait too long to do so. You should have summaries of every subject. Pro: you\u2019ll already know the structure of a subject, you\u2019ll have had the chance to get more information on issues you don\u2019t understand. The advantage of knowing the content of lessons beforehand is that you\u2019ll hear more easily what the teacher considers to be important and what less or not at all. Many teachers (when they write the exam questions themselves) will, not explitively, but by giving a hint, tell what will be highly probable exam questions. (I used to highlight those hints with a green fluo marker).Being active in lessons or frequently asking questions for the sake of asking questions gets you nowhere. When you ask sth., make sure the answer is relevant for better answering exam questions. Whatever anyone may claim, learning things by heart remains an important part of studying. There are far more subjects that you cannot know by logical deduction or sensible reasoning, but that you can only know by accepting them and getting them somehow in your head. Don\u2019t study too intensively too early, you\u2019ll forget it. Be sure, you have an insight in the subject, have a good idea of what the former lessons were about and have a look in the table of contents to know what will follow. Know yourself. You ought to have an idea of the speed at which you can study. Being a student doesn\u2019t differ that much from being a blue collar worker. Determine the number of hours you\u2019ll need to study per week, make a scheme and respect it. It\u2019s no use to study frantically in the days before the exams. Beginning in time will avoid you many stressfull moments. Take care of your desk and the room where you study. That desk should be as empty as possible. The neatness around you will have an influence on your ability to concentrate. Do not listen to your fellow-students. Those with the highest grades will tell you they studied very little for an exam, or will talk about other activities they did instead of sitting at their desk. They tend to make you believe they have sky high IQ\u2019s or natural skills that enable them to study at least 3 times faster than anyone else. Yes, there are students who are more gifted than others, but talent alone isn\u2019t enough. If they were honest, they\u2019d tell you they rely on 5% talent and 95% hard work. I\u2019m sure you knew most of this without asking me. You know exactly why your results are not as good as you want them to be. I guess you are easily tempted by funnier activities than studying. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if you spent more than 50% of your time playing games on your pc instead of doing research for school, as you make your mother believe. Hence, first task: clean up your desk. Then, take your textbooks and categorise them, don\u2019t allow them to look like a messy pile of paper. Evaluate where you stand NOW and make a plan to get to where you should be now. You\u2019ll need an empty head, perseverance, motivation and courage. Be aware that nobody can help you here, you\u2019re on your own! SUCCESS ",

If the proper solutions are taken into account, the best scores can be bagged comprehensively. The most important thing that one student needs to take care of, during the examinations is that they must keep calm so as to deal with all sort of questions, both easy and miscellaneous. Some essential tips and tricks for qualifying the examinations confidently are as follows: Firstly, the students must make sure that they have referred to their date sheet that is generally prescribed by the board officials that is responsible for conducting the same examination. The date sheet spells out the dates of the examinations and thus, it is easier for the students to prepare the subjects according to the hierarchy of the dates. Secondly, all the students must ensure that they spend maximum hours studying and also rest at the intervals. The tough chapters must be acknowledged first so that the easier are easily done at the end with more time left for revising the former. Thirdly, the students must refer to a large number of sample question papers of all the subjects included in the syllabus so that they get a grasp over the question pattern and answer them comprehensively after enough practicing. Fourthly, the students must make a very decisive choice of the books that they are referring for the examinations after proper consultations from their subject teachers, peers and passed out seniors who already have a good knowledge regarding the books and reference books. A study plan must be included with all the above points, as the same assist the applicants to follow the routine and also allocate equal time to all the important subjects along with mandatory intervals of mathematics practices. Lastly, all the answers must be prepared according to the marking scheme set for both long answer type and short answer type questions. The marking schemes are provided in the sample questions papers/books. The marking schemes are vivid for the subjective, objective as well as literature or language subjects. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I saw all of this at a friend of mine, she was absolutely fabulous and aced all of her exams, some of which she even took earlier than the school planned:  Develop a strong focus during teaching. Pay absolute attention to everything. Try to get learn the lesson from class. If you have assignments, try and work on them the very same day you got them, even if they're not due the next day. If for some reason you can't, make it a habit to wake up early and do the assignments for that day in the morning: even better if you do the assignments as soon as you get them and the day before the class for which you had those assignments, you go through the previous lessons and previous assignments and simply read them with a strong focus. In fact, most of the time in class you don't get a full session of teaching, you get some teaching + some practice + some distraction + some \"breaks\" - teacher examines a fellow classmate or checks the attendance list or whatever. You shouldn't get those breaks, focus intently on the lesson of the day for the duration  of the class, there's a break for you in-between classes and that's more than enough.  Every week give yourself 1 hour and organise what you've learned that week. Check out and see if there's anything in particular you didn't quite fully understand or that you need to practice a bit more...and do that practice.  If your \"teaching\" explores everything you need to know for exams, then you're set. Simply take a couple of \"simulations\" of the exam (sample exams) and check out how well you do before the exam.  If your exam requires more than what you're being taught in class, that's fine. Imagine I had no special preparation for the SAT, for example, yet it wasn't all that difficult for me to prepare for it. Simply do exam-specific training. Syllabus/curriculum - have a list of topics for any class you take, have a list of topics for any exam you'll take. Use these to check out your progress...you can even use them to better study by memorising the syllabus and then \"organising\" the lessons and concepts into tiny syllabus-looking lists of concepts. Once you work through a concept, it's a lot easier to remember it and where it's placed in your head if you make mindmaps out of the syllabus.  Try and engage fellow students that are your friends into doing \"special projects\" or extracurriculars that relate mostly to what you need to master for your exams. Sometimes this could take you to weird places, such as learning to use Macromedia Flash (now it's Adobe, but back in my day..) to make an animation + micro-video game for a special school event that had little to do with the announced topic, but a lot more to do with working alongside a crush. Sometimes it could be spot-on: a particularly in-depth exploration of a topic you had in class which you then deliver as a presentation. Who knows ? Figure out what sort of things you have an opportunity to do in school. Don't get cocky ! From all this advice I'm giving right now I mostly followed the paying attention part...and the extracurricular activities part. For nearly 4 years of high school I barely took notes, barely did any homework and nearly never studied before a test. I'd spent 1 morning/semester studying for the \"Math paper\", just to get an idea of what we've covered in class and how to use it. I did, however, pay a lot of attention during teaching. Most of the lessons I got really well because of paying attention instead of mindlessly jotting down notes. I only needed to sort of recap about 1-2 times a year in order to stay good. And I was involved in organising hundreds of extracurriculars/out-of-school projects/stuff like that. I did do very well in my exams, though surprisingly I did better in international exams than in Romanian exams. I only got 10/10 in about 3 exams out of the 6 I had for my final high school exam. To be fair, nowadays, only 50% of high school takers get an average of 6/10 - which is a passing grade. In my C++ exam, which I had to take on paper, I couldn't remember the syntax for a \"type struct def\" -\"typedef struct\" sort of thing (still don't) and that's because I was more used to getting the algorithm than remembering syntax, and this took off a few points. Ultimately it didn't matter, but still, I could've had a perfect grade. Point is, do your due diligence if you want to ace your exams.   ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some habits of top students that you can use as tips to do better in school: 1. They don\u2019t always do all of their homework. In college, homework assignments generally make up 5-20% of your grade, but can be the biggest time-suck for most students. Yes, working problems is one of the best ways to turn new concepts into working knowledge, but a large majority of those problems that take you hours and hours to work through, you\u2019ll never see on an exam. 2. They never \u201cread through\u201d the textbook. Per time spent, reading the textbook is one of the least effective method Top students use the examples and practice problems, but otherwise use Google, lecture notes, and old exams papers for study materials. 3. They Google EVERYTHING. It\u2019s like an automatic reaction. New concept = go to Google for a quick explanation. Don\u2019t think just because your professor gives you a textbook and some examples on the blackboard that you\u2019re limited to that information. You have a massive free search engine at your fingertips, so make use of it. 4. They test themselves frequently. Testing yourself strengthens your brain\u2019s connections to new material, and gives you immediate and clear feedback on whether you know something or not. Bottom line,repeated self-testing significantly improves long-term retention of new material. 5. They study in short bursts, not long marathons. Studying in short bursts tends to help you focus intensely because you know there is at least a short break coming. The natural activity/rest cycle of our bodies, which makes studying continuously for multiple hours on end counterproductive. 6. They reverse-engineer solved problems. It\u2019s one thing to follow and memorize a set of steps to solve a calculus problem. It\u2019s an entirely different thing to understand what a derivative is, be able to take derivates of complex functions, know when to use the chain rule vs. the product rule, etc. The problem with simply following the steps the professor provided, or the textbook outlines, is that you\u2019re only achieving a surface-level knowledge of the problem. Top students, instead, take solved problems and work backwards, from solution to question, asking \u201cwhy.\u201d Why did this get this value?Why did they simplify this expression?Why did they use that type of derivative rule? By following this process, you begin to understand the interconnections of the concept, and how to directly apply that to a problem. This \u201cworking knowledge\u201d of a concept is key to performing well on exams, especially on problems that you haven\u2019t seen before. 7. They don\u2019t own a highlighter. Highlighting anything = unengaged reading. If you want to note something that stands out, underline and write a corresponding note to go along with it. Or better yet, write yourself a note summarizing the item in your own words. 8. They sleep\u2013a lot. The daily routines of top performers, in any field, are characterized by periods of intense work (4-6 hours per day) (9 hours per night). You see this trend in top violin prodigies and chess champions, as well as elite athletes. The idea is to alternate periods of intense work with rest, so that you create tons of new connections in your nervous system, and then allow adequate time to assimilate those gains. 9.They make the best out of lecture. Yes, your professor sucks. Yes, lectures are boring. Yes, it\u2019s either too fast so you can\u2019t keep up and miss all the important stuff, or it\u2019s way too slow and you start zoning out because you already understand everything. The best students look at this this way: I\u2019m going to be there no matter what, so what\u2019s the best use of my time while I\u2019m in the classroom? Ask questions, bring the textbook and look stuff up, focus on the important practice problems to copy down in your notes, try to anticipate what the professor is going to say, make note of anything they put emphasis on as a potential exam topic. All of these things make the time you have to spend in lecture more productive and engaging. And that\u2019s less time you have to spend studying later on. 11.They immediately study their exam mistakes. Most students get their exam grade back, flip through to see if the professor made any mistakes they can argue about, and then promptly shove it into their notebook, never to be seen again until the mad scramble at the end of the semester to study for the final. Instead, top students ignore what they got right, and use their mistakes as an indicator of what to improve on. 12.They\u2019re busy with work and side projects. Yes, to do well in a course, you need to focus and put in the hours. But like many geniuses throughout history have shown, involvement in a diverse set of subjects, activities, and skill sets keeps you active, and provides you with a rich and diverse set of mental models to pull from. Also, as they say, \u201cIf you need to get something done, give it to the busy person.\u201d If you stay active in multiple areas, you don\u2019t have time to procrastinate, and are forced to be efficient with your study time. This generally translates into quicker learning and better performance throughout the year. 13. They don\u2019t wait for motivation to strike. motivation comes and goes, but studying for a degree requires persistence and consistency. Just like Olympic athletes train even on their worst days, the best students figure out how to get their coursework done when it\u2019s the last thing they want to do. 14. They practice under test conditions. The old adage \u201cpractice makes perfect\u201d isn\u2019t totally true. Deliberate practice under the right conditions, with the correct mindset, is more like it. Instead of reading through all of the lecture notes and redoing old homework problems, top students make themselves practice exams, and rehearse their exam performance, under time pressure and in similar conditions (no notes, uncomfortable chair, quiet room, etc.) to what they\u2019ll see on test dates. 15.They use the 80/20 rule. Yes, some students who get good grades do every reading assignment, finish every practice problem, and attend every study session they can get their hands on. But these students are missing the point. There will always be an endless amount of information you could learn given the time and effort, but having the ability to discern what is worth learning will truly set you apart. Top students identify the 20% of concepts they need to learn deeply, in order to determine 80% of their final grade. They focus intently on those few things, and simply ignore the rest. This is a formula for high performance, without hours and hours of busywork. And it translates seamlessly into the real world too ",

            "answer_text": "For getting good marks you need focus on following qualities1. hard work2. Smart work3. Dedication 4. Positive attitude5. Presentation Skills Hard Work: I suppose, I don't have to explain what hard work means. Hard work doesn't imply picking up your books one day before exam and doing all nighter. Don't ever be a grasshopper when learning, be an ant.    Plan for your exams, Always have a reminder when your exams are going to be and prepare for them chapter by chapter at a time. Instead of overwhelming yourself in the very end.   Smart work: If you don't have enough time to cover all topics in a subject check the previous question papers and try to cover important topics. If you are not able to understand a topic go to your friend or teacher or your seniors who ever you are comfortable with ask them to help you understand the topic. Make quick reference notes of each topic you cover so that you don't have to go through the whole topic again and again .use markers to mark the important points in a topic/chapter. Dedication: Half hearted effort will never take you any where. You need dedication to achieve in life.   Positive Attitude: Sometimes in life we encounter failure instead of getting discouraged learn from your mistake and try to improve yourself for the next time. You have done your best so never get disappointed about the result and try to improve yourself for the next time. you cannot turn time back to redo the stuff so cheer up and look forward for the next exam. Ask your teachers and friends to check what mistakes you have made to correct them next time around. Presentation Skills : Even if you have all the above skills, if you are not able to present your answer properly all your effort goes to waste.  And so you should work on your writing skills . You also need to work on presentation of the answer as someone anonymous is going to correct your answer sheet. ",

            "answer_text": "This is what I wanted to share with some one all these years .I only learned this during my PG and understand it ,it really works . There is no shortcut for what you study whole year for knowledge .Keep study for whole year to earn the knowledge for the subject and understand them better . It is just matter of how to put all that knowledge in the exam .You must have studied the subject well .I use to read 3 4 books for same subject and make notes from that and read only those notes during exam time .I at least start preparing for exams 2, 3 months in advance and start creating those notes.Those notes are most important for me .I even use pencil to mark important thing in book and while revising just read those things nothing else. It is not like I never did these things in my previous exams.But I never scored that well. During exam I most of the time only read my notes nothing else which covered all the syllabus for that paper .Exam use to be in morning so I make sure I do all the revision in the nigh only .Mostly I try avoiding wake up early and revise things.Which make me relax before exam .But still I read few things which I forgot and some time things which you read last movement you remember in exam hall. This is all about preparation for exam and study . What ever you study we use to forgot things in exam hall how to cope with that . Here are few pointer for exam hall and writing exam (I did this only in my PG and It worked well to get good marks )    @ Keep calm  :Keep your self calm even if you forgot every dam thing you studied and paper is out of the syllabus .Read the whole paper first, read it 2,3 or even more time. Note down the question which you know best answer for them make a order and attempt in that order only.      @  Attempt them all  Always make sure you not suppose to leave a single question un attempted I will tell you the reason soon .Make the order of question which you can answer the best.if you started a question and forgot the answer in between leave the question there don;t wast you time attempt some other leave some space there to attempt it later else leave it all together you might not get time later to re attempt it . ## Start with what you know best :Always start with question which you know  best .If you pick a question which you can't answer will frustate you and you will forgot every thing else .Start with what you know and even writing answer write those points first which you know best  understand examiner read the start questions and read the start of answer well this is about making first impression     @ Divide time  : Divide the time for all the question in equal amount and the number of pages to write .So you need to keep the eye on your watch you must have watch in your hand.You need to cut shot your self if you are writing to much to answer a single question on the cost of others fource your self to do that you need to attempt all question at any cost .Writing to much for a question will not get you more marks for that question understand it 10 marks question will not going to give 20 for writing long answer .But leaving a question  will cost a lot . Eg .For  5 marks question I try to write a answer not more than 1 and half or 2 page . 20 marks ,max 5 page even if I can write 20 pages for that .I make sure I attempt all the question  You need to decide this based on you writing skill.   @  Bullet Point  answer : While giving answer try to make bullet point to highlight your answer(try to divide answer in points ) .If a answer include point .Never give points as 1 ,2,3 4  just to use some other method like use #, ##, **&,*,^ (special symbol for 1,2,3,4)  like symbol to cover if you miss few points examiner will never know .Do yo think all the time they count and will not cut the mark . @  Highlight important Point : Highlight important point in answer .Understand examiner will not read whole answer try to mold him to read important point for that question .If he/she understand that .They are not going to read whole answer .You might have forgot and not remind the answer completely this will help to save your marks. # Use multiple colour pen :  This is to highlight import points and write a defn kind of thing in different colour this really helps  to keep attraction when you don't know the whole answer but only the bullet point for that question. $ Write some thing on top margin : I use to write very important point for that question on top margin with different colour pen. ##  Write some thing even if you don't know  :Make sure you attempt all questions .Even if you don't know any thing for a question .Copy some other answer and write in it .but make sure this question suppose to be at the end of you answer sheet. Examiner never wanted to fail some one, keep that in mind .He will try to give you some mark but understand you most have written some  thing ,some time  poor student can get passing mark this way .I did this most of the time I passed my weak paper this way when I know I am going to fail. This really work 100% of time examiner are good people they never want you to fail. This will definitely not going to work for all question. ##  Making diagram : Diagram are really very helpful .If possible always make diagrams to explain your answer better . ^^ You can't fool examiner : If you have not studied it will difficult to follow the points I added you suppose to study first .The above point will help you to get some better mark for the same question and it really worked for me . Do you know how many point I added I am telling you this works . ",

            "answer_text": "Short Answer : Learn to enjoy studying :) Remember to study for knowledge and not study for getting good grades! This helped me a lot, and so might help you too\u2026 (STUDY FOR KNOWLEDGE, GRADES WILL FOLLOW ON ITS OWN)  Tips : 1)Learn the importance and value of education : As a student, you should understand that studying is a path to what lies ahead in your life. Studying is a path to attain all your dreams. Usually, students who have learnt to value education, tend to enjoy studying, as well. 2)Keep your study area organized and comfortable : This helps you to concentrate better while studying by reducing unwanted distractions. Keeping all the required books, pens, and other instruments within reach help you to stay focused on studying. You don\u2019t have to look around for any book you need. 3)Discover ways to enhance your concentration : Concentration is unquestionably the most important attribute necessary to enjoy studying. Staying focused on what you are reading helps you to understand and absorb it. This is the essence of enjoying your studies. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for you to ascertain all the essentials that enhance your concentration. 4)To enjoy studying, prepare in advance for tests : If you intend to truly enjoy studying, you must make it a habit to prepare well in advance for all your tests. You cannot enjoy studying when you are preparing on the last day prior to your test. This will make studying a painful experience for you. 5)Ensure adequate lighting in your study area : Good lighting and relaxed seating are important for long hours of study. A comfortable chair and a good quality study table are pre-requisites for you to enjoy studying. 6)Ensure that your study area is free from disturbances : Ensure that outside noise and disturbances do not affect your studies. Your study table must be located in a silent area free from all external disturbances. 7)Mark all important dates on a wall calendar : You must mark all important dates pertaining to your academics clearly on a wall calendar. This should include the due dates of assignments, homework, and projects. You must also mark the dates of all class tests, term tests, and semester tests. 8)Remember to take short breaks : Taking short breaks during studying helps you in retaining more of what you have studied. Hence, short breaks are helpful during a long study session. 9)Manage your time optimally : This can be achieved by scheduling particular time slots for study. You can schedule all other activities during the remaining period. During the time slots allotted for studying, finish your assignments, homework, and project. Plan to fit in your reading into these time slots, as well. (Refer to my answer - Sanjay's answer to How should I make a study timetable for my exam? ) 10)Stay positive : Staying positive is necessary to enjoy studying. Think of all the benefits you can derive from scoring high grades. This will motivate you to strive harder in your studies. 11)Be prepared; banish fear of exams : Make it a point to study every day. This will boost your confidence and help you in being prepared for assessments. You can banish the fear of exams only when you make it a habit to be prepared for them well in advance. When the fear of exams is banished from your mind, you will truly begin to enjoy studying.  Also refer to one of my answers : What should I do to concentrate on studies to top in class? by Sanjay Abraham Sanjay's answer to What should I do to concentrate on studies to top in class? Hope my answer helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "The main thing about studying well is to first study smart. [1] Preparing for a test shouldn't involve staying up all night before an exam. Studying well requires preparation ahead of time. The trick to studying well is learning a few tricks as well as your own preferences. Studying depends on your commitment and what type of environment you strive in. Part One of Four:Taking Care of Yourself 1Drink plenty of water. Water is the elixir of our bodies. Having a glass of water available while studying will help fuel your concentration during studying. Staying hydrated can benefit your memory as well.2Eat well. Treating your body well is half the battle of entering the right mindset. There are certain foods you can eat that will improve your focus and your general well-being. Studies show that eating high-carb, high-fiber, slow-digesting foods like oatmeal are best for the morning of a test. The food you consume the two weeks leading up to the exam are just as important and affect how well you study. Eat a well balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables.[2]Incorporate superfoods into your diet like blueberries and almonds.3Stimulate your circulatory system.This system controls your heart and blood path. Part of healthy studying is a healthy flow of blood to your brain. Studies have proved that 20 minutes stimulating this system improves your memory. Don't feel obliged to go on a run if you don't want to. Bust a move in your living room to your favorite dance track. Let this be your time to unwind and alleviate stress during your study break.[3]The main thing is to get your heart rate up. Once it is faster, continue doing an exercise for at least twenty minutes.4Sleep well. Getting a full nights rest (at least 7-8 hours) helps motivate you to study. If you are sleep deprived, studying will feel like a chore. You won't learn nearly as much information sleepy as you will after a good night's rest.AdvertisementPart Two of Four:Studying Smart 1Stick to a schedule. After planning out when the best times are for you to work, follow through. Set aside a chunk of time every day for studying. Even if your exam or presentation is two weeks away, a little each day goes a long way.2Understand what you're learning. It's common for students to memorize what they know they'll be tested on, but it's not as efficient. Understanding what you study increases your chances of retaining it. You might not care to retain trigonometry past your final exam, but in the long run, you will.[4]Create links to what you are studying. Establishing connections to what you are studying to your everyday life is not always easy. This is a skill that you can improve over time. Spend extra time using your imagination to draw links from what you're studying to aspects of your life.[5]3Use flash cards. This is one of the best techniques you can use in studying that stretches across almost every subject. The act of writing out the information onto the card begins your brain's focus onto the subject. Once you've finished you can test yourself for an extended period of time, and then let others test you.If you read the definition side of the card and quiz yourself on the term, switch sides. Force yourself to give the definition or formula to the word or concept.4Rewrite your notes. Some people may find this excruciating because they already spent a fair amount of time creating the notes in class. Rewrite your notes by adding more information to them. Don't just sift through your notes mindlessly transcribing them. Use external sources like a textbook or an assigned essay.[6]This is a good way to study because it requires you to take an extra step past reading your notes and textbook. Reading, thinking, and writing are all ingredients to an efficient study session.5Take breaks. After spending a decent amount of time studying, between 45 minutes to an hour, take a quick break, 10-15 minutes. This is a tried and true learning method. After your break revisit what you were previously working on as a test. Revisiting subjects after distancing yourself will reinforce the materials into your brain.[7]Don't watch a television program or play a video game on your break. You might become too engaged and distracted to go back to work. Try walking the dog or go out for a quick run.6Test yourself. After studying for your allotted chunk of time, test yourself during the last 20 or 30 minutes. This is a good way of reviewing everything you just went over and will cause the concepts you've learned to sink deeper into your brain. Textbooks often have practice tests at the end of a chapter. Try your best to go through one of these even if it isn't assigned.[8]You don't need practice tests to test yourself. You can always use your hand to cover up definitions or parts of your notes. Then say the idea of what you've covered up out loud.If you're wrong, go through the correct answers.7Avoid cramming. Cramming, or studying extensively the night before, doesn't work. Most people need a few days to review their notes for the information to really sink in.[9] By cramming, the information you're memorizing will not be retained. Ignore those who claim to cram for everything. Sometimes people are freakishly good at testing and school. Don't compare yourself to them! Everyone is different and you'll need to do whatever fits your needs.",

            "answer_text": "Prepare a Proper Time Table Prepare a proper time table for your entire course. Divide your time for every activity. The time table should be devised in such a manner that your maximum time is devoted for studies instead of wasting it here and there. Allot proper time for your sleep, sleep early and wake up early next morning. Take out some time for activities which interest you most, such as playing games, watching TV or listening to music. This helps you to refresh yourself. Rationalise your time equally for each subject. Do not spend too much time on a particular subject and do not neglect another one. Do not Grasp too Many Things at a Time Your target should be to cover a particular topic of a subject in one day. Do not try to overlearn, as this will lead to confusion. Focus on concept building instead of the quantum of study. You can select one or two topics from 2-3 subjects everyday and finish them thoroughly. Too many topics at a time lead you nowhere during examination. Study Smartly Smartly here does not mean that you skip some topics. Here it refers to your efficiency. Do not waste your entire day in solving a single difficult problem. If you get stuck in some question, move ahead and solve the next one. Plan your study well. Increase your study hours gradually. First solve the easy questions and then move to difficult ones. Note-Making Make notes, highlight, and if you don\u2019t mind making notes in your book, then you can even summarise the page in the margins. This will help you recollect important points just before the exam. Practice Model Test Papers Practice makes a man perfect. Practicing model test papers in real time situations not only makes you familiar with the paper pattern, but also makes you confident. You get to know different ways in which questions can be asked and also raise doubts which you could not have come across while studying that chapter. So practice, practice and practice. Meditation and Exercise You should also devote some time for meditation and exercises to keep you fit. Meditation helps in improving your concentration and gives you mental peace. Sitting continuously for 12-14 hours daily during studying disturbs our digestive system, so we should do some simple exercises and take breaks at regular intervals. ",

            "answer_text": "You should always be consistent with your study and notes and listen to your teach ( even if she says something several times) because you will be surprised what you would remember in the exam from what your teacher states. Start studying at least 3 weeks before the exam so in the first week you should make sure all your notes are written (if not already) and gather all resources neededThe second week you should read through your notes, understand your notes and memories your notes of neededYour final week should consist of you doing practise papers and applying your knowledge to allow yourself to familiarise yourself with different questions (which significantly helps)You should remember to study smart and strategicly rather than studying hard as it may not be effective. You must always believe in your else and trust what you have done is enough because you can do it! What worked for me is changing study environments for example; instead of studying in my study room, I would study on my bed, or head to the library or to a park! Also, studying in groups really helps. This allows most people to get engaged into the topic and allow other students to learn off each other. During the exam; plan out how much time you are going to spend on each setion before the timer starts. This helps you stay on track during the exam to ensure you finish all section.If you find a question in the exam that you don\u2019t understand leave it till the end as you may waste your time on it, plus you want to ensure you can get marks from the questions you know.Always, I mean ALWAYS read the whole question and underline key aspects. It can be simple and small things\u2026 for example in biology they may ask you, -what technologies are used to mesure oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood and list advantages and disadvantages of each- If this was an 8 mark question, And you only wrote about one technology you will most likely only get 4 marks.One final note, don\u2019t study all the time and don\u2019t let it take over your mental health. Make sure you have a balance between your study and social life! ",

            "answer_text": "To do well on exam you have to be confident and you can take a look to get reach on your confidents: 1. Groom yourself. This seems like such an obvious one, but it\u2019s amazing how much of a difference a shower and a shave can make in your feelings of self-confidence and for your self-image. There have been days when I turned my mood around completely with this one little thing. 2. Dress nicely. A corollary of the first item above \u2026 if you dress nicely, you\u2019ll feel good about yourself. You\u2019ll feel successful and presentable and ready to tackle the world. Now, dressing nicely means something different for everyone \u2026 it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean wearing a $500 outfit, but could mean casual clothes that are nice looking and presentable. 3. Photoshop your self-image. Our self-image means so much to us, more than we often realize. We have a mental picture of ourselves, and it determines how confident we are in ourselves. But this picture isn\u2019t fixed and immutable. You can change it. Use your mental Photoshopping skills, and work on your self-image. If it\u2019s not a very good one, change it. Figure out why you see yourself that way, and find a way to fix it. 4. Think positive. One of the things I learned when I started running, about two years ago, what how to replace negative thoughts (see next item) with positive ones. How I can actually change my thoughts, and by doing so make great things happened. With this tiny little skill, I was able to train for and run a marathon within a year. It sounds so trite, so Norman Vincent Peale, but my goodness this works. Seriously. Try it if you haven\u2019t. 5. Kill negative thoughts. Goes hand-in-hand with the above item, but it\u2019s so important that I made it a separate item. You have to learn to be aware of your self-talk, the thoughts you have about yourself and what you\u2019re doing. When I was running, sometimes my mind would start to say, \u201cThis is too hard. I want to stop and go watch TV.\u201d Well, I soon learned to recognize this negative self-talk, and soon I learned a trick that changed everything in my life: I would imagine that a negative thought was a bug, and I would vigilantly be on the lookout for these bugs. When I caught one, I would stomp on it (mentally of course) and squash it. Kill it dead. Then replace it with a positive one. (\u201cC\u2019mon, I can do this! Only one mile left!\u201d) Know yourself and you will win all battles. \u2013 Sun Tzu 6. Get to know yourself. When going into battle, the wisest general learns to know his enemy very, very well. You can\u2019t defeat the enemy without knowing him. And when you\u2019re trying to overcome a negative self-image and replace it with self-confidence, your enemy is yourself. Get to know yourself well. Start listening to your thoughts. Start writing a journal about yourself, and about the thoughts you have about yourself, and analyzing why you have such negative thoughts. And then think about the good things about yourself, the things you can do well, the things you like. Start thinking about your limitations, and whether they\u2019re real limitations or just ones you\u2019ve allowed to be placed there, artificially. Dig deep within yourself, and you\u2019ll come out (eventually) with even greater self-confidence. 7. Act positive. More than just thinking positive, you have to put it into action. Action, actually, is the key to developing self-confidence. It\u2019s one thing to learn to think positive, but when you start acting on it, you change yourself, one action at a time. You are what you do, and so if you change what you do, you change what you are. Act in a positive way, take action instead of telling yourself you can\u2019t, be positive. Talk to people in a positive way, put energy into your actions. You\u2019ll soon start to notice a difference. 8. Be kind and generous. Oh, so corny. If this is too corny for you, move on. But for the rest of you, know that being kind to others, and generous with yourself and your time and what you have, is a tremendous way to improve your self-image. You act in accordance with the Golden Rule, and you start to feel good about yourself, and to think that you are a good person. It does wonders for your self-confidence, believe me. One important key to success is self-confidence. A key to self-confidence is preparation. \u2013 Arthur Ashe 9. Get prepared. It\u2019s hard to be confident in yourself if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll do well at something. Beat that feeling by preparing yourself as much as possible. Think about taking an exam: if you haven\u2019t studied, you won\u2019t have much confidence in your abilities to do well on the exam. But if you studied your butt off, you\u2019re prepared, and you\u2019ll be much more confident. Now think of life as your exam, and prepare yourself. 10. Know your principles and live them. What are the principles upon which your life is built? If you don\u2019t know, you will have trouble, because your life will feel directionless. For myself, I try to live the Golden Rule (and fail often). This is my key principle, and I try to live my life in accordance with it. I have others, but they are mostly in some way related to this rule (the major exception being to \u201cLive my Passion\u201d). Think about your principles \u2026 you might have them but perhaps you haven\u2019t given them much thought. Now think about whether you actually live these principles, or if you just believe in them but don\u2019t act on them. 11. Speak slowly. Such a simple thing, but it can have a big difference in how others perceive you. A person in authority, with authority, speaks slowly. It shows confidence. A person who feels that he isn\u2019t worth listening to will speak quickly, because he doesn\u2019t want to keep others waiting on something not worthy of listening to. Even if you don\u2019t feel the confidence of someone who speaks slowly, try doing it a few times. It will make you feel more confident. Of course, don\u2019t take it to an extreme, but just don\u2019t sound rushed either. 12. Stand tall. I have horrible posture, so it will sound hypocritical for me to give this advice, but I know it works because I try it often. When I remind myself to stand tall and straight, I feel better about myself. I imagine that a rope is pulling the top of my head toward the sky, and the rest of my body straightens accordingly. As an aside, people who stand tall and confident are more attractive. That\u2019s a good thing any day, in my book. 13. Increase competence. How do you feel more competent? By becoming more competent. And how do you do that? By studying and practicing. Just do small bits at a time. If you want to be a more competent writer, for example, don\u2019t try to tackle the entire profession of writing all at once. Just begin to write more. Journal, blog, write short stories, do some freelance writing. The more you write, the better you\u2019ll be. Set aside 30 minutes a day to write (for example), and the practice will increase your competence. 14. Set a small goal and achieve it. People often make the mistake of shooting for the moon, and then when they fail, they get discouraged. Instead, shoot for something much more achievable. Set a goal you knowyou can achieve, and then achieve it. You\u2019ll feel good about that. Now set another small goal and achieve that. The more you achieve small goals, the better you\u2019ll be at it, and the better you\u2019ll feel. Soon you\u2019ll be setting bigger (but still achievable) goals and achieving those too. 15. Change a small habit. Not a big one, like quitting smoking. Just a small one, like writing things down. Or waking up 10 minutes earlier. Or drinking a glass of water when you wake up. Something small that you know you can do. Do it for a month. When you\u2019ve accomplished it, you\u2019ll feel like a million bucks. 16. Focus on solutions. If you are a complainer, or focus on problems, change your focus now. Focusing on solutions instead of problems is one of the best things you can do for your confidence and your career. \u201cI\u2019m fat and lazy!\u201d So how can you solve that? \u201cBut I can\u2019t motivate myself!\u201d So how can you solve that? \u201cBut I have no energy!\u201d So what\u2019s the solution? 17. Smile. Another trite one. But it works. I feel instantly better when I smile, and it helps me to be kinder to others as well. A little tiny thing that can have a chain reaction. Not a bad investment of your time and energy. 18. Volunteer. Related to the \u201cbe kind and generous\u201d item above, but more specific. It\u2019s the holiday season right now \u2026 can you find the time to volunteer for a good cause, to spread some holiday cheer, to make the lives of others better? It\u2019ll be some of the best time you\u2019ve ever spent, and an amazing side benefit is that you\u2019ll feel better about yourself, instantly. 19. Be grateful. I\u2019m a firm believer in gratitude, as anyone who\u2019s been reading this blog for very long knows well. But I put it here because while being grateful for what you have in life, for what others have given you, is a very humbling activity \u2026 it can also be a very positive and rewarding activity that will improve your self-image. Read more. 20. Exercise. Gosh, I seem to put this one on almost every list. But if I left it off this list I would be doing you a disservice. Exercise has been one of my most empowering activities in the last couple years, and it has made me feel so much better about myself.All you have to do is take a walk a few times a week, and you\u2019ll see benefits. Start the habit. 21. Empower yourself with knowledge. Empowering yourself, in general, is one of the best strategies for building self-confidence. You can do that in many ways, but one of the surest ways to empower yourself is through knowledge. This is along the same vein as building competence and getting prepared \u2026 by becoming more knowledgeable, you\u2019ll be more confident \u2026 and you become more knowledgeable by doing research and studying. The Internet is a great tool, of course, but so are the people around you, people who have done what you want, books, magazines, and educational institutions. 22. Do something you\u2019ve been procrastinating on. What\u2019s on your to-do list that\u2019s been sitting there? Do it first thing in the morning, and get it out of the way. You\u2019ll feel great about yourself. 23. Get active. Doing something is almost always better than not doing anything. Of course, doing something could lead to mistakes \u2026 but mistakes are a part of life. It\u2019s how we learn. Without mistakes, we\u2019d never get better. So don\u2019t worry about those. Just do something. Get off your butt and get active \u2014 physically, or active by taking steps to accomplish something. 24. Work on small things. Trying to take on a huge project or task can be overwhelming and daunting and intimidating for anyone, even the best of us. Instead, learn to break off small chunks and work in bursts. Small little achievements make you feel good, and they add up to big achievements. Learn to work like this all the time, and soon you\u2019ll be a self-confident maniac. 25. Clear your desk. This might seem like a small, simple thing (then again, for some of you it might not be so small). But it has always worked wonders for me. If my desk starts to get messy, and the world around me is in chaos, clearing off my desk is my way of getting a little piece of my life under control. It is the calm in the center of the storm around me. ",

But remember concentrate is very important while studying. It can be hard, especially when the study material isn\u2019t one of your favorite topics. With a sense of determination, and by implementing some effective study techniques, even the dullest subjects can be conquered with increased concentration during a study session. Here are a few tips to score high marks in exams: Make a study PlannerMake your study planner and include every subjects don\u2019t leave anyone. For a day give some hours to particular subjects, subjects which you finds are hard schedule on top in the early morning. Then scoring and one interesting subject keep side for day time while you get bored of study pick your interesting subject and your time will not waste just looking at book. Don\u2019t forget to take a break in between. Revision is important thing, learn today and revise tomorrow. This key will make you succeed and help you to score good in board exam. Manage your time effectively\u201cIf you didn\u2019t care for time, time will never give you a chance to care for the thing you needed\u201d That\u2019s simple time is one of the most dangerous thing, you should take care of. Try studying 7 or 8 hours daily. Make a chart for your daily routine and give maximum time to your study. It will help you reduce anxiety and focus on studying. Keep up with SyllabusUnderstanding your portions and the weightage attached to different sections. This will help you in deciding how much time to dedicate to each section. For example, if you know that there will be just a 5 marks question from a particular section, you do not have to dedicate a week practicing those sums. Study till you understand a topic completely. As soon as you understand something, write it down in your own language to make your own notes (Maintain separate notebooks for each subject).This will help before the exams as you can just grab the subject notebook and revise the portions you want.NCERT textbooks:NCERT should always be on the top priority. At the board level, the examiner usually asks the questions from your prescribed textbooks only. Hence, assure yourself that you have to cover each and every aspect of your NCERT books. Start with easier chapters and gradually proceed to topics that you find more difficult. With basics brushed up, you will find that even the most difficult topics will melt down to simpler easier concepts.Previous years Question papers:The only way to success is Practice, Practice and Practice. Understanding and Reading the concepts is not enough to get you a high score in Exams. You should try to solve previous 10 years examination papers. Solving such papers can prepare you for the Final exam. Solve maximum sample papers before the exam:Sample papers provide us with an idea of the type of questions and the pattern of the exam which you are actually going to write in the next few days. It helps you practice and learn time management skills. 10% \u2013 20% are comes from sample paper each year so that you have to solve sample paper.

            "answer_text": "The strategies below can help you keep pace throughout the year. Set your goal: Read the course overview to understand what the course will cover and how it will be scored. Identify your goal in concrete terms and put it in writing to strengthen your resolve.Manage your time: Time management skills can help you take control of your study workload, achieve more, and stress out less.Identify your learning style: Take a assessment test and find out if you are a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner.Develop effective note-taking techniques: A variety of note-taking styles can help you record key information and see the bigger picture in terms of subject matter.Attend classes regularly: Be an active learner. Attend lectures regularly and participate whenever possible. The interaction will help you to remember more than if you sit passively in class, dreaming of other things.Create mind maps: Mind maps are graphic organisers, developed by Tony Buzan, which can help you summarise vital information from lectures and textbooks.Surround yourself with learning: Create a 24-hour learning environment by putting up review charts and points where you can see them daily \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on mirrors, doors, fridge, bathroom, television, or bedside table.Work with concentration: Its in your interest! One hour of concentrated study is worth several hours of distracted study.Apply memory techniques: Take the time to learn different memory techniques and practice applying them in a variety of academic and professional contexts.Use all your intelligence: Are you aware of the concept of multiple intelligences? Do you know it doesn't matter how smart you are but rather how you are smart? This concept was introduced by Howard Gardiner of Harvard University.Hope this helps!!! ",

I am generalising this topic for a reason which is Board Exams don\u2019t matter at all! You can read it again if you don\u2019t believe. See here\u2019s what I feel, these are not complains, I am just pouring my thoughts on this matter. In India alone, every 90 minutes there is one suicide case due to exams\u2019 stress. This is something that is really sad for Humanity in general. The purpose of education is to live a happy life, a life of purpose and also uplifting the people around you which is clearly not seen in our case. Marks, not Application of Knowledge is what we are asked to focus on as students. Exceptions are surely there, but a few. Also, you must have heard a lot from your teachers that your 12th % or mark sheet is crucial for college admission and job purposes but from a few of my seniors I got to know that the 12th marksheet is just for formality purposes and used as a proof that you have completed class 12. In bigger universities in and outside of India you have to reach a cut off rate so that is an exception. To conclude, all I am trying to say is that dont give marks all the importance because gaining the knowledge and learning how to apply it in life is much more important not just according to me but also according to the Big Game Changers. Don\u2019t fall into the misconception that if you perform well, your life is set and if you perform below expectations, your life is ruined. Your fortune is in your hands alone! Happy Reading!

He/she might be able to help you with a tough question you are stuck on.With math, you should try to use a calculator after you've finished all of your problems to check if you're understanding most of your work.If it's math you are working on, try checking your answers in the back of the textbook. Do the work, then check your answers. If you see that you have an answer wrong, then go back and rework the problem until you get the right answer.Talk to your teacher, they are there to help.It might be a good idea to record your notes and play them to yourself, then try writing everything you remembered. This will help you see how much more you need to learn and you'll also feel much better seeing how much you remember.Always try to participate in class, that way if you get something wrong your teacher can correct you and you probably won't make that mistake again.Go to extra help. If your parents are too busy to help you and your having trouble, don't make it harder for yourself. Teachers have extra help beginning of school and after. Go to them.Understand concepts by reading, which will form a base, and practice questions thoroughly and memorize areas of common mistakes. Improve consistently on your accuracy to achieve higher grades.Start a study group with your classmates.",

            "answer_text": "Hey! Firstly, i would like you understand that passing an exam is not a rocket science as conceived by most of the students. Exams come and go, all you are required to do is to face them confidently and maturely. Remember the first Unit test you underwent, how keen you were to learn those 26 alphabets, how you had applied all your energy towards it, you learned it by your heart and then you passed with flying colors too. Ever thought why was it so easy to pass exams in your childhood days? It's because you had that zeal in yourself to learn, apply and deliver. Also your thoughts never wandered here and there while studying. Now coming to the question-How to pass an exam? The perfect answer to this very question is-Concentration! Yes all you need to do is concentrate on whatever you study. Make a proper time table and follow it religiously. Do not let your thoughts go out of the track. Eat healthy and try to engage yourself into an outdoor activity at least for half an hour. It will boost up your metabolism and energy level to a great extent which otherwise gets stagnant due to long sitting hours. A good sound sleep of 6 to 8 hours is very much required as a tired mind can never work wonders. Many students complains about irritation in eyes as they continue for study for longer hours. I would suggest you to keep washing your eyes with running water every now and then to avoid irritation or red eye. Do not engage in telephone conversations with your friends too much as it will distract you and make you depressed about the fact that your friend is ahead of you. Avoid using social networking sites like Facebook, Watsaap etc because they take you to a whole new world and makes you jealous of the good time people are having! So just follow the above mentioned routine and trust me you will definitely achieve your goal very soon. Still if all these things do not help, just look into the eyes of your parents once and think about the sacrifices they have made for you throughout their lives to see you becoming what they couldn't become. I suppose after that there wont be any more questions left in your mind and you will do anything to strive success and make your parent proud pf yourself. Thanks Ankita. ",

Well prepared after spending weeks learning the concepts, taking notes, and doing practice exams. And now it was show time \u2013 the next 120 minutes would make or break my semester. When I sat down my mind was focused on two things - recalling the concepts and writing fast. I made sure I knew how long I had to answer each question. Regularly checking the time to make sure I could finish it. I was immersed in the flow, and after what felt like only 30minutes, the exam was over. Six short essays, one sore hand, and a huge amount of relief - I had done it. This was one of my best exams and I put it down to following these 7 study strategies: Having an awesome study timetableForming a virtual study groupDoing lots of practice questionsAvoiding cramming at all costsHaving study breaks to manage stressLearning challenging stuff in the morningNever giving up.To help you prepare like a boss for your next exam, I wrote about each study strategy here: Start Studying Effectively.

            "answer_text": "Well, having written a book on this very topic (link below) I trust a few points I consistently came across in the research and writing for it could prove worthwhile here. I. Ensure you\u2019ve a plan in place While some people may make cheeky jokes about them, it is nonetheless a reality college students are often in the business of full time stress management. Accordingly, when exam time rolls around it often feels (and oftentimes is the case) that you just finished all major assessments and essays; and then suddenly exams are here! Que the mad rush. Instead of going this way though, it is wise to put a plan in place, stick to in regularly, and ensure you have a positive attitude \u2018OK I\u2019ve not got a ton of time and I\u2019m a bit nervous but I\u2019ll make this count\u2019. Sticking to a plan will ensure you\u2019re working towards good results. II. Know examiners understand your under exam conditions While when it comes to submitting essays and content in the semester it is expected a student dots their i\u2019s and crosses their t\u2019s when it comes to exams some leeway typically applies. So, while content written in the exam does need be clear and still make sense, it is also understood students will usually make more grammar and spelling mistakes, and also be writing answers that in some areas are less brilliant and landmark examples of academic inquiry; but instead just a good and serviceable set of answers put forward by a student a little rushed for time:) III. Recognize nobody does the \u2018perfect exam\u2019 On this, one of the common mistakes many students make is thinking exams require a perfect demonstration of all knowledge on offer in the course. This is just not so. While you do need to work hard and show critical thinking in the application of what you\u2019ve learned, exams are not \u2018trapdoors\u2019 but instead opportunities to show what you know. So, rather than focusing on what you don\u2019t yet know and freaking out if you don\u2019t remember a certain fact or detail in the exam, focus instead on putting forward clear, informative, and accurate content that illustrates you\u2019ve a solid grasp on the material.

            "answer_text": "Here are some tips to concentrate in studies, to top in class : 1. Write down all of the assignments you need to do in an assignment notebook. Some schools may have them passed out to you or able to buy there. 2. Work ahead. One of the most important things to do. If you work ahead, you won't get behind. Simple logic. In other words, do not procrastinate. A lot of people do this. But don't work so far ahead that you do not know what is going on. 3. Get sleep. You need to be well rested to be able to concentrate at school. Stay on a schedule if you can. 4. Get it done. Find ways to keep yourself motivated, like completing some amount of work by a certain amount of songs. 5. Don't procrastinate. Do your assignments right away. 6. Try doing most of your homework at school if you have a busy schedule- before school, lunch, free time during class, etc. 7. Understand it. You really want to understand what your homework is so that you know what to do when you get home or your dorm. If you don't, ask. There is no harm in asking a teacher or someone else for help. Don't have them do the work though, you won't know what to do when you actually have a test. It will not help you get a good grade on that test and 8. Do your best. The absolute most important thing, and last, is to do your best at what you are doing and how you are doing it. 9. Go to review sessions that teachers offer. The review questions that they ask will sometimes be just like ones on the test. 10. Check your grades online if you can. This way you don't have to pester teachers to tell you your grade. Sometimes you can find out a grade before the assignment or test is handed back. If a grade on an individual assignment is messed up you will be able to fix it quickly. 11. Help the Teachers after school.1 2. Help students and make friends with smart people so you can learn from them. 13. The most important step is STUDYTips* Always plan ahead. If you are going to be busy and you know ahead of time, do as much homework in advance as possible.* Go in for extra help with teachers. Most don't like to give out bad grades.* Learn some fantastic memory tricks (mnemonic devices) to make studying for tests easier. Some really cool memory methods include the Link Memory System, Method of Foci, and acrostics.* Go to somewhere quiet put down the phones iPods or whatever you have so you canstay focused.* Always listen to the teacher. So then when you have to do your homework, you're not confused or if you have a test and you don't know the answers because you weren't listening, that will be a problem.* Stay after school to talk to your teacher, if you don't get something. Go to a quiet place to study.* Try to pay attention, to the teacher during the lesson. Don't get sidetracked with talking to friends, writing notes, text, drawing, etc.* Try to stay near the teacher so you can hear or see the board.* Make sure your work is neat and legible, especially on a project (projects count for a lot of your grade!), as this definitely will get you a few extra points. Warnings* Watch out for people who say you are not smart.* Avoid distractions.* Don't mess around when the teacher is talking.* If someone is talking to you while the teacher is talking, politely ask them to stop, or quietly and quickly answer their question without causing a distraction or simply ignore them.* Do what the teachers say or get detention. Hope my answer helped, and if the points above are followed dilligently, you can easily top your class..good luck :) https://www.educationinsta.io ",

            "answer_text": "Every student wishes to score good marks in the exam. Some students score top marks easily while others barely manage to score the passing marks.If you wish to score better marks in your exam you have to study smartly. It is seen that people who study very hard are not able to score the marks they expect. By following the six methods given below you can improve your scores: 1)ATTEND EVERY CLASS This is the most important advise for all those who can\u2019t score good marks by studying one night before the exam. When I ask you to attend all the lectures I don\u2019t expect you to listen carefully to every word your teacher says. By attending every class you\u2019ll get some idea of the topics which will stop you from being clueless in your exams. 2)DON\u2019T FORGET TO STUDY THOSE TOPICS WHICH THE TEACHERS MAKE YOU MARK AS IMPORTANT If you attend the classes you\u2019ll notice that the teacher consider certain topics to be important. Never make the mistake of not studying these important topics. Mostly your teachers prepare the question papers and they tend to put questions from these important topics. 3)NEVER LEAVE ANY TOPIC UNPREPARED It has now been widely observed that the topic a student considers to be the least important one comes in the exam as the question carrying the maximum marks. In order to avoid being clueless and scoring some marks for that question never make the mistake of not studying a topic. 4)REVISE AT LEAST TWICE Revising all that you learnt twice will help you in brushing all your concepts . You\u2019ll easily recollect answers to all the questions asked in your exam. If you fall short of time make sure that you complete one round of revision of all the topics. 5)STUDY EVERY DAY (MINIMUM HALF AN HOUR) Before going to bed spend half an hour in revising what was taught in class. You don\u2019t have to read everything in detail but all you need to do is skim through all the topics once to get an idea of whatever was taught in class. Revise everything at least once in a month. 6) SOLVE SAMPLE PAPERS AND LAST YEAR PAPERS: By following the advise you\u2019ll understand your strong and weak topics. Work on them accordingly. While solving the sample paper attempt it exactly the way you would attempt your main exam question paper. Be confident of your preparations and take the exam without any stress or tension. Trust yourself You can easily score better. ALL THE BEST!! Source:HOW TO SCORE BETTER IN EXAMS!! ",

            "answer_text": "Method One :Absorbing Knowledge Efficiently: Pay attention in your classes and concentrate The best thing you can do to raise your test scores is to pay attention when you're supposed to be learning the material: in class! Letting your mind wander or not showing up at all are both likely to make you miss out on key information that will later appear on tests.Take good notes. This is important if you want to have an easier time studying later. Not only will writing the information down as you learn it help you in absorbing the information and paying attention, but you'll have a reference for when you go to study later.Do your homework. Homework, such as assignments and at-home reading are where you will find the rest of the information that will be on tests, so doing this homework is important. Schedule time and set aside a quiet place just for homework to help beat the procrastination blues.Use mnemonics and other tricks.Various memory tricks really can be useful for remembering certain things like numbers, categories, and lists. Just make sure that you learn them correctly and don't mix them up!Mnemonics are phrases which can help you remember the order of certain things. For example, \"Katy Perry Came Over For Great Songs\" is a great way to remember the biological classifications (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).Another memory trick is if you have to remember a string of numbers. Instead of trying to remember 2537610925, for example, break it up like a phone number: 253-761-0925. You can break up dates this way too. 14 Oct 1066 (the Battle of Hastings) can become a locker combination: 14-10-66.Do practice tests. Ask your teacher or go online and print a few practice tests. Taking a practice test will help you figure out how much information you actually know vs how much information you think you know. Knowing your weak spots before a testMethod Two of Four:Studying Like a Pro Study frequently. Studying hard for only a few hours the night before the test isn't going to help ensure perfect scores. If you really want to ace those exams, study old and new material every day, or at least several times a week. This will make test-taking a breeze.Take study breaks. When you study, make sure you take a 5-10 minute break after every 30 minutes of study. This will help keep your brain from getting overloaded and give it more time to absorb the information.On study breaks, try not to fill your brain with more information, even if that information is more about your favourite celebrity's latest concert rather than Winston Churchill's foreign policy. Study according to your learning style. You may know that different people have different learning styles. Some people are visual learners, some people prefer sound, some need physical motion, and so on. Know how you learn best and work that into how you study.For example, if you learn better by physically doing things, try walking around while you study. If you learn better with sounds associated with the information, listen to music while you study. If you're a visual learner, make a chart of the information you have to know.Take advantage of sense memory.Your brain is pretty good at associating smells or sounds with ideas or memories. You should take advantage of this! While you're studying, wear some unusual cologne or perfume (with a smell you don't usually encounter) and then expose yourself to that smell again right before or during a test.Listen to music . Your teacher probably won't let you have headphones during a test, but you should at least listen to music, specifically classical music, right before taking a test.[1]Studies have proven that exposure to certain types of music right before rigorous mental activity can really help, by waking up your brain and increasing your awareness*You should study when you feel comfortable and can concentrate properly. Studying at both times is a great way to help cement knowledge -- studying in the night and reviewing the next morning to ensure you don't forget anything.Best of luck",

            "answer_text": "To get more marks in examination,the procedure involved is very simple: 1) Always remember that your effort should be only to improve your level of \"knowledge\" and never run behind the marks (because the marks automatically runs behind the knowledge). 2) The next step would be to classify the subjects into:  i) analytical and tough,  ii) analytical and easy,  iii) descriptive and tough, and  iv)descriptive and easy. 3) Try to prepare analytical subject followed by descriptive subject. You can think of making notes, marking/highlighting the important portion of reading material. 4) Never mix-up analytical subject and descriptive subject (you can not learn unless your mind is concentrated). But you can mix-up (or bring in between) easy subject, when you are tired with a tough subject. 5) Every one hour, you keep changing the subject as per the second and third points (when you are reading something dull, difficult or boring, keeping your attention focused for one hour will be a challenge). 6) Before you start the next subject, relax for just five minutes (Which is going to enhance your understanding capacity). 7) Try to be confidant of the basic concepts. 8) Have five years' question papers, and have a mock test (at the weekend). 9) Then compare your answers with the right one (and keep observing the improvements or shortfalls). 10) You should never get distracted your mind despite so many diversions. 11) Your must keep some interesting things to change your mood and calm-down your mind. You can use the break time to watch songs and news on TV (to break the monotony). 12) You can take the help of light melodious background music (if need be). 13) Do not waste time in unnecessary chatting, criticizing someone. Be meticulous in all the above steps and success will be surely yours. ",

            "answer_text": "Exams! Scared? No wonder it does bring a sense of fear in us because for many of us, examinations are mere punishment. Although we fail to realize that it is only due to exams, we get to step the final stage of our ambitions and also get an opportunity to live our dreams. Hmm that being said you might be now wondering how to cope up with the exam pressure and even score maximum marks. Well it is no rocket science and anyone can get good marks if he or she follow these simple and easy tips. Let\u2019s together look into the top 10 tips to get higher marks in exam. 1. Concentration: Make sure that you are fully attentive while writing the exam, both physically as well as mentally. Avoid any sort of distraction. Don\u2019t look here and there and focus mainly on your paper. Also carry every necessary item with yourself so that you don\u2019t have to ask as it may disturb others as well as your focus on the topic. 2. Handwriting: The majority of the students take the value of handwriting very lightly. They do not understand that it is handwriting which brings in some extra marks. Yes, if your handwriting is neat, viable and easy to read then the examiner unconsciously or consciously checks generously and you get a few extra marks by the virtue of your good handwriting. Intelligibility counts and it is always appreciated and favored. Clear handwriting is indeed a way to get that high scores in exams .3. Quality Content: If you want to score excellent marks in exam, you should not stuff your answers with any unwanted trash. Many pupils are under the impression that if they write more they will get more marks. However, the marks allotted is mainly for your quality writing and not just quantity. So master the art of content writing (have the knowledge beforehand) and easily score effectively. 4. Avoid Grammatical Mistakes: Grammar plays a very significant role in getting higher marks in exam. So as much as possible avoid all the obvious grammar as well as spelling mistakes. One way of achieving this is by reproducing all your answers in very simple and plain language instead of using complex terms. 5. Accentuate Your Answer: Where ever possible emphasize your answer by drawing a diagram. You can draw flow charts and illustrate your knowledge. Also make the diagram effective and not shabby. Next, highlight the main points and words in your answer by underling the important phrase. Present your answer as neat as possible without any cuts and strokes. 6. Use \u201cParagraphing\u201d: In case of long answers where you need to write in paragraphs adapt the method of paragraphing. After every three or four points, a new paragraph should commence. In addition, where there is an association of points, the following paragraph should begin with a transitional word like, \u2018Consequently\u2019, \u2018Therefore\u2019, \u2018Nevertheless\u2019 etc. To get a good command over the language, one should read as many books as possible. 7. Sequencing: The style of the writing is very vital. A notable point wise answer will absolutely earn you more marks than a long piece of writing. Highlight your answer point wise starting from the most important to the least important. Pay a lot of attention to your writing style. It may definitely fetch you some bonus points. Practice beforehand in this arena so that you write appropriately to get higher marks in exam. 8. Balancing Your Writing: Illustrating too much for questions that do not need lengthy answers results in an apparent scarcity of time for other remaining questions. Similarly, if you write too little for questions that requires elongated answers, you will end up missing main points or details of an idea. Invariably, the result will be loss of marks. But at the same time, if you balance it out well you\u2019ll apparently get higher marks in exam 9. Check and Re-check your Answer Paper: Many of the pupils fall short of time to check their answer paper after finishing it. To avoid this, try to complete your exam paper at least 20 minutes before time so that you have enough time to check all your written answers. Moreover, you also can see if each and every question has been numbered correctly or not and if by any chance there are any questions left unanswered. 10. Allocate Appropriate Time: Before you begin, allocate time for every question. Few of the questions will need more time than others. Allot the time accordingly i.e. always allot your time to each question based on the marks fixed to it. For instance, if one question is of 15 mark and another question is of 20 mark, then you should definitely dedicate more time to the latter question. Best of luck!!! ",

Letting your mind wander or not showing up at all are both likely to make you miss out on key information that will later appear on tests. Take good notes. This is important if you want to have an easier time studying later. Not only will writing the information down as you learn it help you in absorbing the information and paying attention, but you'll have a reference for when you go to study later. Do your homework. Homework, such as assignments and at-home reading are where you will find the rest of the information that will be on tests, so doing this homework is important. Schedule time and set aside a quiet place just for homework to help beat the procrastination blues. Mnemonics are phrases which can help you remember the order of certain things. For example, \"Katy Perry Came Over For Great Songs\" is a great way to remember the biological classifications (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).Another memory trick is if you have to remember a string of numbers. Instead of trying to remember 2537610925, for example, break it up like a phone number: 253-761-0925. You can break up dates this way too. 14 Oct 1066 (the Battle of Hastings) can become a locker combination: 14-10-66. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you got an important test coming up that you really want to ace? Do you generally want to improve your grades? There are a number of tricks and practices which can significantly improve your chances of scoring high on a test. This article will help you in studying, analyzing and solving exam questions, so read on! Method One of Four:Absorbing Knowledge Efficiently 1Pay attention in your classes and concentrate The best thing you can do to raise your test scores is to pay attention when you're supposed to be learning the material: in class! Letting your mind wander or not showing up at all are both likely to make you miss out on key information that will later appear on tests.Take good notes. This is important if you want to have an easier time studying later. Not only will writing the information down as you learn it help you in absorbing the information and paying attention, but you'll have a reference for when you go to study later.3Do your homework. Homework, such as assignments and at-home reading are where you will find the rest of the information that will be on tests, so doing this homework is important. Schedule time and set aside a quiet place just for homework to help beat the procrastination blues.4Use mnemonics and other tricks. Various memory tricks really can be useful for remembering certain things like numbers, categories, and lists. Just make sure that you learn them correctly and don't mix them up!Mnemonics are phrases which can help you remember the order of certain things. For example, \"Katy Perry Came Over For Great Songs\" is a great way to remember the biological classifications (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).Another memory trick is if you have to remember a string of numbers. Instead of trying to remember 2537610925, for example, break it up like a phone number: 253-761-0925. You can break up dates this way too. 14 Oct 1066 (the Battle of Hastings) can become a locker combination: 14-10-66.5Do practice tests. Ask your teacher or go online and print a few practice tests. Taking a practice test will help you figure out how much information you actually know vs how much information you think you know. Knowing your weak spots before a test is crucial!Method Two of Four:Studying Like a Pro1Study frequently. Studying hard for only a few hours the night before the test isn't going to help ensure perfect scores. If you really want to ace those exams, study old and new material every day, or at least several times a week. This will make test-taking a breeze.Take study breaks. When you study, make sure you take a 5-10 minute break after every 30 minutes of study. This will help keep your brain from getting overloaded and give it more time to absorb the information.On study breaks, try not to fill your brain with more information, even if that information is more about your favourite celebrity's latest concert rather than Winston Churchill's foreign policy.2Study according to your learning style. You may know that different people have different learning styles. Some people are visual learners, some people prefer sound, some need physical motion, and so on. Know how you learn best and work that into how you study.For example, if you learn better by physically doing things, try walking around while you study. If you learn better with sounds associated with the information, listen to music while you study. If you're a visual learner, make a chart of the information you have to know.3Take advantage of sense memory. Your brain is pretty good at associating smells or sounds with ideas or memories. You should take advantage of this! While you're studying, wear some unusual cologne or perfume (with a smell you don't usually encounter) and then expose yourself to that smell again right before or during a test.4Listen to music . Your teacher probably won't let you have headphones during a test, but you should at least listen to music, specifically classical music, right before taking a test.[1]Studies have proven that exposure to certain types of music right before rigorous mental activity can really help, by waking up your brain and increasing your awareness.Method Three of Four:Preparing Your Body1Eat right. The most important thing is to eat, full stop. Being hungry during a test will distract you and make you tired. Don't eat too soon before a test though, as some foods can make you tired. Instead, make sure you get a meal filled with lean protein before you have to take a test.Eating healthy will generally boost brain performance too, so make sure you're always eating a healthy diet to help you learn all through school.2Sleep well. If you don't sleep you won't be able to focus when the pressure's on! Make sure to go to bed early the night before a test, rather than staying up all night to study. Your brain won't be able to hold on to all that crammed information anyway.3Have all the necessary supplies. Go to your test with all of the calculators, pens, pencils, blank paper, and other supplies you might need. Not having these things could mean you'll have a much harder time!4Drink lots of water. Getting dehydrated during a test can be distracting and reduce your ability to think clearly. Stay hydrated before your test and bring a bottle of water with you to the test as well.5Don't do anything different. If you aren't used to drinking coffee, now is a bad time to start. Try not to do anything different in your basic routine the day of or the night before the test. This can really throw you off.plenty of sleep, otherwise you could become tired and unfocused easily. Have no distracting things around you.Get rid of any unnecessary 'time wasting mechanisms' while studying. This includes TV, computer (only if you need Internet access), mobile phones, tablet, or even your siblings!Studying while containing fear inside yourself is a waste. Get rid of fear and any other possible bad feelings before studying.A good timetable will help you. You may organize it in such a way that a long/hard subject takes more space than a short/easy subject. Remember, however, that all subjects should be studied.Make notes while studying. Write a synopsis for your subject if you are studying it for the first time/ in the beginning of the school year. This will help you in the future examinations by allowing you to remember the contents of your subjects.Make a list of all the things you need to do to study for each subject, and how long you think it will take you. Use this information to make up a study timetable. Be certain that you have given yourself all the time you think you need, plus a little extra per subject, in your study plan. Also make sure your study plan has enough space in it, so if something comes up one day, you can shuffle around your plan so that you don't lose study time.Studying while having something in mind that you want to do is a waste of time. Do everything you want first then study; as your brain will not beg you to stop studying. However, if you have nothing in mind, then don't play (for example) before studying - finish your job towards school and then enjoy in the rest of the day.Attempt the questions which you find easy first and then the ones that seem harder.Study in phases. Each phase should not exceed 40 minutes in time. Take a break after each phase (up to 20 minutes).Write clearly and be direct to the point. Don't write any irrelevant information. Don't wrap the right answer in a wrong answer. Write in full sentences. Don't expect the examiner to link your sentences, fill in the space or any other thing. Think that the examiner is your little brother, and you are explaining to him.Each subject has a unique way of preparing, studying and answering its questions. Some competitive exams (university exams, for example) need a long and complex preparation, while your school exams may need preparation of one or two weeks.When you are preparing for a test or exam- forget about the actual test or an exam and just know that what you are doing exactly.Never try to study at the last moment, because it doesn't work and you will forget everything that you learned in the past 2 hours.Make sure you are studying in a place with bright light. It will make you feel fresh.Never try to cheat in exam or any type of test.Have a good night's sleep and wake up early in the morning to go over the topic. This helps refresh your mind, helping you consume information easier rather than going it over at night when your mind is tired.Don't use cellphones and social media while studying, even when you are on a break.Warnings Do not be overconfident. If you are, then your grades will slip.For example, you get 95/100 in you maths exam, and if you think you don't need to study, your second exam you will get 80/100.Never try to cheat. You are very likely to get caught, which would result in a zero. Be confident. Believe in yourself. If you have the attitude to do well, then you will",

            "answer_text": "1. Give yourself enough time to study Don't leave it until the last minute. While some students do seem to thrive on last-minute 'cramming', it's widely accepted that for most of us, this is not the best way to approach an exam. Set out a timetable for your study. Write down how many exams you have and the days on which you have to sit them. Then organize your study accordingly. You may want to give some exams more study time than others, so find a balance that you feel comfortable with. 2. Organize your study space Make sure you have enough space to spread your textbooks and notes out. Have you got enough light? Is your chair comfortable? Are your computer games out of sight? Try and get rid of all distractions, and make sure you feel as comfortable and able to focus as possible. For some people, this may mean almost complete silence; for others, background music helps. Some of us need everything completely tidy and organized in order to concentrate, while others thrive in a more cluttered environment. Think about what works for you, and take the time to get it right. 3. Use flow charts and diagrams Visual aids can be really helpful when revising. At the start of a topic, challenge yourself to write down everything you already know about a topic - and then highlight where the gaps lie. Closer to the exam, condense your revision notes into one-page diagrams. Getting your ideas down in this brief format can then help you to quickly recall everything you need to know during the exam. 4. Practice on old exams One of the most effective ways to prepare for exams is to practice taking past versions. This helps you get used to the format of the questions, and - if you time yourself - can also be good practice for making sure you spend the right amount of time on each section 5. Explain your answers to others Explain an answer to a question to your friends. That will help you to get it clear in your head, and also to highlight any areas where you need more work. 6. Organize study groups with friends Get together with friends for a study session. You may have questions that they have the answers to and vice versa. As long as you make sure you stay focused on the topic for an agreed amount of time, this can be one of the most effective ways to challenge yourself. 7. Take regular breaks While you may think it's best to study for as many hours as possible, this can actually be counterproductive. If you were training for a marathon, you wouldn't try and run 24 hours a day! Likewise studies have shown that for long-term retention of knowledge, taking regular breaks really helps. Everyone's different, so develop a study routine that works for you. If you study better in the morning, start early before taking a break at lunchtime. Or if you're more productive at nighttime, take a larger break earlier on so you're ready to settle down come evening. Try not to feel guilty about being out enjoying the sunshine instead of hunched over your textbooks. Remember Vitamin D is important for a healthy brain! 8. Snack on 'brain food' Keep away from junk food! You may feel like you deserve a treat, or that you don't have time to cook, but what you eat can really have an impact on energy levels and focus. Keep your body and brain well-fuelled by choosing nutritious food that have been proven to aid concentration and memory, such as fish, nuts, seeds, yogurt and blueberries. The same applies on exam day - eat a good meal before the test, based on foods that will provide a slow release of energy throughout. Sugar may seem appealing, but it won't help when your energy levels crash an hour or so later. 9. Plan your exam day Make sure you get everything ready well in advance of the exam - don't leave it to the day before to suddenly realize you don't know the way, or what you're supposed to bring. Check all the rules and requirements, and plan your route and journey time. If possible, do a test run of the trip; if not, write down clear directions. Work out how long it will take to get there - then add on some extra time. You really don't want to arrive having had to run halfway or feeling frazzled from losing your way. You could also make plans to travel to the exam with friends or classmates, as long as you know they're likely to be punctual! 10. Drink plenty of water As a final tip, remember that being well hydrated is essential for your brain to work at its best. Make sure you keep drinking plenty of water throughout your revision, and also on the exam day. ALL THE BEST!!! ",

            "answer_text": " There are many ways to score good marks. I'll tell you mine , what I did. I was one of the laziest student in my class during my 10th grade. Everybody used to criticize me for my laziness. But when board exam came I managed to take 91.4%! Unbelievable right! My parents and teachers were having the same feeling. I'll explain what I did. I studied 3 hours a day Each subject half an hour . ( except extra time for writing notes). I slept at 9:30PM and woke up at 6:30AM. While attending class I just understand the concept. And also wrote short notes. NEVER BY HEART ANY SUBJECTS! Keep that in mind. Usually during my exam days , there was one subject per day. Spent max hours for that subject and revise what you learned. Wake up early in the morning on the exam day and revise quickly for 2 hours. ( during exam days I slept at 10:30PM and wake up at 6:00AM). Then just walk into exam hall with cool and confident mind . Write what you know about the question and attempt all questions. Maintain good handwriting for a good impression. There are also other things which you must do: Always have a balanced diet.Sleep 8 hours.And eat dark chocolate! ( its because chocolate helps to improve your memory but don't overdo the practice.)NOTE: You must ask doubts whenever you have to teacher and maintain a positive impression with them.

Instead of rote-learning(\"Rattebaazi\" in Hindi) you should try your level best to understand the things which you are trying to study. If You Are Studying Maths, Look After The Basic Formulas First. Don't Learn Maths by just reading the problems. Grab a book & start jotting down the problems again & again until you learn them properly. If you are studying Science, try memorising easy-to-learn small Theorems & Concepts first, like Newton's First Law Of Gravity, Modern Periodic Table, Fisher's Fundamental Theorem Of Natural Selection, etc. & understand the other answers by understanding them properly. If you are studying language subjects like English & Hindi, instead of trying to memorise the answers, try to go through the lessons & poetry and do remember the names of the authors properly, they are very essential.

            "answer_text": "Well getting full marks depends on the subject, there are few subjects like Maths, Physics where I feel you have the scope to obtain out of out but some theoretical subjects don't provide you much scope.Coming back to your question here are few suggestions which might be of help-  Be stress free and don't over strain yourself in order to achieve full marks.Sleep is very important factor for effective learning(Min 6 hrs I would suggest).If you don't bunk classes regularly then attend them to learn not just for the sake of attendance.Try to make notes while lecturer is teaching because sometimes lecturers tell few things outside your prescribed textbook and if that comes in exam then we don't have any clue and loose marks.Whatever notes you have prepared make sure you go through them. :)You can't achieve full marks just by studying overnight, so plan your studies properly.Revision is important factor which plays a great role in your exam, so along with completing your syllabus you should keep on revising. Self assessment is another important factor, it tells you where you stand and in which areas you need improvement, so buckle up yourself for mock test and give it in exam like environment.We often tend to ignore the result of our mock test, that is something very bad, you should give enough time to review your mistakes and make plans to overcome them in next mock. Repeated mistake is totally undesirable and will never let you achieve your goal-\"Full Marks\".Sometimes we tend to refer to lot many materials/books and end result is we are unable to complete the syllabus, I would say even if you need to refer different materials then make sure every topic of your syllabus is covered completely.Taking breaks can boost your performance as it will keep you relaxed and focused, so don't just sit for long hours reading.You are the best person to judge yourself where you are wasting time and try to reduce it as much as you can.Last but not the least, have believe and faith in yourself that you can do it.Happy learning and I hope you will achieve your goal. :)  Cheers..!!

            "answer_text": "Hi Friend,Nice Question! Please realize that you should 'Focus on the Process, not the Outcome'!!'Getting good results in the exam' is an outcome (something you don't fully control), whereas, 'studying' is a process. You cannot control the outcome, but you can definitely work on the process to make it as better as you can! So, start focusing on, and enjoying the very process of studying! Just focus on how you can have a creative approach with regards to studying :) Once you fall in love with studies, everything else will fall in its place! Believe me! You will have great results, without you even realizing that you made it! Below are a few mind hacks that will help you focus on studies and trick your mind to study effectively. Follow the steps mentioned below and do not find any reason not to follow them!  Do not ever think that you have to 'study'. Just think that you have to do a few things as a part of your daily routine. That's it. Take it as a game :)Start reading things in your syllabus for a particular subject. This will not help you to prepare yourself completely to be able to write answers perfectly. However, it will surely help you to get an idea about most things and concepts. When you read first, only 1% of what you read will stick in your brain. When you read it twice it will be 4%, and so on. Continue to repeat this for a few times (you decide the count - 5/10 whatever). Read stuff loudly or silently, or make a song of the content that you read- whatever way you want to but read it. Just run your eyes through entire content of the subject that you want to start with.Then, once you do that, practice drawing each diagram and writing each answer and repeat this process. Write answers (just copy them from your textbook to your notebook, that's fine!). Though you would not understand the subject matter completely, some 20% or 40% will stick in your brain. Then repeat it until you are confident to recall a few keywords that you can remember to elaborate in exams.These steps will help you reduce your anxiety, improve your confidence and inspire your mind to forget that you once hated studies. If you score good in your next exam, you surely will! :) If you like my answer, please follow my Quora blog: Yog.World ",

In the latter, you have to go to the lectures or at least rely on some sort of note taking service from your university to complement your notes. In the former, you have to hit the books very hard and focus on the problem sets in the book. You would need to then start a study plan. If the test is going to be in 5 days, then you needed to divide up the material into 3 parts, one for each night. The fourth night should be spend on over-viewing the materials. In other words you cannot procrastinate and wait until the last minutes. After that you need to make your room conducive to studying. Meaning no internet. No checking your phone. Take necessary breaks to keep your focus sharp. Finally after every test, analyze your mistakes. I know that is hard to do. But unless you are willing to confront your own failures, you will never improve. ",

            "answer_text": "Scoring good marks, if not an absolute goal, is important in many regards. Exam stresses students like nothing else, this plays the biggest hindrance in their goal to score high in a test. There are many ways through which students can improve their scores, however, an optimal result can be achieved with consistency and patience. It takes a daily practice from a student to actualize the target. According to Rajesh Bhatia, Treehouse Founder, \"Teachers play a crucial role in fostering quality learning habits in their students. Conscious learning is important than simply putting targeting to score more in exams. This helps students in the long run.\u201d Here are a few ways that can help you to achieve better marks while pursuing conscious learning. Absorbing knowledge efficiently: The crux to achieving this is to pay close heed to the lecture in the classroom. By allowing your mind to focus on what is in the moment, you can achieve learn more in lesser time.Take good notes: This is an important test, which comes particularly handy when one has to do revisions right before examinations. This saves a lot of time, preventing students to dig in textbooks when they have less time left for the exam.Do homework regularly: Assignments are a great way to revise what a student learns in the classroom. Pending assignments can pile up and add to a student's stress. One can beat the procrastination blues by setting an allotted time to completing homework. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always said there are only two rules for acing a test: Get a lot of questions answered;Get them right.The problem for most people is that they can\u2019t find the balance between these two rules. They slow down to make sure they get everything right, at the expense of answering enough questions to get a good score. Others rush to finish everything, throwing away accuracy to fill the answer sheet. Only repeated practice and analysis will find the optimum rate for you; and you have to remember that questions have varying difficulty, and some are supposed to take longer than others. If you don\u2019t factor that in, you can decrease your performance. For instance on the U.S. MultiState Bar Exam (MBE), there are 100 questions to be answered in 3 hours. I divided that into 25 questions every 45 minutes. But I quickly noticed that the first 25 questions comprised 11 pages of the test, and the last 25 questions took 17 pages, with the middle two at about 14 pages. So I adjusted my time targets to 40\u201345\u201345\u201350. Thank you for asking this question! By making it so general, you enabled me to think of a basic rule that I\u2019ve never thought of posting here. I\u2019m rushing right over to make it a blog post! ",

Last minute for your exam: 1 Ask your teacher for a checklist of what you need to know for that topic and make sure you need to know at least what those checklist says. But most of the time, knowing those things in the checklist can make you survive that exam. 2 Ask your teacher what are the main topics tested for the exam and study those topics first. If time permits, study other topics which are still tested, but not as important. 3 Prioritize your time. When having multiple exams the next day, spend more time on the subject you are weaker at. If you are really good at the subject, you can study only the things you are not really sure of and leave the rest of the time for the other subject.  4 Set targets, like complete a topic at a certain time. 5 Do not skip meals and eat proper meals.  6 When memorizing, if you lose concentration, try walking around in your house, jump a few times, walk to the window and take in deep fresh air. You can even play music to help you concentrate like classical music, IF it works for you. If it don't then don't try it again. For Mathematics, I suggest you continue doing practices even for the day before the exam. But that's just suggestion. 7 Look through past years paper, questions tend to repeat again. 8 Look through your mistakes and understand why you went wrong and make your sure must not make that mistake again. 9 Take a break in between like a 5-10 minutes nap. Make sure you set alarm to wake up and study again. You can call a really good friend to continue motivating each other, which might make you awake, or even test each other on what you have memorized. Testing helps. A lot. That's because you say it out, you tend to remember what you said more easily. 10 Sleep adequately. 11 Eat breakfast. 12 Bring jacket if you are in an air conditioned hall. 13 Check if you brought the necessary stationeries like set square for the exam.  14 Eat some sweets before entering the exam hall. 15 Go to the toilet if you need to before entering the exam hall. 16 Wish your friends \"good luck\". They might wish you back, which makes you feel safer for the exam. During the exam: 1 Do not panic. If you do, you tend to forget all you studied. Take deep breaths, close your eyes, relax.  2 Drink tea or coffee 5-10 minutes before the exam.  3 When checking the number of pages of the paper, take note of the total questions tested. Manage your time by giving a specific time to spend on doing each question so all questions should be completed. 4 Skip if you do not know how to do the questions.  5 Blow air to your hand if you have sweaty palms which cause your pen to slip, disrupting you from writing. 6 When answering some essay questions, if you are afraid of missing out some points, write down the points before writing the whole answer. 7 Read the instructions and the questions carefully. Missing out one word can mean getting full marks for that question, or none. Make sure you relax and do all you should be doing for the exam. You can consider praying if you want. All the tips are things that helps you to survive the exam, do what works for you. Remember, you have studied for this exam and you are going to ace it, do not panic and get it all you have. Good luck and all the best for your exams! Do not try to cramp everything together again, you can search \"study tips\" in Quora to see what you can do for studying. I will be answering there, see you! ",

Letting your mind ramble or not showing up at all are both likely to make you miss out on key information that will later appear on tests.Take good notes: This is necessary if you want to have an easier time studying later. Not only will writing the information down as you learn your lesson it help you in interesting the information and paying notice, but you will have a reference for when you go to study later.Do your homework: Homework, such as tasks and at-home reading are where you will find the rest of the information that will be on tests, so doing this homework is necessary. planning time and set aside a quiet place just for homework to help beat the procrastination blues.Use mnemonics and other tricks: Different impression tricks really can be useful for recalling certain things like numbers, categories, and lists.

I don't think that the first topper n second one follows the same strategies, they follow it in their own way! But on a point of generalizing, which could work is always the HARD WORK, definitely it is something which you would find common! You need to study qualitatively instead of quantitative wise, never count the number of hours you study. Be focused n estimate the no of topics or chapters that you could cover in a day n then study accordingly. Don't postpone your target! Try practicing by solving the questions by writing it n not just orally,it helps you learn time management and to improve your speed The last one while appearing for an exam, always prefer writing the answers neatly, everyone could not have very good handwriting but a clean answer does helps you to score better. Underline the important points. And try using tabular or diagrammatic approach,it catches more attention of the paper checker! Good luck:)  ",

If your target is not decided then don't waste your time to doing that work because you never get success that's why I'm saying like that because if your target is not decided it means you don't have any idea about that where you want to go and why.  2. class work :- if you want to score good marks in exam then attend all the classes and listen to the teacher\u2019s carefully listen to the teacher carefully, and for better result you have to make good notes because notes are mirror image of teacher\u2019s , and always finish your homwork never put it on next day.  3. ask your doubts:- always remember if you have any kind of doubts on any topic then don't hesitate to ask to your teacher\u2019s because doubts clearance makes your perfect and teachers also want that you ask some doubt to them.  4. do revise:- revise every previous notes at least once in a week because revision is one of the most key of success and if you revise regularly then then i'm sure that there is no need to do study in exam time.  5. don\u2019t wait for exam days:- there is one bad habit that we have and that\u2019s we all always wait for exam days and always think like that we are smart we can get full marks by doing study in exam days but this trick may help you to get passing marks, if you really want to score good marks then avoid this trick , don\u2019t wait for exam days always prepare yourself and do practice because practice makes you perfect .  all the best ! may be this ans will help you. thanks. \u201cEdits are welcome \u201d ",

So be focused on studies.Stop worrying about what would happen in future. no-one knows their future, but if you work even harder, then only you can get good marks.Be active in the exam period(i.e. the time when you will give your exams), not only during exams, but also for other days as well.Eat healthy food, sleep well, follow a *regular* but simple schedule for yourself.That's it.

The key to taking exams successfully is to have the confidence to do it and preparing well for it gives us that.2. Having a good relationship with the teacher. A teacher can see it fit to always assist you if you show much interest in the subject he/she is teaching. Knowing that you are in good terms with your teacher is a psychological bonus which should assist you in approaching exams with a positive mentality.3. Avoid unnecessary communications/interactions a day before taking exams. Our mind is a fragile thing it can sway according to our emotional state. Anything either good or bad that triggers our emotions and lingers can get our focus away and may cost us a good result however well we prepared.4. Always set a goal to achieve. I usually approach my exams by aspiring to score within the 60th percentile or set a goal of being in the top 5 scorers. This strategy always works and saw me always scoring way above the marks I set to achieve.5. Be determined.That is all I can share in answer to this question. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "This is something I have learnt from being a teacher. Being able to do well in examinations, means that you have to teach yourself the material. Of course, if you have unlimited amount of time, you could take all the time you want to understanding everything in the syllabus. However, with our limited amount of time these days, it may not always be possible to understand every single concept in depth. i.e. to study one topic thoroughly, you have to do lots of research. For example, even the question - ' why is the sky blue?' can be as complicated as how light works, and even, how particles work, how could the sun shine through, etc... Every single question could be answered in-depth, and seems like there could be no end to it. That being said, coming from a country that heavily focuses on examinations, I came to realise that attaining high scores at examinations is not about understand all the materials in such great depth. It's about being tactical about what/why/when/where/who/how you learn it. These are some of the important steps: What to learn        - Check the syllabus of the examination: what do you have to know? how much depth?        - Ask your teacher: You'll be surprised, but a lot of teachers give hints in class or tell you the exam topics when you ask them! Then you can focus more time on those topics.        - Check mock examination papers: See if you could attain pastpapers. For public examinations, you could usually by them online or purchase them from the examination board. I would suggest getting at least 5 set of pastpapers, and try to think about which questions come out the most, think about the trend of the questions - have a guess what questions would come up and make sure you learn them well according to the syllabus. If you could get hold of the answers and marking schemes, it would even be better as you would know what you should answer and how answers are marked and how you could get top scores. Why learn       - Why are you learning the material? For example, why are you learning about light particles? What are the applications of this knowledge?    3.  When should you learn       - Review the material after the lesson, and do thorough research on the topics especially the ones you think are most likely to come up in the exam (see point 1). Try to learn everything required by the syllabus by the second week after that class. Ask questions. Makes notes so you can review them.        - To prepare for the exam, set a plan on when you should start studying. For example, think about how much time you need to study each topic thoroughly. If you think you need 10 hours to study a topic, and you could realistically study for 5 hours every week. Then you should start studying 2 weeks before the exam so to study for 10 hours in total. If you have 2 topics coming up in the exam, and you need to study 10 hours for 1 topic, and 5 hours for the 2nd topic, then you should start studying 3 weeks before the examination.         - A day or 2 before the examination, review the materials once or twice again.The more you review, the easier it would be for you to draw information from your long-term memory according to the Forgetting curve.          - Although some people even just study the night before and they manage to pass the examination as the material is in their short-term memory. However, they do not have thorough research and time for the material to assimilate, so they usually pass but do not get high score.        - Learn about when you study best. For example, I've learnt that I can concentrate the most when there is no one around me. When I was at high school, I used to sleep at 7pm at night, and wake up at 3 in the morning (3am!) to study for the examinations. I then nap at 8am for 45 mins. I ended up attaining distinctions in all my 4 subjects at high school. However, sometimes you may work better at night. Some of my friends prefer study from 10pm to 6am!     4.  Where should you learn          - Determine which is the place where you work best at. Personally, I like studying on myself in my own room, as the strange thing is that whenever I try studying at the library I get low scores. I also tried working in the our garden with a cup of tea - it worked well for me too. However, I know some high scoring people work at libraris or coffee shops, etc. It depends on you - where do you work best at?        5. Who to learn with            - Do you work better with a group of friends or work better alone?                 6. How to learn            - Write notes: These notes should be concise, but inclusive of everything in the syllabus. Also, while revising, keep referring to the past papers and check the questions related to that topic, try to answer them and look at the answers and marking scheme. What are the key words that you need? Add to the notes. What did the teacher talked a few times about? Add to the notes. What is important?             - 1-2 weeks before the examination, work on the most recent year past paper, time yourself, and see how you score in it. Also, this will help you understand what are your weakness and strengths in the examination, and improve on them. Hope this will help you get a high score!

Knowledge is the only source where you can find yourself in condition of getting good marks. But then also to gain knowledge and good marks i would love to write some points down as: 1. Respect the subject You need not to just learn the subject. There is a point in your preparation where you finally come to know that \u201cyes, now i don't have to worry of this subject i can focus on next one\u201d. That is the point where you actually prepared it or you have given respect to it. 2. Never try craming Craming is the worst habit that you can develop in your education. It just gives you some marks but drop you at many spots where you truely understands why it is not preferable. 3. Concentration Rest are you need concentration to study. Its better to concentrate 2 hours than wasting full day with books without concentration. 4. Strength You should find your strngth in some subjects which helps a lot in securing some precious extra marks. 5. Break Regular study is not so helpful(scientifically too). You should prefer to take brakes between your studies which can make you and your mind fresh for next session. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is to study hard until you know the concepts or topics that are being covered. This could be as simple as making flashcards to learn vocabulary or as complicated as reading several assigned books and formulating your own thoughts for long answer exams. In a perfect world, you would be able to break your your studying into digestible pieces so you don't have to cram, but that's not always possible. With other classes, family events, sports or extracurricular activities, studying ahead of time might be easier said than done. In addition, teachers are different from each other and have their own preferences and biases and ways they want things done. Paying attention to what your instructor is like and what he or she expects can make taking tests easier. If it's a class you just need to get through, write anything you have to in order to make them happy. If you can't live with yourself because you think your teacher is wrong about everything and you need to write an essay or exam answer challenging them, my best advice is to still just answer it to their specifications (but sometimes it's worth it to take a docked grade if you can write a well argued answer that contradicts the teacher. Who knows, maybe they will give you good marks because someone had the guts to challenge them. Weigh the risk). A good resource for ideas is College Info Geek | College Tips for Smart Students . It's run by a guy name named Thomas Frank and he has a pretty good YouTube channel too. When it really comes down to it, getting good marks requires knuckling down and doing the work. Don't blow it off or you might regret what you didn't learn later in life (like I do). Do the work, make the sacrifices now, and life is likely to be a little easier later. You can get good marks (unless your teacher hates you because you keep writing about how stupid you think all their beliefs are in the essay questions.) ",

Tape record your reading aloud and play it back to yourself as you do some exercises. Make flash cards of key facts and then test yourself with them. I actually made a study guide for an entire text book by writing down a study question for each paragraph in the book and then going over those questions. Take notes by hand of what you are studying. This will keep you more alert than just highlighting the book, and engaging the writing section of your brain increases your retention of the material. Sit at a comfortable chair at a work surface of a good height. Make sure your screen is at a good distance from your eyes. Have good lighting for reading. Do not study in bed or on the sofa. If you are studying on the computer, set a timer for 5 minutes and when it goes off, look away from the screen and focus into the distance for a few seconds. Every third time it goes off, get up and walk around the room one time. ",

            "answer_text": "How to get good grades is a common question asked by the students at any level of education. The reason is everyone wants to score good grades in their examinations. It just not provide mental happiness to the students but also play a crucial role in the success of the students. Get higher grades in school can be a lot easier than getting high grades in college. Getting good grades is also helpful in winning competitive scholarships. Today I am going to share with you the best and most effective tips on how to get good grades in exams. Just studying is not enough for getting good grades. You need to have a solid strategy and plan that will help you to regain your focus and help you to achieve good grades. Tips on how to get good grades: 1. Motivate yourself Self-motivation is the key to success for every student. It is pretty often that the students lose their confidence when they don\u2019t get good grades. But you should not make the same mistakes as other students do. You may not get satisfied with your grades sometimes, but at that moment, you should maintain your self-confidence to be in the game of getting good grades. You should believe in yourself to stay focused on your work. The best way to motivate yourself is to create some milestones for yourself. You can create a series of milestones. When you start working to achieve those milestones than in every achievement, you will boost your self-confidence. And this confidence will lead you to get good grades in your exams. 2. Listen and participate in the class A student who does participate in the class always gets more grades than the students who don\u2019t. But listen and participate in the class is not easy for any students, especially for the shy one. But it showcases the teacher that you care about the topic and you want to score high grades. The teacher gives the grades based on various factors. Apart from that if you participate in the class, then you may get more awareness about the topic. Along with that if you listen to your mentor or teacher carefully, then you can learn a lot more than the self-study. It will help you to prepare for the exams more effectively. Thus it helps you to get good grades in your exams. Besides, if you\u2019re a weak student, then you can sit closer to the teacher so that the teacher can know more about you and find your weakness. Apart from that, you can also write down some questions before the class and then ask them to the teacher to clear your doubts. 3. Take thorough notes during a class Notes are quite helpful in getting high grades. You should make notes during the class. Notes help you to cover the important information about the topic. You can create the notes by listening to your teacher. Apart from that, you can also create the notes of the important topic with the help of some reference book of your topic. It will help you to prepare for the exams more efficiently. Sometimes the students just need to have a look at the notes, and then they prepare for the exams within a few hours. Apart from that, these notes are also helpful just before the last few minutes of the exams. 4. Do not hesitate to ask for help Majority of students does this mistake. I don\u2019t why they always have hesitation while asking the help from the teacher. The students need to take help from the teacher. Even intelligent students also look for help from the teacher. Because the students can\u2019t cover everything about the topic without taking help from the teacher. It is quite common for tough subjects. You should ask for help from your teachers and your peers in the class. It helps you to learn more about the topic and clear your doubts without much effort. Apart from that, you can also ask your parents for help if they can help you with the topic. Along with that, you can also ask them for the private tutor, who will help you to learn more about the topic. 5. Stay focused during your homework Focus is the key factor in how to get good grades. Lack of focus will not help you to good core grades; You need to be well focused during your homework. Did you know homework plays a crucial role in your academic scores? Homework helps you to get ready for the exams and learn more deeply about the topic. That\u2019s why you need to stay focused during your homework. Now the question is, how we can do that? The best answer to this question is to find a quiet place to do your homework. Remember that the place should be located in a distraction-free environment. There are some other factors too that create the distraction during your homework writing. Mobile devices are a major distraction for that. You should put your mobile phone aside. You can also put it into the silent or mute mode. Moreover, You can also use some apps that will lock your phone for a certain period. You can also do your homework with the help of some experts. Suppose that you need to have the statistics homework help. Then you can take the statistics homework help from the experts. They will help you to clear all your doubts more effectively. 6. Reward Yourself by taking the short breaks Majority of students don\u2019t give the importance to the breaks between the study. But remember that breaks work as an amplifier for your brain. If you do continuous study, then you may not get the good grades. Because continue study usually tied up the brain. That\u2019s why taking the short break always help you to refresh your body and brain. You should take a break within every 45 minutes during your study. The break should be as long as 15 minutes. During your break, you can walk around your house to get some fresh air. You should also drink some water to regain energy. Apart from that, you can also eat some snacks to fuel your body. It works as a reward for yourself and makes you more productive by doing something that you enjoy. 7. Prefer group study (If Possible) Sometimes group study works better than the self-study. The reason is in group study the members of the group help each other to motivate themselves and make them more productive. It also helps you to clear the doubts of each other if you find any trouble within the topic. Moreover, you can be sure that how much you have prepared for the exams. Because most of the time we assume that we study enough and get ready for the exams. But in reality, we may not be ready for the exams. On the other hand, in the self-study, there may not be any motivation for you. You need to motivate yourself. If the group study style suits you, then you should organize such groups. You can also do group study after class or on weekends. 8. Organize your study space In most of the cases, the students don\u2019t organize their study space. It is a common thing that perfect planning leads you to perfect achievement. You should organize your study space efficiently. You can do this manage all your books and stationery in one place. Don\u2019t you ever try to do not let your desk become cluttered with papers and stationery? Apart from that, you should also make separate notebooks for the separate subjects. Don\u2019t you ever try to make the notes on the same notebook for every topic? Because during the exam sessions, it will be overwhelming for you to study from that notebook. Also, remember that when you prepare for the exams. You should always have your notes and your books along with you at the same time. In this topic, I also talked about planning. You should plan your entire day and divided into small parts. Along with that, you can also write down the important dates for tests. 9. Develop a study schedule Scheduling your study is crucial to get good grades in your exams. Whenever you decide to study. Then you should divide your time into small chunks. Small chunks help you to prepare for the topic more effectively. Suppose that if you\u2019re preparing for the test, then you should divide your time into small chunks and put the small topic into these chunks. You should also manage the time as per the topic hardness. If the topic is hard enough, then you should give it more time, if the topic is easy enough then you should give it a little time. Majority of students were waiting for the last night to get prepared for the exams, but it is the worst strategy. Because no one can get good grades with a one-night study. 10. Take Care of Your health and stay fit Health is wealth for everyone, whether it is a student or a professional. Health is a crucial factor behind how to get good grades. You should take care of your health during the study. Don\u2019t you ever try to avoid food during the study? Because your mind and body need nutrients for study. Therefore you need to make sure that your meals are nutritious, balanced, and varied. Because It works as a fuel for your brain and makes it more productive. Never miss breakfast before school because breakfast provides you the necessary nutrients for study longer. 11. Sleep well It is often that the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep while studying for their exams. It is proven that sleep plays a crucial role in the performance of students. If the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep, then they may not be able to keep their focus during the class study and self-study. Our brain needs proper rest. Therefore sleep helps the brain to relax for a couple of hours. Moreover, it also recharges our body and makes it ready for the study. It has been proven that the students should take at least 8 hours of sleep each night. It also helps them to stay fit and active during their study. 12. Utilize Your Textbook Textbooks are quite helpful in getting good grades. Professors and teachers assign textbooks based on some reasons.

You should read everything about the topic from opening vignettes to the case studies. Also, try to figure out which topic is most critical.

Sometimes its that annoying proffessor who isnt serious enough or those troublesome backbenchers. According to a study it was found that if attentive in class, you are halfway done with the topic.Study in short frequent intervals. Dont stress yourself out with a greed to finish a topic in 3 or 2 hours. Rather indulge in short sessions. It makes you grasp faster and you do not feel burdened. Also take short breaks like listening a song or two or maybe chumming a bits of biscuits or having a talk with your mom. Make sure to take a break of 5\u20137 minutes between every 30 min session.Revise. Get a habit of frequent reading what you memorised that past night. Just reading enough will make it last longer.

Secondly, you need to be able to think when answering questions. Memorising isn't going to help you if you encounter a different question. Lastly which I think is the most important - having a calm and relaxed mind. You have to understand that exams are going to put you under a lot of stress. Most students are already stressed before exams because of anxiety. This doesn't help at all. All it does is that you are going to panic during exam and not being able to perform. I suggest that relaxing one day before exam is crucial to do well. You can try meditating, exercising, watching a movie and most importantly you need to have an adequate amount of sleep. Good luck, hope it helps. ",

Mark my works and by the end of a month you will see changed in your study pattern and your concentration level will become double. Here it goes Spolier--This guide is only if you want to devote all your time towards studies and you are ready to give up your social life and focus on studies. LEAVE SOCIAL MEDIA YES. It might sound heart breaking but I have personally tried it and it worked. I just gave my 12th board exams and I used to study 12\u201314 hours a day. That might sound crazy but you can do too. Do not waste your time on social media. Uninstall WhatsApp Facebook Snapchat Instagram and all other apps. Wake up at 6 am everyday and study. Take a short nap for an hour and then study again Have breakfast. Take a shower Start studying again Have lunch. Take a power nap for 15min Start studying again Now in the evening sleep, go out and play or watch YouTube or talk to your family or friends or listen to music. After wards study Have dinner take rest And study That was the routine I followed and believe me even you can study for atleast 10 hours by following my routine. this is the only advice. Also you can watch motivational videos on YouTube to motivate you and study hard I hope this helped!! Upvote if you liked it!! It only motivates me to write more :) ",

Some lose their interest in studies as they find it difficult to get good marks. There are few tips on how to get good marks in exam. Any student who genuinely implements these tips can definitely get good marks in exam.1. Personal time table This is the most important tip to get good marks in exam. One must create a personal time table in which one must give time to each subject on regular basis. Subjects which you find difficult must be given a bigger slot of time and subjects which you find easy can be given a smaller time slot. For Example, a school student can fix one hour each for difficult subjects like Mathematics and Science. Half an hour can be given to SST, 15 to 20 minutes for easy subjects like Hindi, English . Same rule applies for college students. They can also classify their subjects depending upon their difficulty level and assign them time slots. Initially one may find it difficult to stick to the time table but with the passage of time it become possible to follow the time table.2. Study Regularly Regularity is the mantra of success.For complete article click at following link http://www.lovejotbhardwaj.com/get-good-marks-exam/ ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing like fetching good marks, you need to understand each and every concept form the core. For doing that you can organise your course plan in a logical way. These are some of the points that I follow and these work pretty well for me. Try to understand as much in the class, that will reduce the pressure of studying at home.Don't focus much on group studies rather focus on doubt discussion.You need not to give too much hours for studies at home just make sure that you understand everything which is taught in the class that day.Prepare for test as hard as possible because when you prepare for test, you prepare for final exams.After you get a concept very well, go through the examples, practise 4\u20135 questions on it.For final revision of that topic, teach one of your friend and try to solve his/her doubts, that will boost your confidence and you won't forget those concepts now.Don't avoid work like assignment whenever an assignment is assigned to you try to complete it within 3\u20134 days, starting from the first day onwards.You have plenty of time after your college/school. Just give 1 hour or less, in starting if you are not long time reader, start with half n hour then increase as you like.If you study from books that will build up your intrest in that subject.Most important of all, don't leave a class till all your doubts are clear, you should feel some giggling in your stomach that I have to ask this even if you think, that\u2019s to small to ask. DON\u2019T Hesitate to ask.Answer properly and precisely in your exams.There is no direct way of fetching marks brother. Prople often say that there handwriting is not so good that's why they don't get marks but that's really not the truth, you need to write what examiner wants you to write and what is correct answer of that question. When I cleared my 12 class I felt that I could have done much more good if I had organised my studies. After that I followed these points or whatever you can call them, and results were really good. I saw that even when I was not straining myself, I was getting very good marks. And last thing that I want to share with you that try to make your studies lovable as you love your favourite sports or tv series or cartoon. If your think these are useful follow them. Thank you. ",

Even though I hardly studied I was able to secure a good position in my class. What really helped me the most was that I used to make my own short notes. And it might seem tedious but trust me it's the prime way to score well without putting in much of hard work. I maintained just 2 diaries for all my subjects every year and I never really had to go through my textbooks. Only at times I used to refer to my books for detailed information. That's it!  I used to classify different topics and subtopics and tried to break them down to short notes. This hardly takes the same amount of time you spend reading it as you're not really mugging up the whole text instead you're noting down only the key points. When exams were near I just had to go through those short notes over and over again and this way you're able to strike the key points and able to recall the rest. Just to mention..I secured 93% in 10th boards and 94% in the intermediate so yes this has worked for me to score fairly well. I hope it helps. All the best\ud83d\udcab ",

To successfully crack and ace big examinations, you first and foremost need passion and drive to put in hard efforts until you succeed. Parental Support also helps a ton as they help you stay motivated , confident and strategist as well as not distracted. Link relevant concepts together - You need to see the bigger picture, not isolated facts. Immersion in the subject itself is better than remembering individual facts.Don\u2019t fuss about rewriting your notes again and again - Simply copying your notes out won\u2019t help you revise effectively. Rewriting does help some people take in key concepts, so restrict it to writing the main point as an anchor rather than regurgitating everything.Use all your senses - Don\u2019t just read; write out brief points that you want to solidify. Don\u2019t just use your eyes; discuss key topics with other people on your course.Revise in different locations to vary your intake - It also helps you recall later, because you\u2019ll store different information at the different places. In the exam, you could recall more by picturing the different places you were and remembering what you studied in each place.",

After completing the topic , close the book and try to memorize the things you've read.  8.Last but not the least , Give atleast one hour of your study schedule for revising the previous day's study.

Mind that these suggestions are equally suitable for toppers, average students, and low scorers. Scoring better marks to me is performing our best during exams. Content knowledge is essential, but presentation skills are equally important for you to answer in a manner that a teacher understands easily in minimum amount of time. Since, the subjective answer sheets are evaluated essentially by humans, quality of assessment may be affected due to infringement with human behaviour. #Before exam: Make sure that you've sufficient stationery materials, you must write atleast a page using each pen and use those stationery materials before you use them in exam. It'll reduce the chances of false negatives for problem in materials going to help you score better marks.Make sure that you're with your admit card!#Before answering: Considering the above guiding principles, keep these points in mind before you start answering: You'll be given some amount of time to go through the question paper. During this period, be decisive!Check for any possible misprints in question paper.Count and verify number of pages in your answer sheet.Read all the questions.Divide the question paper into two parts. One, which is known well to you and other, which is unknown to you.Do the above procedure, even if you're not provided with time to read question paper. Start with answering the questions which are familiar to you. Do this part with an optimum of your speed.For the questions whose answers are unknown to you, write the distantly related concepts too. Present formula, steps and other related concepts.#While answering: Q: How to write answers so that teacher will assign you maximum marks? Write question number (with black pen) in the centre of answer sheet, so that it's clearly visible to the evaluators.Parts of an ideal answer;Introduction: Give a short introduction to the topic.Content/Body: This is part where you've to focus.Never miss an opportunity to express yourself using an example.If possible, present an unique schematic diagrams. Label the diagram, don't forget to put arrow sign in diagrams to denote direction and order.Underline what you think your evaluators must consider.Put the derived formula in a box so that it can be distinguished from the whole mess.Conclusion: Give a crispy conclusion, not more than 50 words.#After answering: Revise to hunt errors and improve the answers.If time permits, use pencil to separate the two different answers.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 END \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Mistakes not to be done: Never keep jumping over different sections of a question paper while answering. It irritate most of evaluators.Never leave 3\u20134 pages continuously in between of answer. It may restrict further evaluation of answer sheet.Never cut any part of answer for the question which you've not enough time to write a different answer.Never use numbers for purpose of Bullet and numbering, instead use alphabets and bullets. Numbering the subheadings provides a quick impression of quantity to the evaluators.Never leave any question unanswered.Never assign same answer number to two different answers, because your marks will be tabulated against question number before their summation.After implementation of these methods, you can expect better marks. Comment to improve the answer, upvote if you've gained something. Wishing you a good luck! ",

If you have ample time then learn each and every topic from the syllabus.  If not then quickly search for the previous years question papers. Although you will not be able to get good marks by using this method but you can pass the examination. Pick those which match your syllabus and study them. Or prepare some important questions from each chapter which are likely to come in the exam. Do not hesitate to go to the teacher to know the important questions. While you are learning a topic then write down the keywords and use them in exams. While writing the exam remember to underline the keywords that you learnt so that the teacher's eyes directly go on the underlined word. Take help from friends who have studied a topic and learn from them, this will save you some time so that you can concentrate on other topics. Best Wishes. ",

If their is no such, then go for the simplest one(as it will help in boasting up your confidence level).Now slowly and gradually you are getting in the mood of studying. So let's start with something called cruel subjects like maths,science etc. Here too apply the same rule that hunt the easy target first in order to enhance your ability for the tough. But, if you are unable to solve any question,leave it and get to other. Don't let your pace been affected.After you are done with the course, try solving the model test papers in an virtual environment that is similar to actual examination hall. This will analyse your preparation and here you come across your mistakes. By solving such papers again and again you are now somewhat prepared to perform your level best at the exams. So always remember    \" analyse time and again so  to summarize it in better way\". And at last the most important thing, always have faith in your ability. The success to anything lies in it's struggle. ",

First believe that the subject you are learning is designed for students who are at the same level as you. If other can why cant you. Have open mind take baby steps initially.4) First revise what you already practised: just give a glance to problems you have already practised and solve them in mind. Don't go for exact values just try to remember the method and logic behind it.  Best of luck for future exams. Cheers !! ",

Also, if you can find a study partner that has better scores who\u2019s willing to study with you and explain things you don\u2019t necessarily understand, that\u2019s a big help. Before one of my finals, I was having a really hard time retaining some information. One of my friends, who had better marks in that class than I did, was gracious and kind enough to spend practically the entire Sunday with me before the exam to study and help me out. We studied for a good 10 hours. We, of course, took breaks, went to go grab some pizza, and then came back and continued. I got a 98 on that exam. But don\u2019t always wait until the last minute. If you can join a study group, or at least get a friend to study with, and go over information that you need to retain, that also helps. Make sure you\u2019re sleeping and eating right. Breakfast or even a snack in the morning will get your brain going. Good luck! ",

Be precisDont take your course as a burden ,rather try to develop interest by making concepts regarding the subjects under study. As an example if you are going through study of literature , of any language ,make a movie of the stories you are reading.BELIEVE me your mind is capable of doing that.There always comes a time when you know that your brain is not working and you are not able to go through even a page.LEAVE IT for some time and go for some running or excercise . When you come back surely you will do better.Go through the previous examination paper as to get the idea of the paper pattern .Make some points with your PEN. Make some notes.Try to combine your study with some activity of your interest. Like drinking coffee or watching a movie after reading ten chapters or having snacks while study\u2026you will enjoy more \u2026AND DONT LET EXAMS OVERCOME YOU ,ONE EXAMINATION CANT DECIDE WHO YOU ARE \u2026TAKE IT EASY.",

I will recommend you to read and learn everyday atleast one topic of 1 subject.Some guys start reading when the exams are very close that situation is very hard.So study daily . Also when exams come study on night rather then in day.Coz during night time there is less distraction and also a lovely peace In which you can learn easily and fast. NEVER just keep reading 1 thing to learn it . Understand it first Put your mobile phone a side and silent on vibrate mode.And mobile dataand WiFi switch off.Phone is your biggest enemy during exam believe me.but yes you can use your phone for study help.But only for study help. Now most important TIME TIME TIME Make target to compelte some topic in that particular time. Always keep a table clock in front of your eyes. This is all I do when my exams come. And I was always in top 5 in our class May it help you ",

Last year only i have completed my first year (M.Ed) and now i am in second year. Because of my job i dont get enough time to study, half of the last year i had spent in preparing assignments, synopsis and all. when i had seen my exam dates i was little disappointed because i had not study at all. But i make up my mind that i should study that much so i can pass the exam. It was 20 0r 25 days before when i started studying with calm and peaceful mind . I had focused on important topics only and charts and diagrams to represent my answer more effectively. I took the help of internet whenever i required or felt that stuff is not good enough in the book. Although i don\u2019t had enough time for a deep study but still whatever the topic i took i studied deeply, for that i took the help of two three books and internet as well. With this preparation i wrote my exam and secured the 2nd position in my class. Except that, for getting good marks is also more depended on how you are presenting your answer in exam. Answer should not have too much of writing. It should have flow charts, pie charts, bold headings to make the answer presentable because examiner dosen\u2019t have too much time to read the answer thoroughly. I hope this information will help you little. ",

First of all, while studying, your aim should not be to pass your exams but to score full marks or rather study to increase your your knowledge.   What I feel the most important things are: Pay attention in the class. Listen carefully to what the teacher is saying. Clear your concepts, never be afraid of asking questions, however silly they are, never hesitate. Have a fair idea of what is going to be taught in the class.   Once you start participating in class discussions, you'll be appreciated by your teachers, your personality will take a hike and ultimately this will also increase your interest in the studies. You'll no more feel studies are a burden.  During exams...   Study at the time you feel comfortable (I like studying early in the morning and late night, most peaceful moments!) Always revise whatever you study.      Most importantly, don't cram whatever you're studying, understand the concept.   Choose to stay in a padhakoo group (a group of friends who are good in studies). Coz you're the average of the 5 people around you. Have group discussions on different topics to open up your mind and increase knowledge.   Hope this helps! Best of luck ",

The most bulletproof advice I've found applies to classes that have a very good textbook and has a curriculum that follows it reasonably closely.  The advice is simple to explain and doesn't require any cleverness to apply to one's studies --- just a decent bit of discipline. Solve all the problems in the textbook. Doing all the problems / exercises in the class textbook doesn't take an onerous amount of time if you do it intelligently --- skip problems you are reasonably confident you can solve, work on problems until the point you see how to finish the solution then move on, etc.  Reading, reviewing lectures, etc. are great ideas too, but you'll end up doing that anyways as you try and figure out how to solve a particular problem you get stuck on.

Learning includes understanding different concepts, application of concepts to the relevant questions and also learning short tricks to solve the questions if you are preparing for competitive exams. However, learning just the short tricks or memorizing will be ineffective if you do not understand/ know the concepts. Even if you cannot recollect the formulae/short tricks during the exams, the knowledge of the concepts will come to rescue. You can always create your own short tricks if you are conceptual base is strong.Practicing the learnt concepts through mock tests or by solving question papers.Analyzing your strengths and weaknesses through your performance on the mock tests and rebuilding your knowledge.There would be no room for stress should you have a plan that works for you and make the plan your habit.2.

People say your friends influence your behaviour ,but i believe in hanging out with anyone you like so have an open mind about learning from even the dumbest! A fool can teach you the things that made him oneSuccess dose not come over night!it is a matter if will and patience! You don't need to be a genius !just don't ever give up! If you have 60% In 10th then out of nowhere you won't get 90 in 12! You will have gradual improvement! Like 70 in mid of 11! Den so on! It's allways about being patient and improving your stand one at a time!Most important thing is introspection! Even if you think you are right contradict your self!

If you want to do well, just focus on learning. Learn whatever you are taught in school, comeback home and revise the material you are given( in the form of textbooks or homework). You will definitely improve your grades. Take relevant examples for all the things you learn, so as to enhance your retention, which will help you remember the answers.

There are many ways to make time work with you, instead of against you. Purchase an academic diary or study planner. Buy one which provides a week-at-a-glance or a month-at-a-glance view, so you can get a holistic view of the time you have available. Find out assignment due dates and quiz/test/exam dates and mark them in your study planner in advance. This way you\u2019ll be able to avoid social commitments during pre-exam periods. Minimize distractions and keep your priorities straight. Focus on your goal of getting the highest marks possible. Schedule social activities around your study schedule and not vice-versa!

            "answer_text": "Studying for Exams  Here are some tips on studying for exams.  1. Start on Day One.  You should always be studying for the next exam. Do a little each day, or at the very least start studying 2 \u2013 3 days before the exam. Do NOT start studying the night before the exam.   2. Get a Good Nights Sleep.  Get a good night sleep the night before the exam. It is important to be well rested and mentally sharp when you take the exam.   3. Make a List of Important Concepts/Formulas.  Review your notes and make a concise list of important concepts and formulas. Make sure you know these formulas and more importantly how to use them   4. Rework Homework Problems.  Do not just read over the homework problems. Actually rework them. Writing down the steps will help you to remember them. Make sure that you try to do the problems without looking at the solutions.   5. Rework Book/Notes Examples.  Cover up the solutions to book or note examples and try to rework them. When looking for problems from the book don\u2019t forget that most books have a review section at the end of each chapter that usually contains more problems.   6. Look for Identifying Characteristics in Problems.  While doing your homework you knew which section it came out of. This provided some clues as to the solution process. During an exam you won\u2019t have this to help you. So, while reviewing your homework look for identifying characteristics that will give you clues on how to identify that kind of problem.   7. Take a Practice Exam.  Find some problems and treat them a practice test. Give yourself a time limit and don\u2019t use your notes or book.    Taking an Exam  Taking exams is probably one of the most important things that you\u2019ll do in a math class and so it\u2019s important to do the best that you can. Here are some ideas that will help you while you\u2019re taking an exam.  1. RELAX!!!  This is the first step to successfully taking an exam. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also one of the hardest things to do. The more worked up and nervous you are during the exam the more likely you are to forget something or blank out. The worst thing that you can do in an exam is panic.   2. Be Smart.  You should go over the exam three times. First, go over the exam and work all the problems that you KNOW you can do. Second, work all the problems that you think you can do, but aren\u2019t sure. Last, go back and work the remaining problems. In this way you will get all the points that you know you can get.   3. Be Time Efficient.  Watch the clock. Don\u2019t spend a huge amount of time trying to get the points for one problem! If you spend too much time trying to get the points for one problem, you may not be able to finish the exam and lose more points than you gained by taking all that time for that one problem.   4. If You\u2019re Stuck Move On.  If you find that you\u2019re stuck on a problem, move on to a different problem and come back later to finish the problem. Don\u2019t waste time trying to get 10 points and then not be able to finish and miss 20 points because you ran out of time.   5. Show All Your Work.  Make it as easy as possible for the instructor to see how much you do know. Try to write a well-reasoned solution. If your answer is incorrect, the instructor will assign partial credit based on the work you show. Don\u2019t leave it to the instructor to read your mind trying to figure out if you knew what you were doing or not.   6. Never Leave a Problem Blank.  You should never leave a problem blank. Even if you don\u2019t know how to finish the problem, write down as much as you do know. The instructor can only give partial credit if there is something written down for the problem. Writing something down is not a guarantee of partial credit, but not writing anything down is a guarantee of no partial credit!  Read the Problem. Make sure that you read the questions carefully and completely before you answer the question. If the instructor asks for the answer to be written in a specific form then make sure that you do that.   7. Does Your Answer Make Sense?  Make sure you\u2019ve gotten an answer that makes sense.  Recheck Your Work. If time permits go back over the exam and check every problem. This means completely rework the problem from scratch. ",

You should think of nothing but what you are studying. There's no use thinking about anything else. That's for sure. Don't think of scores. Don't think of the results. Don't worry abt how well you can memorize the topic and all such thoughts. Just study. And nothing else. Never get depressed over why the hell you are studying all this.

Hard work alone can help you pass exams. Hard work can be done only if you stop worrying about the exam dates and simply try to focus. Analyse yourself, your strengths and weaknesses and prepare accordingly. Try to work harder on your weaker portions. Even when you are doing other things you can keep in touch with your subjects by simply linking them to real life situations. Try to remember the topics which you tend to forget while in bathroom or while idle or drinking cold coffee. Such practices refine your memories. At the end of the day it all comes down to that particular day and you need luck. So keep praying to God. Enjoy in between studies and refresh your mind through meditation or doing something which doesn't stress your mind like painting or reading. Best of luck!!  ",

That time you will be able to read the lesson more than one time. Second, the weeks before exams. You will find out that you don\u2019t need to read the lesson anymore to remember it. There will be few parts which you will need to read again. If you don't study on your first day don't be sad there is still much time to revise what you didn't study and much time to study your new lessons. Don't forget your free time to renew your energy, by playing or talking to your friends, but if you want to get high marks, you should know that you should lessen your free time and double the time of studying. Best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "Performing well in the exam depends on how well one is able to recall what has been studied. Many of the students just memorize the important portions and think that they should be able recall at the exam hall. Consider the anxiety, expectations and the stress plus long hours of hard work one would put in just before the exams - and in the exam hall all this heady mixture hits the memory cord and \u2018boom\u2019 - what ever one had memorized completely gets vaporized into nothing. To perform well in the exam do the following. Study almost every day - May be only one hour - but studying every day gives you more confidence.Most important - Understand what you are studying- There are enough resources available to clarify your doubts- Once you understand it is stored as an experience rather than just a mugged up portion.keep a note book with you and always write /scribble what you have understood - in its essence. These notes should help you when you revise the same portion later.Practice revising the portion - The more you revisit what you have studied -the longer it stays in your memory.Don\u2019t give up hope.",

After all you are the one who studies,come up with your own strategy. And finally Revise repeatedly . REVISION IS THE KEY. If you don't revise it is difficult to remember that huge syllabus. ",

It can be school exams, board exams, entrance exams or some kind of job oriented competitive exam and the answer will be different for different cases. But i am going to answer this in the most generalised way. So to score better the first thing you need to do is to Understand the EXAM i.e. pattern of question, division of marks according to syllabus, toughness of paper , time allotted/marks(say 2hrs-time to read questions-sign attendance sheet- revision). for this the best thing you can do is to try all previous year papers available for the particular exam and sort out all the above mention points. then you can have a better view of what you have already done and what you have to do further. For descriptive types of paper the presentation is a very important factor i.e. the neatness, sequence of answer s , readability of answer sheet , the amount of conceptualize answer you are presenting in a concise way etc. Lastly learn the things from basics , try to relate the things with your practical life as much as you can and also try to remember all the things you have learned atleast once before you are going to sleep. Hope these things will work for you. GOOD LUCK!!! ",

If you have an elder with you and you are finding a subject difficult to understand you can ask your elder to help you with that\u2026. After understanding the subject you can write something which is written in really hard words , in your own words so that you can remember it better.After you have understood the paragraph or line, instead of memorising it in your mind , write it down\u2026 this may take time but you won\u2019t forget it the next time you have to refer to the book.. in fact writing down will help you remember it so well that you won\u2019t have to refer to it again(NOTE THAT WRITING DOWN A LINE OR A PARA IS ONLY HELPFUL WHEN YOU ARE TRUE TO YOURSELF, MEANING THAT DO NOT OPEN THE TEXTBOOK WHILE YOUR WRITING DOWN THE POINTS)Your exam may be next week or it may be tomorrow itself, so writing down a whole paragraph might be time consuming, so I advise that you write the important pointers which you think are hard for you to Memorise..The final tip is to refer to many books , solve as many questions, do not byheart and finally understand the topic.These 4 pointers will help you to get higher marks in exams. Good luck! Happy learning!  ",

He will just see whether you understand the central principal/concept asked in the question Or not? The moment you write those 5 to 8 words required to be mentioned, you would get the score.

Sometimes you have to study a subject which you may not like, however if u wish to move ahead then u need to study that subject as well. When you know u will have to study it, what's the point in cribbing about it. Hope this was useful.  Happy studying everyday. ",

Think practical. You should be knowing by now all the important topics in each subject. If you have any problem areas consult a tutor or your teacher Even if u study hours and hours it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is how productive you were in those hours. You could probably do 6 hours worth of revision in 3 by focusing really hard and staying in that moment without procrastinating Also throw your phone away. That shit is distracting.

This can be achieved only if you are true to yourself. You are studying for yourself so that you can achieve great heights of success. And success is built on a strong foundation. Now coming to the marks part. You should know what are your strengths and weaknesses. Play to your strengths and learn to conquer your weaknesses. An analysis of the past question papers generally gives you an idea of how questions are set, which chapter carries more weighatge etc. Once you understand this, it is easy for you to recognize the areas which carry more marks. Then scoring becomes easy. Exams are not tough. It is your efficient preparation that helps in scoring good marks. Hope this answers your question! ",

Questions like 'What is the purpose of me learning this?\u2019 or 'How can this be useful to me in the future?\u2019 plays a very important role into what you want to achieve. Answer it yourself, different people different motivations. Even if you don't favour the subject you are learning. Just find a reason why too. It can be just proving your school teacher wrong. Well hey, I have experienced it. Im sure many people do. Good luck. Oh wait.. Luck doesnt help. ",

Integrating what you are learning into workable information means you need to think about how that information impacts or will impact your life. Another thing you can do is talk to your professor. Perhaps you don\u2019t have a clear understanding what she/he is looking for. Join a study group. Having the perspectives of others always gives you a new way of looking at something. Not only that, having to verbalize your thoughts on the subject helps to uncover where the gaps are in your own understanding. Good luck. ",

Just hit past paper after past paper, targeting weaker areas in more focused questions on the side and you can get yourself in to a position where you're almost able to predict what questions are going to appear in the real thing. Now the only way to guarantee 100% on every paper would be to cheat. I'd advise not doing that but hard, consistent repetition could get you reaching past 90\u201395% in all of your exams.
