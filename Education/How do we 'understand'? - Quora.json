My approach has been to study topics that will help me grasp most everything scientific and philosophical, the sources of factual/reasoned truth. i don\u2019t devote much time to the arts and music, i\u2019ll admit, though i do enjoy them at times. When i read that Ken Wilber began his career as a scientific spiritual philosopher by transcribing by hand all that Alan Watts had written, i took up transcribing passages from books that i\u2019d read, including \u201cHow to Read a Book\u201d by Adler. i currently have thousands of quotes crossreferenced so as to understand conceptual relationships in over 150 categories including General Truth, Factual Truth, Absolute Truth, Relativism, Paradoxical Truth, Zen, Infinity, Awareness, Right Understanding, Mindfulness, Virtue, Ethics, Morality, Buddhism, Free Will, etc. This personal library of quotes allows me to quickly gain access to quotes that relate concepts. Here are examples of easily accessed quotes from who is currently my most recommended author related to your question: \u201cConsciousness does not feel like a self. Once one realizes this, the status of thoughts themselves, as transient expressions of consciousness, can be understood.' from Waking Up by Harris \u201cAs manuals for contemplative understanding, the Bible and the Koran are worse than useless. Whatever wisdom can be found in their pages is never best found there, and it is subverted, time and again, by ancient savagery and superstition.\u201d from Waking Up by Harris \u201cOnly consciousness can know itself \u2013 and directly, through first-person experience. It follows, therefore, that rigorous introspection \u2013 'spirituality' in the widest sense of the term \u2013 is an indispensable part of understanding the nature of the mind.\u201d from Waking Up by Harris \u201cThe reality of your life is always now. And to realize this \u2026 is liberating. In fact, I think there is nothing more important to understand if you want to be happy in this world.\u201d from Waking Up by Harris \u201cThe answer to the question 'What should I believe, and why should I believe it?' is generally a scientific one. Believe a proposition because it is well supported by theory and evidence; believe it because it has been experimentally verified; believe it because a generation of smart people have tried their best to falsify it and failed; believe it because it is true (or seems so). \u2026 As far as our understanding of the world is concerned \u2013 there are no facts without values.\u201d from The Moral Landscape by Harris \u201cScience simply represents our best effort to understand what is going on in this universe, and the boundary between it and the rest of rational thought cannot always be drawn.\u201d from The Moral Landscape by Harris \u201cI know that we do not understand consciousness, and nothing that I think I know about the cosmos or about the patent falsity of most religious beliefs requires that I deny this.\u201d from Waking Up by Harris rand ",

            "answer_text": "This is a fascinating question. I think it has long answers at both scientific and philosophical levels. And, I don\u2019t believe we know all of the science behind \u201cunderstanding\u201d. That said, I think a broad overview might be this. In order to \u201cunderstand\u201d we need to have incoming information be relatable to prior informational constructs. Some kinds of information are relatable even at a genetic level. For example, a baby knows what it is supposed to do when offered the mother\u2019s breast; or, a baby will cry when it has a problem (knowing that crying will serve a purpose). Alternatively, most information becomes \u201cunderstandable\u201d as we connect the information to developing intellectual constructs. For example, we learn language by learning what words \u201cmean\u201d. The exact processes whereby incoming information is connected to appropriate neuronal structures in order to be processed as relevant are not known. Put simply, we don\u2019t know how the brain connects the image of a dog to other stored information specifically related to dogs. We also don\u2019t know precisely how the concept of \u201cdog\u201d is stored as a concept, and differentiated from the concepts of other similar creatures. One of the fun things about computers is that as computer programmers develop \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d they will need to address these issues. Certainly the constructs they create will be computer versions rather than human versions, but insights into how this may be done will be of service in both arenas. ",

            "answer_text": "If we can use a definition, UNDERSTANDING = FILTER. For example, in order \u201cto know\u201d (scire\u2019), the bottom line about \u201chow much it costs,\u201d we should realize that there is an \u201camplification,\u201d a lense, from each culture, creed, typology, and so on.

Of course, not everyone knows what it means when they dream, as another example. They may need to build (bildung: meaning \u201cscaffolding,\u201d \u201cpicture,\u201d), a \u201cfilter\u201d to comprehend dream language, or poetry, even what other\u2019s \u201cmean.\u201d A \u201cshortcut\u201d like commoner and technical languages that provide filters.

Also, when we investigate political ideology, religious fervor and/or fanaticism, and other group mentality, \u201ccontext\u201d can be similar or different. Thereby, different modalities thru which we understand can agree that they are referring to the same thing, yet there can be disagreements about how to react.

            "answer_text": "Hi, thanks for your request to answer. I actually have addressed this in several other of my Quora posts / so instead of \u2018re writing\u2019 the answer? I am going to cheat a bit and just do a copy and paste from a recent one. Copy and paste below> Hi, I do understand this question well (within the Objective Understanding of my own very \u2018Heart and Soul). First? a bit about me? so you can grasp my answer better. I am a Jew? not a Judaism jew . . . but a Jew from the 'boundary' of land known as Judah. The land of the 4th son of Jacob and the land of The Lion.The boundaries drawn in the sand. My \u2018understanding\u2019 is that our \u2018Creator (s) loved us so much that instead of giving us 'Law - and Rules' (the knowledge of good and evil aka morality) and rather also than / social teachings or religion teachings? My \u2018Understanding\u2019 is that He/She rather loved us so much our Creator (s) gave us Himself/Herself to dwell in our secret inner parts. Our Heart, our very Soul - for guidance, power, understanding, and the living of LIFE .. . forever and beyond forever outside of the \u2018legalism style\u2019 of \u2018mortal teachers, priesthoods, lawyers, rules, laws, and even books that are overfull with those simililtudes,and the multitudes of their likeness. (kind of like \u2018sidestepping\u2019 forever) . . . knowledge of good and evil, aka morality and totally and forever replacing those \u2018brain and emotional fireworks \u2018teasers\u2019 with pure understanding of hearing the \u2018ears\u2019 of a \u2018clean heart. The Herself piece of the puzzle? (What\u2019s up with that?) - well, in the beginning was 'Herself' (the living Word) - of all things created, nothing that was created, was created without her. She was with our Creator, - and also was our Creator (God) In order to 'find' that \u2018dimension? You must 'be a bit ashamed' ( and quit, forever, considering the brain and it's emotions (and their fireworks displays of colors, \u2018booms\u2019 and \u2018teases\u2019) that have put a layer of blindness and deafness over the eyes and ears of the/your very Heart. Again this is just my \u2018Understanding\u2019, not a teaching. It comes from listening thru the \u2018ears\u2019 of my heart. and I \u201cam not\u201d a teacher . . . just trying to be a bit of a \u2018help mate. The buck stops there. Again? My True Understanding? . . . Knowledge? - are much greater than - Emotional fireworks mortal understandings? - Get in the back seat forever . . . you ain\u2019t ridin\u2019 \u2018shotgun\u2019 no more. Wisdom \u2018herself\u2019 is rather rideing \u2018shotgun\u2019 24/7 . . . I will just call her \u2018Instinct\u2019 on \u2018steroids. The birds of the air, and the fishes of the seas? they do well with her. I do know that this does not answer your question \u2018directly\u2019 . . . but you did ask? . . . and I did answer . . . sincerely, no head games, not smack talk, no \u2018chain pullin\u2019. I guess the only thing left that I can say is? This will probably be a bit different than most of the other answers.  Hey, you have a great day, and thanks again for the request. from that lion CUB scout from the land of Judah (no! not the \u2018religion\u2019) - just the land) - easy to find - it\u2019s boundaries are \u2018drawn in the sand\u2019.

            "answer_text": "\u201cUnderstanding\u201d is a tricky term. My own \u201cunderstanding\u201d divides learning into two phases, which I think of as \u201cacquiring information\u201d and \u201cintegrating it.\u201d For example, you read a history book to gather information about the American revolution \u2014 everything from the names of military leaders to battle plans, to weaponry, to the progression of victories and defeats. You know there\u2019s a test coming up, so you memorize as much of the information as you can. Later, you read a book about, say, George Washington. At first, you gather information about him, and then you integrate that information with the information you have about the Revolutionary War. Still later, you integrate it with the development of the American constitutional process for choosing a president. The more links you establish among the information you\u2019ve gathered, the more integrated that information becomes, and the more information you have available to deepen your understanding. It\u2019s entirely possible that there\u2019s no maximum limit to \u201cunderstanding.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that at some point you\u2019ll encounter information that challenges some of your integration, and you\u2019ll have to re-integrate and modify your understanding. I hope this helps a bit, Jim! ",

            "answer_text": "How do we understand depends on what do we want to understand. Is it a situation, some person, a person\u2019s feelings and emotions, someone\u2019s expectations, our role as an observer and a listener, or the past experiences that we want to understand. The most challenging part of this process is to identify aspects and expectations around \u201cunderstand\u201d. We do have a few tools like asking questions to clarify thoughts and assumptions, analyzing behavioural pattern and doing the right thing after recongnizing the emotional expectations of a person. Asking questions is vital to this process, however, remaining cognizant of perceptions and cultural influences on a person\u2019s life or a situation is equally critical. What I understand is a display of love might not be love at all. Above all, having a genuine interest and determination to understand something or somebody without bringing in one\u2019s own baggage from the past is the most difficult step of this process. We understand with our own experiences, and by making a person feel that we could only imagine what they are trying to tell us. ",
