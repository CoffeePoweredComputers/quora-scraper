            "answer_text": "The middle ages as most commonly described are the period between the fall of the roman empire and begining of the Renaissance or the slightly later modern period. There are obvious problems with it, notable amongst which is thae fact that the eastern roman empire didnt fall untill the Renaissance had well and truly begun a thousand years after the fall of the city of Rome to barbarians. Also the golden age of Islam spread the light of classical and new origonal scholarship all over eurasia during this time. The period roughly 450 to 1450 (although I would go later to the earliest pre enlightenment thinkers like spinoza or locke inthe 1600's) is a time that western europe was basically an economic and intillectual wasteland compared to the roman era. Its not as dark as you might assume and there were a few periods and places where civilization took hold (carolingian Renaissance or in venice circa 1100) but there was a definate trend that can be identified during that rough 1000 years and you wouldnt be wrong to call that the middle ages. Sorry its not very cut and dry but its a very contentious issue amongst historians i.e were the dark ages dark,  is it useful to think of this time as simply between two \"great\" eras etc. As for the causes of its end you could fill libraries with whats written on that topic from climate change and agriarian reform to the mad idea that actually historians have the time line all wrong and rome was just a few centuries ago (or conversly much longer ago, people really do think that!). There are however a few easy to identify trends and happenings that I think did a lot to bring about modernity:  First is the contact with eastern scholarship through the crusades and then after the fall of Byzantium learned greek refugess fleeing west. In the byzantine and islamic empires classical knowledge was preserved and built upon and during the Renaissance period this knowledge slowly filtered back to the west. Secondly and most importantly in the long run was the printing press. Most people in europe during the middle ages were illiterate, why should they be since they probably couldn't even get their hands on a bible. Medium sized regional libraries, personal or monastic might have 50 books and probably mostly bibles or biblical or religious commentaries. As a result most knowledge resided in people and could die with people and even if someones insights were recorded in book form only a few people with access to that single book can benifit from it. Books could cost their weight in gold and for the most part were just nice illuminated copies of the bible. 50 years after moving type however any idea or discovery could be recorded and distributed to tens of thousands of people all over europe in a matter of months. This meant ideas of all sorts were accessable to so many more people and they could be built upon and prlgress could be made. The total body of knowledge was able to grow massively as was the number of people who could access that knowledge and add to it themselvs. Imagine, in ancient Alexandria a single building fire destroyed centuries of human progress in thought. Simmilarly in thr middle ages where in one county a fire or deliberate book burning could erase most secular knowledge in whole fields for a whole nation. After the press it was almost impossible to go backwards since there were so many back ups. From that point on knowledge could only stall or move foward, it could never revert to a more primitive state as it had after the fall of rome in the west. This led to the birth of modern thinking and so many of the other answers someone might give are dependant on this. ",

            "answer_text": "Although the answer of Phrenzy is good, I would like to answer this question from a different perspective. The term Middle Ages was invented, or better said became common usage in the 17th century and later on, when scholars tried to cut up known European history in periods. A frequent used three-period system was dividing history in the Classical period, the Middle period and the Rebirth of the classic or Modern period (rebirth means renaissance). When scholars subdivided the Middle period in an early and later age, with often a high period in between you had the Middle Ages when those three ages were combined. The term Dark Ages, meaning originally also the Middle Ages, became popular later when people thought the Medieval period being dirty and obscure. Later on this term remained in use for the Early Middle Ages because hardly any historical sources remain for this period. About when the Middle Ages started and when they ended remained open for debate. Though it was from the start agreed that the Middle Ages started when the (Western) Roman Empire fell, the actual date when this happened is debatable. When the last Roman emperor was forced to step down (AD 476) , Roman imperial government was already gone sometimes for decades or even centuries in many regions of Europa, technically meaning that the Middle Ages started earlier in those regions. For instance, traditionally the Dark Ages start in England when the Romans reject the Briton plea for help in AD 410 and not when the last Roman emperor steps down. The date of the switch from Middle Ages to Modern Period was even more a topic of debate. However, it was never a discussion what was the cause of the end of the Middle Ages, but more when the Modern period started. There is no long term cause or whatever, there is just a starting point of a new period which has to be agreed upon by a large number to become common. Nowadays this is not a debate anymore, because every scholar has his/her own view on things, which is accepted as long as the arguments are good. For Western-Europe dates like the year 1453 or 1492 are accepted - the first date mentioned is the year when Constantinople fell and with it the Eastern-Roman Empire, which caused the West-European states to look elsewhere for spices, the second date is when Columbus arrived in the Americas. However, per country, or even per region there are other dates. For instance in North-Italy it is the 14th century when the classics are rediscovered, while in the Netherlands the year 1500 or the year 1568 are commonly used. The first date because it is such an easy to remember date, the second because it marked the rebellion against Spain which is the beginning of the state which would become the Netherlands. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion\u2026it was three things, in roughly this order. The Post-Crusade period and the rise of international trade: Europe during The Middle Ages - especially areas inland from the coasts and away from the major navigable rivers - became very cloistered, very insular, and very much rooted in routine and ritual. The feudal system was in very much in place. Virtually everything revolved around one\u2019s own family, village, or town. There was very little communication with the outside world. Correspondingly - there was very little exchange of new ideas and new information. To fill the knowledge void - the Church became the storage house of everything known at that time. The monasteries and the Church were the only ones that possessed real knowledge from Ancient Rome and Greece and other civilizations. Given that the vast and overwhelming majority of people in Europe were functionally illiterate and that the Church was the only source of information and knowledge - it sets up a system in which the Church could control what was known by the people. Consider also that the Medieval Bible was written in Latin. Virtually no one outside of the Church and The Nobility knew Latin. Therefore, the Church held the key to the interpretation of the Bible - and taught the people their interpretation without question. Critical thought amongst the people requires knowledge that the average person simply did not possess during this period. The Black Death: The Middle Ages in Europe was characterized mostly by feudalism and everyone having a place within a rigid class-based society. The bedrock of this society were the serfs - the people tied to the land and to the land owners. Once the Black Death swept through Europe, it effectively wiped out most of the serf \u201cclass\u201d, if you will. Without this serf class in place paying taxes and tribute to the local barons and lords - the lords and nobles had to do other things to keep their feudal kingdoms going. Largely this meant cooperation with other neighboring kingdoms and establishing treaties and local trade. Also, since there were fewer peasants and serfs around, post Black Death era, there are correspondingly more opportunities for those left behind to help rebuild European society. Since most people didn't necessarily want to be tied to the land - many left the land. Those that stayed behind to farm and work the land demanded and got better compensation that their efforts. This had the net effect of giving the peasant class more real economic and social power then they ever could have had, pre Black Death period. This combined with the rise of trade and cities created a middle class (not desperately poor, nor fabulously wealthy) that really didn't have a place in the Middle Ages. This burgeoning middle class - and especially the increasingly well-to-do merchant class - was the beginning of the end for the rigid, class-based society that dominated Feudal Middle Age Europe. The development of gunpowder and firearms as an effective weapon of war: It's been stated by real historians that the development of the long bow (especially the English design of the long bow) was one of those great military developments that helped to bring about the end of the Middle Ages. In that respect, I tend to agree with the reasoning behind that assertion - but I don't buy into the true significance of the invention, by itself. The idea behind the long bow was a true game-changer namely, fire from a distance. Prior to the advent of the long bow - medieval warfare was very much a close-knit affair\u2026and anything went in the melee of a medieval battlefield\u2026swords, knifes, hammers, clubs, pikes, spears, daggers, grappling, wrestling, fists, knees, elbows, head-butts, teeth, and so forth. Medieval fighting was a metaphor for the times\u2026Cruel, Brutish, and Short. I would also add bloody, gory, exhausting, and very personal. The long bow started to change that. It represented the ability to wage war from a distance. While I fully agree that the advent of the long bow was a great innovation - it's not the \u201cgame-changer\u201d that it appears to be. Archers had to be specially trained for a long time in order to be effective. Also, the effectiveness of a medieval longsbowman was dependent upon the strength and stamina of that man to continue to fire bolt after bolt at a large and advancing enemy. Enter gunpowder and firearms. This was the real Game-Changer. It fundamentally changed the composition of medieval warfare. It allowed attacking forces to pour devastating fire from a (relatively) safe distance. More than that - firearms (specifically heavy siege cannons) rendered castles and fortifications functionally obsolete. While a castle, or a fort, or a walled city could withstand most medieval sieges and assaults - they could not easily withstand withering cannon fire over a sustained period of time. The advantage had been gained by the attackers\u2026and warfare would never be the same again. Additionally when cannons were brought on board warships - it would profoundly change naval warfare forever. Gunpowder and firearms changed warfare fundamentally and wars are still fought with gunpowder and firearms today. This concludes my long-winded answer to this question - I hope that you find it interesting. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "There is no hard definition and it varies depending on the field in question. I.e. a military historian can work with a different definition than e.g. an art historian or a student of religious history. Furthermore, one can argue that the middle ages ended in different areas at different times for different reasons. A few events are usually used: 1453: The Ottomans conquer Constantinople, the last remnant of the Roman empire. With the final ties to the ancient world lost and an incoming flood of eastern scholars into Italy, the groundwork for the renaissance had been laid. 1492: Christopher Columbus arrives in America, setting the stage for conquest of the new world and a drastic change in European onlook on the world and capabilities.  1520's and 30's: The first countries break with the Bishop of Rome and inter-European religious wars between Catholics and Protestants begin.  I personally like the last one, since it will have had such a profound effect on the ordinary people living at the time. People can have grown up being taught a certain world order, which had been shaken or proven false when they were old - and this is rare when talking about changes in historical period. However, as I said this is personal preference and for many fields (e.g. military history) there wasn't a profound difference between 1510 and 1530. There are likely other events tied to the end of the middle ages, but as always in history it has less to do with events and more to do with general developments in society. These can be very broadly summarized as the centralization of power with the monarch, the change from feudal to early-modern state structure and Europe becoming more interconnected through trade and exploration with far-flung areas of the world.

Nearly half the world cooks food on a wood-burning (or solid-fuel) stove that is not ventilated and does not have a chimney just like Northern Europeans did in the Middle Ages. This has resulted in a global-health crisis that causes more deaths than Malaria and nearly as many as AIDS.25% (or 2 billion) people around the world in Africa, Asia, and Latin America are subsistence farmers \u2014 also known as peasants. Sound familiar? Like their Northern European medieval counterparts, these peasants are vulnerable to hunger, malnutrition, and starvation.[1]Like the European Middle Ages, famine is always a heartbeat away in countries like Africa. And like the Middle Ages, famine is an economic and logistical problem. In the Middle Ages, the rich had enormous grain reserves but they chose to speculate on the price of grain. During famines, grain often existed in places like Egypt but it could not be shipped due to credit and trade route issues. But one of the biggest drivers of famine was war. Weak kings did not help. Today, war and bad government continue to lead the way in countries like Africa. See The true cause of hunger and famine? War and weak governance.Today slavery, politely renamed human trafficking, exists around the world. If you live in the US, consider where your lettuce comes from: Sex Slaves on the FarmGross inequalities between rich and poor exist in Western nations and between the West (aka the new nobility) and developing nations. Some of these inequalities are dramatically worse than the difference between medieval lord and peasant. Consider a CEO\u2019s compensation in relation to a workers. Consider our wealth in the West vs. the average person\u2019s life in a developing nation.Corruption (gov\u2019t, officials), sexism, limited human rights, corrupt and inadequate justice systems, crime, warfare, inadequate birth control, maternal mortality, infant mortality, warlords with private armies, and famine are all problems that plagued the Middle Ages and plague many parts of the developing world today.This may not be quite what you wanted to know, but it\u2019s worth asking ourselves if the Middle Ages are really over. If 25\u201330% of the world lives like medieval people did, are the Middle Ages that far in our \u201crear view\u201d? When we see the Middle Ages as being part of the distant past, we numb ourselves to the tragedy and horror of many people\u2019s lives in the developing world. When those of us in Western nations don\u2019t see the struggles of developing nations as part of our own history, I think it might make us less compassionate.

            "answer_text": "What brought an end to the Middle Ages? The Middle Ages are generally described as the period from approximately 500 to 1500 CE. Of course, there is not a day or even year when we can say they ended; there was a period of transition. Some theorists now suggest that the only way major social change can occur is if societies collapse or experience catastrophe. I think that view is overstated - I think we can have change without collapse. However, collapse usually brings change. The Black Death caused enormous social and economic change (this was not the only factor, of course). Widespread death caused a crisis of belief (had God abandoned humans? was the world coming to an end?) There were shortages of agricultural labor; food production was reduced. Deaths among nobles and church leaders also contributed to the breakdown of order. Labor shortages gave workers limited power to demand greater freedom and better conditions. Trade guilds become stronger, and this brought more wealth and greater power to crafts persons and traders (such as smiths, weavers, brewers, carpenters, and so forth). To a limited extent, women became more likely to practice trades (sometimes a widow maintained her husband\u2019s brewing or wool trade business, for instance.) Something like a middle class began to emerge. There was somewhat more opportunity for social mobility. I don\u2019t want to overstate the changes - this didn\u2019t lead to a modern world overnight. Changes in technology also had great impact. For example, the introduction of cannons and guns made armored knights obsolete and the nature of warfare changed. The advent of the printing press promoted literacy and the spread of new ideas. (Earlier, the Roman catholic church was largely in control of these). Books began to appear in vernacular languages (and not just in Latin or Greek) and therefore more readers could understand them. Martin Luther publicized his objections to Catholicism around 1517. Protestant \u2018heresies\u2019 began to challenge the power and wealth of the Catholic church, and some rulers, notably Henry VIII, confiscated large amounts of church property. There are additional factors that contributed to social change. I believe these were among the strongest factors. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the beginning of the Age of Discovery signaled the end of the Middle Ages.  The catalyst for the age of Discovery was the creation of the Mariner's astrolabe, and Navigational tables, by Abraham Zacuto.  This allowed for open-ocean navigation according to celestial bodies and could be corrected for latitudes. The age of discovery began when Portuguese investors, boat owners and crews began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of Prince Henriques. In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias reached the Indian Ocean by this route.  In 1492 the Spanish monarchs expelled Jews and funded Christopher Columbus's plan to sail west to reach the Indies by crossing the Atlantic.  Columbus and a boat load of Jews landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a new world, the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Spain, the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands. Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by Vasco da Gama reached India by sailing around Africa, again with a boat load of Jews, opening up direct trade with Asia. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable spice islands in 1512, landing in China one year later. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan led a Spanish expedition West, achieving the first circumnavigation of the world, while Spanish conquistadors explored the inland of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

            "answer_text": "I will answer you \"How\" they ended and that may partially help you understand that \"When\" is a fuzzy term. Medieval Europe was an authoritarian conglomeration of vying states and kingdoms, dead on preserving the status, even during the most chaotic times of Europes history. It resulted from Europe's alienation from international trade and markets, due to major states, such as Byzantium and the Ismamic states of N.Africa and the Middle east blocking them, and because due to the fragmented nature of politics in Europe, no decent military effort could be mounted.  The crusades were a first effort to tople that balance by breaking the blockade and accesing the silk routes of  central Asia, but vying interests within and without Europe toppled the Crusader states within a century. The \"crack in the glass\" came with the development of the caravel, a light and highly maneuverable sailing ship, by the portuguese in the 15th c. allowed  for Vasco da Gama's circumnavigation of Africa, thus breaking the Muslim world's tight hold on silk and spice trade once and for all.  But the reason the muslim world did not fight back was because events like the crusades and the mongolian invasions all across asia had weaken muslim states and broken their cohesion (let's not forget that Mohamed forged a single state and intended it remain so). That, along with the fall of Byzantium, allowed the Portuguese a free reign in the Indian ocean (and Reign they did). back in Europe the landed classes coveted the wealth of the Orient, but were less than willing to trade, having been invested in land management. So it was that the opportunity for trade with the Orient fell to lesser nobles and peasants. Those who wurvived the rigours of a journey made a killing (littrally, hte Portuguese took over Goa, killed all Muslims and held it till the 1950's). This unprecedented wealth, which came from a source other than land and which looked (to european eyes) as virtually endless gave rise to a new class within the otherwise static European social system, the merchant or middle class. In time the middle class clamoured for more respect; they demanded representation for their taxes and equality before the law. All this upheaval and the European courts' reationary spirit gave rise to revolutions, social and religious reformation and the coming of a more liberal spirit over Europe. Inventions like the printing press, helped speed along, but they were an answer to a need, not an innovation that caused a revolution (no monks lost their jobs because of it). All this liberalism in economic, civil and religious matters ushered in the age we now call the Renaissance. So, you tell me, when DID the Middle Ages end and the Renaissance begin? ",

            "answer_text": "One could argue that the Middle Ages never really ended.   Imagine that an inhabitant of medieval England stepped through a wormhole in 1413 that took him to 2013 England. After he/she got used to flying machines, cell phones and electricity, our time traveler would notice that society and institutions had not changed that much. A monarch still rules a sovereign nation in conjunction with an elected parliament. People still speak English. Cambridge and Oxford are still in business. England is still predominately Christian. There is still a Pope in Rome, and the English still don't listen to him. Criminals are still tried by juries. Everything is still priced in pounds. Most importantly, people still think of themselves as English/British, with a stake in the future of their country (as opposed to a tribe or clan). The government still does not need to maintain a large military force to suppress internal rebellions, freeing up soldiers for wars in the Middle East.   Now imagine that our time traveler went back to England in 213. Things are very different from the late middle ages. No one speaks English. England is a province of an Empire, instead of an independent country. Slavery is legal and ubiquitous. There are probably a few Christians around, but England is mostly pagan. There is certainly no Pope. Nobody has ever heard of a university. No one thinks of themselves as English, and Rome has to keep three legions deployed to suppress rebellions.   The point of this exercise is to show that medieval cultural and legal institutions are still going strong. That is why it is so difficult to point to a specific end point for the middle ages. ",

But the tl;dr is: 1. Printing; 2. Formal and irreconcilable split in the Western church (Reformation and Counter-Reformation); 3. European voyages of discovery, exploitation and conquest. Lots of medieval institutions have survived until modern times: romantic love and the idea of a University have only really been demolished in the last 40 years, and some people haven't heard about it yet. But those three things acting together made a big change in the non-material world in which people lived. You might add the rise of the absolutist state, as opposed to the multi-centred and negotiated power that's more characteristic of the Middle Ages, but that might be a consequence as much as a cause.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s put a few things straight. Dark Ages is a term that was used in the XIX century but has since long been disused, the very concept of \u201cdark ages\u201d has been debunked and it a thing of the past.  This said, traditional periodization or European history is based on four ages: Antiquity, Middle Ages, Modern Age or Ancien R\u00e9gime, and Contemporary Age. The traditional boundaries for these ages are the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, the discovery of the Americas in 1492, the French Revolution in 1789. Actually these dates are not fixed in stone, for instance the end of the Middle Ages can be placed at the fall of Costantinoples in 1453, or at the introduction of the printing press in 1455 (and other dates have been used as well).  This periodization is not without critique. Most historians nowadays introduce a fifth age, between Antiquity and Middle Ages, called Late Antiquity, going from the III to the VIII century, more or less. This age is marked by the decadence of the Western Roman Empire and the survival of its institutions in the barbaric kingdoms. Besides, many different types of periodization. For instance marxist historians may divide history into Primitive Communism, Ancient mode of production, Feudal mode of production, Capitalism. Other historians completely refuse all periodization.  In the very end, periodization is mostly useful when it comes to create school and university programs. It gives teachers an easy handle with which to split our past in chunks, so that in the first year you stufy the Antiquity, in the second you study the Middle Ages, in the third you go for Modern Age, in the fourth you study the late XVIII and XIX centiry, in the fifth year you study the XX century. Periodizations help us orientate in history because we can place events in an easy ladder, they are a kind of pocket chronology that help us not get utterly lost in the past. Apart from this, periodizations have modest value.  The term \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d was invented by humanist Flavio Biondo in 1450, so in a time that we still consider part of the Middle Ages, to describe anything that went between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the newborn humanism. It was a concept deeply veined with ideology and which is heavily debateable. But he did (inadvertently) nail one thing: whenever convention puts the end of the Middle Ages, whatever definition we give of Middle Ages, it will always be just a model. And a model is something that never really occurs. Middle Ages is such a vague concept, apart from that handy periodization that helps us not getting lost, that however you define it, I could easily come up with examples of how your definition does not apply to stuff that occurred during the Middle Ages.  In the very end, the Middle Ages end wherever historians that deal with periodization decide they want them to end, to create a coherent chunk of history that we can use in our studies, whether we aim at becoming historians or we are just curiously peering through history books.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it was the Black Death that did in the Middle Ages. You see, the Black Death killed about 40% - 50% of Europeans. This meant there was a LOT of work to do, and not enough people to do it. After all, you still have to sow and reap and store food; you may not need as MUCH of it, but remember, this was all done by hand; no machines were available. So, the peasants and workers had an advantage; they had the muscle power the higher-ups needed, and could bargain for higher wages and better working conditions. It also sparked innovation. New ways were found of doing more with fewer people. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press less than 100 years after the Black Death. (Yes, I know the Koreans and the Chinese invented the printing press first; however, they did NOT invent the type alloy Gutenberg used\u2014which is still used today\u2014nor did they invent the hand mould to mass produce the type. And Gutenberg did it independently.) I\u2019m sure there were other innovations, too, but I am out of time. Just my $0.02 ",

More recently, the consensus has been to say that the Middle Ages ended at the dawn of the early modern period. What ended the Middle Ages specifically? Too many things to count, and unfortunately, it\u2019s not one of those things where there\u2019s a clear-cut answer. You could argue it was the Renaissance, but then the Middle Ages would\u2019ve ended in the 12th century, not the 15th. You could say it was the Spanish discovery of the Americas, but then the Middle Ages would\u2019ve ended in the 11th century, not the 15th. More than anything, it was a combination of factors, ranging from the decline of feudalism and the rise of centralised nation-states, to the rise in international commerce and mercantilism, to colonisation, to religious upheaval, and so much more.

Essentially, the Middle Ages were born and died with birth of the Modern era. The death was not a function of technology, but rather of mentality. Prior to the modern, most people generally assumed that there was not fundamental difference between life in 500 BC and life in 1500 AD. Although Koselleck does not make this point, this change in mentality is arguably the basis for several of Shakespeare's histories - a contemplation of what is eternally human and what is not? Do we share the same human qualities as the ancients? ",
