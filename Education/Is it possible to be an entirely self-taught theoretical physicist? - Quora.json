            "answer_text": "When I saw this question, I was very curious what the answers would be. It appears that the majority of those most invested in learning physics the usual way seem to think the answer is no, while the majority of those in other fields or are not physicsts themselves seem to think yes. I fully intended to become a physicist when I was young, but by the time I left high school, I had convinced myself that I could not afford to attend school long enough to get a PH.D., which I felt was needed to truly be a physicist, theoretical or not. My quest for knowledge never ended, so I always read up on the advances and published (for the masses) works to keep myself abreast of what was going on, if not the very detailed information involved. Since I did not know the extremely complex math involved, I never thought of myself as a physicist, because I could not do even the most low level quantum calculations for particle interactions. I did however, feel that there was a serious problem with the explanations that were being given for how things operated in the quantum world and so began a search for an alternative that made sense to me. The idea struck me that Einstein might have been wrong about E=mc^2 and that there was a velocity of something we were not seeing that could cause the apparent energy of mass conversion. When I started looking into this heretical idea, one that no physicist would dare to allow themselves to consider, I found that there was already a simple set of equations that existed that allowed particles to be made using this method. Part of the solution involved using the basic ideas involved in string theory, which I knew were not in existence when Einstein was alive, so he would not have considered those types of possibilities. It turned out that replacing Einstein's energy equation with simple momentum using a superluminal component worked in producing the spin value for particles if they were made with a torus of increasing diameter and decreasing cross-section, and had a charge sphere attached to the edge of the torus. All the values worked out for the accepted equations that described all aspects of particles. What was even more astounding, was that the simple ideas I had applied to creating particles also applied to energy particles as long as the mass was an inherent part of the construction of the particles, no matter which type. From there is was not that difficult to apply these same properties to explain every single thing that occurs in nature, including atom construction and how gravity can be generated as a 2D brane pressure in the creation of matter, which is why the two are completely linked. I'm sure that more complex math knowledge would help me provide the proof necessary to convince the scientific community that the ideas are completely consistent with all the evidence, and not just parts of it. I think that the most interesting thing is that when I first tried to write a paper about what I had discovered, I'm sure it could have been better, as it was my first attempt, the reply I got was not about the quality of the paper, but rather that 'no one is looking in this area.' This seemed to imply to me that even if the paper were accepted, no one would take the time to look at it. That simple statement has led me to believe that the scientific community has become too much like a cult. If your views do not fit with what is already the accepted doctrine then they are rejected out of hand with no further consideration. This has led that same community to the belief that the quantum world is essentially a magical place when in fact it can be equated with normal macroscopic behaviors in almost all instances. The only differences are that 2D objects with basic unalterable properties that cannot be detected on their own are what creates everything, and that one of those properties involves a faster than light velocity. Both of these seem much more believable than that entangled particles have an instantaneous connection across space, or that particles can take more than one path through space to interfere with themselves, or that particles can appear out of nothingness by borrowing energy from that nothingness. Seriously, just because no one is looking there, does that mean that we shouldn't be? I have written all of this into a book and posted it to be downloaded free of charge, so that anyone can decide if it makes sense for themselves. If ultrawave theory is proven correct, which I am certain it is, it only shows that it is what you are learning not how you learn it that is most important. This would seem even more relevant to those in the profession, or going into it, as there would now be much less complicated and unnatural information to learn. There is so much information out there to absorb that simplifying it would seem to be the way to go. Who can argue with that? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is possible, although I don't exactly know what you mean by \"entirely self-taught\"!  I take, by Theoretical Physicist you mean someone who can publish a paper in a decent theoretical physics journal and not the one who just knows some grad-school level subjects. By \"entirely self-taught\", if you mean learning some subjects on one's own without taking a formal course, then it is possible. Here are some examples. Edward Witten said he never took a math course in grad school but won a Fields Medal for his mathematical research. Bryce DeWitt saw his advisor Julian Schwinger only for about 20 minutes during his grad school and Dennis Sciama said he met Paul Dirac only twice regarding his PhD thesis. By \"entirely self-taught\" if you mean not going to grad school or not getting a PhD, then it is possible too. Freeman Dyson, C V Raman, J C Bose and M N Saha, all had no PhDs but did great work in theoretical physics. But if the question means entirely skipping the college & grad school, I say it is possible. First of all you should master the five basic subjects in theoretical physics: Mathematical PhysicsClassical MechanicsClassical ElectrodynamicsStatistical MechanicsQuantum Mechanics.After that depending on which direction you want to, you will have to study other subjects.  I will say a few more things about option (2) and (3). It is a lot easier today than ever before to become a competent theoretical physicist (among many other things) without attending a university, especially given that you can watch  great physics lectures online and listen to all the talks in big conferences and read the latest papers on arXiv.org without spending any money and without getting out of your room. If that is what you have in mind, here are the things to watch out for.  Although you can be a good self-taught theoretical physicist, if you don't attend a university, you will miss things like discussing with professors, sharing ideas with fellow students, making connections with others in the field.One doesn't have to be at the best universities to write a good paper in physics, but it can be very difficult to get any attention for your work if you are an \"independent researcher\". You can be easily dismissed as a crackpot. I don't remember reading any paper in Physical Review D written by someone (new) without any affiliation. If one is determined enough, these obstacles can be overcome, but I am sure you will be spending a lot of your time and talent to explain yourself than your research. I strongly discourage this route. If you still insist, here is the advice straight from the horse's mouth. Even if you attend the best university, you will have to do all the work yourself to understand the concepts. Sure, your professors and TAs guide you, but you have to sit and do the dirty job of calculating things and only then you learn, otherwise you just know nothing beyond the names of the topics. In that sense, any theoretical physicist worth his salt is self-taught!  ",
