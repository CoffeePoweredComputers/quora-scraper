Whereas it might be the case that a job of teacher looks more easy or respectable or facinating and comfortable to you. Fair enough go ahead. I just want to tell you being a teacher is one of greatest responsibility ever and greatest Honor. No matter who you teach or where you teach, if you can make a difference to even one life you have achieved more than you think you can. Hence if you feel like being a teacher. Just make sure you have full respect for this job and you do it with passion. Otherwise don't become a teacher. You can get any other job for sure. ",

The pay is horrible (downright disrespectful, actually), so if you do, make sure you either make the same, close, or can live without tens of thousands of annual income you might be used to having (assuming you don\u2019t have a spouse to pick up the slack). Or, be prepared to get supplemental pay by another means. Also, be prepared for classes, exams and certifications you have to pay for to become fully certified. It\u2019s truly a thankless job and requires people really in it for the love of it and the children \u2014 with the awesome schedule being the only non-financial perk! ",
