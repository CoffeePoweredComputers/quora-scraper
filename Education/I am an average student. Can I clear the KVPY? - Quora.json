Right?Okay now let me tell you a real story nowIt's about one of my friend , I do not want to disclose his name In my 10th standard I cleared NTSE but he couldn't He got less cgpa than me as wellNow in 11th preparation for JEE starts His rank in class 12-20My rank in class 2- 15Then comes KVPY 1His status - disqualifiedMy status - disqualifiedThen comes 11th boards (telangana boards)My percentage- 91.3His percentage- 98.1Now 12 starts My rank in class 15-30His rank in class 1- 7Then we get the second chance to write kvpyMy status- disqualifiedHis status - qualified Then comes 12th boardsMy percentage - 94%His percentage - 96 %Now JEEMy score - 165His acore- 268And now it's 12th of June JEE advanced results are out I got 15000 rank and he got 750 AIRHe'll get into some good IIT and I'm still figuring out the top 100 engineering colleges in India on Google So all I wanna say that he was an average guy initially But just by a lil dedication and perseverance he reached the pinnacle of his abilities So basically it's possible to crack kvpy even for a below average guy And the transition from 10th to 11th is great And these two years seperate every abilty of a person and provides you a rank of your own Where you stand in this crowd Sorry for such a long shit.Have a nice life. :) ",

I am not clear about what your definition of average is. If you're calling yourself average based on the numbers written in your marksheet, you're probably not thinking the right way and it doesn't make sense to me. KVPY is an exam where your concepts are judged and any hardworking/sincere student with clear concepts can clear it was long as he takes the thing seriously and gives in the amount of effort necessary. So, if you're ready to work hard enough, you can clear KVPY. I have seen some of my friends who were considered \u201caverage\u201d clear KVPY and studying in IISERs. So, all the best! ",
