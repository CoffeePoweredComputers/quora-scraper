            "answer_text": "There are plenty of websites like edX, Udemy, Udacity, Coursera, etc. that offer courses with certification and university affiliation. You could either directly visit these websites individually to search and compare courses, or you could visit lore.online to search and compare online learning options from various education providers. You can filter the learning options with the help of Lore's extensive filter list, e.g. as you're looking for courses that offer certification, you can use the certification filter to only view those courses. You can also filter based on how much experience you have, your budget, university affiliation, duration of the course, and user ratings. If you're the type that needs to refer to videos while learning, then Lore also shows relevant YouTube and Vimeo videos alongside the courses. You can also get recommendations based on your career interests, the skills you want to develop and a few other preferences. Hope this helps! ",
