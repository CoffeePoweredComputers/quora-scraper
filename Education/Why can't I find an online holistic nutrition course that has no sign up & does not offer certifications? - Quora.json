            "answer_text": "Nothing is free in this world. Most online course providers want you to signup to ensure that they could potentially up-sell to you sometime in the future even if the current course is offered for free. If you want quality, the least you can do is to give someone your time to enter your name and email. It is fair. You are of course free to search for nutrition related videos on youtube which do not require a signup but then again, do they have the quality you are looking for ? ",
