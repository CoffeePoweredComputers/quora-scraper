It has been four years since my kids have started attending school. And from the looks of things, they are having a great time at Hi-Tech. I am quite happy for them, as they are making noticeable progress each day.  Here are a few reasons why Hi-Tech does such a fantastic job doing. Hit-Tech offers an affordable fee structure and a well-realized curriculum that facilitates students\u2019 all-round development making it the best CBSE school in Secunderabad. Firstly I need to mention how excellent the faculty staff is. They are well-trained, compassionate, and flexible. From what I\u2019ve heard from my children, it seems like they are friendly as well. They also offer excellent amenities in a homely environment that allow students to reach their full potential. Academic facilities like the computer lab and science lab enable them to experiment with their learning, whereas sports facilities will allow them to build their physical strength. It\u2019s all about all-round, holistic development in Hi-Tech. The infrastructure is also great and provides an excellent learning atmosphere.

            "answer_text": "St. Michael\u2019s School. It\u2019s because they provide a holistic learning and also teach ethics, discipline at the same time. They teach life values to children which is a must nowadays for younger children. The best thing about the school is each and every child is taken care of. In my school days i remember when teacher asking any questions only the smarties could answer. The special ones would be left wandering when will their chance come to speak. But at Michael\u2019s each and every child is taken care of and all are equal in their teacher\u2019s eyes. Thank you Naina Mukherjee ",
