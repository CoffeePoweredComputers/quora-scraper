            "answer_text": "As a high school teacher, I see many students I think probably have ADHD. The problem is, I cannot diagnose and the student may have learned to cope by the time they get to me. All I can do is recommend to the diagnostician they take a look at the student and see if something needs to be done. If the student is not struggling in school, then they diagnostician cannot do anything either. In order for us to do something to help a student with a learning disability, the student must first test for the disability and have the disability negatively impact their life. If they have more or less learned to cope, we cannot do anything at all. So I often suspect a student has something like ADHD, but often am unable to do anything. ",

            "answer_text": "I see a number of excellent answers and cannot add to them except to relate my experience with a foster child who came to me with severe ADHD. He was given imipramine, an antidepressant which has relatively few side effects and which is used also to treat ADHD (note: this was a long time ago and the use f imipramine may no longer be approved or appropriate\u2026doesn\u2019t change the basic message though). Since some feel use of drugs is controversial or negative i want to point out that with this boy the effect of the drugs was very positive, both on his general behavior and on his self-esteem. With the drug he was much more able to focus and to control his behavior. The result of that was that he felt far better about himself and was able to perform even better. While I think it\u2019s wise for parents to be cautious about use of medication especially to be sure of the diagnosis, it\u2019s not rocket science; qualified professionals can usually tell with a high degree of accuracy if a child has ADHD; medication is a bit tricky in that there are a variety of choices and doses and it is a bit of experimentation to find the right drug and dosage. Nevertheless, as I hope my experience shows, using meds in treating this condition can be very positive for the child. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer pertains to the US. A regular classroom teacher may track behavior to have justification to issue a referral to start the evaluation process. Once the evaluation process is started parents must give permission for an assessment to begin. An assessment will involve tracking behavior and batteries of diagnostic tests for IQ and approximate grade levels of reading and math abilities. After the assessment has been completed a meeting will occur. During this meeting, you will be part of what is known as an evaluation as to whether you qualify for special education. If it is found you qualify for services you will given an IEP and given accommodations and modifications to help you succeed. If you are concerned you should research the process and have a conversation with your teachers and parents. The process is pretty transparent and you should be involved. Best of luck. If you are involved in this process you should research evaluations and IEP\u2019s for yourself. ",

What we do is we talk to the parents about what we observe in the classroom, without trying to give them advice about what they should do. We are not psychologists/psychiatrists, so we can\u2019t diagnose or tell the parents what our \u201cdiagnosis\u201d would be\u2026we just say what we observe and let the parents go from there. But if a parent has questions, I\u2019ll answer them. If they say, \u201cDo you think my child has ADHD?\u201d I\u2019ll say something like \u201cI am not qualified to make that diagnosis. You\u2019d have to make an appointment with a doctor to find that out. But this is what I do notice in the classroom\u2026and some of the behaviors match some symptoms of a child with ADHD.\u201d That\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll ever go. ",

Of course, I also discuss my concerns with parents. I encourage them to speak to their pediatrician so that we can have more than one expert\u2019s opinion. I try to accommodate the student using the strategies I know can help students with ADHD like sitting them closer to me/away from distractions, allowing them time to move around (something I incorporate with all my kids - stretch break), I try to ignore behaviors that aren't serious, I figure out the things they like and use that to motivate desired behaviors ",

Since they are in university and no longer minors, if I feel their grades are suffering AND if they come to my office hours about their grades, I will suggest they MIGHT look into it. I remind them that I am not a doctor or a psychologist who would have to formally diagnose them. I then let them know that I have ADHD and was not diagnosed until I was in my 30s. I also let them know that it is not bad, it is just understanding that you are motivated differently, you might think differently, and you might be more creative. ",
