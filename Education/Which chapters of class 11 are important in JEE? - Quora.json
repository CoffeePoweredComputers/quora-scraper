            "answer_text": "Class 11: Subject Wise Important Chapters For JEE Main 2020 Class 11 Subject Wise important Chapter For JEE Main: JEE Main is an all India common engineering entrance examination and one of the most competitive undergraduate exams. While it is deemed to be one of the toughest entrance exams to crack, it is not quite difficult to figure out its important chapters. Unlike scoring 90+ in other board exams is mandatory to get into a good college, JEE Main, on the other hand, requires a candidate to score close to 50% to get into the best institute. To fetch a 50% score in JEE Main, it is highly important for a candidate to focus mainly on those topics that offer high weightage, low effort and high weightage, high effort. Along with the current chapter of class 12 you also have the task to revise the chapters of class 11. You may be wondering which are the class 11 important chapters for JEE Main 2019 in order to revise quickly. A solid data-based study and research have led to helpful conclusions and here they are. In this post, we bring to you the important chapters for the JEE Main from Class 11 syllabus. Important chapters for JEE Main 2019 from Class 11 syllabus I have divided the chapters based on the ratio of how much \u2018weightage\u2019 against how much input (the effort to learn and understand) they require. Chapterwise Weightage Categorisation Note: The above said two sections like- Low Weightage, Low Effort, and Low Weightage, High Effort are not of much importance. Students can chuck these two parameters and rather focus on High Weightage, Low Effort, and High Weightage, High Effort to reach their desired goal. Easy Chapters \u2013 High Weightage, Low Effort These are the most important group of chapters. They are a must for every student to complete thoroughly. It is advisable to start with these chapters as they are of high weightage as well as easy to study. You can focus on these particular chapters of the following subjects to enhance your preparation: 1.Physics Fluid DynamicsUnits and DimensionSurface Tension2.Chemistry Chemical BondingAtomic StructureHydrocarbonsMathematics Set Theory and RelationMathematical ReasoningStatisticsTough Chapters \u2013 High Weightage, High Effort These chapters are tough but cannot be ignored because of their high weightage. After the easy chapters, these should be next on the list for students. An effort has to be made in order to crack these chapters. Paying attention to the below-mentioned chapters will help you sail through the tough chapters: Physics Rotational MotionExperimental Physics and InstrumentsCenter of Mass and Conservation of MomentumChemistry ThermodynamicsMole ConceptGeneral Organic ChemistryGaseous StateMathematics CircleParabolaPermutation and CombinationSequence and SeriesI hope this sheds some light on how to crack the JEE Main and Advanced by brushing up the Class 11 syllabus. Best of luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to prepare for JEE is by working smart and focusing on what is important. While it is important to cover strong concepts in all the chapters as they are interrelated more often than not, questions are a combination of more than one chapters and you will waste your time if you\u2019re proficient in only one of them. In short, basics of each and every chapter should be understood and learned for best results.  That being said, the most important chapters for class 11 in terms of weightage in JEE as per previous years\u2019 trends are listed here: PHYSICS: \u2022\tKinematics \u2022\tLaws of Motion \u2022\tWork, Power and Energy \u2022\tRotational Motion \u2022\tThermodynamics \u2022\tWaves and Sound \u2022\tSimple Harmonic Motion  CHEMISTRY: \u2022\tChemical Bonding \u2022\tAtomic Structure \u2022\tEquilibrium (Chemical and Ionic) \u2022\tChemical Thermodynamics \u2022\tS-block elements \u2022\tHydrocarbons  MATHEMATICS: \u2022\tTrigonometry \u2022\tSequences and Series \u2022\tComplex numbers \u2022\tPermutations and Combinations \u2022\tCoordinate Geometry (Circle, Parabola, Ellipse, Hyperbola) \u2022\tBinomial Theorem  Some chapters like Thermodynamics become even more important as they overlap in both Chemistry and Physics. Many of these chapters make the basis for chapters in 12th class, like Permutations for Probability. You can always use Toppr, if you\u2019re looking for previous year papers, practice questions, test series or even a platform to solve your doubts instantly. Hope this helps. Good Luck! ",
