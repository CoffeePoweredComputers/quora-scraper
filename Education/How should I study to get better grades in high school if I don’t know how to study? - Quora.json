            "answer_text": "First of all, you have to be SMART. What you have to realize is that everyone in life expects results. Parents, professors, managers, and bosses \u2013 everyone wants you to deliver results. Hard truth I had to learn to pursue better grades is that the educational process itself doesn\u2019t matter. Cheat the test and get an A. Cram all night, get a bunch of dumb questions and please have your C+. I studied really hard for the whole week/month/term/year! No one cares, the result is not there, catch a\u2019 later. To get the result, I eventually concluded that I must be SMART. What does it mean?  Study like you mean it. I never treat studies haphazardly. If I\u2019m to produce an essay or learn certain material, I roll up the sleeves, put any distractions aside and just do it. Friend calls? Will call back later. Fire in the building? Doesn\u2019t matter, got to study. Knowledge for me, grades for teachers. Understand this and you\u2019re good to go. Decide on your learning type. There\u2019re \u201clisteners,\u201d those who's great at perceiving information by ear, e.g. in an auditorium during a lecture or while doing listening. There\u2019re also \u201cvisuals,\u201d those who learn best with a textbook in front of them. The more charts and diagrams to it, the better. Finally, there\u2019re \u201cpracticals,\u201d those who like me prefer the hands-on approach, learning in the process of doing something. Which type of learners do you belong to? Stick to it and learning the college program will become much easier. Master time-management. Juggling several tasks effectively and managing time properly is the key to securing results in college. Laziness is off the table. I\u2019ve got myself a girlfriend, got a part-time job, got my share of partying with hommies, and I still have enough time to study. So, your argument of starting on essays at the eleventh hour is irrelevant. Don\u2019t even want to hear of any lame excuses a lazy bone reproduces! Want to get better grades? Start from doing assigned papers at a proper time. You don\u2019t have to \u201cknow how to study\u201d to do that. Thank me later.  Do whatever it takes. Professors never cut me any slack, perhaps that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have any pink shades on my eyes. They want a great paper, I provide. How do I provide? It depends. I\u2019m a practical guy, so when a composition is due, I consider the options. Write the thing myself or delegate to a writing service. To add the feel of completeness to a paper, I forward the texts for professional editing, where a subject-relevant writer tailors the draft to perfection. Costs me quite a dime, totally worth it though. Cheating? Please\u2026 Grow up already; you\u2019re in college! Sleep on it. Writing essays, I found out that proofreading is rather key. To improve quality of compositions, meaning better grades, all I had to do was sleep on papers and commence proofreading the next day. With a fresh head on your shoulders, there\u2019ll be plenty of errors and typos omitted the previous day. Trust me on that; it\u2019s where a chasm of difference between an A+ and B paper lies. Hope you\u2019ll find these tips useful! Some might sound beat up, but these are usually the essentials that make up the foundation of effective studying. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Learning how to study is very crucial to retention and mastery. The first thing you need to do is figure out what your learning style may be. You could be visual, auditory or hands-on. Take this quiz to tell you what your learnng style is: What's Your Learning Style? 20 Questions Then based off of them if you are Auditory learners: tend to have incredible memories for past conversations (such as jokes).have a great memory for music and lyrics.enjoy discussions, debates, and talking to others.enjoy listening to music, and sing/hum/whistle to themselves.They prefer to give oral presentations over written reports (although this also has a lot to do with confidence!).may read slowly.may have difficulty interpreting complicated graphs, maps or diagrams.Study Tips for Auditory Learners Auditory learners should try to incorporate study techniques that have them either listening to information and repeating it out loud. Ask questions All auditory learners should aim to ask questions during a lesson. Even a simple question will greatly increase information retention. This way, their teacher will put an idea into words, or paraphrase what they\u2019ve been saying. Watch videos This is another thing that Auditory learners can do during their study periods. The Khan Academy website is a great place for this. The site currently has over 1800 videos (all produced by one very smart guy with 4 university degrees, whom Bill Gates\u2019 professed as his favourite teacher!) predominantly science and maths focussed. YouTube is another website that has hundreds of educational videos. But be careful \u2013 it\u2019s also one of the most powerful procrastination tools in the world! Use word association Word association can be a great way to learn facts and lines. Auditory learners make better connections when facts can be repeated out loud \u2013 especially when in a memorable fashion. Mnemonic devices are a great way to help remember facts. Repeat aloud Auditory learners can benefit from repeating information out loud to themselves. Even better than pure repetition would be to paraphrase, or pick out the main points of what they\u2019ve just learnt and say it to themselves. Participate in discussions Unfortunately discussion groups at high school can be quite distracting, meaning they aren\u2019t a normal part of classroom life. But you can talk to your child about what they\u2019ve learnt today. If you don\u2019t understand it \u2013 even better! Teaching is the best way to learn! Visual learners: loves pictures and diagrams.is good at reading maps and charts.create strong pictures in their minds when they read.like bright colours (and fashions).may have to think for a bit to process a speech or lecture.Study Tips for Visual Learners Visual Learners should try to make use of diagrams and charts while they study. This is becoming easier as there is now so much educational material put in these formats. Use highlighters Visual Learners love using highlighters. They make things bright and colourful while making the important bits stand out. When making their own notes they should develop their own highlighting system. Consistently highlighting certain types of facts in predefined colours will help Visual Learners sort out where facts sit in their heads. Use flash cards While flash cards are a fantastic learning technique for Kinaesthetic Learners, they can also be a great way for Visual Learners to study. They are particularly effective if used with diagrams or charts. E.g. What is this part of a cell called, what does it do? What does a graph that looks like this mean? Who is this, when was she born and what did she do? Replace words with symbols or initials This simple tip can help speed up the process of making study notes. It also gets Visual Learners to associate symbols with concepts, rather than words \u2013 increasing the strength of association. Finally , Kinesthetic learners: are good with their hands. They enjoy building models and putting things together (or breaking them!)are good at remembering things they\u2019ve actually done before. E.g. cooking meals, putting together computers, jigsaw puzzles.enjoy active learning at school, such as PE and science experiments.enjoy playing sport.like adventure books and movies.become fidgety when sitting for a long period of time.do not tend to have great handwriting or spelling.Use flash cards Flash cards make kinesthetic learners turn simple recall into a game. This makes them perfect for kinesthetic learners. Simply write a question or topic suggestion on one side of a card, and the answer or a list of details they should remember on the other side. Study in short blocks Kinesthetic learners tend to have a relatively short attention span when they\u2019re studying. But this doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be doing just as much study as everyone else. They should break their study up into shorter periods, but also take shorter breaks. Forcing a kinesthetic learner to study for an hour at a time can be counter-productive. Regular 5 minute breaks can often be all they need to help them study far more. Use plenty of examples when writing study notes Many main points and concepts can be demonstrated with examples. Kinesthetic learners tend to make better associations with the examples than just the plain facts. For example, most science concepts can be backed up with specific examples. E.g. instead of just remembering the formula, F = m \u00d7 a, you can think of a cellphone being dropped from a second story balcony, and how force, mass, and acceleration are related. (The more personal or relatable to their everyday life the better) Many of the arts subjects include many examples and case studies. Try and get your child to think of these \u2018situations\u2019, not just the plain facts. Study with other people Kinesthetic learners enjoy discussion. Talking about what they\u2019ve learnt is often a great way to consolidate what they\u2019ve learnt. This tip is suggested with caution! This is because students often use \u2018study groups\u2019 as a way to hang out outside of school. As a parent, you could try and have a discussion with your child about what they\u2019ve learnt. Combining this with flash cards is a perfect way for parents to contribute to their child\u2019s study. Do something while you study Tap a pencil, squeeze a stress ball, or do something to occupy the want to do something with their hands without becoming a distraction. Just make sure that this doesn\u2019t become a distraction itself! Citation: http://www.thestudygurus.com I hope this helps. ",
