            "answer_text": "While the academic screamers hold their pity party and run around acting like chickens with their heads cut off, the whole stinking edifice of modern higher education is burning down around them. What is happening is a panic that isn\u2019t going to end well for modern higher education. Every day these schools do not reopen is another nail in their coffin. You see modern higher education is obsolete. I will illustrate with my sister-in-law. She lives in West Virginia. She teaches at the University of Kiev in Ukraine. Modern Colleges have almost no reason to exist. They are too expensive. They are inefficient and they are not producing results for their victims. (Graduates) This issue of university housing is serious because the colleges themselves are going out of business. The dormitories will not remain long part of a closed University or College. In the USA probably 50% of private colleges will never reopen after this. If the miss fall reopening the number may reach toward 100%. Of the public Colleges and Universities if they miss Fall opening they too will probably be facing 50% or more closures. If they miss opening this entire year they are gone forever. This is a system that for at least 20 years has had no reason to exist in the real world. The only reason these institutions have existed in recent years is the \u201csocial\u201d life and the football teams or other sports teams. It was just a way for parents to politely kick non-performing kids out of the house to transition them to sink or swim on their own and to get sex. Sorry if I just stripped these institutions to the bone but they deserve it for all of the lives they have destroyed. I will say that there some topics that are warranted for such education. These include study of \u201cLab\u201d or hands on type courses such as medicine. The purpose of these institutions to do this requires probably 10% as much cost and space as it is taking. ",

            "answer_text": "Schools are in the process of working this out. Some students were allowed to stay on campus when the schools shut down a couple of months ago\u2014particularly international students who couldn\u2019t go home. They were placed in individual rooms and more or less sequestered. It was not a nice living situation. The question of whether campus housing will allow roommates or suitemates in the fall is still up in the air. This is a big problem, because restricting students to one to a room or suite effectively reduces the housing supply on campus. It would be best to check with the individual school to find out what they have decided. ",
