            "answer_text": "You\u2019re either a morning person, or a night-owl. At least that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been led to believe. When it comes to learning, what\u2019s the best time to study? And what does science have to say about it?  Science says that our cycles of alertness and focus are governed by Circadian rhythms. They are what forms our 24-hour sleep/wake cycle that then drives when we are hungry, when we are tired and even when we undertake activities such as work and study. But that is just the beginning of the story. There are a wide variety of lifestyle factors that influence when the best study time is for each individual person. Benefits of studying by day It\u2019s not hard to argue that studying during the day is a good choice. After all, we are refreshed in the morning after a good night\u2019s sleep and should have just had an energy-filled breakfast that will sustain us well in to the day.  During the day you are less likely to require indoor lighting. Sunlight is actually good for your eyes. It provides just the right spectrum of light to maintain optimal eyesight and actually works with the pituitary gland to make you alert and awake. Indoor lighting has been shown to interrupt the sleep cycle and most sleep doctors recommend that you expose yourself to as little artificial light at night as possible at night, including TV, computer and smartphone screens. The world as we know it tends to operate during \u201cbusiness hours.\u201d This includes libraries, shops and Officeworks. Studying during daylight hours means that you can access businesses and libraries that are open 9am to 5pm, and get those odds and ends that may not be as available in the evenings. But wait! I\u2019m a night-owl! Like many students, you may be better suited to studying at night. And there are various reasons why night time is the best time to study for some.  The most obvious advantage of studying at night is the abundance of peace and quiet you have. Night time is when people are more relaxed, quiet and contemplative. That environment can be exactly what some people need to get in to the right head-space for study. There are many anecdotal stories of the creative genius that is unlocked late at night. If you find that you can\u2019t get a breakthrough on a project during the day, taking a look at night means you are literally looking at the problem with a different set of eyes. The eyes and brain work differently at night. Many authors, songwriters and scientists prefer to work at night because they feel that they tend to think more \u201coutside the box\u201d after-hours. With the pressures of the daytime behind them, many feel that their mind is free to wander through more alternatives at night. And this can be useful for assessment-writing or working on creative pursuits. How to get the most out of night study The great risk with studying at night is that you may lose track of time and end up sleeping less. And this is the great enemy of learning. A strong routine complete with deadlines on when you stop studying and start sleeping means you aren\u2019t breaking those Circadian rhythms that govern your body\u2019s patterns. And then there\u2019s the distractions that can pop up at night. Especially if you have trouble leaving the TV off, the phone on silent and the X-Box out of sight.  Caffeine is another temptation with night study. As tiredness starts to kick in, the temptation to put on the kettle or pop out to grab a cappuccino can be very real. With caffeine taking up to 4 hours to cycle out of the body, you might be giving yourself a quick hit of focus and alertness, but you are probably going to have trouble getting to sleep later. What does the science say? Whilst Circadian rhythms are different for everyone, there are patterns that indicate that there is such a thing as a \u201cmorning person\u201d or a \u201cnight-owl.\u201d The typical morning person will find that they are rearing to go as early as 7am. That burst of energy will last until around 10am when they need a rest. Then they will burst again until around 3pm when they start to wind down.  The \u201cnight-owl\u201d tends to be the complete opposite. They will be sluggish until around midday when they have their first burst of energy. This will last until 3pm when they will have their second burst that will last until 7pm. From there, they will start winding down around 10pm and go quickly from activity to sleep. In addition, studies have found the younger students tend to be better suited to study at night than older students. From about 30 onwards, there is a proven switch to a desire to study by day. In fact, only around 2% of students over 30 find that studying at night works for them. 80% of them would rather study in the morning.  With younger students there is a tendency to go out at night, be around bright lights and use backlit screens such as televisions, smartphones and computer screens. All those things can interfere with the night-time production of melatonin, leading to sensory arousal being greater at night. So when is it best to study? It all depends on your lifestyle. Younger people with a routine that sees them more active at night will find that studying at night comes more naturally to them. If you\u2019re an adult and re-entering study after a long time away, you\u2019ll find that daytimes are far better suited as you are used to working or being active during the day. The important factor for everyone is making sure you are getting enough sleep. So whether you\u2019re a morning person or a night-owl, there\u2019s nothing stopping you from taking on study in your own time and at your own pace right now. Are you ready to change your life? Whether you\u2019re a morning or a night person, Open Colleges\u2019 flexible online study means that you can study when you want, where you want. There are no deadlines and no classrooms, so you can fit study around your life. Source - Best ways to study: When is the best time to study and why? I hope it helps\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "As early as you can, in the morning, before you do anything else. Why? Because you have the most willpower and are the least distracted in the morning. Not everyone is a morning person. I certainly was not built that way. But if you develop the discipline, you can make yourself wake up earlier. I\u2019m not saying you have to wake up at 4am every day. But you can make the choice to wake up earlier than you normally would so you can schedule an hour or two to get some work done in the morning. You may not realistically have the time to get everything done in the morning. But if you have to choose, do your least favorite task. The task you tend to avoid doing. In the productivity sphere this is called \u201ceating the frog\u201d. Just get it over with and you can focus on more pleasant tasks later! Alternatively, between classes during the day. Unless you\u2019re in high school or got stuck in a tight schedule, you most likely have time between your classes where there\u2019s nothing to do. Perfect! You\u2019re already on campus, so why not get some studying done so you won\u2019t have to later? Pick a place where you can study quietly on campus that\u2019s close enough to your classes so you\u2019re not running around. Then study there. Every day. You might have to pick a different time/place depending on your schedule that day, but be consistent with this. I recommend explicitly scheduling it on your calendar. Treat it like a study hall. Give it the same seriousness as you do attending lecture (which hopefully is serious). Really can\u2019t do the other two? Do it right after classes. While you still have momentum from being in class, go right to the library (or wherever else you study) and start right away. Don\u2019t take a break if you can help it. Just get it done. If you absolutely must go home after class, then do your best to just grab a snack and start working. The more break time you take after your classes, the less motivated you\u2019ll be to study. So start ASAP. Then you can just chill later. You already finished your work. No worries. Night owls, beware. The last option is, obviously, late at night. This option will mean less distraction in the sense that most people are sleeping. So you have that going for you. But the danger is that you are less likely to get the sleep you need. Because procrastinating means you\u2019re doing work at the last minute. You might not get enough sleep after you finished if you even get it finished at all. A lot of engineering students have pride for getting things done at the last minute. And they\u2019re foolish. You might think you\u2019re doing your best work when you\u2019re driven my adrenaline. But never have I ever seen a fellow student do better work than me when he waits until the night before it\u2019s due to scrawl an answer on the page. Don\u2019t let those assholes fool you. They\u2019re idiots. Not only does doing last-minute work mean lower quality work, you\u2019re also cramming, meaning you\u2019ll have to study harder for the next exam. And, worst of all, consistently getting too little sleep will actually cause permanent brain damage.  Some of it is personal preference, surely. Choose whatever works best with your schedule and personality. Good luck this semester! ",
