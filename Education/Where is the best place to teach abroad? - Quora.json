The JET programme in Japan is well paid, lets you live somewhere interesting, and has a relatively light workload. You might find that it doesn't test your teaching skills, however. The international schools are also good, but here you'll need to decide where you want to live. And there's a danger of ghettoization with these sorts of jobs - you really have to work to stay out of the foreigner clique. That's not bad, just something to be aware of. Since you note you might want to continue your studies, Europe is an obvious place, however, competition is tighter. Asia is a bit more wild-west, as is Africa, with some exceptions.

There are many expats living there so you\u2019ll have a community from Day 1. The job is very easy and fun (unlike in other countries like China and Japan), and it\u2019s absolutely stunning.
