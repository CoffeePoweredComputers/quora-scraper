            "answer_text": "Learning a foreign language to the point that you can function independently in that language is nothing like an intellectual task such as learning philosophy, a natural science, history, or most non-foreign language courses is school. There are grammatical rules to be sure, but somehow babies learn their native language without textbooks teaching grammatical rules. Sometimes grammar rules are presented in a confusing manner. An alternative method would be to see short sentences and phrases that illustrate the rule. That was the method I used back when I was too young to understand the explanations. Learning to function in a foreign language is more like learning to play a sport or a musical instrument in that you are acquiring a new habit. As such it requires practice to the point that you are comfortable in it. Six days of one-half hour sessions per day will prove to be far better than three hours one day a week. It helps tremendously to have some audio recordings available so that you can hear the sounds of the language. If you have no native speakers available or if money is a problem, either inexpensive recordings or even using a program such as Google Translate is better than nothing.Repeated listening is needed to get your ears used to hearing the language. Repeated watching of foreign films would be recommended once you have reached an intermediate level of ability. Do not worry if you do not understand much at first. This is because many common idioms in the language are never found in textbooks and dictionaries. As for the course itself, the learning should be tailored to specific social experiences that you are likely to encounter. This can be done in units and subunits (lessons) that you set up. Limit your acquisition of grammar to only those rules that are needed to achieve the social task being learned. In the beginning, do not overload yourself with too much vocabulary. You can always add vocabulary later when you need it. It is critical that you practice what you are learning until you feel fluent in achieving each task. Remember, you are acquiring a habit. From this point on, you will see me refer to \u201cunit\u201d which can consist of more than one lesson. The term \u201cunit\u201d refers to a specific social situation. Within each unit you could set up several lessons, each of which address a specific social task. For example, in the first unit, you would learn specific phrases for expressing simple greetings and good byes. Included would also be such expressions for \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d. In the second unit you would learn to ask and identify yourself and other people. Keep it simple. Sentences and phrases such as \u2018I am John Brown.\u201d and \u201cThis is my friend, Phillip.\u201d are typical of this unit. Family relationship terms probably could be limited to immediate family and friends for now. In the third unit you would learn to ask and identify several common objects seen in a room or classroom, such as \u201ctable\u201d, \u201cchair\u201d, \u201cbook\u201d \u201cpen\u201d etc. Knowledge of these items will be useful in attacking the next few units. This is not the place to overload yourself with too much vocabulary. At most, eight to ten objects per lesson are enough. Your primary task here is to acquire a habit by practicing the simple sentences and phrases needed to achieve this task. As you practice, the vocabulary will be internalized and your fluency in this task will be achieved. In the fourth unit, you will learn to ask and give simple descriptions of people and objects. This is a good time to introduce basic colors and simple adjectives such as \u201ctall\u201d, \u201cshort\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d, \u201cboring\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d etc. You can break up this unit into separate lessons, people, things and maybe even a few places. Do not overload yourself with too much vocabulary in each lesson. Focus on acquiring the fluency needed for this task through practice. In the fifth unit, you will teach yourself to ask and tell where something is located. Now you have a chance to practice again the vocabulary learned in the second unit. Here you are learning expressions such as \u201cis in front of the table\u201d, \u201con the table\u201d, \u201cunder the table\u201d etc. In separate subunits or lessons you can add the names of a few places in town for expressions such as \u201cnext to the bank\u201d, \u201cacross from the restaurant\u201d etc. Practice what you are learning until you feel fluent in achieving this task. You might even ask where a city is located, but here, keep it simple. An example to be used would be: \u201cWhere is Paris?\u201d - \u201cParis is in France.\u201d Practice what you are learning until you feel fluent in achieving this task. Practice what you are learning until you feel fluent in achieving this task. In the sixth unit, you can learn how to ask and tell where someone is going. You could learn the names of common rooms of the house, perhaps a few more places in town. Here you can include rooms, the schools, stores etc. Feel free to include verbal phrases such as walking to, running to etc. In the seventh unit you learn to ask and tell what someone is doing. Here you restrict yourself to simple expressions such as taking, putting, looking at, drinking coffee, eating an apple, sitting, standing etc. Practice what you are learning until you feel fluent in achieving this task. Practice what you are learning until you feel fluent in achieving this task. In the eighth unit you can ask and tell how something is done. Sentences such as \u201cHow do you get to work/school etc.?\u201d and \u201cI write with my hand/with a pen etc.\u201d \u201cI walk to school. I ride to work. These types of simple sentences are typical of this task. Subsequent units and lessons can deal with when something happens and why something happens. Later units and lessons can also cover topic like \u201cgiving\u201d, \u201cteaching\u201d and \u201cshowing\u201d. Other separate units can be added for \u201ccounting things\u201d, \u201cshopping in the grocery store\u201d, \u201cgoing to a post office\u201d, \u201ceating in a restaurant\u201d, \u201cbuying clothes\u201d etc. By now you should have a feel for how to approach learning a new language.

            "answer_text": "Since this question is quite general in nature, there are a lot of areas that must be covered in the answer, so please bear with the length of this answer. To begin with languages themselves are complex because of all the areas involved in learning it. A language is our basic method of communication and a language has to accommodate a great many features to support our means of communication and expression of ideas. Basically, to learn a language and be fluent in it you need to be competent in four languages skills; reading, listening (understanding what is being said), writing and speaking. Reading and listening are the passive language skills and speaking and writing are the active ones. To fully learn a language means to learn all four skills equally well. Firstly to learn any language, the most important tool is practice. Without practicing frequently it is difficult to learn a new language. To begin the learning process, firstly you need to determine which type of learner you are. If you are a visual learner, you\u2019ll learn faster watching videos of the language\u2019s syntax and word pronunciation etc. If you are a auditory learner you\u2019d be better of listening to the language and learning. If you\u2019ve previously learned a language, you can use experience of how you learnt that language and try to apply it when learning a new language. However it is to be kept in mind that depending on how hard a language is, the time needed to learn it and the level of fluency you achieve in that time will differ. One of the best ways to learn a new language is to interact with a native speaker of that language. They are a great asset when it comes to the speaking and listening skills as native speakers know the exact pronunciations of words. Surround yourself with that language as much as possible. To gather the basics of the language such as the alphabet and syntax, you can take up many online courses, some of them which are free, or you can attend classes. Once you\u2019ve got the basics in mind, interact with that language as often as you can. Read books from that language (start with small books before advancing on to harder ones), watch TV shows, practice speaking and communicate with any of your friends who can speak that language. Ask for help when you need it. There will be some aspects of learning the language where you will need help indefinitely. Do not be afraid to ask and inform your close friends and family that you are taking up this endeavor. They will surely assist you in every way possible. Paying a visit to the country in which this language is native can also help you to learn the language. Culture and language are deeply interwoven and getting to know the local culture and history may also further help you to learn the language. Practice is the key to learning any language. Practice all skills as frequently as possible. Daily practice will definitely go a long way in helping you learn the language.
