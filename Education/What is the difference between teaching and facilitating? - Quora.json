            "answer_text": "When you are teaching, you are disseminating information to students, but you are not necessarily interested in helping them use the information you teach them, not apply it to real life situations. Facilitative learning requires a few things: Students should know up front the usefulness of what they learn.They should be given practice in applying the principles of what they learn.They should be shown what it will take to learn the material being taught to them.They should be encouraged to ask questions on what they don't understand and be given clear and precise answers that lead them to a good understanding of whst's being learned.When these things are present, student learning becomes easier. It's more work for the teacher but student learning becomes easier. ",
