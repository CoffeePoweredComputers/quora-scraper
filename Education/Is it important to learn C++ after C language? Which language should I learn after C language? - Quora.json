            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not absolutely necessary. But it is a logical step and I would recommend it. When you learn C++, you\u2019ll know Object Oriented Programming very well. And the OOP paradigm is probably the most used programming approach there is. It\u2019ll be easy for you to understand and learn any other OO programming language in existence after C++. Last but not least, C++ is a very good language. But beware; C is a simple language, you can learn it relatively quickly. C++ is much more complex; properly learning it and gaining experience is much harder and takes years. If you\u2019re looking for something you\u2019ll learn more easily (namely for OOP), languages like Python or perhaps Java might be a better choice. ",

            "answer_text": "learn C++.Most of the times questioners knows the right answer already he just need a little support for realizing itif you already know C, C++ would be easy. it will help you know the concepts of classes and object oriented programming. while syntax remaining somewhat similar to C. if you go for java or python you would miss out some serious concepts that will later haunt you when programming. pointers for example, you need to know what pointers are. java is gonna make this all abstract . you will never know when you are using pointers.Also about what the fk is going on when someone is making a function of an inner class which exists inside paranthesis of another function.you know something like functon (class { anotherfunction ();}); these concepts are hard to follow along after learning just C.rather just go with C++ than try out C# its much more clean in my opinion. but DO GO FOR C++ . Dont need to master it.Let Java/C# be after C++ and python after that.  Javascript has no point unless you know html and css, so learn html and css before javascript and after learning javascript learn php and asp .net and all good. ",
