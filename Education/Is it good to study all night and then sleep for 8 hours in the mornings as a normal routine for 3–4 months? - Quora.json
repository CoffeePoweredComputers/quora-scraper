            "answer_text": "You will face the same mental lag time as the night shift (so-called Graveyard Shift) workers.  You might need a mild seditive to effect changes to your internal (circadian) clock, but most people can slowly adapt. \"In 2001, scientists at the University of Utah discovered the first human clock gene. They found it while studying a rare inherited disorder that makes people fall asleep early and wake spontaneously hours before dawn. Clock genes normally keep us awake during the day and asleep at night. But this clock gene is altered in a way that disrupts the normal sleep cycle.This inherited sleep pattern, known as \"familial advanced sleep phase syndrome\" (FASPS), has been linked to a variation in the hPer2 gene. People with FASPs are \"morning larks\" who usually get sleepy by 7 pm and wake up around 2 am. Another sleep condition, called \"delayed sleep-phase syndrome,\" has the opposite effect, turning people who have it into extreme night owls. They fall asleep very late and have trouble waking up in the morning. Delayed sleep-phase syndrome has been linked to a variation in the hPer3 gene. Any student who has studied during an \"all-nighter\" knows the circadian clock isn't the only sleep influencer. Our need for sleep also plays a role. When rats are awake and vigilant, their brain's master clock is more active. When rats are deprived of sleep, their master-clock doesn't respond normally. Sunlight resets the internal biological clock every day, keeping it synchronized with a 24-hour day.  If you lived in an underground bunker under constant artificial light, you would continue to follow an approximately 24-hour sleep-wake pattern, but because it is not exactly 24 hours long, your cycle would slowly get out of phase with actual daytime and nighttime. Air travel to a distant time zone can also disrupt normal cycles. The resulting jet lag is both a disconnect between local time and your body's time, and a disconnect between your brain's master clock and local clocks in tissues throughout your body. Once you arrive at your destination, the change in daylight hours will \"entrain\" or reset your internal clock, but it will take a few days to get rid of the jet lag.\" Courtesy of    learn.genetics.utah.edu      ",

            "answer_text": "\"Good\" is relative. I pulled many all-nighters in college and it was often the only way I managed to get papers written. My college roommate went to bed at 10pm every night, got all his homework done 2 days early, and made better grades than me. I don't know how he did it, but what worked for him apparently did not work for me. Since you're asking about study schedule, rather than \"staying up all night\" binge studying sessions, I would say that it's a trade-off. The advantage of studying at night is going to be fewer distractions and reduced social activity. (This is also why people go to the library to study.) The disadvantage is that you're not on the same schedule as everyone else. If you're in school, you'll miss classes or attend tired, and everything will be out-of-sync with the collective educational rhythm. You'll also be sleeping during the day, which is less \"restful\" (more light and noise) than sleeping at night. Regarding \"binge studying\" at night (which I originally thought was the question), that is another trade-off: the elimination of distractions and the deadline of wanting to get to sleep creates focus, while working tired reduces focus. The best pattern generally is whatever keeps you synchronized with the academic system and studying while rested and healthy. However if you are a highly distractible person who is more effective at night, you might need to make trade-offs between two less-than-ideal options. ",
