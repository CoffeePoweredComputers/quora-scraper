            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure how to answer this question. Basically, one \u201cgets a degree\u201d by completing the requirements for it through attendance at an accredited institution. And in order to do that, one must apply, register, attend, maintain a passing GPA, and finally graduate. If you\u2019re working at a medium to large sized company, look into tuition reimbursement and company benefits for attending college. If you\u2019re in the military, look into the GI Bill and veterans benefits (or for attending school while serving). The rest of the answer is really up to you. It depends on your area of interest, what your vision is for your career, and where you want to go. I cannot tell you that. Original question: How should I get my degree? ",
