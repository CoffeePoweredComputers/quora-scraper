            "answer_text": "In the US the term college seems to be used fairly synonymously with university level education, whereas in the UK it tends to suggest something for 16\u201318 year olds, or delivering this level of qualification to adult learners. There are separate individual uses. For example Imperial College London, was formerly a section of the University of London, but from 2007 is an independent university. Students at Oxford and Cambridge belong to individual constituent colleges. However all of these students would speak about being at university, not being at college. Some history In the UK compulsory full-time education was formerly to the age of 16. Most pupils would leave to get work, some would stay on to study till 18 for higher qualifications, known as A (for Advanced) Levels, which are required for university entry. There were 5 years of secondary school before this, so the extra years are called sixth form. Increasingly these two years are spent in what is called Sixth Form College. It may be part of a large school or a separate institution serving an area. Some secondary schools do not have a sixth form, and those that do (high schools) may not have enough pupils to justify staff to teach a particular A level, so pupils may go to the Sixth Form College elsewhere. It is now compulsory for young people in Britain to have education or training (e.g. a trade apprenticeship) so there are also colleges teaching these subjects for 16\u201318 year olds. Thus \u2018college\u2019 can and does refer to education of 16\u201318 year olds, which is carried out as part of many high schools. For adults who (for whatever reason) have not achieved qualifications such as A levels or trade qualifications there are institutions called Further Education Colleges. There are other details and variations where the term college may be used, but these are the main use I think you are asking about. ",

            "answer_text": "In the U.K., the term \u201ccollege\u201d is synonymous with a \u201ctrade school\u201d in the US. It is considered as Further education, rather than Higher (University). They are considered as appropriate for 16\u201318 year old education, but predominate in \u201ccraft\u201d and \u201cart\u201d rather than academic studies. They also provide qualifications in \u201ctrades\u201d for people of any age. Plumbing, bricklaying, painting and decorating, dress-making, jewellery making, blacksmithing, ground keeping, animal husbandary. However the term \u201cCollege\u201d can refer to an establishment, such as the Royal College of Nurses who offer both Education and Higher (degree, and higher) level courses. if I heard someone say they were going to \u201ccollege\u201d, even if they said (the location) College, I would assume they meant \u201ctrade school\u201d for further education. If they said they were attending a NAMED College (Magdalen, Norland, Royal College of Nurses, Kingston Maurwood) then I would assume that it was more akin to (or part of) a University and offered further and higher courses in a specialised field. Kingston Maurwood, for example, is an agricultural college, that offers everything from short \u201ctrade\u201d courses for the mentally challenged (low IQ, moderately autistic) to degrees. ",
