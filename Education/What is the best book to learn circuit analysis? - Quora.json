            "answer_text": "Previous answers either mentioned introductory circuit analysis texts \u2014 which are found in many incarnations, all of them more or less clones of a same syllabus, to fulfill needs of university courses :-) \u2014 or they mentioned \u201cbooks on electronics\u201d, mainly Sedra\u2019s \u201cMicroelectronics\u201d and the \u201cArt of Electronics\u201d. But electronics books are not books on circuit analysis\u2026 Well, IMHO the best book to learn circuit analysis is \u201cLinear and Nonlinear Circuits\u201d from Chua, Desoer and Kuh (CDK) (Leon O. Chua, Charles A. Desoer, Ernest S. Kuh: 9780070108981: Amazon.com: Books ). After that one, comes what can be considered the \u201cprevious edition\u201d: \u201cBasic Circuit Theory\u201d from Desoer & Kuh (Charles A. Desoer: 9780070165755: Amazon.com: Books ), although it is a few notches down due to the far weaker (read incomplete) treatment of nonlinear circuits. The reason why CDK is the best IMO is because no book I am aware of treats systematically, and explains in a clear way (chapters 2, 3 and 4, mostly), the analysis of nonlinear circuits, both resistive and dynamic, including (simple) examples of the analysis of nonlinear dynamic circuits. About 20~30 years ago CDK was the recommended text in the introductory course on \u201ccircuit analysis\u201d in my school (IST, the largest engineering school in Lisbon, Portugal) and I used it (along with Colclaser\u2019s Electronics text Basic Principles: Roy A. Colclaser, etc.: 9780471866268: Amazon.com: Books for analog electronics and Digital Circuits and Microprocessors (McGraw-Hill series in electrical engineering. Computer engineering and switching theory) for digital electronics) to teach \u201cIntroduction to circuits and electronics\u201d in other school, with excellent results: the students learned to do easily and systematically the large signal analysis of nonlinear circuits \u2014 e.g. circuits with diodes, resistors and sources, with 3 or 4 diodes. This kind of analysis is perhaps the most difficult to grasp for electronics rookies: electronics texts jdon\u2019t teach you how to do a systematic quantitative analysis, they just present a qualitative discussion of the \u201cstandard\u201d configurations: rectifiers, limiters, clampers, nonlinear shapers,\u2026 CDK also introduces the basic methods for simulation of large scale circuits \u2014 Newton-Raphson for nonlinear resistive circuits, forward and backward Euler for integrating nonlinear differential-algebraic equations modeling nonlinear dynamic circuits. Unfortunately, CDK was (or is) too advanced for its time :-) and so, it is out of print since many years. Even used copies are usually expensive. Fortunately, at the time I bought a few paperback copies for myself which often serve me well :-) (PS: a few time ago I answered about the \u201c5 books an EE should read\u201d and it became a popular answer: Jose Soares Augusto's answer to What are the top five books every Electrical Engineer should study at least once? Perhaps you have some interest on it\u2026) ",

            "answer_text": "I have to disagree with Art of Electronics - it\u2019s great but it\u2019s too disorganized and goes too deep in many cases. If learning circuit analysis well and quickly matters, it\u2019s definitely NOT the best book. AFTER you\u2019ve learned circuit analysis, it does better as \u201cleisurely read\u201d or a \u201cI have a specific issue not found in textbooks\u201d or \u201cI want to learn something I didn\u2019t know before\u201d type of resource. Various tomes by Robert Boylestad are still the best for basic circuit analysis. I used the 1968 edition of Introductory Circuit Analysis when I was a teen. In EE school we used Boylestad/Nashalsky Introductory Circuit Analysis. There\u2019s a lot of overlap between all of his books and all are good for basic circuit theory.
