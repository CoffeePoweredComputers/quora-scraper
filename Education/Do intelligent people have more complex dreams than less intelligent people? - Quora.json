            "answer_text": "A very intriguing question. I am not an expert on dreaming psychology but I can tell you from the expertise in psychology that I do have with cognition and mental structure that fundamental conscious cognitive needs are an options list 1-8. Near the end of the sleep cycle when people exit REM sleep and begin to awaken, their consciousness will retain some memory of their recent dreams. And according to cognitive psychology this information should be quickly assimilated by the consciousness\u2019 fundamental cognitive function or information format. So to answer your question from my version of intelligence's\u2019 experience\u2014 I myself having a fundamental cognitive function of Extroverted Feeling, or Cognitive Empathy, I almost never remember my own dreams, (if i have any at all). I have also never awoken from a nightmare. I am really good at reading other people however, and applying their dreams to their life and their current problems. And usually people tell me that they think I am right. So based on that and the fact that the unconscious and sub conscious are constantly sifting through the right information to give our consciousness to help us survive our environment, I have assumed that people dream to safely become \u201caware\u201d of information that they otherwise cannot consciously handle, and then when they begin to awaken they get little snippet that peaks their interest. Kind of like our subconscious winking at us and then we double take and its gone. Peaking our curiosity, wondering what it was that it was trying to tell us\u2026 probably the only way most people can really accept the things that are buried deep in their lower mind. Call it intuition on my part, but I\u2019ve often felt constantly asleep and in constant dialogue with my unconscious and subconscious all day. I have verified again and again that see and understand things about people that they don\u2019t even see themselves. Any time that I\u2019ve been a pal and brought it up without their subconscious giving them the green-light first however- ended in them being very defensive and angry that I would bring up or talk about \u201csomething like that with them\u201d. So yes I think people who are intelligent have complicated dreams, but a really intelligent person will follow/interpret their dream and learn more about themselves. And the MOST intelligent person (people like myself) don\u2019t have any dreams. Because we aren\u2019t afraid of looking at any part of ourselves or the world around us and therefore our unconscious and subconscious trusts us completely to review this information in broad daylight without any weird subconscious encryptions.

            "answer_text": "Dreaming is not a function of intelligence, as intelligence is a limiting concept. Dreaming requires mobility of consciousness, and complex dreaming requires a stable personality with a sense of adventure willing to explore the unknown. People whom are suffering trauma due to their life circumstances will usually dream \u2018less\u2019 as every bit of available time is being used by the psyche to try and calm the \u2018storm\u2019 that is buffeting the ego and so consciousness is held back to a greater degree. Trauma, which may have little to do with a person\u2019s intelligence. If we place the issue of trauma to one side, then yes, the complexity of a person\u2019s mental constructions may impact the complexity of their dreams but the complexity of these constructions may have little to do with their measured IQ. We would prefer you to think about complexity in terms of how much dream complexity can be retained into memory. For example person A, may be having the most complex dreams but without a framework of knowledge to understand these dreams, A is unable to assimilate most of the data which is now lost to him. Person B may have less complex dreams than A, but if she has a more advanced mental and emotional framework then she may be more successful at retaining her dream data. ",

I\u2019m often a ninja, super soldier, or have superhuman powers, but sometimes I perform routine tasks or solve problems that have been bothering me while I\u2019m awake. Sometimes I lead armies of zombies, and sometimes I do statistical analyses and make charts, or organize road expansion projects. Sometimes I dream of colors, sounds, and abstract thoughts that I\u2019m unable to express in words. Often my dreams have complex contextual background information, but I\u2019m not always myself. I regularly dream I\u2019m someone else (male or female), an alien, an animal, a computer, a rocket ship, a stone, whatever. While dreaming, I am unable to perceive that I am dreaming. Sometimes when I begin to wake up, I think that I am falling asleep and that reality is the dream. I use the snooze button a lot, and have been known to sleep through multiple alarms. Is this type of dreaming complex or simple? I don\u2019t know. ",

            "answer_text": "( I googled it ) A Higher IQ Means More Dreams Most people dream every occasionally. If you dream several times during the week, it might be because you have a higher IQ than others. A dream is related to the unconscious parts of the brain. When you go to sleep, all the unconscious thoughts that are present in the mind from the day are put together to form dreams. Those who have a higher IQ and tend to process more information than others tend to dream more often because there are more thoughts going through the mind. Think about dreaming as sorting out all the things that you learn or think about during the day, somewhat like a processing plant. As you learn more and process more information in the mind, that information has to go somewhere. It\u2019s processed in the form of dreams until you can figure out how to use it in your life. Sometimes, dreaming can boost the IQ by a few points because it allows the thoughts in the mind to remain fresh and reach the conscious levels during the day. Some people with a higher IQ are better at remembering the smaller details instead of just the main themes or key notes of the dream. ",

            "answer_text": "Intelligence has many different measures and for some, complexity varies along the scale in unexpected ways. It is not easy to tell if people who are considered more intelligent would have more complex dreams or not. In general, those with higher intelligence do tend to have existential concerns given their ability to grasp certain concepts intractable to the rest of the population, but that doesn\u2019t mean their dreams could necessarily be hard to understand or highly nuanced or abstract or metaphorical. That can be true for anybody regardless of intelligence level if analyzed deeply enough. What is more interesting to consider is how intelligence level corresponds with general life concerns and the evolution of thought throughout a person\u2019s life. Dreams are a reflection of waking concerns. ",

I don\u2019t think the IQ of a person has anything to do with the contents of our dreams. Our dreams are not generated by our cogntive mind, of course, and our unconscious mind knows how to communicate to our cogntive mind. It will frequently use current experiences, because they are fresh in our mind, to tell us what we most need to know at that moment in our lives. The unconscious mind has an ingenious capacity to communicate with our cogntive mind, which is no where near as objective as is our unnconscious mind. ",
