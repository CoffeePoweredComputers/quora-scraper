            "answer_text": "It was always in my heart to pursue MBBS degree. As I was about to complete my 10th schooling, my parents thought about shifting me to some other school where I can get entrance coaching also.I was ready too. It was then we came to knw abt special batches-The new initiative by Brilliant Study Centre. I applied for the exam and I didn't make it.I applied for school exams and I cleared the school exam of PLACID VIDYA VIHAR and they admitted me to special batch that year since I got a good rank in that exam.(The seats allotted to special batches through school exams are limited now) Then began my 2 year journey !!!!!!! Definitely,it was not an easy one.I had no idea at all how to deal with OMR marking at the beginning.But the number of exams i wrote moulded me like anything.I would say that I had a very slow progressive scale in my exams and that happened only because of the coaching i received. The brilliant study centre provides the best faculty and all the requiring study materials.They support us in all the ways they can.They regularly conduct exams, publish ranklists at the earliest and provide constant support to all those who performs well.They also supported us with a library where we could get books we required for reference. They finished all the topics in advance and provided us with nearly 6 months of preparation before the +2 board examinations so that we could utilise it for both NEET and Board exams. But the schedule is very hectic and one needs to run the race faster to reach the finishing line on time ! They conducted model exam series separate for special batches and also along with Repeaters batches . These exams were helping us to prepare for a national level competitive exam. I had no trouble for preparing my board exams and I was able to clear it with 95.8%.And because of the special batch coaching only, I was able to save an year and get in to a government college.I presently study at KARNATAKA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, HUBLI. PS: This is my story .This story was scripted like this because the fruit of my efforts was sweet.This need not be the case of everyone who had been in special batches.Each story is different and each experience is different.But I would definitely say that SPECIAL BATCH IS NEVER A VAIN EXPERIENCE ",
