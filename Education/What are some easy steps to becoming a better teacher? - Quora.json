            "answer_text": "One easy step to becoming a better teacher: Regardless of what you teach, have your students write in a journal the first five minutes of class. Have journals scattered on the floor when they walk in. Students should be seated in desks writing in journals when the bell rings. Journals left on the floor means a student is absent or tardy. Mark this in your roll book. No need for calling roll, and students are on task. Students can write on a topic you write on the board OR a topic of their choice OR they can look at the journal idea sheet which has possible topics. This is very important: Students can write about anything they want.* Your topic on the board is merely a suggestion. You only need to allow about five minutes for students to write. I even return papers while they are writing, which is an efficient use of time. Read journals everyday. You must write one comment on each entry. For a class of 25 this will only take 20\u201330 minutes. Comments can be \u201cI bet that was fun.\u201d \u201cI love chocolate, too.\u201d \u201cThis made me sad.\u201d \u201cDid you ever go back?\u201d \u201cTGIF\u201d \u201cFun!\u201d Any quick comment that pertains to what they wrote shows that you actually read what they wrote. This often surprises the hell out of students. They were heard, and they like being heard! Benefits: Students are on task immediately after bell rings. Journals transition easily into other lessons. Having students write improves their writing and is a skill all teachers, regardless of the subject they teach, should nurture. This also impresses administrators. You will learn more about your students by reading those journals than you can from talking to them. Knowing your students\u2019 likes and dislikes, fears, goals, feelings about you, feelings about your class, will enable you to structure lessons that, at least some of the time, appeal to your students. You will begin to understand why some behave the way that they do. When the students enter your room while you are standing at the door monitoring the halls, you can make a comment about yesterday\u2019s journal entry: \u201cI laughed at the thought of you running from the snake,\u201d \u201cYou made me hungry,\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know Georgia had a mini Grand Canyon,\u201d \u201cWhen does deer season/start end?\u201d \u201cYour grandmother sounds like a special person,\u201d - anything that again lets them know you read what they wrote. This opens up communication between you and your students like nothing else. You will become a better teacher. *I tell students they can write about whatever they like. HOWEVER, I make them aware that teachers are state-mandated reporters. If they write about abuse they or someone else is experiencing, if they write about hurting themselves, or if they write about hurting others (particularly me), I have to report that to the proper authorities. I cannot keep that confidential. I also add that while they can write about anything without my revealing what they write to anyone except in the above instances, I also would prefer that they not write about what they do in the backseat of a car on Saturday night. I do not give love advice - \u201cI love him. He doesn\u2019t love me. What do I do?\u201d I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t keep my own love life in order. I rarely take journals home with me. I do not guard them 24-hours a day. If they REALLY don\u2019t want people to know about something, it is best not to write it down ANYWHERE. That\u2019s just a good life lesson, period. ",
