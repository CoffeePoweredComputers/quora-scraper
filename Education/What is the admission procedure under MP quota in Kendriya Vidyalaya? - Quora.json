            "answer_text": "I think I can answer this question as I recently admitted my daughter for class 6 in Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) at Pondicherry. The first time I approached KV was for her 1st Std. admission and I was unsuccessful as I was not clear about the application process and available quota options. Therefore I had to admitted my child in one of the so called best private CBSE schools in Pondicherry where she studied there for eight years (including pre-montessori, montessori 1 and montessori 2) until class 5. Though I do not have major complaints about the private school (in fact my daughter enjoyed her schooling) I found the quality of education was not that great and English as a spoken language was not in practice in the campus for the exorbitant amount as fees collected. And like any other private schools the wards were not allowed to sit in the class or take periodic tests until the entire term fees were paid and this is really annoying. My child has experienced this in some occasions. That was the time I strongly decided to get my child admitted in the KV, but I was sure I was not going to win the competition through online application and lottery procedure as I know that there may be only few vacancies available and that already central govt employees (or based on priority) must be waiting to grab the seats to admit their wards. Adding to the thrill the school in their website http://kvno1jipmer.nic.in/classi... had announced \u201cNo Vacancy from class II and above\u201d for the seventh year (2019-20) in row. The only way in which I could get a seat in KV was \u201cAdmission Under MP Quota\u201d. but the new challenge was that the General Elections were nearing and that I will know who my MP of my constituency is only after election results are announced and the MP\u2019s swearing-in ceremony is done. Therefore I had to wait until the MP\u2019s quota for KV is released. (Please note that the Loksabha MP can recommend to someone who is living within the respective MP\u2019s constituency whereas the Rajasabha MP can recommend for KV in any constituency in a State that the MP represents). The process required a lot of patience and constant follow-up. All children were attending some schools, but my child was at home, if I send her to her last school, they will keep asking the fees (which is a huge money you will know), and I could not get TC for my child as by chance if I fail to get the seat in KV, I will have to ask my child resume in the same school (at least I can save the readmission fees) and on the other hand I had to answer my family members and others for not sending my child school yet (it was already July then). But I decided to take the dare step, with confidence. Very thankfully my good friend introduced me to the Honorable MP with whom he had cordial relationship. (It is important that you identify the right person in your friends circle who has some good connections). This helped me a lot. The Hon. MP assessed every application meticulously and recommended those whom he found deserving as per the list. Now the formal process begins..as you know each MP has a coupon and can recommend up to 10 candidates (for every academic year) that were shortlisted in a stipulated format mentioning names of the children and parents and the contact details like postal address and phone number and email id, to which class and school opted for, to be sent to \u201cKendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan\u201d and \u201cGovernment of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development\u201d both at New Delhi. The MP\u2019s office does this. If the name of your ward is included in the list you will certainly get a call from \u201cKendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan\u201d who will verify your details over phone. It usually takes one or two working days for them to finalize the procedure and to host the list on the website https://kvsangathan.nic.in/acade.... Please keep checking the website from next day after you get call from KVS. It will be easier for you to download the right file from the website if you know the coupon number (every MP is given a coupon number, please see attached); else you need to keep checking every files. It may happen that you get email on this, but it may not reach you sometimes. Otherwise the school will definitely give you a call on the number you shared. Once you have the coupon with your ward\u2019s name in it, take a print out and annex it with other relevant documents (such as proof of age, residence, TC (if applicable) and meet the school principal. The principal will admit your ward immediately. The fee challan will be raised and given to you and you can make payment online from the school\u2019s website or KVS website using the Student Unique ID No. or in person through Union Bank of India. The fee structure is very affordable. I paid Rs. 1,825/- in total. Kindly note that \u201cAdmission Under MP quota\u201d is over and above the class strength (usually it is 40 per class/section) to any class (except for 11th I believe, for which the ward need to appear for some exam) and your ward WILL get admission even if there is no vacancy. As on 1st July 2019, my daughter joined in class 6 in KV1, Pondicherry now wears the KV tag. The children here are from different backgrounds hence your child has opportunity to mingle/learn/share with them which will help children having balance in their real lives. PS: I have spoken out from my own experiences; I do not recommend anybody to follow my footprints as it may not necessarily be applicable for all cases in successfully getting admission in KV. I am a freelancer and this process shall not apply to the personnel of Central or State Govt/Defense and alike that. Kindly excuse me for grammar, typo errors if any. Thanks, Yuvaraj,   ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Students/Parents, MP quota in Kendriya Vidyalaya only work for class 1st to 9th, and now time is over as 16 May 2018 was the last date. They(Member of Parliament or Ministers) will be allowed to give their recommendation for classes 1 to 9 and each member can refer 10 cases for admission in an academic year. As new changes in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) chaired by Union human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar, officials said. The KVS had earlier stopped this practice for Class 10 and 12. Now coming to the point how to get it done? Getting admission in KV class 11th, First of all, you have to be present there at the time of admission after declaring CBSE result most probably after 30th may. Please note KV is a Central school so there are some preferences and priorities, you will get preference after that of the students from a defense background etc. If CGPA is more then 8+ ultimately you will be admitted. If you are not from a KV student, so your marks will decide your entry. Each KV has different cut off eg. reputed school and remote area wise. To say even different KV on the same city may have different cut off. Observation: From last two years the cut off for Science is going as high as 8.8 CGPAComputer Science it is above 9 CGPACommerce with Maths at least 8 cgpa.How to count CGPA For example, if your grade points for the five main subjects are: Subject 1: 8; Subject 2: 9; Subject 3: 7; Subject 4: 9; and Subject 5: 9 Step 1: Add the grade points: 8+9+7+9+9 = 42 Step 2: Divide it by 5 42/5 = 8.4 So, your CGPA is 8.4 Calculating percentage from your CGPA In order to convert your overall CGPA into percentage, multiply it by 9.5. For example, In this case 8.4 (CGPA) is multiplied by 9.5, so 8.4 x 9.5 = 79.80% You should know that though both your Class 9 and Class 10 grades are displayed on your report card, only Class 10 grades are used to calculate your CGPA Hope it will help, All the best ",
