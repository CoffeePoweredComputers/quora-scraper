            "answer_text": "Retail is one of many industries where people can get a job without having a college degree. Or sometimes, even without a high school diploma \u2014 just as long as such individuals can read and write well enough to work a cash register or one of today\u2019s equivalents. That said, there\u2019s no reason why retail workers might not have one or more college degrees, particularly seeing the ups and downs of the US economy over the last dozen years or so. There were many times, in the years following both my own and my wife\u2019s graduation from college with a total of 5 degrees between us, that we held retail or related occupations. We simply couldn\u2019t find the university teaching positions we\u2019d trained for, so were forced to work a few retail jobs for several years until we figured out how to retrofit our careers. And believe me, we were grateful for the opportunity to find these jobs, and remain so to this day, many years after the fact. The bottom line here is that a great many people over the past 50 years (or perhaps longer), find it somehow reasonable to despise people who work in retail or the trades because they\u2019re (allegedly) ignorant and uneducated and can\u2019t do any better for themselves. This is, quite simply, the kind of phony superiority complex that this country could certainly do without, particularly in the current environment where, in numerous cities and towns across the country, it\u2019s fashionable to sneer at people who aren\u2019t as \u201csmart\u201d as university grads. But the sad thing is that many of today\u2019s university grads are fitted with socialist blinders on their way out of the Ivory Tower. They think they know everything, as opposed to those awful plumbers and drywallers and Walmart greeters. But from my point of view, most of those plumbers, drywallers and Walmart greeters are better human beings than those who sneer at them. And furthermore, many of today\u2019s employees, particularly those at or past retirement age, have decided to get retail jobs \u2014 no matter what their previous employment might have been. In hard times, you take what you can get in the world. And what you can get is what employers need, and it helps makes ends meet. And this situation also gives the lie to the myths surrounding retail. In the end, anyone who takes pleasure in looking down upon people in any profession, or assuming that such professions hire only the intellectually underprepared are only voicing their own prejudices. Which doesn\u2019t say much for their character. ",

            "answer_text": "Historically, retail workers were low paid unskilled workers frequently without formal education. In the last 30 years or so, retail workers comprise unskilled workers with high school diplomas, or less, and college graduates. The 11 years I went university (4) and earned 3 degrees, I worked to pay for my education (I took no loans or financial assistance). Mostly, I was treated well by employers because I was a student. If you are a student, that tag, will open a lot doors. People see that as your trying to \u201cbetter yourself\u201d. A lot of people misunderstand society right now. Some college graduates are retail workers, work at fast food places, are servers at restaurants and lounges, work construction and other unskilled jobs because they cannot get the job they want or are simply taking a break from the pressure of finding a job that society sees as worthy. I treat everyone that is in an unskilled job as a worthy person. Everyone has talents and abilities regardless of their education. ",

            "answer_text": "Part of it has to do with the fact that lots of high schoolers will be working in retail. So it\u2019s a very common job for young people to have. And some presume you don\u2019t need much of an education to work in a retail store. So selling, working a cash register, etc doesn\u2019t require college. Thus, you don\u2019t need to hire college grads to do jobs that one can do with just high school. So we have those who look at retail as being on the low end of the educational spectrum when it comes to what employees need to do those jobs. But the reality is very different! Yes, there are those with just a high school education working there. However, there are lots of college grads working in retail too! Some who are working there by choice because they enjoy retail, see it as a faster path to management, etc. And others who work in it because that\u2019s where they can more easily or quickly get their first jobs. Either way, retail does have lots and lots of those with a college education and even those with degrees. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, Others often judge us by our occupation. Because I am a white, middle-aged male who dresses professionally, some people do not assume that I am a public school teacher. And, since virtually everyone in the United State comes into contact with retail workers, there is an unjustified assumption that service industry employees must be limited by their education. Until we view all legitimate work as honorable, those who serve others will be erroneously viewed, somehow, as unable to have achieved elevated academic standing. Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",

Me, I\u2019m on the high functioning end of the autistic spectrum but I\u2019m capable of higher level jobs but the social and analytical aspects would be too overwhelming. Fortunately I have a loving family who supports me and provides all the basic necessities and for that I\u2019m eternally grateful to my parents. I want to be a good honest person and stay out of trouble to show them my gratitude. Hope this somewhat answers your question although I got off on a tangent. \ud83d\ude00 ",
