            "answer_text": "A can do a piece of work in 10 days and B can do it 15 days. If both of them are working together, half of the work can be finished in? LCM of 10 and 15 is 30. A can do (1/10th) of the work in one day (or 3/30th). B can do (1/15th) of the work in one day (or 2/30th). Working together, A and B can do (3/30)+(2/30) = 5/30th of the work in one day. So they would require 30/5 or 6 days to complete the task. Therefore in 3 days A and B together would have done half of the entire work. ",
