But if a college or university requires the exam, or the ACT, then you must take it to be considered for admissions. There are always some exceptional cases if you live in a yurt in Mongolia, I suppose. There are many test optional colleges that will allow your other attributes to shine. Even for these, if you do will on the tests, you should submit it. https://www.fairtest.org/university/optional ",

Neither test is perfect, however. I remember one student who only scored a 21 on her ACT, but received almost all A\u2019s in college. ",
