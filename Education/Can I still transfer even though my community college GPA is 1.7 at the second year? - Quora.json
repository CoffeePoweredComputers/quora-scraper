            "answer_text": "A2A. It will depend on the school you will be transferring to. I suspect most accredited universities will not accept you with such a low GPA. A 2.0 is usually considered the bare minimum, but I would think even a 2.0 would not get you into most schools. If you thinking about transferring to another community college, you probably could. The new college would probably require you to go through some kind of remediation - this may not mean developmental courses, but could be some type of required counseling or tutoring. A non-accredited college may decide to allow you to transfer, but really you should not be going to a non-accredited school anyway. ",

Without seeing a transcript (and that should be done confidentially by a trained, qualified advisor) I would have to say no, but I\u2019d also have to ask why it is so low. Your best bet might be to buckle down and apply yourself where you are. Go make an appointment with both an academic advisor and a counselor as soon as you can. Discuss why you are doing so poorly and ask for their feedback. An advisor can help you with an academic plan. A counselor can help you address issues where their particular expertise can apply, like for example do you have issues holding you back that can be addressed. All of us hit roadblocks at some time in our life. A below 2.0 GPA certainly applies, but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t push through it. Just don\u2019t try and do it alone. ",

Then, you would be able to transfer to local state sponsored programs. Also, look for \u2018transfer agreements\u2019 from your Community College with 4-year Colleges, as this may prove very helpful. If you are having difficulty pulling your gpa up to a 2.0 or above, I would recommend you intentionally take some \u2018soft\u2019 classes that come easier to you, as a means to increase your grades.
