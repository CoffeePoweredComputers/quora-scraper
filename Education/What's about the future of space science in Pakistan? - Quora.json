            "answer_text": "Thanks , For the A2A ! The future is that phase of life which we all can be optimistic of , whether it is relating to a country\u2019s economy or it is related to other fields.  In Pakistan , sadly , there is no awareness or even interest about space ,planets and the universe. Even in entire universities of Pakistan there is no separate educational field for astronomy or separate training for launching rockets, satellietes etc.. As a result nearly 99% of Pakistanis are never aware or have lack of interest towards space science. Recently the Government of Pakistan has decided to launch its own Mars exploration rover with the collaboration of Chinese . If this project gets successful , this might open doors for Pakistan towards space research as interest of the public to explore the Universe gets increased . One more thing if this project doesn't gets launched ,people will be unaware or will have no interest in space science for another 5 years.  On a slight note , the unawareness and lack of interest towards astronomy can be seen from the fact that Pakistan geological and weather stations are working on 19th century instruments and technology.  That's All saad\u221a ",
