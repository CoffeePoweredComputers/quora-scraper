            "answer_text": "I give my students problems for which they have no information or direct experience and then I tell them to figure it out. The usual first response is to question my sanity. I can ask them what they think they need to know to solve the problem and explore that. Creative problem solving is really about being intellectually brave. Trying any damn thing that might work and eliminating in, an iterative way, those things which don\u2019t. Sharing ideas is a remarkably effective way to arrive at unique solution to open ended problems. The crazier the problem seems the better because so rote responses are clearly not going to work thus saving time and energy for real flights of fancy to get at the possible solutions. My students recently created a template for a seawater farm in Tunisia and early in the process I added the complications of working with an entrepreneurship class in Tunisia who came from a different culture, spoke mostly different languages and didn\u2019t know what the heck a seawater farm was either. Big fun, great results and everyone learned a lot about creative problem solving by jumping in and exploring many, many avenues. ",
