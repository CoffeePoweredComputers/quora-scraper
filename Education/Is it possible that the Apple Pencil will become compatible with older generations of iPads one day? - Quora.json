            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it would because older generation of ipad may not have the special touch or sensitivity that support apple pencil and as I tried with other stylus and test with iPad pro I saw a big difference. iPad pro don\u2019t react to side of your hand. It is most likely not going to work because when we\u2019re drawing some part of your hand may touch the paper so with old iPad you are drawing from the tip of stylus and also a dot and line that also drawn from side of your hands at the same time too. So when you are drawing with old iPad you have to keep your hand away from iPad and only the pen touch the screen and that is not how most people are drawing. Apple won\u2019t make Apple pencil works with old iPad since they already know the problem that won\u2019t change the way people looking at the old iPad and they want to make money, no old outdated one.

            "answer_text": "The Apple Pencil is unique as a stylus for iPad Pros, because only those devices have the needed technology the screen to detect it. For this reason, older iPads or other iOS devices will never work with the current model. There is nothing to stop Apple from using this tech an iPhone or iPad mini screen, however, which would then enable use on those devices. The cost of this is most likely a factor in this decision. (Totally random aside) Personally, I\u2019d love to use my Pencil with my iPhone, like I used to do with my Newton. I have a keyboard extention that gets pretty good recognition, even using my finger. It\u2019s called MyScript, and I love it. ",
