            "answer_text": "All of them have already had the chance for an education, because we have universal public schooling in this country. Yes, yes, I know. Let\u2019s not launch into broadsides of argumentation about unequal quality of schools and outmoded or inadequate methods of instruction and all the rest. Even in the crappy schools in the most horrible neighborhoods, some kids get educated. And some kids with hideous home environments, end up at the top of their class. Still, a very large percentage of new prisoners are functionally illiterate. Many more never got beyond grade school or ninth grade or graduated from high school. Some prisons actually do have adult education classes, aimed at making prisoners become functionally literate, or able to earn a GED. Others have classes or tutoring provided by other, better educated, prisoners. Some prisoners go after that like a cat pouncing on a mouse. Others wouldn\u2019t go into such classes unless they were dragged in, wearing chains. It is possible for prisoners to take college courses, by correspondence, in at least some prisons. There are prisoners who have earned one or more college degrees while incarcerated. Others, by self-study, become experts in Law or other fields. So in most places it already is possible for prisoners to get education they missed the first time around. But prisoners are not forced to get it. And, as I said, many don\u2019t want it \u2014 no matter how much you feel they should want it. A prison is not a very good environment for academic learning. Too much noise, too much danger, too much regimentation. Too little stimulation, too little encouragement, too little reward. Lack of educational opportunities is not very high on the list of things that are wrong in prisons. ",

            "answer_text": "I work in a prison in Alabama. Most of our inmates are dropouts and I don't mean just high-school dropouts, we're talking junior high and elementary school dropouts. Most, if they had any work history prior to incarceration, could only find work as manual laborers. Regardless of these dismal education and work records, 95 percent will eventually be released. I see what happens when these guys are released from prison without high-school equivalency and vocational skills. They go back on the streets and get arrested again and again. They spend more time in prison than in the free world. They try to qualify for SSI, because they have insufficient work history to qualify for social security. In correctional facilities, they take GED classes, often, get literacy training, and usually have vocational school and other higher education opportunities. Our inmates have both vocational school and university degree options. Some inmates are sent to seminary, so they can act as assistant chaplains. Reading outgoing mail of inmates, I've been struck by what a big difference GED and vocational training can make in lives. It is not just about gaining job skills, education can revolutionize the outlook of these guys. Men from dysfunctional families start taking pride in themselves. They make the Dean's List and realize they are capable intelligent. They look at the work of their hands and they see talent and worth for the first time in their lives. They form aspirations and see the chance to break the cycle that got them into prison. ",
