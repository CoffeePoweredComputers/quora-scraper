            "answer_text": "There was no difference between the Early Middle Ages and then the High Middle Ages, but then, there was a lot. For arbitrariness\u2019s sake, let\u2019s call the Early Middle Ages 476\u20131066, and the High Middle Ages 1066\u20131337. These dates are incredibly important, more so 1066 and 1337, because they root this answer in English history. 1066 is when William I ascended to the throne of England. 1337 is when Edward III invaded France, kicking off a four-part series of wars that changed European history forever. Understandably, 1065 and 1067 were incredibly similar despite being in different periods, whereas the worlds of 477 and 1336 would have been unrecognizable to each other. More importantly, each country has its own definition of when these periods changed. That alone says that the transition was muddy at best. With that out of the way, I\u2019ll try to draw a couple generalizations: The Early Middle Ages was a more likely time for monks to produce illuminated manuscripts. These were bibles inscribed in gold leaf, which were incredibly time-consuming and difficult. According to the tour guide when I saw the Book of Kells in 2004, each manuscript was the lifetime\u2019s work of three consecutive monks. Whether that\u2019s true or not, the point is they were harrowing to create, which, aside from their beauty, is one of the reasons why we now keep them under temperature- and moisture-controlled conditions in museums. Monks in the High Middle Ages typically did not go to such great lengths to preserve biblical teachings.The High Middle Ages saw the first proto-form of what we could call a European international relations system. Although Charlemagne supplying money and weapons to Krum (King of Bulgaria) against the Byzantines arguably is this, as is the political marriage of Otto II to the Byzantine princess Theophana, the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantines very much saw each other from afar. The High Middle Ages saw England, France, the HRE, the Archduchy of Austria and the Papacy exchange diplomatic documents in a way we would recognize now, although they were generally written in Latin. The High Middle Ages is also when the passport was invented.The High Middle Ages saw the invention of the (somewhat) modern university. The Early Middle Ages was a time of extreme decentralization. This wasn\u2019t backward or dark, it just meant that populations increasingly lived farther from each other, which prevented them from having many modern amenities. Italy, and then France, Germany, Bohemia and Poland to follow, reversed this trend through a series of institutions. Perhaps most notable is the university, where educationally-minded youths of various nationalities could all speak Latin to each other and learn various subjects. Early doctoral degrees were in theology, medicine and law. Eventually, a master\u2019s would be the highest in any other discipline.There are hundreds of other differences. Each member of this site will have a different perspective. This is what, off the top of my head, denotes the differences between the Early Middle Ages and the High Middle Ages. Note, however, that I used extremely Anglocentric dates. Each country\u2019s experience is different. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, So much. First of all, I\u2019m not sure how much meaning the distinction has in places outside France. England followed a completely different path; Germany remained outside the Roman and so the post-Roman structures; Italy took a long time to recover from the fall of Rome. In France, the early Middle Ages were the formative centuries when Gaul began to become France. Roman and Germanic (mainly Frankish) culture were still separate and began to meld. The Church was still fighting heresy in the form of Arianism and in many ways was stricter and more moral, because it was competing with another belief system. Paganism - Roman, Germanic and even Celtic - still survived. The country overall was divided and would shift in form for centuries, until Charlemagne actually took over most of Europe, only to have his empire divide into France and Germany (mainly) later on. People spoke some form of Latin or various Germanic dialects. By the high Middle Ages - that is, the period just before the late Middle Ages -, France was small, but a single entity which continued to grow. French, which had been a corrupted form of Latin, became the standard language. There was only one French king. The Church was firmly established and regulated much of daily life. Cities began to revive and so trades groups, for instance, began to grow up, taking on increasing power and defining production in a more regulated fashion. The main conflicts for a long time would soon be between the English (who often had French-speaking kings who still claimed land in France) and the French, whereas earlier kings were fighting with each other within Gaul and with scattered groups like the Saxons. The French monarchy, having lost its mobile archives in one battle, would soon begin to keep these in Paris, starting a bureaucracy which would only grow through the centuries. Basically, the early Middle Ages started with fragmented former Roman possessions with various populations and little structure; the high Middle Ages (which has almost the opposite meaning in French) ended with a highly structured, if still small, country with a single Church, a single monarch and a single language.
