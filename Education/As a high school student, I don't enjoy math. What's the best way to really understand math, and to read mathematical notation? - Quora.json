            "answer_text": "Notation can be a very big hangup.  I strongly suspect that there are MANY students who give up on math because they get lost in the notation and language despite the fact that they basically understand most of the big ideas. The notation is all there for very good reasons, but the reasons are often not obvious to beginners.  The only way to get used to the notation is to practice and be thorough.  (It really is like learning a new language.)  When you see some mathematical statement with cryptic notation, take the time to completely decipher it until you REALLY understand exactly what it says.  (Most students don't do this, and most eventually dig themselves such a deep hole that they are forced to give up the subject because there is too much to get \"caught up on\" that the didn't fully learn the first time through the material.)    When you begin this process, it may well take several minutes to understand a single mathematical statement.  That's normal.  Don't let it frustrate you.  Spend the time to get it right every time.  As you repeat this process, it will come more quickly and will become quite natural. Definitions are another big hangup for many students.  Reading math is NOT like reading other subjects.  Mathematical definitions are NOT like definitions in other subjects.  Here's a dirty secret of mathematicians...  We don't write down definitions to help your intuitive understanding of what something means.  We write them down to allow you to check whether or not something meets the criteria for the definition.  (We use them for proofs, not for intuition.)   Here's an example.  \"A circle is the set of all points in a plane equidistant from a fixed point.\"  That doesn't exactly scream \"IT'S A ROUND SHAPE\" to most people the first time they read it.  If you want to intuitively understand what a circle is, you need to see a picture of a round shape.  The definition doesn't really help your intuition.  Once you have the intuition, it's essential to see WHY the definition implies what your intuition now tells you about a circle.     But if you want to check to see whether some collection of points is really a circle, the picture and the intuition isn't enough.  (Maybe the points make a shape that look round, but are they a really a circle?  How can we tell?)  We have to use the definition.  Can we show that the points of interest are all equidistant from a fixed point?  Do we know that they make up the set of  ALL such points?  If yes to both, then we have a circle.  If no to either, then we don't. For some reason, math is often taught in a way that students think that they are supposed to read the definition \"A circle is the set of all points in a plane equidistant from a fixed point\" and immediately understand that it means a round shape.  What's worse, we don't do anything to assure them that when they don't get that connection immediately, they are neither dumb nor \"bad a math.\"  The truth is the definition should be confusing at first.  You try to get the intuition by analogy and by example.  Then you try to figure out the definition and go back and forth until your intuition is right and the definition are completely reconciled. ",

            "answer_text": "In 65 years of doing math, I never found it enjoyable but I find it incredibly fascinating. Mathematical thinking is used in every discipline. If you don't like math, find something you do like and apply math to it. Computers? Physics? Economics? ...? As to notation. Mathematics is couched in a formal language (Mathematical notation). There is no room for sloppy notation. Mathematics is a nominative system, meaning that you define terms using only terms previously defined. You can't cheat on this aspect. Every sub-discipline of mathematics has its own definitions and sometimes overlapping notation. You should be able to take any term and unravel it by substituting definitions. At your age, you should strive to gain skills with the concepts presented to you. At your level, the way to understand math is to work problems. Not all those rote exercises but real problems with real applications. Look for reality! ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of maths is literacy.  Think of problems in terms of reading comprehension and logic puzzles.  If you're interested in law, that's perfect: good literacy plus applying the law (in this case maths ones) will get you far.  With a maths problem, read the entire thing out loud (but in your head): if you just flick through with your eyes, your brain will filter out many of the words.  Try and associate with real life situations, use easier numbers if you're unsure of the method to see what works.  Estimation is really helpful: have an idea of what you think the answer might be, use words like greater, smaller....try to make sense of what you're being asked to do, and of the answer you come up with.  Notation is only there as it's a pain in the ass to write without it, there's no reason why you shouldn't use words if you prefer.  Try to become more aware of how your brain works; don't be afraid to get things wrong.  It is much easier to help someone if you can figure out where they're going wrong: a minor mis-conception can affect lots of areas of maths.  Don't be afraid of numbers: unlike words, you can take them back.  Ending up with the wrong answer is the worst that can happen. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is, beyond numbers and patterns, it is a new language. Similar as when you learn a new language, like Spanish, you need to learn how to communicate in mathematical language. It has its own rules and symbols, you need to learn the rules and follow them. While math is language of nature, you may face some abstract concepts that hard to find in nature (at least now). I mean, don't expect to find physical meaning of any concept and matter you learn in math. Again, similar as learning music and a new language, it needs practice and practice and practice. For any concept (or note in music) you learn in minutes from a teacher or by yourself, you need to practice many hours and days. That is during the practice that you can discover and observe hidden things that you never knew before. It means that, practice must not be just physical work, it must be smart practice and with thinking.You will definitely enjoy the magnificent world of math. Look at it in this way, not just as a school subject. added: I recommend you to read How to Solve It, Book by George P\u00f3lya. ",
