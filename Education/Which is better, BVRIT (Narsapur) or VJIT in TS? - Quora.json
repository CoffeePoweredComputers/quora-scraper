            "answer_text": "Yo.. Thats easy to answer bro.. Its very rare that a student from his own college suggests or speaks good of it. As a student of BVRIT, I can surely suggest you to join BVRIT.. Bt some things to keep in mind are: Up nd down journeys will be tough through 4 yrs.. So be well prepared fr that. Faculty is quite good unless nd until you join civil engineering according to the feedback i got frm civil students. My Best suggestion for you would be join BVRIT hostel to utilizes all the resources more effectively.. nd finally.. Join BVRIT.. ",

            "answer_text": "Vjit is very good if you want to pursue your masters in usa or any other country. They kind of concetrate more on grades and theoretical knowledge. Placements have quite improved . But still I have seen many of it's students going for master's rather than taking up the placements. They are very particular about marks and will make sure that you will learn your subject throughly ",
