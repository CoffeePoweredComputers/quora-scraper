But once you get caught that feeling of regret will haunt you to the end of your life.Even if u overcome that guilt and u accidentally or intentionally tried to do the same mistake again--BELIEVE ME LIFE IS A VERY GOOD TEACHER,IF U FORGET A LESSON, ITS 10000% READY TO TEACH U AGAIN AND AGAIN. So when u do a mistake and taught a lesson from it,never ever forget it because second time it will hit you way painful than before. So don't cheat in exams ,u will get a second chance every time to prove yourself.Or you can create your own chances.But trust and respect won't last,if u get caught. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there, What i believe is it is absolutely ok to cheat in an exam it you don\u2019t violate the real purpose of the exam. Exam are meant to test what you have learnt and if you have learnt the content , even after the exam also than it is ok to cheat and pass the exam. But if you aim at completely passing through cheating and not learning what is required than it is not a good act. Also at times it\u2019ll be very difficult for you to cheat so better prepare for the exam than to relay on cheating. Peace ",
