            "answer_text": "Some countries comes very close to having 100 percent literacy. But there are numerous reasons why it is not possible to achieve 100 percent literacy. For example, some people do not have the intellectual capacity to become literate in the sense of being able to read and write. Other people may have difficulty because of such things as dyslexia. Such people usually are, however, able to use spoken language to a level that they understand other people on a basic level, and other people can understand them. As an aside, there are people who cannot speak but who can read and write their native language at a very advanced level. Next, there are people who immigrate to a new country, and learn how to speak the country\u2019s language at a functional level. They may, however, be too busy working and raising a family to spend the time necessary to read and write in that language. It is very common for first generation immigrants to not be literate in the written language of their adopted country, while their children and grandchildren not only speak the language like a native, but are also literate. Literacy is not a fixed concept, but rather a description of a wide range of competencies in reading and writing a language. Thank you for your asking this interesting question, Mr. Yousuf. ",

            "answer_text": "You asked: \u201cWhy does no country have 100% literacy?\u201d Two quick answers. There are old people who never learned to read.No country actually has 100% school attendance. Some children work in a family business, so desperately stuck in poverty that they cannot afford not to have a member of the family contribute to the income to keep the family alive, or worse yet, they have to beg in the street for a few pennies. In some cases parents will intentionally inflict a broken arm or leg so the child will appear more pitiful to make them more likely to \u201cearn\u201d as a street beggar. (So I have been told, and I have seen some beggars in a condition that might well have been inflicted upon them, but I was not able to ask about how they got the way they were).It is rare that in the situation that a parent is able to read but they are unable to send their child to school that the parent gives the child home schooling. If you don\u2019t teach EVERYONE, you have less than 100% literacy. Sincerely, Stafford \u201cDoc\u201d Williamson ",
