            "answer_text": "I am assuming since you asked this question, you will be a foreign student paying foreign fees. As you might know, pricing is a function of demand and supply. In this case, focus on \u201cdemand\u201d as supply is basically steady. The more prestigious a university is, hence many people want to enrol there, the more it is likely to be in the upper echelons of fees. Also, the location of the university will play a factor in cost of fees and your living costs when you are enrolled (that is another thing you have to consider if you are price conscious). Universities in or around expensive cities will have higher cost of living and will likely have higher fees because they have to pay their staff more to attract them to the expensive area. So you will have to go and check the UK League tables for the following: The lower ranked universities (those less presitigious)The ones with a short time of being regarded as a \u201cUniverisity\u201dThe ones not located in or within 1 hour commute to (in the following other of expensive) London, All of South East England, Birmingham, Manchester and other major citiesHint: The more North or West from London you go, the more affordable it becomes. If you have a technological facility that can highlight the number of cows and sheep in an area, then the ones with high numbers are a pretty good bet for affordabililty. So former polytechnics or colleges that were recently converted to universities, are ranked low on the local league tables (they will not feature on the international ones anyway), are in the North or West of the UK and not commutable from a major city will likely be affordable.

            "answer_text": "Sure, but it is a long list. Because of the way that further education funding works in the UK, pretty much every single university in the entire country charges the same fees for home students. However there are some variations in the fees for overseas students. Accordingly, the only way that you can generally make university \u201cmore affordable\u201d is to choose a university which is in a town with a low cost of living (hint: not London). Why do UK universities charge the same tuition fees for all undergraduate degree courses? ",
