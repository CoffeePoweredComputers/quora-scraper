            "answer_text": "The problem is that schools should be able to prepare you for the future - when you first come to school at age 6, how are the schools supposed to know what world is going to be like in say 20 years? You don\u2019t even know what new technology is going to be around in 5 years from now. The abilities required at work are totally different now than 18 years ago, when I started to go to school. It is said that most professions our kids will work at still need to be invented Another reason may be political. Suppose you know something is wrong with the school system and have an idea how to fix it. Even if everyone agreed that your idea is good, what are the possibilities? To apply it in practice, you should probably start with the youngest kids. Even if you start with older, it will still take a great amount of time before someone is even able to see the results. In particular, if you start with changing the system for the youngest students, it will take at least 10, but more likely 15 years before these people finish school. And after this huge amount of time, you still have only a very limited amount of data whether the change you made was effective - and yet, the word is totally diferent than it was at the time you implemented the change. I don\u2019t think that the school system is ideal - in fact, I think that it is pretty bad. Yet, in my opinion very people blame it without thinking about particular problems and how to fix them. The true is that you learn only what you are willing to - the fact that most people leave school unprepared for the real world is their mistake as much as the failure of the system. For me particularly, I have definitely learnt a lot of stuff at school, though most of it is not from the lessons. The most important for me is to think about everything I read, not blindly believe everything. There are also a lot of minor things like communication, gaining some responsibility and have an idea about what I would like to do in the future. Then there is what a carried away from the lessons - a little history to be able to put in context what is happening around, some geography to know where these thinks happen, some literature and other cultural stuff, biology, physics and chemistry to have an idea how the world works, and most importantly math which taught me to think appopriately about many things. However, I know that I could have learnt a lot more and it is my and only my mistake I didn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "School is not designed for you to learn things useful to you, instead school is designed to allow you to get a job in a large corporation - being more useful to the corporation than useful to yourself as you can't leave when you choose with out risking your family and lively hood. You become dependent on your job in this way because if you stop, your paycheck stops and Unemployment is taught to be feared. In this job they hope you stay there for life and pay taxes all your life to retire broke so you are dependent back on the government after it's all over. In school they don't teach you the most important things: Health: how to take care of your body and expect to have a full life (90 years). How can you enjoy life if the physical body is in pain ? Do they teach you to be healthy and strong even as an elder ? Wealth: how to make money so you\u2019re not dependent on a job that can fire you or downsize you at any time. Did you learn how to employ others and create change and wealth both? Wealth is not taught in school . They teach you to expect a paycheck from your boss. Love: some will say love is the most important thing in life , others will say it's the 3rd. We all can agree that to live a fruitful life we need to be able to give and receive love. To many, love for life involves having a family. Little is said about this fact in school. The government had got so overly involved with college under the fake aegis of wanting to help minoroties go to colllege that with all the government money given to students the cost of college has quadrupled and now with out relying on the government you can't even afford to go to college unless your super rich which is a form of socialism. Joining the military can also get you into college which is highly suspect on a moral level. Facts : Henry Ford - 1st grade education Chrysler Founder : 3rd grade education Bill Gates: Droped out of college to build his own company . Food for thought . Good luck .* ",
