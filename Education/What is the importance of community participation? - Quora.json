            "answer_text": " At a minimum, community members should pay attention to the community\u2019s discussions and events. And some will post, reply, present, and speak up on calls. Those who do none of these are join-only members, and they may as well not have joined, as they get nothing out of being a member. Those who don\u2019t post, reply, or speak up on calls can still get value from community membership. Often derided as \u201clurkers,\u201d they are merely part of the 90% of members who aren\u2019t active. But as long as they pay attention, this is to be expected, and there is no problem with it. They will learn about the community\u2019s topic, and that is an important form of community participation. It\u2019s also important to ask questions, answer questions, share useful content, and participate in conversations and calls. The 10% of members who do so provide a great benefit to the other 90%.
