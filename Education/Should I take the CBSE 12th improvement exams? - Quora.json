            "answer_text": "First thing you made sure is that you are dropping a year if you are sure of dropping for IIT then go ahead but keep in mind these time you have to work hard and forget about past and don't wait for tomorrow by just starting now . 1. Wait for IIT to annouce top 20 percentile if it is less than 83 percent and you are sure of working hard next year and cracking IIT then no need to give CBSE exam again but I would recommend you to give cbse improvement exam because its a gain-gain situation for you . To let you understand gain gain situation let me tell you some important rules of cbse improvement exam Rule of cbse improvement exam : 1. Even if you fail in CBSE improvement exam then also you will considered passes because you will be getting marks sheets of both the years , so whichever year you pass with better percent you may use that mark sheet and throw other out in garbage . 2. Your percent can never decrease even if you give cbse improvement exam because cbse says while calculating your percent you can use best marks of the two years marks sheet . let me give you a example mark sheet 1 physics -90 chemistry - 88 maths - 99 english - 33 additional - 88 mark sheet 2 physics -88 chemistry - 91 maths - 84 english - 89 additional - 95 So now you can calculate your percent by considering the best marks of the above two marks sheet total marks = physics(90)+chemistry(91)+maths(99)+english(89)+additional(95)percent= total marks /5Only loss or cons of above method is that you have to carry both marks sheet for your entire life and also jee main ,advanced dont follow above method they will calculate the percent from only one mark sheet , so you will have to provide them the roll no. of best mark sheet( which have highest percent). Now coming to second part of question Yes during filling of jee main form they will ask ( passed or appearing ) and also you will have to provide you previous years marks but then you have to select the option that you will be appearing for improvement exam but no need to worry about that as you may provide either year roll no. or roll no of marks sheet which is having better percent. Now coming to your third part of question Yes IIT , BITS and nearly every college will accept you improvement exam marks . So don't worry about future and stop wasting time on social networking sites and just study because you will never realize when these 10 months time will pass and you will be in same situation . fell free to ask if you have doubt :-)Have a look at comments below this answer , I have answered many specific queries related to improvement exam !

            "answer_text": "Improvement Exam is one of the biggest issues student face when it comes to appearing for JEE. They come across several doubts and queries that require expert assistance. In fact, in the last few days, we have received several questions on our blog. Some of the common queries are what is improvement exam? What is the procedure to give improvement exam? How to apply for improvement exam? Hence, we have decided to dedicate a blog post to all those who want to know everything about CBSE Improvement Exam. CBSE IMPROVEMENT EXAM Out of the total number of candidate who plans to give JEE, some are usually dissatisfied with their score in board exams. There is good news for such students. They can now be able to increase their marks by appearing for Improvement Exam. However, a student needs to give improvement exam in all five subjects to be eligible for JEE. They are not allowed to appear in additional subjects and the subjects, in which they are marked as failed. Students simply need to prepare for theory exam, as their practical marks will be added in the improvement exam results. Students appearing for CBSE Improvement Exam can also appear as private candidates. This means it is not mandatory to attend regular classes/school lectures to appear in the exam. IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT CBSE IMPROVEMENT EXAM Only candidates, who had qualified the Secondary School Examination of the CBSE Board, will be eligible to appear for CBSE Improvement Exam.For candidates from other boards, there is NIOS \u2013 The National Institute of Open Schooling (working on the concept of On-Demand Examination).Candidates appearing for improvement exam cannot pursue higher studies during this course.Those giving improvement in all subjects can also appear as regular school candidates.Students simply need to prepare for theory exam, as their practical marks will be added in the improvement exam results. If the candidate has failed in practical, he/she need to appear for both theory and practical exam, irrespective of the fact that he/she has already cleared the theory examination.Candidates appearing for CBSE Improvement Exam are issued a new marksheet, reflecting their revised marks.New passing certificate is not issued, since the previous year\u2019s passing certificate is still valid.CBSE Improvement Exam Application Forms are of two types \u2013 DISSCE (exclusively for Government Schools in Delhi) and AISSCE (for private schools \u2013All India level).Cost of the CBSE Improvement Exam Application Form is usually INR 10.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON CBSE IMPROVEMENT EXAM Question 1 \u2013 How many times can I give CBSE Improvement Exam? Answer \u2013 Only one attempt in the succeeding year is permitted for improvement exam. Question 2 \u2013 In how many subjects, do I need to appear for Improvement Exam? Answer \u2013 For JEE, a candidate is required to take up improvement exam in all five (5) subjects. However, for general, candidates can appear in one or more than one subject (s) as per his/her choice. Also, the improvement exam can be taken only in the successive year of passing Class XIIth exam. Questions 3 \u2013 Can a candidate simultaneously appear for Improvement as well as Additional Subject Examination? Answer \u2013 No, a candidate appearing for Improvement Exam in one or more subjects cannot appear for additional subject examination simultaneously. Question 4 \u2013 Will I get passing certificate after clearing the Improvement Exam? Answer \u2013 No, only a statement of marks is issued by the board after clearing the CBSE Improvement Exam.. Question 5 \u2013 I wish to improve my performance in Class 12 th Chemistry and Mathematics subjects. Is it possible? How? Answer \u2013 A candidate who has qualified Class 12 th examination of CBSE board may re-appear for improvement of performance in one or more subjects in the main examination in the succeeding year only. The candidate may appear privately, however those re-appearing for all subjects can also appear as regular candidate, if admitted by the school. Question 6 \u2013 Is it safe to give CBSE Improvement Exam? Answer \u2013 Of course yes! CBSE Improvement Exam is as safe as giving the board exams, since you are actually appearing in CBSE Board Exams. The question papers, exam dates, result will be same as for other regular candidates. You will get a new marksheet issued by CBSE. The improvement marksheet is different from board marksheet and even if you have 2 marksheets with you, the combination of marks of both the marksheets are valid if you are applying for a college. (Please note that some colleges and universities have different policies for improvement exam like BITS). ",
