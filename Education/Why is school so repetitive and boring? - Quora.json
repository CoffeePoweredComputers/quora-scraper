Most likely though\u2026and also the reason why I\u2019m not working on an assignment in the class I\u2019m in right now\u2026is the fact that there is no clear relationship between effort and reward for students. Sure, you do the assignment to get good grades. And good grades lead you to good colleges. Which then gets you good jobs. But right now, none of that effort is really given a result. What\u2019s the point in one of those busy work assignments? Does it teach us time management? Maybe how to find words in a word search better? Or to be able to solve logic puzzles more easily? Because surely, when I become a lawyer or a doctor, I will need to know which house had which person of a different nationality and a certain type of cigar and pet. (I\u2019m referring to one of Einstein\u2019s logic puzzles.) Either way, the assignment seems useless and therefore students give little care about it. It doesn\u2019t challenge them. Granted, some end up doing it and turning it in any way because it\u2019s something you can do without thinking much, but the question of why still exists. What I wish schools would do better at is teaching students on how to adult. Help us find jobs, learn how to deal with confrontation or communication better, teach us how to create a study or learning system catered to our needs. Teach us about taxes, focus on the system of governments and how things are in our country and why. I don\u2019t want to wait for senior year to start learning about this. Trust me, if I can shoot a gun or drive a car or get a job before I\u2019ve had the opportunity to analyze the government\u2019s role in things, or before I have an idea of what different high-paying jobs entail, or before I\u2019ve learned about basic adulting problems and how to overcome them, there\u2019s something wrong with more than students being bored.

            "answer_text": "For the most part? Because it\u2019s too easy. The American school system, assuming that that was the specific school system of this question, lacks a sense of rigor in their classes. I know what you may be thinking: b-b-but there are plenty of honors and AP classes for high schoolers to take!! Yeah there are, but what people often forget to consider is elementary school children. In my school at least, there were \u201cadvanced\u201d classes, but there were certain exams that would determine whether or not you could take them. These standardized tests were mostly on how well students could answer questions before the students were taught the information. Because the information was so foreign to students, they did not realize a purpose in trying. The US education system continually neglects the development of critical thinking skills, likely skills much more important than the things that they are actually teaching. When children are unmotivated by these tests, they consequently will be put in the lower classes. Schools tend to believe that these children are not smart because of all the low test scores; however, the real problem is that they just don\u2019t want to try. And why would they? Because of grade inflation, many \u2018smart enough\u2019 students are able to not even try and pass their classes. American students are unmotivated in their schoolwork. Additionally, these students are in the United States. They know that even if they don\u2019t end up successful, they won\u2019t have to worry because everything will work out eventually. Because of this (dare I say) privileged attitude, they don\u2019t even have a point to try. When they aren\u2019t trying, they do not perform to their best, and their teachers think classes are too hard. If these classes could become harder, students could be given a greater incentive to try and maybe our students would get just a little smarter than they are now. :) I saw this the other day and thought it fit well:  ",
