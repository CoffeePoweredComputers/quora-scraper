            "answer_text": "Hi ! There is a book called \u2018ENGLISH GRAMMAR IN USE\u2019 by RAYMOND MURPHY which I used when I was in France working as an English language Trainer. I found this book very well written and presented. . . One page with grammar rules and examples, and the opposite page with exercises corresponding to the rules covered. It is simple but the explanations are very well presented. I would recommend this book which you may obtain, either at a bookshop like Higginbothams or through Amazon. (To be a good Editor, you would need to be a master of the grammar rules of the language!!!) Class 10 grammar would have covered most of the subjects but, you would need to do extensive reading and expose yourself to the different styles of writing. Good luck ! ",
