            "answer_text": "As a student in the 21st Century myself, there are definitely certain skills you should be focusing on. However, these vary depending on what type of student you are or are interested in being. A high school student will require slightly different skills (e.g. good listening skills, research skill, problem solving skills, etc.) than a college student(e.g. effective written and oral skills, adaptability, critical thinking, etc.), a college student will require different skills than a self-taught entrepreneur and so on. I\u2019m going to assume, however, that you\u2019re interested in the self-learning path. For this type of \u201cstudents\u201d you will need the following skills. And I\u2019m not saying these are the only skills you\u2019ll need, but they are a good place to start if you already have a good grasp on the basic learning skills mentioned in the examples above. ConsistencySelf-DisciplineFocusConsistency In the self-learning world you have to be able to develop a routine and keep the momentum going. This is exactly what consistency is. If you start learning and truly want to become good at it, keep doing it, keep learning, keep investigating. This will separate you from the pack and give you a tremendous advantage since not everyone has what it takes to stay consistent. Self-Discipline Consistency goes hand in hand with discipline, for without it you won\u2019t be able to stay consistent. Learning in and of itself is hard. This is especially true for self-taught persons. Therefore, if you truly want to make progress in your learning journey, you have to work on being more disciplined. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to go through enormous amounts of uncomfortable situations in order to accomplish your goal (though it can be this way sometimes). Rather, it means that you have your learning goals well defined and do everything in your power to meet those goals. Try to make it easy for yourself to meet your goals. Focus Attention in the 21st century has become more and more scarce. There are tons of things trying to get our attention from many different directions. That is why focusing while you learn is of outmost importance. You have to be able to go into your learning sessions with 100% of your focus directed to it. This way you will make sure to be making the most out of your learning time. By focusing, you\u2019re also reducing the amount of time you have to study overall since you will be able to retain the information more efficiently. These are just some of the skills you need to be an effective student in 2020. However, there are a ton more you should master such as curiosity, analytical skills, and others. Hope this helped, and if this isn\u2019t the type of student you were referring to or had in mind, feel free to specify it and I\u2019ll do my best to answer accordingly. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well considering we are entering 2019, 2020 is around the corner. Here are the top skills that would be valuable to anything you are doing, whether working for yourself or for an organization. This topic has been discussed in detail by the World Economic Forum, as they have mentioned that we are on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. There are some valid points, but here are six of the ten mentioned, with my personal thoughts: Critical-Thinking. In our ever increasing automated world, employing logic and reasoning to direct those machines (think of A.I.) would be important.Creativity. This is why I encourage everyone to do things for themselves, like write, or create something because it exercises this muscle. It fosters innovation, pushes critical thinking and in a world where we are navigating new technologies, pushing new products and services are important leveraging newer tools to reach new audiences will become more valuable.Adaptability. One of the key traits that leads to resentment in this world, is the resistance to adapt and change with rapid technological advances. This manifests in to politics and plays in to the electorate. Keep up with trends, study new tools and see how careers are being shifted so you are not caught off track.Decision-Making Ability. With vast amount of content and data, decision making could be seem like it\u2019s more of a mission. With the assistance of data analytics, being able to analyze, make sense and making informed decisions as a business (whether you are in one, or running your own) will be key in the information age.Negotiation. This has been a key skill identified by the World Economic Forum, however, I would personally argue that the art of negotiation and interpersonal skills should be honed in on during the grade school years. A lot of people are afraid to ask for what they want in understanding their self worth. This could be a tough transition to ask for in the working world if the formal educational system has them institutionalized.Relationship Management Skills. The World Economic Forum has cited the rise of technology signifying the importance of people management and people oriented skills. This is especially true in leadership and management. However, this could be extended to other aspects other than business but on a more personal level. Trying to replace people with technology is a self-defeating endeavor and the statistics show that is it not working, causing a lot of isolation, loneliness and in some cases depression. ",
