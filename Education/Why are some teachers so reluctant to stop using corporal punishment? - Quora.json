You can lose your teaching credential. You can get sued. And you can lose your job. A whole bunch of reasons not to use corporal punishment. I can only talk about California and US education. I can\u2019t speak to practices in other parts of the world. ",

            "answer_text": "No idea if 'why' is even the case. As far as I know corporal punishement is very rare today. At least in Sweden it is. Dunno about the states though. If I had to say something it probably boils down to the sense of power it might give those individual teachers who, in that case, are still punishing their pupils with physical force of any kind. What they might lack in the pedagogical department they make up for with physical means. If you ask me it's plain wrong. But as I said it's something that's not common practice at all anymore. It's kind of like asking \u201cwhy are some people reluctant to stop using physical force?\u201d overall. Some people do because they either get a kick out of it or because they don't know what else to do. Some think it's the only way they have to 'demand' respect from their students. Especially if they can't earn it by knowledge or presence. Neither of those should be working in schools in the first place. Teachers are role models and their behaviour sets the bar from which our children has to build their own future. Only parents, siblings and family are more important in that aspect of their everyday lives. ",
