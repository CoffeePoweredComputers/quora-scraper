            "answer_text": "First of all relax and keep calm, almost everyone undergoes such situation atleast once in life. If you have the blueprint and weightage of syllabus then first go through it carefully so you will get an idea that on which chapters you have to spend more time and on which less. If you don't have blueprint then call a friend but remember only necessary talk.Now as it is the peak time give up all social networking sites such as facebook, whatsapp etc But don\u2019t forget to do exercise daily for 30 minutes as it will boost your concentration.First of all complete those topics, which you had left half ( keeping weightage in mind)Now take a quick revision of chapters you are confident with.Solve previous year's question paper for practice.If you still have some topics left unread then go through only such topics who have more weightage. As you have already solved some previous year's papers so you know what type of questions will come, Read them all.Don't try to make much use of refrences as it is high time now, just stick to your textbook and class notes.Don't compromise much with your diet and sleep.Take 5 min break after every study session of 45 mins. But remember just 5 mins.And most important keep calm, prepare well and start studying now. All the best.",
