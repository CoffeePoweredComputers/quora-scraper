            "answer_text": "English isn\u2019t necessarily more important than mathematics. It really depends on what occupation you have, and/or what you are using these skills you learnt in school for. For example, if you had a job as a professional athlete, you wouldn\u2019t have any need for maths, but you would need english to communicate to the people around you. But for someone that has a job at a bank, then you will have to use math every day of your life. With that said, english is still slightly more important than math because every occupation, and I am telling you EVERY occupation, requires a certain level of english and communication. Thanks for reading and I hope this helped. ",
