            "answer_text": "Yeah, I know there are 100+ answers and I\u2019m probably not adding anything too new, but I keep seeing this one pop up in my feed and I have a variety of perspectives on it. Currently, I love school. Previously, I hated school. Before that, I was ambivalent. Before that, I hated it, and before that I liked it, mostly. I\u2019ve seen a number of current students reflecting some of my thoughts at the time, but at 28 I have a more evolved perspective, and can more easily figure out what the \u201creal\u201d problem I had was, rather than the somewhat played out \u201cwhen will I use\u2026\u201d type of issues. I have a much more nuanced opinion on that issue, but that\u2019s probably appropriate for a different answer. I had different reasons for loving or hating school throughout time, and the fun thing about being an adult is that it\u2019s harder to dismiss my answer due to ageism. Even more fun, I teach. So its even harder to dismiss. Elementary school: I generally liked it since I could see my friends, make arts and crafts, and learn things. I felt trapped by homework often, and some problems that seem small from an adult perspective were huge, such as my handwriting. My handwriting has always been awful, but it was a source of great distress in elementary school as we got a letter grade for it. I would regularly get B-\u2019s and C\u2019s. There\u2019s literally no perspective for an elementary schooler that gets in trouble because of a C in Handwriting, no way to know that your problem isn\u2019t actually the end of the world. I imagine a lot of elementary schoolers begin to get poisoned on school in this way, because without actual experience and points of reference, and with a society that says \u201cyou are your letter grades,\u201d how can you not? Its also a bit early in development to start questioning things to a really deep level, and behave in a way that isn\u2019t merely reactive to your environment. By 5th grade though, I hated school. Not just because of the homework or seemingly nonsensical structures forced on us, but because I was actively bullied by both students and my teacher. I have written about this in other answers, but the school environment is toxic to a lot of students, so any benefit you might be getting by being there is overridden by its sheer toxicity. School becomes synonymous with pain. Middle school: I was overall ambivalent toward school in middle school. It was a tough transition period but I was being challenged academically, had a friend group, and good teachers so it was better overall. I find it hard to claim I \u201chated school\u201d in middle school so it\u2019s a good contrast. I also had enough free time to pursue some hobbies and have fun. If school has supportive teachers, a good friend/support group, time to pursue their own interests, and classes that generally match developmental levels, it is a good experience. However, that combination is a rare unicorn. \u201cWhy do many students hate school?\u201d They don\u2019t have this winning combination. High school: I hated high school so much. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot redeemable about it, except maybe marching band. Reasons: ~I slept through 1\u20132 classes everyday after getting up at 530 to be sitting in class by 715. In middle school, I slept on the bus, because middle school started later than high school and we dropped the high schoolers off before driving to the middle school. I usually tried to grab a window seat and passed out on my backpack. High school? Nope, I slept through first or second period instead. Every couple weeks I would come home from school pass out uncontrollably on my bed until about dinner, when I would eat and then go to bed early. I tried to go to bed earlier but couldn\u2019t fall asleep until after midnight no matter what I did, even if I just laid in bed and stared at the ceiling, or tried to meditate. My problems with this were generally belittled as me not trying hard enough. My senior year I got \u201clate arrival\u201d by scheduling study hall first period and having my parents fill out a permission slip to let me drive myself in late (this is a privilege for seniors only that was offered by the school, I wasn\u2019t some special case). I got a 4.0 my senior year. This is not a coincidence. Sometimes I imagine what my life would have been like in high school if I had late arrival starting freshman year. It\u2019s depressing. ~Utter powerlessness and grappling with double standards. This is the root of most of the answers. This ties into helicopter parenting, having a schedule handed to you, being told what to do, having your questions and concerns belittled because of your age, being told \u201cyou think you know everything because you are a teenager\u201d when you\u2019re asking questions so you can understand what you know you don\u2019t understand, being restrained by nonsensical dress codes, being told that every single quiz will make or break your chances at college, questioning forbidden topics such as religion and societal mores, being told to stop being lazy and get a job in an economically depressed area, but being told you can\u2019t even apply for certain kinds of jobs or in certain towns that have more opportunities, and so on. A lot of other answer-ers had similar problems, and it all boils down to the sheer powerlessness of being old enough to begin to reason and understand and running headlong into a huge gilded cage built by \u201cadults\u201d. A gilded cage is still a cage. ~An economically poor district. This one was especially bad in my area. We were not a rich district, because that\u2019s what happens when your school budgets are based on property taxes in an economically depressed region. The coal dried up, jobs got shipped overseas in the 90s, and the area still hasn\u2019t recovered. I graduated before the 2008 recession, thank goodness, but they were constantly trying to pass levies so the school districts could afford to run. These measures almost always got voted down because no one could afford to pay more for schools. As a result, our best school was\u2026 mediocre at best. Understaffed and undersupplied were the least of our problems. We were also stricken with government mandates we couldn\u2019t afford to implement, and it got worse after No Child Left Behind. I had a few teachers with ridiculous job security and no filter. I learned more about educational politics listening to them rant about the bullshit that went on behind the scenes\u2026 but ultimately there can be systemic reasons to hate school. How could anyone love attending an underfunded, overcrowded district?? ~Lack of support for TAG (talented and gifted) students coupled with overcrowding and greater higher reasoning skills so you fully understand that you\u2019re being cheated. I remember an assignment from elementary school that described the proper \u201croles\u201d of the students in class. We were a mixed class with everyone from LD-TAG. The role of the average student was to listen to the teachers, take notes, and do a(n average) job. The role of the LD students was to, well, not break anything. Just at least try, please. The role of the advanced students was to help everyone catch up to the \u201caverage\u201d level. This educational philosophy was present in almost all of my mixed-level classes. As an advanced student, I was all but ignored by a the vast majority of my teachers because I \u201cwasn\u2019t a problem\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t need help\u201d. Instead I got to sit there bored, waiting for everyone to catch up, or was told to \u201cteach my peers\u201d. In kid language, \u201cteach your peers\u201d doesn\u2019t mean tutoring them. It means handing them your answer sheet while they copy it. In elementary school, this philosophy was merely irritating. By high school, I understood what was going on and refused to participate, focusing on my own education instead by reading nonfiction during study time. I would get in trouble for going ahead. I would get in trouble for trying to learn above the level expected in class. I would get in trouble for doodling because I just couldn\u2019t take sitting there anymore. It didn\u2019t matter what I did or how good of a student I was, I was in trouble. In more advanced classes, things were a little better, but because my school district was poor, we didn\u2019t have a whole lot of advanced offerings and we had a lot of overcrowding. Even in the advanced classes this pattern sometimes cropped up, depending on the teacher. When you\u2019re getting in trouble for being a good student and learning more than is in the curriculum, how is any student expected to enjoy school???? ~Inability to motivate studentsMy teachers and parents were trying to motivate me to do better. They did this through threats and lectures. \u201cYou have a B in math, I thought you wanted to be an astronaut? If you want to do any STEM thing you have to be getting all As in math all the time or you can\u2019t do it, ever. Get your grades up. Science and math go hand in hand.\u201dGuess what I did? Gave up my dreams in STEM at the ripe old age of \u2026 12? This is the kind of \u201cmotivation\u201d most teachers and parents use, and it serves only to poison the well for the students. Want them to hate education? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing\u2026 I renewed my real interest in STEM around 26. Not \u201ctoo late\u201d but in SPITE OF school, teachers, and my parents, not because of them. I am lucky. ~Doesn\u2019t match your study / learning style. Doesn\u2019t help you learn your study / learning style. Doesn\u2019t care.Also in elementary school we did an assignment called \u2018learning styles\u2019. According to the little quiz I took I was primarily a kinesthetic learner with secondary visual. There\u2019s a bit of controversy about learning styles, but now that I\u2019m #@$%ing 28 and have had time and maturity to figure out how studying works for someone who does fit a more kinesthetic profile I can firmly state that the school districts let down everyone who has a propensity towards kinesthetic learning. In our learning styles unit I was literally told that the way a kinesthetic learner might learn best is by doing projects like \u201cmaking a diorama\u201d. I could go on for a whole answer length about how school doesn\u2019t actually teach you study skills but I\u2019ll save that rant for a question more directly about study skills. Needless to say, there\u2019s no support structure in place for someone who can\u2019t watch a lecture, take notes, and do busywork-homework. On top of this good luck if you\u2019re ADHD / have another learning disability that you can mask through high performance but that\u2019s another answer. Things are getting better for girls with ADHD now though as research is coming out showing that a lot of us got missed because they were comparing us with the kinds of hyperactive symptoms in boys. A lot of my hatred of school came from the entire system failing me, biologically, telling me that because I wasn\u2019t jumping out of my chair, climbing things, and blurting answers I must not have a problem and need to \u201ctry harder\u201d. And that\u2019s before the depression and anxiety. College: Loved it. Most of the problems of high school are gone, or at least they were for me. I went to a college that was a good fit for me with a major that was a good fit. A lot of my education was a bit more trade-based so I got to take more of what I liked and less of what I didn\u2019t. The people I saw hating college weren\u2019t ready for it right out of high school, or went to a college that wasn\u2019t a good fit. \u201cGrad School\u201d: right now I\u2019m in an odd place where I\u2019m taking grad classes but am not enrolled in a program. I\u2019m undergoing a bit of a major switch, so I have to do a lot of work before I can get into the program for real. Once again a lot of the people who hate it are in a bad fit situation. They need a different school, a different advisor, a different major. At this level, its so optional that if you don\u2019t love it, get OUT. K-12 doesn\u2019t have that option. You can\u2019t just enroll in a different school. You can\u2019t just drop out and get a job with the Bachelors\u2019 or Masters\u2019 you already have. You can\u2019t change majors. Also because it\u2019s an Ivy, I also see an alarming subset of undergrads that are still under their parents\u2019 boots. Some of the legacy kids didn\u2019t really choose to come here, they were told by their parents that they were coming here because it\u2019s a family tradition. Some were forced into becoming study machines in their teenage years in order to apply to Ivies, and are just following steps A->B->C because its what they were told they had to do \u201cfor success\u201d. Some of them are still pursuing their parents\u2019 dreams rather than their own. Contrast that to most of my classmates in undergrad (myself included) who had to fight their parents to even be allowed to attend. I don\u2019t know how anyone who lacks agency while being a legal adult could have any positive feelings toward school, even as an undergrad when you\u2019re supposed to be truly discovering yourself. (Obviously, for the inevitable commenter, this isn\u2019t the whole undergrad population, that\u2019s why I said \u201csubset\u201d. Also obviously, for the inevitable Ivy league undergrad commenter, you\u2019re not going to be able to recognize this agency-less behavior until after you\u2019ve been out off the academic escalator for a few years. In fact, I guarantee at least one of your \u201coverachiever\u201d peers is displaying it. It comes from overachieving without deeply asking \u201cwhy\u201d and just because your token buddy can get an A in philosophy 101 doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re self-examined.) Anyway if you made it down here, thanks for putting up with the whole answer, this is one of those topics I could write a book about, and held back considerably while crafting this answer. If you\u2019re still in K-12 prison, keep your chin up. I\u2019m rooting for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Ooh boy\u2026 where do I begin? I guess we can start with: they hear our pleas and complaints but they always say something like, \u201cyour just lazy\u201d or \u201cyour not trying hard enough\u201d or \u201cmaybe it just isn\u2019t your thing (even though they continue to relentlessly pound the supposed square pig in the round hole.)\u201d or \u201cyour a failure\u201d or \u201cyour just a whiny teenager with hormonal imbalances who just wants something to complain about.\u201d If we try to speak up about how our educational system is a disfunctional pile of crap, they dismiss us. We can\u2019t change the way the school works! That means I\u2019m trapped! Stuck! Imprisoned in a system that confines me and tortures me and despite my desperate pleas for mercy, the gears of tyrant and oppression march on! I\u2019m helpless! There\u2019s nothing I can do to change this piece of crap! I speak up for myself and I\u2019m sure for others as well, but to no avail! It drives me past the bounds of sanity that I am trapped in a system that seems to actively work against me, claiming its pushing me forward! I\u2019m sick of that Bs! (Excuse me there, I don\u2019t usually curse but sometimes you have to emphasize your points a bit!) a good analogy for the educational systems way of \u201cpreparing you for the real world\u201d is throwing you, unarmed, in a pit of hungry wolves in an attempt to teach you how to defend yourself from a person. It\u2019s rediculous! Retarded! And nothing short of stupid. Ok I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard me rant about that long enough that you get the picture. We have no freedom. You scoff at how immature and exaggerated it is when someone compares school to prison but, trust me, they aren\u2019t wrong. Classroom: corrective class program thing/jail cell Lunch: honestly, their isn\u2019t much difference here. Just look at the food! Detention: solitary confinement Expulsion: the needle/electric chair Seriously! You\u2019re locked in a room in a locked building. You are expected to stay there, do meaningless work. Your punished for even speaking. Punished for questioning things. Your told when to speak, when to move, when to pee! \u201cNoncompliance\u201d is a sin worthy of capital punishment. Expected to trust your superiors unquestioningly with utmost respect regardless of whether they deserve it or not. Forced to follow a schedule whether it\u2019s convenient for you or not. Heck! If that isn\u2019t prison enough, A lot of schools even have barred doors and windows! Homework is unnecessary. Have you heard someone say they have too much homework? Did you think they were being lazy or not working hard enough or procrastinating? Well, I don\u2019t know if they were or not cause I wasn\u2019t there, but, I doubt they were complaining without cause. The workload is rediculous, unnecessary, and downright stupid. It does not \u201creinforce\u201d any learning (memorization) that took place in the classroom. If your student got an answer right on the homework or test, it probably wasn\u2019t because of the homework! I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret! If the student already knows something, repeating the information any number of times won\u2019t make them know the information any more than they did before! I know right! What a crazy idea! But it\u2019s true! I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve \u201clearned\u201d the water cycle in ten years of school, but I can tell you that I knew the water cycle the very first time it was taught! SO WHY ARE WE GOING OVER IT TEN MORE TIMES?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! We aren\u2019t actually learning. We\u2019re memorizing. I don\u2019t even remember what we \u201clearned\u201d about last semester let alone last year! Even if we were truly learning, we\u2019re learning useless stuff (as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard a million times) but No matter how many times you\u2019ve heard it, it\u2019s still just as true! I\u2019m never going to need to know how Romeo and Juliet relates to Pyramus and Thisbe! I\u2019m never going to need to know how 10,000 year old Japanese rice farms were structured! And I\u2019ll sure as heck never need to know how cobalt is extracted! Freaking cobalt extraction! Seriously? Even if I were to become a cobalt miner, I could learn that in the job! And if I for some reason didn\u2019t, I could do a quick google search! But in the likely case that I will never use that information, that was a sure waste of those three days! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this argument at least a thousand times so I\u2019ll stop here with this point but never you forget how true it is! Also, stop with the BS about how the useless information \u201cteaches us how to think or react\u201d or \u201chow to handle social situations\u201d because you and I can both see that, if that is the intent, it has sure as hell failed miserably. They treat us like we\u2019re all the same. Another thing that really gets me is that no one seems to understand that everyone is different! Everyone thinks differently, is wired differently, learns differently, has different passions and strengths and weaknesses, has different interests and ignoring this fact has been shown to not work out. So\u2026 strp et! If it doesn\u2019t work, which it clearly doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t use it! The current \u201ccookie cutter\u201d method is crap. Not only do children have different strengths and weaknesses, but they also have varying levels of intelligence and thus learning speeds. When we force kids of this variety to go at one pace, the smarter kids get bored, decide to get ahead (and somehow get in trouble for it), or lose their patience for school altogether (me) and what little growth they might have gained from our dystopian education is stunted! The slower kids are left behind, stunting what little growth they might have experienced. The average kids get to keep up, but, then they realize that it\u2019s all pointless. This \u201cone size fits all\u201d method is trash and must be thrown out as such. School doesn\u2019t care if your learning. It\u2019s obvious in the way they prioritize things. everyone ive encountered claims that school is where you learn or it\u2019s a place of enlightenment and higher thinking. That idea is garbage. It is painfully obvious by how much emphasis they put on grades and standardized tests that they only care about their ranking among other schools. Any learning I\u2019ve done in the ten years of my being in school, was done on my own time (which hasn\u2019t been much.) I questioned what causes gravity when I was in fifth grade, the teacher was still going over the water cycle. I was punished because I was curious. They still haven\u2019t even covered the life cycle of a star and it\u2019s sophomore year of high school! If they really wanted me to learn, they would have embraced and encouraged that kind of questioning. But instead, they shut me up and forced me to continue the face level evaluation of things that I probably would have concluded before then if I wasn\u2019t caught up in their stupid busywork. The emphasis on standardized testing is a dead give away that they don\u2019t care one wit what you\u2019ve learned. They only care if you can earn them a high number on the scoreboard. The fact that they\u2019ve even considered using standardized tests to evaluate their students worth or potential is mind blowing to me. Heck! Even the creator said that they are too crude to be used! But does anyone care? No. They just keep marching on, pretending they don\u2019t hear our pleas for help or our rallying cries. They require us to wake up at an ungodly hour. I wake up a little after 5 to hop in some clothes, grab a quick cup of extra caffeinated coffee, and run out the door to the hell we call school. I arrive at school tired, unthinking, and unable to reason. Zombie like, i trudge through my first four classes, not learning nor able to think due to extreme exhaustion. Then, at lunch, I finally wake up, only to find myself tired and trying to recover from the first half of the day. I arrive home pretty much brain dead. I usually get about nine hours of sleep. You are probably thinking, \u201cdude, that\u2019s plenty of time! What are you? Insomniac or depressed or something?\u201d To the latter of which I would say yes. But that\u2019s beside the point. The reason why we are so tired is because getting 9 hours of sleep and getting 9 hours of sleep when your circadian rhythm tells you to, are two different things. I could dive into the science of that but I can\u2019t right now. (You can always look it up yourself too!) We are punished for learning. Instead of encouraging us to learn from our mistakes, the school makes us feel like failures, or incompetent or stupid, when if they really were there to have us learn, they should rejoice at our mistakes. An F shouldn\u2019t stand for failure, instead it should stand for \u201cfind another answer.\u201d They always say that you should learn from your mistakes and then they quote famous people and say things like \u201cI failed (insert obscenely large number here) times but that just means I found (same obscenely large number as before) ways not to make a lightbulb.\u201d But their actions don\u2019t support their words. would they have punished me for turning in an assignment literally six seconds late?!?!!?!?!?! No, I think not. But they did anyway! Their lack of justice. We\u2019ve all heard stories about someone getting mugged in the stairwell or jumped on in the bathrooms, but when the kid defends themselves (especially if they succeeded in doing so) the defender is always punished instead of the actual offender. Then, someone puts a sticky note with a knock knock joke on it on a friends locker, and they get detention for a week! (True Story) needless to say, our schools need a major overhaul. No free time. Believe it or not, free time is very valuable and even essential to any child or teenagers healthy development. Let\u2019s say school did everything right except for giving students free time, those students would still become depressed, demotivated, and unhappy to say the least. Why? Teenagers must be social! (Obviously, Not unless they don\u2019t want to of course (duh!)) socialization is crucial for a teenagers healthy development and is essential for a child to be around allowed to play with other children! It\u2019s a must! And it\u2019s one of the most important things that schools overlook! In fact, most of the time, an hour of social time can be much more beneficial and educational to a teenager than if that time was used for learning! I know it\u2019s hard to believe right? The bathroom situation. \u201cNo, jimmy, I\u2019m teaching class right now\u201d \u201cBut si-\u201c \u201cSHUT UP JIMMY AND LET ME TEACH! YOu shoUlD hAVE gOnE tO dA BatHroOM at lunch or study hall!\u201d \u201cExcuse me sir!\u201d \u201cJIMMY I-\u201c \u201cSir, if I had to go to the bathroom during lunch or study hall, I believe I would have gone during lunch or study hall\u201d *teacher gasps and sputters at the horrible disrespect* \u201cSurely, sir, you don\u2019t think I would have held it all this time, saving it just for your class did you? Besides, if you hold that policy to me, you must then hold it to everyone else in the school. Can you imagine what chaos would ensue? Can you fathom a single bathroom with 5000+ kids in there at the same time? Essentially, you would have a singularity of students, and I fail to see how that would be very helpful. Especially when they lack enough sense to not cram twenty rolls of toilet paper in the toilet, or pee in the flood drain, or write curse words on the walls in their own feces! So stop restricting our relieval of bodily fluids before someone gets a bladder infection or something! They dumb it down too much. I can\u2019t tell you how many times we\u2019ve gone over the water cycle. We\u2019ve gone over WW1 +2 at least three times since the start of middle school, and they\u2019re doing it again! This has to be at least the tenth time we\u2019ve had to sit through a lecture on the parts of the cell, or the rock cycle. It\u2019s like they ran out of stuff to cram down our throats, so they cram stuff they\u2019ve already used down our throats again. I already know when and where Christopher Columbus landed. I already memorized the parts of a cell (about a thousand times! I mean, who could forget that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell?). If I already know it, why do we keep going over it? Perhaps they do add in more details every time they go over something, but why don\u2019t they do that the first time??????? Is something \u201cnot school appropriate for this early an age?\u201d Good, go over it later, but don\u2019t redo the lesson six times!!!!!!!! Use that time to build some common sense. Teach them how use a tool correctly (there are way too many people in this world who don\u2019t know how use a knife, and many more people who are deathly afraid of knives and anyone who uses them because they\u2019ve heard stories of the idiots who use them incorrectly.) honestly, I think that this would be a much better way to spend that time than under-explaining something ten different times. They put all the blame on the teachers or the parents. Although, this isn\u2019t necessarily a reason that kids don\u2019t like school, it is also a big problem that, if fixed, would improve educational quality. Teachers are expected to teach to many different students of many different intelligence levels, interests, ways of thinking, personality, etc, and they are expected to do that job rediculously well. They have to deal with the administration screaming in their left ear, parents in their right, and the children at their throat, all with very little pay. To say that teachers have one of the most important jobs in the world would not be an overstatement, and yet they are under funded. teachers who should not be teachers are allowed to continue teaching, while the really good teachers who actually know how to do their job (who I love and respect as real jewels) are treated like trash. They do not care that they are assholes. It is quite obvious from their lack of action that they do not plan on fixing this disfuntional pile of degenerate scum we call \u201cthe Ameraican educational system.\u201d Anytime soon (unless it involves throwing more money at the school, or standardized testing.) They are forcing an entire generation to rely on a corrupt system thus, messing up our imperfect world even more. But then again, who cares right? We\u2019re all humans. i guess that\u2019s what we\u2019re best at isn\u2019t it? Messing things up, Ruining lives, crushing dreams, destroying our future, focusing on the red herrings rather than the big picture, it\u2019s what we do, and I guess it would appear many of us take great pride in that.
