            "answer_text": "Well, you\u2019re not likely to have spent 15 years in a private school, unless you were there from babyhood. But let\u2019s assume 10 years. Still a bit scary. A good friend of my two sons was in this situation. He had been a pupil at one of England\u2019s most famous, ancient and prestigious schools, but got thrown out (I can\u2019t remember why) and as a punishment, his parents (tired of spending money on his education) sent him to one of the three local state schools. As this was in Winchester, which is a very civilised town, it could have been much worse; all three of the state secondary schools there are pretty good. But he was terrified, \u201cwetting myself,\u201d was the way he once described it to me. As things worked out, he needn\u2019t have worried. On his second day there, the Drama teacher was auditioning people for parts in the next school play, and this young man was so stunningly good that he got the leading role (and he was very good in it). By his third day he was known throughout the school, and he just never looked back. He was happy, he had plenty of friends, and he did very well. But he\u2019s never forgotten how scared he was when he first went there. So a lot depends on you. Kids are kids, and just because they are not at an expensive school doesn\u2019t mean they have to be horrible people. Most of them are just normal. ",

            "answer_text": "While 15 years will take you past graduation, and therefore isn\u2019t quite possible, I can speak to transitioning from a private education to a public one (and from a public education to a private one). It\u2019s rough. When I went to a public school for the first time, I was a bit shocked. Compared to the passionate places of learning I was used to, this place was dingy and apathetic. Teaching was uninspired, and tests were boring scantrons. The students were burned out and were so pressured about grades and future success that it was hard to build friendships. Of course, I only experienced one admittedly subpar public school and I'm not one who fits that system too well. It's probable that you'll have a far more enjoyable experience than I. Good luck! ",
