            "answer_text": "My answer is mixed. I\u2019ll say \u201cyes, I recommend teaching\u201d with a monstrous caveat. Pros: Teaching is great. Kids are great. You\u2019ll improve lives, help young people grow, and grow yourself. You\u2019ll never have the same day twice - the job has to be at the absolute bottom of the list of most boring jobs. It\u2019s an adventure. It\u2019s emotionally stimulating. And it\u2019s fun a lot of the time. Cons: Teaching is great. Working in a school? That can be a nightmare. Schools range from \u201ca joy to work in\u201d to \u201cthe most toxic work environments on Earth\u201d. How can you tell which kind you\u2019ll work in? You likely can\u2019t - you\u2019ll take the job you can get and you\u2019ll find out later. Often \u201clater\u201d is too late for you to move. In addition, you\u2019ll not only never be rich, but you\u2019re likely to be lower-case \u201cp\u201d poor for at least a decade. Oh, and the problems of the world are often blamed on you. Teaching has a pretty high turnover rate, especially for newer teachers: The US is having a hard time keeping teachers in their jobs and they leave mostly because of problems with administration, though money and \u201cpursuing another job\u201d play a role:  Teachers Are Leaving the Profession At an Alarming Rate  So what\u2019s the monstrous caveat? Well, there\u2019s a pretty decent chance you\u2019ll spend 4\u20136 years getting a bachelor\u2019s degree / teaching certificate / master\u2019s degree, get into teaching, and flame out in your first 5 years (about half of teachers do). Now what? So, here\u2019s the caveat: Do not get an education degree only. If you get a bachelor\u2019s degree in education, get your master\u2019s degree in something else not related to education. If you get a bachelor\u2019s degree in something other than education, try to get it in a subject area or something outside of education entirely, like an MBA. This way, if you decide teaching isn\u2019t for you, you have an easier exit strategy. I wish I didn\u2019t have to be so cynical about teaching - the job itself really is about as good as a career gets. You get to really make a difference talking about your favorite subject each and every day. Who could want anything more? But the structure of schools, the problems of poverty and drug abuse and crime and trauma, and the presence of bad actors and malicious administrators can make the job all but undoable. I leave you with a piece of advice my student teaching supervisor told me more than 20 years ago: Teaching is like fishing. No one catches all the fish. On your best days, you\u2019ll catch more fish. On your worst days, you won\u2019t catch any fish. That\u2019s OK. Just try to catch more fish. Be well, educators. Remember that you are doing the real work of changing lives. And, if you decide to leave, I get it. I get it. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, let's spill some hot tea. If you care about kids, teaching is probably the most exhausting, heartbreaking, and fulfilling jobs that exists. If you don't, it's dull and easy. Let's break that down, starting with the teachers that don't try. Here's how you teach if you don't really care. You give the kids worksheets on the daily. You use the book A LOT. Most of your grading is based on the appearance of work. You give decent grades, because no one complains about decent grades. The kids leave your class not having learned much but not having that much to complain about. You get a few kids who are smart and want more (not that the other kids aren't necessarily smart, just that they don't care much) but there aren't really enough complaints from other kids for administration to take much notice. You make few connections with kids. You probably aren't remembered by many. These teachers exist. I have worked with many and my heart bleeds for their students. Freshman love teachers like this, they let kids get away with whatever, but by about junior year, kids who have had a lot of teachers like that realize that they've been denied a real education. If you want to be a teacher, look for teachers like that so that you know not to take their advice. Now, what is your day like if you care? The bell rings at 7:50, but you get there early because you need to get copies made and your boards set up, so you come in between 7 and 7:30. You probably have a stack of grading to do, tests to write, planning that still needs to happen. As you come in, you see the kids who have to come in even earlier because for whatever reason they need to be dropped off by five or six. You know them. You say hi and check in. You teach from bell to bell for each class. When the kids are there, you are \u201con.\u201d You are ready to help. You're not quite you, but the you who can feed the kids positivity at all times, the you with a really long temper who is always ready to show the kids that their failure is an opportunity to learn, even if it's a failure to learn something they should have gotten three years ago, because you know there are deficits in what they should have been taught, so you aren't just a ninth grade teacher, but you also have to bring them through sixth grade concepts. The kids sometimes complain about you, because your class is hard and you don't tend to give good grades, but kids can't tell the difference always between easy and good. Sometimes they encourage each other not to take your class, because this other teacher is an easy \u201cA,\u201d and you are not. Sometimes they get mad about this. You teach for five to six hours, depending on whether or not you teach an auxiliary course. Maybe you have nutrition and lunch to sit, or maybe you've had to promise your lunch to a kid who needs to take a test or maybe some kids need your help catching up on work. If you've succeeded at building a culture of learning in your classroom, you know the kids have learned something, but if you messed up in the first couple weeks of the year, a lot of your day has been discipline and you hope the kids got some of the ideas while you were trying to quiet the other half of the room down. After school, if it's not a professional development day, you have a pile to grade of staggering size and you need to figure out how close to your plan for the semester your students are, or maybe you've been struggling with your planning and you are currently working week to week. If some of your kids are struggling or behaving poorly, you are calling home. You are already exhausted, but there is more to do. You're brain is focused on the things that didn't go right, but you try to focus on the class that wanted to ask questions and maybe they didn't get exactly what you planned out of the day, but they engaged, or maybe you are thinking about the student that you convinced to see the on campus social worker who told you that she got hooked up with a therapist and it's going well. You try to find the victories and not focus on the young teacher who is struggling and having to ask if they can handle staying in the profession. But you also keep that email in your metaphorical back pocket of the kid who's doing well at UC Davis who had an easy time in their chem class today because they remember what you taught them about enthalpy and entropy, but at the same time there was that kid in 3rd period who just acted like a schmuck today, but that's normal and you're just upset you didn't handle it better. But at the same time, you know you were there for the kids today. And you know that you're trying to show them how they can be good people tomorrow, and they're not all going to get it, but you can't save all of them. And sometimes you're going to be surprised at which ones come back and say thank you, and which ones decide that they're going to tell you about their lives outside of your class, and which ones need you to be there for them when they're really low. And that reminds you that this is in some ways the most important job you'll ever have, because someone needs to love these kids, and you've decided it's going to be you. Being a good teacher is really fucking hard. The hours are long, you largely don't get to talk to other adults all day and the pay is not great. But you get to spend your day teaching kids to be good people and helping them see they can get there. If you're ready to commit to that, if you can get through all the bullshit and just decide you're going to commit to learning how to be better every day and showing that to those kids, then nothing else matters.

If you have a really good support system (i.e. a spouse with a high income so your teaching income will just be a nice bonus), and you\u2019re fine earning less for an easier teaching position (like at a private school with relatively few disciplinary issues with the students), then yes, I\u2019d recommend teaching as a career. Private school teaching is really the perfect career for someone who: has someone else paying the majority of their bills.has kids or wants kids, and wants to spend a lot of time with their children.wants to have a career; don\u2019t want to be a stay-at-home parent.has the credentials to be a teacher.isn\u2019t worried about working up any sort of career ladder.On the other hand, if you actually want to earn a living on your own as a teacher, in most places, you\u2019re going to have to be comfortable with \u201cpaying your dues\u201d for a while. That is, you\u2019ll likely end up with the types of students that cause people to quit the teaching profession: students with discipline or behavior issues, attitude problems, or zero motivation to learn, for which you will get blamed. The problem is, of course, that many college-aged people have no idea how much their spouse is going to earn in the future, how many kids they want, etc\u2026 With that in mind, I do not recommend teaching as a first career. However, I think it makes a really good second career, once you\u2019re in an established relationship with or soon to be with children of your own. ",

I\u2019ve had a good life, but now, as I get close to my retirement date, I feel trapped. I\u2019d like to move on, but won\u2019t be able to for another 5 + years. TEACHING is great. Planning can be interesting. Grading is a bore. Meetings suck eggs. Dealing with parents is intolerable. Dealing with Admins is a chore. The question is, does the good outweigh the bad. As time goes on, and more and more time is dedicated to testing, and less and less time dedicated to teaching, I would say that there is less and less to recommend it. One of the biggest problems is the fact that everyone THINKS they know what it is to teach, since they spent so much time watching teachers. Until you are facing 40 teens who don\u2019t want to be there, there is no way you understand what it means. ",

Don\u2019t be a teacher for anything other than passion for the kids, the love of the classroom, being able to really understand how to teach, and being a life long learner. There is complaints and so many cons to be a teacher but if you really wanted to be one, the complaining and cons will not make you go away. I love being a teacher but I hate the way politics is controlling what we are allowed to do and what we aren\u2019t. My passion has always been teaching. My heart is strong when I talk about the good and the bad about teaching. When I speak to my husband about teaching, I ask him If he notice the passion I have and that\u2019s how you know that no matter how much teachers complain, they still love what they do. ",

With that being said it can be upsetting when trying to land a job. Being a teacher is rewarding and such a great thing if you love children. I notice ove the years that kids have been harder to handle and some parents things it's all in our hands to teach everything even manners and respect to their children. It's hard especially after years of them doing and acting like whatever when they are around their parents or guardian. It's getting kinda sad to say for teachers and officers have to be on the grounds of every school and they have to help with discipline. It can be hard on teachers more now says then every before but if you are willing to try and make a difference then it's so rewarding. ",

Teaching is not an 8 to 5 job, its 24hours, 7 days a week. no leave apart of the school holidays. If you go on an overseas trip, people will say \u201cWow a free holiday\u201d its the opposite, its work, 24 hours cause you need to make sure nothing goes wrong. If you been on a flight with an annoying group of students, think of the teacher who has to ensure it the next few days! So yeah, it's a life choice, don\u2019t go into half-hearted. ",

            "answer_text": "The parenthetical aside in your question expresses interest in teaching junior high and high school, though the question itself is asking \u201cteachers\u201d generally, which presumably includes teachers at the college-level. So, just in case you are curious about teaching options beyond your primary interest of 7th-12th grade, let me add my two cents. I\u2019d recommend getting a degree in my major of English (good writing, good rhetoric, and good communication skills can get you ahead in any number of fields). However, I don\u2019t typically recommend English students go into college-level teaching on the tenure-track. Why? There. Aren\u2019t. Enough. Jobs. In English literature, there\u2019s about one tenure-track job opening available each year for every 40\u2013200 Ph.D. students who walks across the stage and take a doctoral diploma. Those aren\u2019t good odds of ever getting full-time, secure employment. ",
