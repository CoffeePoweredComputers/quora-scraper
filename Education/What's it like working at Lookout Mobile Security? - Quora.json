            "answer_text": "It's quite amazing. Lookout is full of smart, honest, humble and nice people that create an open, fun and productive work environment. Every single employee is empowered to come up with ideas and introduce change that will make anything better \u2013 the products, the company, the internal tools \u2013 and openness and transparency are taken very seriously, and with clear information about the business, everyone is able to understand how their work fits in the big picture and what they can do to get to our goals faster. We work on hard technical problems while focusing on great user experience, and solve real pains for our users on a daily basis \u2013 the wonderful emails we receive from our users every week prove that repeatedly. It's definitely the best place I've ever worked at, and the great food, beer and social life that permeates it all are just icing on a delicious cake. Update: here's a blog post which talks a bit specifically about our approach to Product Design: https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2013/05/09/design-lookout-qa-with-lookouts-head-of-product-design/ ",

            "answer_text": "I've been at the company for 3+ years. When I started, I was the first girl (aside from our lovely dachshund Stephen) of about 10 engineers and the 3 founders. And what I loved about the company 3 years ago is still what I love about the company now - every day the team here is doing amazing things toward making our vision real: keeping people safe on their mobile devices. The way we have been able to achieve our success is through our team. A lot of companies may tout transparency, but we mean it. Everything from our weekly company meetings to our open work environment, we're not afraid to celebrate our accomplishments and admit when a risk we took didn't turn out how we expected. Because of this, I am confident that everyone in the company knows what we're trying to achieve and where we are in the process of achieving it. The culture fosters an environment where taking big risks is rewarded, even if we fail. There is learning in failing and everyone appreciates the lessons we learn from when we win just as much as when we lose. In addition, we have a super supportive environment with people to socialize with if you want to, but also a realistic work/life balance too. I recently was among the first people in the company to have a baby and have felt super supported the whole way through - from a generous maternity leave to a personal mama's room.  It also doesn't hurt that we have awesome perks like Waffle Wednesday where Claire makes us delicious homemade waffles with fixins like fresh fruit, maple butter and fresh whipped cream as well as lunch every Friday after our company meetings. Food does wonderful things to help bring people across the company together and is conducive to making connections across other areas of the company with people that you don't work with every day. ",
