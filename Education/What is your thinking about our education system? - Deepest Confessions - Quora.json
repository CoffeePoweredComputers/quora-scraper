            "answer_text": "The education system of India is in a pretty messed up state. The issues are plenty but no clear solution is visible in any policy making. The main issue right now is commercialisation of education, poor curriculum, underpaid teachers, disinterested students and demanding parents. The root of all this is poor economic conditions in India and disparity among incomes between different jobs. Once this disparity is reduced sufficiently and job security is there in different professions, the reforms in schools can see light of the day. Until then reforms will not be of any use as a child passing out of schools fully satisfied and very well educated will remain jobless. For example, if schools don't grade students, they don't put students of same age group in same class, they let the student study what she is really interested in, it will result in a very good and happy student. But if what the student learns doesn't help her to get employed or make a living out of it, it will go waste. ",

            "answer_text": "Like Indians usually rant, i wouldn't say Indian education system is totally useless. Its all about what one makes out of it. As for medical education, for eg i have heard other country citizens say that Indian doctors are the best. Same holds true for many other fields.  Whole India is not what we saw in 3idiots.i would say its an exaggerated depiction. No professor or teacher would ever discourage a student who comes up with a novel idea. We have lots of scope for research and explorative activities right from school level. Remember, we had science exhibitions and school projects. India has higher education institutions like IITs IIMs and AIIMS among several others, which meet international standards. In CBSE and state board schools we get to learn a wide variety of topics and i find the textbooks excellent(cbse). Designed in a student friendly and really thoughtfulway, NCERT books are the best. After 10th we are free to choose our path. Science/commerce/humanities\u2026 have you ever gone through the subject list of cbse class 12 boards, you will be amazed. Marks are not everything. But marks motivate to study. Schools like KVs, Navodays and even some state government schools have high standards of teaching and learning. Even if someone could not afford to go to these schools, if one has the will, to reach a certain level of skill or fulfillment he will reach it. We have so many living examples. I could name if you want. India also provides free education that too compulsory for everyone under 14 years and mid day meal schemes in govt school is something exemplary. Overall,i feel Indian education system is commendable . But of course we have a lot of scope to improve. Cheers! ",

We are taught useless theoretical concepts which have almost no use in our day to day life! In . For example an average adult does not perfom factorization at all, then why are we learning it. The olden Indian education system is undoubtedly the best as the main focus is skills, so the child when leaves the gurukul has already learnt the skills required for his/her career (no need to go to college and waste more 4 years). These skills taught to us not only help us in our career but also in the problems we face day to day . But Indians think that the west is superior and we are nothing. People are slowly realising that fact. I hope the transition from the UK to the Olden system happens soon. Please upvote if you like the answer. ",
