            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I have been a student of Ram Lal Anand College , Statistics Honours for the past two years and it definitely has one of the best faculty teams in the entire Delhi University. All the programming languages and practicals are taught with equal importance, unlike other colleges where they are usually skipped. Also, you won't have to run to your seniors for notes because teachers here make sure that you have the best of them. RLA is definitely a lesser known college, and you won't get a placement with a handsome package here, but it definitely promises to enrich your skills and knowledge. Also, PGDAV and Mata Sundri College are off-campus colleges and you won't get any campus life there. RLA fares quite well in this context as well, being in the South campus. Thanks for reading :) ",

            "answer_text": "Ram Lal Anand College , anytime anyday. Maybe if you will find about RLA you will find it kind of low or underrated in reviews but I have already spent my first year here and I am already worrying about that how will I not miss this place after my graduation. The best thing about Statistics department is the faculty and even our seniors. I am a Btech. drop out from Manav Rachna University and in my first year there every single senior I met, they always say , \u201cHey ! I am your senior. You can call me Sir/Mam XYZ\u201d,which is something I haven't yet found here. Apart from faculties , the other facilities, infrastructure, crowd, Campus life,societies everything is just too good like this college. Hope it helps, Good luck !! ",
