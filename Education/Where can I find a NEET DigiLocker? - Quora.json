            "answer_text": "Digilocker is not something especially made for neet . It is a government run cloud storage software with CBSE as one of its issued partners. Here\u2019s the link of site https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjm-8LF6-XUAhWGs48KHdIzAPUQFgglMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdigilocker.gov.in%2F&usg=AFQjCNEueMkMc17il-JaeMUusS6Bqiz5HA If you prefer to have a constant update on your account , you can also download the app from google play. Do link your aadhar card with it. CBSE has still not declare the date of issuance of rank letter , we need to wait and constantly check notices. After that you can find your letter in your issued documents sectioned and if its not transferred automatically , there is an option to pull documents by selecting the documents you need and you need Roll No. Hope this helps ALL THE BEST!!
