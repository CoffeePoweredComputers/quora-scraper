            "answer_text": "Well, the Yuma Union High Criminals aren't the best. The New Berlin Pretzels are mediocre. As are the Boiling Springs Bubblers, the Webb Feet, the Fisher Bunnies, the Frankfort Hot Dogs. There are plenty of schools with stationary, cuddly, smelly, and delicious mascots that don't inspire strength or motivation. They aren't great, but they also aren't offensive to people. Some mascots, on the other hand, are outright offensive in their depictions of people. I think the Coachella Valley High School Arabs are one of the worst.     Although the Vestavia Rebels may arguably be even worse. Rebels are a term for Confederate Soldiers, and their mascot is in a Civil War uniform. His other outfit dates him to the antebellum, plantation era. Simply put, he is a plantation owner. Remember that Alabama's 1861 Declaration of Secession (their argument for leaving the United States) says: \"And as it is the desire and purpose of the people of Alabama to meet the slaveholding States of the South ...in order to frame a provisional as well as permanent Government ...\"    What is Mr. Rebel's stance on slavery? What wars is he fighting for? Finally, I also wanted to conclude with America's gun violence. We have shootings daily. The horrific, live, on-air shooting of Alison Parker and Adam Ward on Wednesday was already eclipsed by 27 students and a teacher held hostage for several hours by a classmate with a gun in a West Virginia school on Thursday, a sheriff shot dead on duty in Houston on Friday, and six people shot in Boston, and three shot in Memphis, and two dead in six D.C. shootings all before the week concluded.  So in that American spirit of protecting all human life, and especially our children attending school, I wanted to nominate the Parkersburg South Patriots for their outstanding gun control. Their human mascot walks onto the field every home game with a gun, points it into the sky, and shoots that gun with a crowd full of people watching and cheering.    Yest that is a real gun on the football field with the players.  A real gun held by a high school student, authorized by the school staff, that will be shot at every home game. This gun is so important that the West Virginia Senate passed a law granting it an exemption from the statewide school gun laws.http://woub.org/2012/02/02/bill-gives-high-school-mascot-gun-law-exception/ An honorary gun-safety award goes to the Canoga Park Hunters, whose gun features prominently on their school sign and every logo. Mr. Hunter couldn't at least have an arrow, Katniss Everdeen-style?   Also, a huge shoutout to Hays High School Rebels in Buda, Texas, which in 2012 made the decision to ban their Colonel Jack mascot. He's racist AND he carries a gun!      Colonel Jack may have retired his guns and flag, but the Hays Rebels' current motto is \"Rebel Pride Never Dies.\" The school was founded in 1968, and Dixie was their fight song until this summer, when it was deemed unsensitive following the deadly shooting of nine people in Charleston. If this were 2012, Hays High School would clearly win for worst mascot. In 2015, the Vestavia and Butler \"Rebels\" may be the worst two high school mascots in the business.   Walpole High Rebels, from Massachusetts, no less,  was another Rebel nominee who recently cleaned up their act in the past few years. I found it fascinating how entrenched this high school got into the Rebel branding. Here's an article from the Boston Globe: http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/05/25/in_walpole_rebels_pride_still_sparks_a_fight/ (Massachusetts had fierce desegregation issues in the 1960s. That is when the school replaced the innocent Hilltoppers mascot with their new Rebel mascot. Their mascot was a clear sign that they didn't want \"encroachment\" by the federal government or the black community.)  If I've depressed you too much with these loser mascots, just remember you can always cheer for the Blooming Prairie Awesome Blossoms of Minnesota!  This mascot offends nobody, endangers nobody's safety, and blossoms are awesome. ",
