            "answer_text": "With google, they do.  Or they did when I interviewed with them twice. I never had issues with interviewing with any company. I worked at amazon, Expedia and a handful of other companies that weren\u2019t a \u201cwalk in the park\u201d to get in. However, after that question about grades in college in each interview with the Mountain View , I was told the typical: \u201cThanks for your time. At this point, we think we will no longer need to continue\u2026blah, blah, blah.\u201d I was in the top 10% of my high school and as a result got into the best public university locally: the UW. However, after choosing to go the private route, I decided I would never go to graduate school (or felt I didn\u2019t have the need). So, I stopped caring about my grades towards the end of my Freshman year. I thought all I needed was enough to graduate. Well, I was wrong 10+ years later. If I would have done better, I may have been working at Google right now. I interviewed with them in 2001\u201302. Check out the stock at the time:  I\u2019m thinking life may have been much less stressful 20 years later, but now I\u2019ll never know. Since \u201cgrades didn\u2019t matter\u201d to me at that time. At the same time, when I look back on that decision and also the decision to leave Amazon, I found out that with the other companies, grades did NOT matter. It never came up once. I worked for amazon \u2014 grades NEVER came up once in the interviews. Networking was key for that position. The same for Expedia. Did it matter for my two businesses I started? Not. At. All. I rose to six figures within the first year for both, but grades had nothing to do with either success. Later, I had the urge to go to graduate school ironically. However, as I learned, I couldn\u2019t get into the top ones - which are the only ones I would have tried to enter. But since I screwed the pooch (with my marks) in college, I basically failed to have the option many years later. Interestingly, I did work for a company that Google eventually acquired. So, I guess if I failed to have the misfortune of going through the dotcom burst and didn\u2019t move to a satellite city, maybe I would be working for Google in NYC now? So, maybe there\u2019s a way without grades? Nevertheless, as you can see, they DO matter in many cases. It just depends on what path you take. (Update) p.s. Year later, I\u2019m somewhat grateful I didn\u2019t end up at Google. I\u2019ve heard how sexist and pampered they are internally. It reminds me a bit of my time at Expedia. While we never were shown to be sexist, there were times at Expedia where I questioned if I was even working. While life has been challenging, I can say there\u2019s always \u201csomething to do.\u201d After many years of dealing with issue after issue (even some of the pain I\u2019m dealing with now after thinking nothing could get worse), I\u2019ve found that having \u201cissues\u201d can sometimes make life even more rewarding.

            "answer_text": "\u201cWe need you to lead our intern program this summer.\u201d \u201cDo we have an intern program?\u201d \u201cNope, but you\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d My first opportunity as a manager was hiring several interns and developing a program to teach them to sell. I was 24 years old and this was my first time interviewing and selecting talent. I visited two major universities after posting a job description and pre-selecting candidates for interview panels. With no prior experience in hiring and only a few open positions, I set about limiting applications to those I would meet in person. My company was Fortune 10 and put a heavy emphasis on GPA. Our brand name was strong and we felt like we could recruit the best of the best.  I knew this because of how much grief I took for my weak 2.95 overall GPA when I interviewed three years prior. Every interviewer dug into why my grades weren\u2019t higher, so much that I was surprised when they actually made me an offer. After two days of interviews, I only filled 3 of the 4 slots. Most of the candidates I met with were rigid and limited in extracurricular activities. With this group, the higher the GPA, the harder it was to keep the conversation going. I came across plenty of intelligent people but struggled to see them interacting with customers. After the last day of panel interviews, we had an information session open to all students. We bought some pizzas and managers were available to talk about the company to anyone interested in attending. A young man approached me at this session. He hadn\u2019t been selected for an interview but was very interested in our company. He gave me his resume and I realized quickly why I hadn\u2019t met him. He had a 3.0 GPA in Management and we were looking for 3.5 or higher with an Engineering degree. Yes, it seems ridiculous looking back that we wanted a 3.5 for a sales internship. To understand, picture Google advertising for a sales and marketing internship today. They will receive thousands of resumes and can pick the very best. Kids will apply because Google on your resume nearly guarantees that you land a full time position out of college. I worked for GE twenty years ago, at a time when GE made magazine covers for Most Admired Company and our CEO, Jack Welch, had just been named CEO of the Century by Fortune. In other words, it was easy to find high GPA candidates who wanted GE on their resume and they didn\u2019t care what the assignment was. Back to this young man, I tried to let him down nicely and told him the requirements for the position and he handled it like a champ. He smiled, said he understood and then asked politely if he could ask me a few questions. Sure, I thought. The pizza is paid for and my flight isn\u2019t until tomorrow. \u201cThis is a sales internship, correct?\u201d \u201cYes, it is.\u201d \u201cWhat will you expect of an intern?\u201d \u201cWell, you would be prospecting from a list of potential targets. You role is to set up appointments for our seasoned sales reps by cold calling.\u201d \u201cGot it. Do the other candidates you\u2019ve selected have experience cold calling?\u201d \u201cUh, not that I can recall. No.\u201d \u201cCan I tell you about my background?\u201d He went on to tell me about his first job which was selling door to door. He told me about how humbling the experience was at first and how he hit 200 houses every day, rain or shine. He walked me through the importance of a good opening, how to lead with a smile and a question, how he overcome objections and the importance of mindset when you\u2019re having a bad day. He further explained how he did this job while putting himself through college. In fact, he had several jobs while taking classes which made it challenging to spend as much time studying as some other kids. He then told me about his fraternity and the roles he held, including two semesters as President. He explained how his fraternity had built his social skills and what he learned about leadership from running a house filled with 50 guys. Oh, by the way, he was a collegiate athlete which was also a significant time constraint. \u201cOK, you win. Want a job?\u201d He accepted and all four started on the same day. Three of the four had an average of 3.8 GPA and our door to door salesman brought the average down a few points. You can probably guess who came out on top. From day one, my boy with the average GPA ran circles around the more accomplished students. Yes, he had specific experience that gave him a head start but he had something much more important. Mindset. When a customer said no to him, he moved on. He didn\u2019t let rejection define him as he was accustomed to failures. He looked at these small failures as opportunities to learn and tweak his pitch with the next phone call. His peers saw it much differently. They were so accustomed to winning that the daily parade of rejection was debilitating. They took every rejection personally and it was apparent in the volume of calls they made. On a daily basis, our fraternity President was making twice the number of outbound calls. The others were so paralyzed by potential rejection that they took way too much time preparing for their phone calls and then second guessing themselves after every call. Rather than playing the numbers game and grinding, they deliberately slowed the process so as not hear \u201cno\u201d as often in a day. In psychological terms, this is called self-handicapping and is a coping mechanism to avoid damage to self esteem. Of the four interns, we only made one permanent offer and he had the lowest GPA in the group. Does this mean I never hired a candidate with a high GPA? Absolutely not. One of the best hires I ever made was to an honors student from Georgia Tech just a few B\u2019s away from a 4.0. He also held high level roles in several organizations and played competitive basketball. But, even this young man struggled out of the gate, especially with failure and not having a definitive path to achieving results. I\u2019ve seen many hires with a strong GPA struggle with the many indirect paths to success in a career. They are used to following instructions, completing their assignments, putting in the work and getting a perfect grade. In business, there is no one prescribed way of getting results. College professors are interested in the path you take to a result as well as the result. In business, there is only the result. Most managers are indifferent on your path. Some kids with perfect grades struggle when you won\u2019t give them a prescribed plan to achieve that result. They chafe at the lack of direction, which is a hallmark in business. No one is going to hold your hand. I like hiring people who have failed a little in their life and are not paralyzed by it. I especially like people who are not afraid to admit a) That they failed, b)Why they failed and c) What they learned from it. If your grades aren\u2019t the greatest, own it. Explain why it happened. Did you have a miserable semester where you didn\u2019t apply yourself? Own it. Then tell me how that humbling experience forced you into better habits and what you learned that will make you a better asset to my company. The last thing I will say about grades is that two years after graduation, no one will give a damn. You probably won\u2019t ever get asked about your GPA once you\u2019ve had some real life experience and opportunity to prove what you can do for a business. Businesses are much more interested in your ability to generate tangible results than grades on an exam. Once you start your first job, no one will care about your GPA. You will be measured against every other person in your role, whether they went to college or not. You will be measured on results. If you had a high GPA, brace yourself for failure. Actually, embrace failure. Welcome failure as an opportunity to learn. Boast about your failures, make fun of yourself a little. This will drive you to try harder and skip the self-handicapping behavior holding you back. Get that first job, kick butt and you\u2019ll be done talking about grades for the rest of your career. Unless, you decide to write an answer on Quora like me. Good luck out there. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. A million times, YES. God, it angers me to no end when I hear older people telling teens and school kids \u201cThe grades which you get mean nothing in the long term. Chill, don\u2019t worry!\u201d They\u2019re doing these young people a deep disservice by feeding them comforting but utterly nonsensical pablum which those kids want to hear, never mind that it is highly inaccurate and unfortunately fateful. Because most of these kids heeding that stupid song will pay a high price then, often for the rest of their lives. Let me put it in this way - Doing well in school does not guarantee career success but doing poorly almost always means paying for it dearly. Do not confuse \u2018lack of a guarantee\u2019 for insignificance. It\u2019s like driving drunk versus sober. Being sober doesn\u2019t mean you will never have an accident but that doesn\u2019t mean you get sloshed before you take the wheel. Probabilities matter. A lot. Look, as a guy who has worked in some of the most competitive professions, let me spell it out as clearly as I can - We cared A LOT about grades when reviewing college grads for hires. Not only the grades, but the majors in which they graduated. In most cases, the resumes with mediocre grades (say GPAs of less than 3.0 out of 4.0) got screened out right at the start. Reviewing resumes is not an exercise in pleasure when it\u2019s an additional task to your \u201860 hours a week\u2019 job already - so in most cases, we had little patience and threw those resumes out right away. You\u2019re not even getting a peep through a crack in the door, forget getting through it! This isn\u2019t some kind of random fetish. Because I\u2019ll spell out the two key reasons why grades matter - Knowledge of the subject - \u201cSon, don\u2019t feed me this horse dung that you\u2019re a master at accounting or operations when you have Cs in those courses.\u201dI remember a friend of mine in business school saying to me \u201cAllen, just because you get top grades in finance, doesn\u2019t mean you know that subject better than the rest of us.\u201d - \u201cUmm, actually that\u2019s EXACTLY what it means!\u201d. How else do you expect someone to evaluate your knowledge of a subject? By taking them at their word? By divining it from their face?Show of hands please by those among you who would like to be operated on by a young surgeon who barely scraped through med school?How about hiring a lawyer who passed her bar exam only on the fifth attempt? And who among you will hire an accountant who you knew had barely managed to make it over the line in his CPA exam?Any takers?Oh I\u2019ll bet that even the ones who most think that grades or theoretical knowledge don\u2019t matter will not touch those three persons mentioned above with a ten foot pole. Not when it comes to actually making a decision on who to trust their life, liberty or money with!Make no mistake - If you want to be a Wall Street banker, you had better bloody aced your accounting and finance courses. If you want to get admitted into a Ph.D program for physics at M.I.T., you had better kicked ass in your undergrad at that.An unmistakable marker of discipline - This one is even more important than the first one. In the corporate world, there is an absolute premium placed on diligence.When I see a resume of a kid who has top grades, not only does it tell me that this fellow knows his stuff, it tells me that he is much more likely to apply himself to the job with dedication. Hard work and discipline matter. Top grades are not merely a marker of knowledge but one of conscientiousness. It is a key signal which says \u201cI am the kind of person who can apply him/herself with single-minded determination over an extended period - and you can count on me to do that in my job if you hire me.\u201d I cannot emphasize that point enough.You screw up your grades in high school and it has a ripple effect - you have a significantly lower chance of getting into a top university - which in turn translates into a lesser career. Repent then at leisure. As a case in point, why do you think that Jewish and Asian Americans are at the top of the socioeconomic food chain? Because they eat something special for breakfast? It\u2019s because growing up, those kids have their parents riding their asses to do well in school. Those habits are then woven into them from the start - and that then continues into their careers as adults. And yes, I can see the ones talking about top entrepreneurs not doing all that well at school. But they are exceptions to the rule and it is not a wise approach to bet on you being that \u201cone in a thousand\u201d exception. So yes, for goodness sake care about your grades like the blazes! Because the habits which you develop as a child and as a teen, will mold your very character. If you think that you\u2019re going to be all sloppy and uncaring for the first fifteen or twenty years on this earth and then all of a sudden just get up like magic in your twenties and be diligent? Really? You\u2019ll find your old habits hard to shake off. Very hard, because that slovenliness has been virtually seared into your very character by then. As the old saying goes in metaphorical terms \u201cThe child foretells the man like the morning foretells the day.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to answer this exactly the same way that I tell my students. Your grade only really matter for the traditional path and for a small number of research jobs and careers. What matters a lot more is your approach to life: Do you always try to do your best? (Do you actually try at all?)If you get stuck do you try to solve the problems other ways or just give up? (Also called \u201cgrit\u201d which is the current in word.)Are you willing to try things and see if it works out?Are you curious about new things?The thing is that if these are true then students almost always have fairly good grades. These are the things that matter not grades most of the time. That being said here are the times that grades matter: Your high school grades matter when applying to university BUT if you wait a few year or even just do a university subjects then try to transfer (assuming they accept transfer students) then your high school grades don\u2019t mater any more your entrance exam matters or the grades for the university subject you do.Your university grades matter when you apply for your first job BUT after the first job everyone cares about your work experience NOT your grades.You need good grades for academic scholarships.For research students your grades matter (a lot) until you publish a research paper then your previous research matters more.Basically grades matter at a few specific instances in time when transitioning between phases in life. Grades can save you a few years of \u201ccatching up\u201d but in the long run there are other paths to the same thing that take a little bit longer if you are willing to try. This is why some high school drop outs succeed. At school they don\u2019t have the correct attitude to life. They fail, hit rock bottom, go through the school of hard knocks and relatively quickly learn and change who they are then succeed without traditional schooling. The grades try (sometimes badly) to reflect what is important. ",

            "answer_text": " This is an ode to all students who have ever gotten B\u2019s, C's, D's (and sometimes even failed). It's a declaration to the kids who calculated the exact number of points they needed to get on their finals in order to pass. This is for all those kids who didn't get extra credit or get placed on honor roll. After years of inadequacy and a lifetime of feeling average and unremarkable, your time has come. Now it\u2019s finally the time to tell you that even if your GPA's lower than 1.2, you can be great. For years, society has placed a disgustingly large stigma on bad grades and an overwhelming importance on good grades. There's a predisposed instinct to strive for A's and cast anything lower to the side, to deem as unworthy. Well, it's time to let the children learn that it's okay not to be an A student, it's okay to fail. Because here's a little secret the older generations are unwilling to divulge to you: it doesn't matter. To all those tight-ass intellectuals out there, it's time to get the facts straight. For all those years that you spent cooped up in the library, poring over facts and stats, soliloquies and Greek mythology, the average scoring kids \u2014 the ones partying and getting C's in college \u2014 are the ones obtaining the skills that do matter: life experiences. Failing is a life experience. Not getting that A on the exam you spent all night studying for, is an experience. Life experiences are a composite of all the skills necessary to get along in the real world. It's comprised of all those skills that are only learned through failure and the obstacles of life, like how to hold a conversation, get away with a lie or entertain someone you really don't like. It's all those skills that high-paying Fortune 500 companies value above all else. In college, it's all about grades. In the real world, it's about experience, balls and drive. Because once you get past the first job, no one is ever going to ask you about your GPA or how you did on that Psych 215 final. What matters in the real world is your ability to adapt, innovate and get along. There are no scantron sheets or essay exams. There are no TA\u2019s to hold review sessions or to help you practice your presentation. Real life is about how well you can bullshit your way through it, and that's not something taught in a classroom. The greatest thinkers, leaders and entrepreneurs of our time have been the men to defy the rules and take risks. They were the ones getting C's or flunking out. However, their \u201cfailures' were not a factor of intelligence, but an inability to be weighed down by grades and superficial markings. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Richard Branson, Mark Zuckerberg are just a few of the men who achieved unfathomable amounts of wealth, status and success without ever really succeeding in a classroom. They are the men, that by society\u2019s standards, had failed.With their passion and intelligence, they were able to change the world with nothing more than a bachelor\u2019s degree and a transcript of failing grades (sometimes not graduating at all). These men understood at an early age that just because society, and everyone around them, placed an excessive amount of importance on grades didn\u2019t mean they were right. But it\u2019s not just these extreme examples of eccentric billionaires and tech geniuses that should solidify the results of this finding. It\u2019s about yourself and the gut feelings you have towards what is right and what is wrong. Succeeding in life means following your gut and understanding what a bad decision is. Just because you passed American History with flying colors doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll know what to do when your coworker is talking behind your back to your boss. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll know how to handle an insubordinate or get together a presentation the night before a deadline. The people who do great things are the ones too absorbed in their own ideas to place too much weight on the opinions of others. Why should Steve Jobs spend hours studying someone else\u2019s ideas and breakthroughs when he could be out creating his own? What people fail to see in bad grades is the reason behind them. Why is this person not getting an A? Is this person doing something that is better? \u201cEverybody is a genius. But, if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it\u2019ll spend it\u2019s whole life believing that it is stupid.\u201d Albert Einstein So for all of you preparing for finals, or finishing them with a bitter taste in your mouth, this should be reason enough not to worry. If you are ending the semester with C\u2019s and maybe a few D\u2019s, don\u2019t sweat. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity out there, and it\u2019s the people with the audacity not to care about their grades \u2014 the ones who don\u2019t spend their lives in the library and bubbling in correct answer sheets \u2014 who will rule the world. Because at the end of it all, it\u2019s really about those people with the most passion. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine you are a corporate recruiter or college admission looking at hundreds of applications for a single spot at your company or university.  Image Source: JDYoung Your job is to find the person with the highest potential to be a successful contributor with the least amount of risk. You know almost nothing about the people represented by the stack of papers on your desk. Maybe you met a few of them at an event and recognize the name. But for most of these applicants, you will only spend 60 seconds or less to see if they meet a minimal threshold to get a deeper look later. But someone needs to narrow down the initial list first. Easiest way to make the first cut? Use GPA.  A GPA is so much more than a collection of grades. It\u2019s actually an important signal that tells someone a lot about your work ethic and your intellectual capacity. What university or company doesn\u2019t want a hard-working, smart person on their team? Sure there are plenty of examples of the Einsteins, Zuckerbergs, and Jobs in the world that succeeded without needing a GPA to prove themselves. But they are the exceptions. Most companies or universities rather take the sure thing than take a gamble because they rather miss the 1 in a million shot to land that unicorn and take someone with a proven GPA. Think about it this way - As a company, you are paying a new graduate $40K-$75K a year and handing over responsibilities that can sometimes impact people\u2019s lives, important business relationships, or expensive deals. As a highly ranked university, you are expected to build a class that maintains the program\u2019s reputation, enriches the experience of other students, and graduates on-time to become successful (and generous) alumni donors. Grades mean everything when you are just getting started in your career. If you struggle with school then you need to invest your time and energy into other valuable or rare skills that Rohan Kamath and Jessica Su mention in their responses. Thank you for reading and remember that there is no shortcut to hard work and discipline whether you decide to invest it in your grades or some other skill. Good luck! ",

I was occupied with re-writing, editing, dealing with literary agents, and searching a reputed publisher for my novel in my first year of engineering. After struggling for months, I got an intent letter from a good publisher. However, in all of that, I got three subjects back. In the second year of engineering, the \u2018start-up fad\u2019 caught hold of my brain. My B-plan and synthesis came into top 30 among 700 applications at the UDGAM, IIT-G. Meanwhile, I started liking a twin of Naina Talwar (from Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani) who recently took admission in my college. However, I was determined. I neglected her as well as my engineering exams and drove my entire focus towards budding the start-up. In all of that, my percentage suffered badly. In the third year, the person who I loved the most in this world, died. My mom and papa had jobs when I was born, and they left me at home with my Grandpa \u2014 my everything. When he was on the ventilator, every single ring of my mobile sent chills down my spine. Doctors had informed he was going to die. Any call could have been the \u2018news\u2019 call. Therefore, I was scared. Every single second. Perhaps my grandpa knew I would leave everything and come to him. Therefore, he postponed his death a week after my exams. But, in between my exams, another mishap came my way. The publisher withdrew his intent and left me hopeless. He cheated me. Desperate, I became engrossed in sending submissions to more publishers. All of the above, no matter how much I tried, showed their effect on my marks. I got my papers back again. During the last semester of the third year, I realized that establishing and building a start-up is ten times harder than we think. I postponed the idea of starting up. The death of my grandpa was killing me already, but the girl I liked also started giving me pains. Pains out of my own expectations. But pains, nonetheless. Meanwhile a start-up idea that was very similar to mine won the first prize in Ten Minute Million competition at E-Summit, IIT-B. Adding to that, the best company among all those which were supposed to come for recruitments, arrived in the third year itself. I couldn\u2019t sit for the interviews because of my backlog. I felt bad for postponing my start-up, for giving up. I felt bad for giving the key of my self-esteem to the girl I had feelings for. I felt bad for not being able to attend the job interview, even when I\u2019m very good at aptitude tests and communicating. I felt bad, very very bad. But, I elbowed away all the regrets and studied. I studied and studied until one publisher offered me the contract. My grip on the studies loosened a little because of the contract signing and negotiating and publishing works. It resulted in another backlog. I am now in the fourth year. Many reputed companies are coming and hiring and going. More than half of my classmates are placed. People with average marks in aptitude tests, satisfactory communication skills, and poor technical skills are placed. On the other hand, I cannot even sit for the interviews. Minimum CGPA 7.75 and minimum percentage of 60 was the eligibility criteria of 95% of the companies that visited my college. Ninety-five percent! Therefore, I cannot even sit for campus interviews because I have an active backlog and percentage below 60. Frustrated, I recently gave AMCAT. AMCAT is the national employability test attempted by millions. I got 99 percentile in English, 97 percentile in Quantitative Aptitude, 98 percentile in Logical Reasoning, and 79 Percentile in Mechanical Engineering. Overall 93.25 percentile. I was amongst the toppers in three subjects. Yet, yes, yet, the jobs available on AMCAT \u2018too\u2019 had the minimum graduation percentage eligibility criteria. People with 80 percentile easily got shortlisted. I didn\u2019t. As a past-time, I researched on the foreign universities and their eligibility criteria and admission processes. I never had plans to go out of India. But maybe I was scared which made me research about that. I dug deeper. Turned out that foreign universities too gave importance to GPA. Canada and the USA and few European universities didn\u2019t even let people with more than eight backlogs apply to their universities. But it made me sick. A good GRE score too couldn\u2019t have gifted me a good university because of my backlogs and low GPA. Mind you, things are similar to some blue-blooded M.Tech and MBA colleges in India. I then decided to chuck it all away and live my life peacefully for a few days. I continued writing. I traveled a bit. I called my old friends. When the suicidal thoughts escaped my mind, I dug my primary school dream. The Indian Navy. I prepared for UPSC CDSE. From my entire college, I was the only person who cracked it. I got a call-letter from SSB Bhopal. But guess what happened\u2026 when I entered my graduation marks and an active backlog in their form, they sent me home. No travel reimbursement. No other way to get in. Just go home. I am shattered right now. And to be honest, that is why I\u2019m writing so much. You get sick, you see a doctor. I get sick, I write.  A few lessons that I learned through all these are: No matter how hard the road seems to be. No matter how less a knowledge or experience you think you have into something. If you are working on a great product (in my case: novel) try to do everything on your own (in my case: self-publish) Remember that People will not take your work half as seriously as you would, even if you pay them. Therefore, take it all in your hands and take tiny bits of help from the people who are experienced in that field and learn things on the internet and work your ass off and make it happen. You have the capacity and the resources to do it all by yourself.Pursue hobbies and passions. But, learn to balance. You\u2019ll have to sacrifice a lot of things in order to balance. But one day it will become a habit and you\u2019ll grow and be at peace while others will remain stagnant and stressed.\u201cPatience gives you sweetest fruits\u201d isn\u2019t working in this era. The world is changing very rapidly. You\u2019ll keep thinking and your idea will get old, or it will be implemented by someone else. Therefore, analyze and take quick action. Quick.The hottest girl from your college is already having someone in her life. Pretty girls could be single, but they are never, never, never alone. Even if they always say it. They have a lot of guys around them, distracting them all the time. Therefore, it is completely okay and normal to have a crush on someone, but \u201cGenius is about knowing when to stop\u201d \u2014 Charles de Gaulle. Start moving away the moment you feel she is not going to be with you. Period. I\u2019ve learned it the hardest way.Learn from your mistakes; do not repeat them. The most important lesson.People only, only care about the end results. They judge you by your current position. Not by your journey. Sometimes not even by your capability. Just think what went through your head while reading my journey above. \u201cThis guy is making excuses,\u201d isn\u2019t it? Exactly. People will think the same when you\u2019ll tell them your story. They won\u2019t give a fuck unless you make poetry or something entertaining out of your failures story. Therefore, paddle inside the water like a duck and do not give excuses.Going against the grain is romanticized. The people who work 9\u20135 find the grass greener on the other side. They do not know that grass incinerates and whoever walks on it burns his feet. I\u2019m not asking you not to go against the grass. But if you do, please make sure you have a backup plan. And if you are going against the grain while in college itself \u2014 simultaneously while studying, then make sure your base is firm and strong. You\u2019ve invested so much time and money into engineering or medical or other popular fields. Learn it properly. You don\u2019t have to top. Just maintain above 65%, and you will be good.CGPA matters. And it matters a lot.Even after bad grades and so many failures, I\u2019m hopeful that one day I will make it. I\u2019m hopeful that life will come on track. Everything gets okay in the end. It really does. But, if you have a bad CGPA, then my friend\u2026 it could take years of enthusiastic struggle and millions of heartbreak survival to get at the place where your friends with a good CGPA will already be seen enjoying. __________________________________________________________________ Have a look at this article with 377k+ views and 16k+ upvotes Pratik Shelke's answer to What are the mistakes that I should not do in my 4-year engineering college life?

            "answer_text": "I have completed my high school and under graduate studies from India. Moved abroad for my MBA. Let me give you an overview of my grades - Class 10th - 2005 (CBSE Board) - 78.4 percent. This is an extremely average or a below average score considering that people sleep walk through exams and still score in excess of 90 percent. I had to change schools because I couldn\u2019t science at my first school because I did not meet their criteria of 80 percent. Class 12th - 2007 (CBSE Board) - 77 percent. Again, below average and did not make it to any good science or engineering college in the country. Failed in all the entrance exams for engineering. Parents were extremely disappointed. A few close people suggested to take the year off and prepare for engineering entrance exams. However, I chose to take admission in an unknown below average engineering college in Uttar Pradesh. I did not want to drop a year beause I knew nothing would change. 1st Semester Engineering - 71.8 percent - decent 2nd Semester - 72.2 percent - decent 3rd Semester - 63.5 percent - fall from grace 4th Semester - 58.3 percent - Passed through the skin of my teeth 5th Semester - 62 percent - Minimal improvement 6th Semester - 65.6 percent - Minimal improvement 7th Semester - 70.8 percent - Improved because marking is relatively easy in the final year 8th Semester - 70.2 percent - Same as above However, I was always good with communication skills because of being a habitual reader. I was barely eligible for placements in college. Managed to secure 3 job offers before college much to the surprise of everyone. Most of my batch mates who had far better grades than me did not make it through campus placement or off-campus. No, my grades did not matter. I graduated in June, 2011 and joined one of those three organizations in August, 2011. Till this point in life, I was extremely careless, immature and took everything for granted. 24th August, 2011 - First day at work, I see 268 people have joined the same organization along with me. That\u2019s when I realized that its time to stop doing what I do and grow up. I could no longer enjoy the freedom I had in school and college. I had to earn my own money. From there on, I worked endlessly. I had 2 promotions in 3 years. In my four and a half years with the organization, I was always among the top performers. I had received numerous commendations and appreciations. I got a chance to move from technology to consulting. My salary had tripled in this time. However, I made a lot of sacrifices as well. I was so engrossed with my work that I lost touch with all friends from college. I worked late hours, night shifts, and on weekends to learn as much as I could. I did not take a single leave for 18 months. But, to me it was worth it. The knowledge and experience that I acquired made it worth it. I moved out of the organization in March 2016 to pursue a 1 year international MBA program. My GPA was 3.18/4.00, not the best. I had people around me who were far more intelligent and brainy than I was. I managed to get a job in India with a fortune top 10 organization and with a decent salary package. A lot of batch mates did not have job offers when they graduated. No, my grades did not matter. I earn a decent of money and finally see that my parents are happy because of me. I was promoted within one year of joining my current organization. Getting good grades does help you but getting bad grades is not the end of the world. A lot people in my friend circle and my family looked down upon me for not getting good grades (almost everyone in my family is a scholar). Now, I see the same people have changed their attitude towards me. You can make up for not getting good grades but you can\u2019t make up for not trying and being careless. Please don\u2019t feel bad if you don\u2019t good grades or if you don\u2019t get admission to a top university. It\u2019s alright. Life will give you chances. Depends on what you want to do with it. The Indian student always faces immense pressure from family and friends to get good grades but its not worth it. Please don\u2019t beat up yourself or end your lives for getting bad grades. There is much more to life than just grades. First answer on quora. Please be nice. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well they do matter! I can tell you about what I observed during my 4 years of college. My answer would definitely be biased towards IITB CSE (although it will mostly be the same scenario for different streams and colleges). TL;DR : If you have good grades, many things in life (be it getting into good universities, or getting placed) become somewhat easier and less stressful for you. The effect of GPA is least in the case of company placements as the only role GPA plays (most of the times) in company placements is that of Round 1 filtering and rest of the criteria is based on your performance in interviews and/or tests. However,Some companies tend to directly hire people who have good grades (By good I mean the creamy layer of the people who applied for the job). E,.g. if the company has vacancy for say 10 people, then it may fill 3\u20134 positions directly based on grades. If you lie in that creamy layer, then you may not have to walk the tough road of interview and tests to get placed.For companies like Google, Facebook etc. which receive myriad of job applications, even the Round-1 Filtering can be really tough, and having exceptional grades definitely give you an edge in those cases. Generally, for off-campus applications, you need to have good grades even for Round-1 filtering.If you want to go to grad schools, then grades matter a lot.If you are applying for Masters, then grades are a very important criteria for judgement of your application. In this case, what matters more is your relative grade compared to your fellow mates in your college who are also applying to the same programme. So even if say you have ~ 9.5 GPA but ten of your fellow mates have greater than that, then you may get rejected.If you are applying for PhD, things are bit different. In this case, your publication list and your letter of recommendations (which are also correlated with GPA to be honest) matter more.Grades also have several indirect effects. E.g. if you have good grades, you will get good advisors (as many advisors filter project requests directly based on grades) for your projects, and if you work with good advisors, you will get better letter of recommendations. Also, working with good advisors results in higher chances of getting your work published at top-tier conferences (hence my point of correlation in 2b)Do grades matter for entirety of your life ? No. As you move ahead in your career, your more recent records/accomplishments matter more than your past ones. E.g. if you get a job, and work in that company for two years, and apply somewhere else - the new recruiters will likely be more interested in what you did in your last job, rather than your grades from 2 years back. Hence, good grades is definitely something you should aim for during your college. However, bad grades is not a dead end. It\u2019s just a matter of time, after which no one would care to know about what grades you got in your undergrad curriculum. ",

Haven't you heard of eligibility criterias?Type B- So, tell me, what degree do Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Dell or Evan Williams have?Okay! Fair enough. Both kinds of mindset is valid in one way or the other. There're always arguments for or against that can be brought to the table, but still, the point is, significance of grades, change with every geographical, financial or even logical aspects. For instance, Indian society values grades more than American societies. So, what kind of upbringing we've, also has a great impact on how we think of grades. In case, you're pursuing something you don't like and you can't get out of it due to some or the other issue, grades won't ever matter, since, you're not pursuing your interest. For eg, if you're interested in Arts but pursuing Science. Or in case, you're brilliant at something, but not the whole package it's included in. For eg, you're enrolled in a Master's in CS program. You like Algorithms and you're amazing in it. Then it hardly matters what was your score in Database Concepts. Marks never actually measure how much you know, they merely tell you how much you can remember- which is seldom required in practical life, considering the fact that we all have Google to remember stuff. So, it's just a certificate which tells people that you've attended certain classes and took an exam. That's all. What I'm trying to say is, it's important to find interest and motivation. If marks motivate you, go ahead, score well. If they don't, it's fine. If grades don't inspire you, you should find something that does and you're good to go. P.s. I've met both kinds of people, seen both types achieving success, and somehow, I tend to be nearer to 'Type B'. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to your question. Grades may matter for some and may not for some. Does it depend on what are grades being utilized for? Probably, yes! That said, the consensus is that good grades will never hurt. If you were applying for a job that needs to meet specific prerequisites and you have high grades in those courses; it will impact your application positively. The opposite holds true as well. There are certain professions such as doctors and nurses where grades are significant. What do grades tell? It simply reveals how hungry are you to succeed (on paper or in real life?). It shows how competitive you are and maybe your motivation to succeed. How do people get higher grades? When I was in my undergraduate program (Penn State), a lot of people had far better grades than me mainly because they took a lot of cupcake classes that had an easy A written on it. Since the classes required a very minimal amount of work, it allowed them to get a GPA boost. In fact, at one point I felt that getting a good GPA is very similar to playing a videogame.Some people would purposely take harder classes in summer to get a better GPA or at times to even pass the course. Historically and statistically, summer semesters are easier to deal with. Why? Because most of the professors are gone and some graduate student is teaching during that time.There were others who would wait semesters to get the professor/instructor of their choice (See RateMyProfessors.com \u2013 Find and rate your professor or campus.).Then there were some who would take AP exams before coming to college and get a waiver for some of the known hard classes. I am not saying that AP\u2019s are easy, but at least they are standardized.Some students took classes where one of the TA\u2019s would be their friend, and I know at least at two instances where the TA gave question papers to a couple of students. Not that this happens all the time, but some students do get an edge if not an entire set of exam questions.What do grades don\u2019t tell? It doesn\u2019t say anything about the financial situation of the student. I remember how some students used to sell their wardrobe because they didn\u2019t have enough money to pay their tuition.It doesn\u2019t say anything about what a student might be going through. A student may be going through a hard time because of a death in the family, or something unfortunate happened to them. I distinctly remember how I was encouraged to withdraw from the semester (after paying 16k out of which none was coming back to me) because I had to miss two weeks of classes due to a family emergency. I am not saying every professor is like that, but there are still many out there who set their rules in the stone. (By the way, I didn\u2019t withdraw :)\u2026 I did get a big F in my Basketball class)It doesn\u2019t say anything about the background of a student and his/her family. For example, I am the first person to go to college in my entire lineage. Imagine, how hard it would have been for my parents to help me do my homework or help me learn anything beyond grade 6 books.I know students who would try different hacks to find the right balance between academics and their financial conditions. For example, some colleges charge you flat-rate tuition beyond a certain number of credits. Penn State had flat-rate tuition beyond 12 credits. I remember taking 22 credits in one semester (18 credits was the max load you could take during fall/spring semester, and I had to get the department approval to do that). On average, students would take 15\u201316 credits, However, almost no recruiter/company will understand such ROI because we were students. People need excel spreadsheets and powerpoint presentation before they can take you seriously.Grades don\u2019t talk about your bravery where you took a class that was entirely out of your league, and you still took the risk without any care for the grade just because you wanted to learn something new. Most of my general education classes were beyond my league, and even though my grades were not so great, it still helped me in becoming well-rounded.Grades don\u2019t talk about how students bust their ass working a 20\u201340-hour job to take some of the burden off their parent's shoulder.On top of all this, I was an international student which means I had even more restrictions on what I could do and what I cannot. Having someone around you vs. having your loved ones 9000 miles far is a whole different situation.Physical disabilities can militate your success. I am legally blind from one eye, and no one has an idea about how it impacts me and my studies. I sometimes find it hard to look at one thing because of the amount of stress my one eye has to take. I was always bullied about my eye since my early childhood because my brain doesn't know how to communicate with my left eye and it went on during my college years as well. It affects your circle of friends and your mind is not the same as others.From a college perspective, as long as you graduate, you should be fine, but there has to be some rationale behind low grades. If you were studying all day and still got bad grades, then there is a problem. But, if you were merely using the college setting as a playground to fail and learn, it's a different ball game. At least this was the case with me. I was apprehensive about my grades after I finished college. Luckily, there was someone out there who still wanted to hire me. During my master's program, my GPA has always stayed in the honors list range not because I am great at what I do but purely because I understand how GPAs work. For me, low grades don't matter as long as someone can provide me with a plausible explanation. People can have low grades for a variety of reasons as I mentioned above. Now, one can argue that maybe I should not have taken too many classes. However, things are not so simple in a student\u2019s head. I sometimes wish colleges made an effort to understand a Student\u2019s brain better. The most critical element in a college is the student itself and guess what? Most don\u2019t care to get that right. College/School to me was nothing more than a chemistry lab where I performed different experiments. A lot of them ultimately failed but what I learned from those failures are unfortunately not recorded on transcripts. Don\u2019t worry too much about grades. Be open-minded and keep learning\u2026 \u201c[You] will either find a way or make one\u201d (Hannibal) ",

He spent most of his time studying and did not while away the hours on things his peers considered cool. He did not have very many friends but he kept studying hard knowing that eventually this would help him have a better life. He aced his board exams and nailed the entrances. He got into the IIT of his choice. He worked hard and remained among the top few in his batch. He eventually landed a great job which he continued to excel at due to his fantastic and diligent work ethic and his humble demeanor. Did his grades matter? Yes they did. They helped him at every stage of his career, both as a student and professionally; they came with some added skillsets that were very helpful to him later on in life as well; he always was and continues to be a shining example for every middle class kid; he will always be \u201cSharma ji ka ladka\u201d. Bunty had terrible grades. He spent time playing sports and hitting the gym but was never committed enough to either to actually excel at them. He always thought he was very smart but that the education system was stupid. He strutted quoting Jobs and Gates and Zuck; their stories of how dropping out of college was why they became successful, yada yada yada. He had below average grades in his boards and ended up in a very mediocre college. Eventually when he graduated he struggled for a couple of years to find a job. Finally he ended up working for his dad\u2019s friend and never really had a career. He spent the rest of his life telling people how the system is flawed and how he deserves better and that the world was missing out. Neha was a girl of many talents. She was an excellent athlete. Since a very young age, she spent hours on the field pushing herself, training herself to be good at track and field. She won competition after competition, medal after medal at different levels and never gave up. She continued to grow. She was also an accomplished pianist. She practiced for years and kept getting better with time. She had multiple solo performances every year and people were in awe of her talents. She had above average grades; she made it a point to remain in the top 35% of her class at all times. She eventually ended up in one of the best universities in the world because of her multifaceted profile; she had a story that would go on to inspire thousands.  Do grades (GPA) really matter? They sure do unless you\u2019re darn good at something else that\u2019s equally if not more valuable to the college you\u2019re applying to or the job you\u2019re trying to secure. 10th - 72% (SSC board, Pune)12th - 71% (HSC board, Pune)B.E. - 65% (Tiny engineering college by the highway, Pune)GRE Score - Q:790 V:500 (Facepalm)M.S. GPA - 3.8/4.0 I never had great grades but ever since I was a kid I had a ton of other value additions; scholarships, olympiads, projects, competitions, robotics; when it was time to tell a story, I had one that someone wanted to hear and that was what helped me compensate for the mediocre grades. I also acquired problem solving skills over the years because of all these other things and that is something I personally feel helps me a lot at my job. Make sure you\u2019re excellent at something. It could be a sport of your choice; it could be music or literature or robotics or birding or one of a million other things; the point is that you need to be very passionate and dedicated about the thing you pick to the point where you actually make an impact. The day you do that, you can say \u201cGrades don\u2019t matter\u201d; but until then, pick up that text book and get back to studying; there\u2019s nothing wrong with walking the tried and tested path. One way or the other, there\u2019s no substitute for working hard and consistently.  Every great dream begins with a dreamer, however,It does not do well to dwell on dreams and forget to live.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Also, No.  I am going to assume that you are an Indian. And Yes, whatever I am going to spit out in this medium length rant is perfectly applicable to the Educational systems all around the world. But before I truly get to the meat of the topic, let me put out a few of my thoughts. When you are dealing with a laaaarge number of people, you need a system which makes things easy to evaluate. There is no walking around this. You need a system in place. Otherwise, you will face issues of far greater consequences than the minor issue of the inconsistency of the grading system. In simple words, if you take out the existing system, you run the risk of introducing choas and anarchy in the long run.Hence, you need some sort of a system (in this case, one which depends on grades and marks. GPA, basically). How else are you going to decide which student is worthy among the billion people on this country?Now, anyone with a brain bigger than the size of a walnut knows that the system in place isn't perfect. In fact, at certain places, it is messy. Our grading system is based on the concept of Rote-learning. You, as a student, are supposed to know answers to possible and probable questions. And write them down in your answer paper. If you write them in a way which pleases the teacher (or the one who checks your paper), you get more marks. And more grades.Now, the grading system is (kinda?) based on the concept of work. The more work you put into it, the more you gain. The system doesn't care if the work you put is the right kind of work required to succeed in life, but, it does tell you that you're going to have to work your butt off if you have to succeed at life.From what I've observed on a general level, people who work their butts off have never been complete failures. Sure, they might not have got to where they've wanted to be, but they've never been complete failures. At some point of time, they have tasted the fruits of their labour.This is where the indoctrination starts. The system rewards you for gaining a high GPA. The system drills into your head that getting good grades is the only way to get a good life. And the worst part? Upto a certain point of your life, IT IS TRUE.If you get a seat into a good college, you WILL improve your chances of getting a better job as you're in a competitive environment. Where everyone is at the top of their game, surrounded by the best equipment and facilities (in this case, professors and equipment). Being put in a competitive environment will almost always make you level up over time. Not to mention, better colleges get better placement offers, more professors with international contacts, and such benefits. There's almost nothing to lose, and a lot to gain by getting into a prestigious college.Hence, anyone who flat out claims that GPA doesn't matter are selling you a sugercoated lie. It is easy to sit behind a keyboard and talk nonsense. Don't listen to the jibber-jabber of the critics, the people in the audience watching the game. They think they know a lot, but in reality, they don't. Instead, listen to the ones who've played the game, and lived to tell the tale. That being said, I am the kind of guy to drop multiple truth bombs in my answers. So, if you're in class 12, and are worried about your GPA, stop wasting your time online and study for whatever exams you have to study for to get to a good college. And hey, bookmark this answer and come read this another day and let me know where you've reached. Leave a comment maybe. I'd be happy to respond. Now, if you HAVE managed to get to a prestigious college (or university)\u2026 Until now, you've been told that grades are the only thing that matter. You can stop believing that lie right away.Learn a skill which puts you at the top of your college. It can be anything. Poster design. Content Creation. Music. Dance. Bodybuilding. Engineering. Programming. Anything. Always, Always keep working on this skill.As you spend more time on this skill, you will realise the effect of compounding. Small investments snowball into a large return over time.Do not be blind to the life around you, though. Become a social master. Learn the art of making friends. It might be hard. Do it anyway. You are a human. You need a social life inorder to survive. If you're socially awkward, work on getting over it. If you think that being awkward makes you a special snowflake, get out of here. This answer isn't for you.Participate in a lot of events so that you get a chance to find out what you really like. I regret not doing this early on. Don't make the same mistakes I've made.Stop chasing women. Again, take advice from this dude who learned it the hard way. Talk to a lot of women, though. Flirt more often too.If you're interested in whatever you're learning, find professors who are looking for people to work in projects. The more you work on it, the more your interest might grow and the better relationships you form with professors. I'm tired so I'll stop this answer incomplete. The guy needs a break. Do let me know what you feel about this in the comments section. And yes, I know that I've gone off in a tangent at times. Bear with me, honey. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a story  There was a girl who was super-attractive. Everyone in the college thought she would become an actress someday. It was not uncommon to find 5 to 15 messages from random guys, almost everyday, trying to please her. Few years later, she got married. And everyone was stunned looking at her beau. He wasn\u2019t handsome. Neither well-built not tall. Had thinning grey-hair. Wore thick glasses and even his smile wasn\u2019t charming. He was nowhere closer to her in looks. Most of her close friends asked her, how did you fall for him? He doesn\u2019t look good. His fashion sense is terrible. And she replied\u2014 He is smart. He has quite a few patents and papers on his name. His intelligence turns me on and he has an amazing sense of humour.  People fall for looks. They get attracted towards looks and it is one of the first few things that gets you instant brownie points. But if you want to make someone look beyond your appearance, then you need to have something else to compensate it. Like intelligence, humour, conversation skills, fitness etc. Similarly, Your GPA is like your appearance. If you are not the best at it, it is still fine. But have something else to compensate for it. And this \u2018something else\u2019 should fit the job description better. For example, For a product designer job, there are two candidates. Both took the same modules\u2014 Like corrosion, air conditioning, thermodynamics, manufacturing process, fluid mechanics etc. One has A\u2019s in all the subjects and he is a five-pointer. The second has B and B- in all his subjects and has an average GPA. However, the first one was not able to present an idea properly, while the second one aced with his the presentation skills. Furthermore, he was certified in two leading CAD softwares and had an exemplary design portfolio. And the interviewer was more inclined to pick him. So in case you messed up your GPA, try building up a strong portfolio and expand your skill-set. And pick jobs accordingly. It works in most cases. I know lot of living examples. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they matter for a number of reasons. I graduated summa cum laud for my B.S. I get paid a salary that is $5k per year more than the normal stipend that my university offers in my graduate program (plus they paid my moving expenses). My university already provides a higher than normal stipend and health insurance (insurancr is uncommon), so I\u2019m in a good place in large part because of my GPA. They offered me this extra money (plus moving expenses as well) because I had a strong application in the areas that they care about. Of course my GPA was not the only consideration that made me a strong candidate, I also had great letters of rec, and scored well on the GRE, and had research experience. It is also easier to get into good labs for undergrad research if you have good grades. My professor for my first undergrad research project literally asked me about my grades in his class before he offered me the opportunity to work with him. His letter of rec was the strongest one on my application. So back to the previous point, GPA isn\u2019t the only thing that mattered on my application, but my research experience and letters of rec would not have been as impressive to the admissions committee if I had not been able to get into research due to lower grades. I realize that many people don\u2019t plan to stay in academia post-grad, and I\u2019m not sure how grades impact people in that situation, but in the world of academia, grades really do matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Do grades really matter to make it big? Yes, they do. Are grades sufficient for making it big? No, they aren\u2019t. Are grades necessary for making it big? No, they aren\u2019t. Grades are like most other things (your college, previous work experience, communication skills, existing network, IQ, EQ etc) one of the parameters that together define your future. Taken in isolation, all of them help and matter but none of them are either sufficient or necessary. What we need to realize is that we all live under some constraints (money, time, bandwidth, aspirations etc), so we all have to continuously make choices, often without knowing whether or not it is the most optimal choice. But that is the point, it is okay to make a sub-optimal choice, as long as it is your choice and not you floating through life / avoiding making a choice. E.g. I had long ago decided that grades don\u2019t matter to me. Did it hurt me? Yes. I am sure a lot of people would have thought I wasn\u2019t very smart considering I was barely scraping through in both my undergrad and grad. May be. with better grades I would have been able to spend more time with the best students / profs. May be, I would have studied in IIM A (my first choice) instead of FMS (my second choice). May be, I would have joined a consulting firm (my first choice at that time) instead of a telecom company. But I knew that MBA wasn\u2019t very important to me, in-fact I publicly claimed that if I don\u2019t get through IIM A / FMS, I would work for a couple of years and then decide if I want to do an MBA. Similarly at FMS, the company that I would join wasn\u2019t important to me, I knew I would drop out of it soon enough. So, I let go of grades and I focused on things that mattered to me. On reading, on building lifelong friendship with many people, on experiences, on Age of Empires, on Cricket, on helping others, on taking long walks and discussing existential questions. By no measure, have I made it big, but I do I think I have done fairly okay. And I know (just like you probably do) people of both kinds, who chose / didn\u2019t choose to work on grades, and have done pretty well. The common factor being that they chose depending on what they thought was the right thing to do at that point in time. Conclusion: Do grades matter? To some they do, to some they don\u2019t. Don\u2019t let someone else make that decision for you, ask others and listen to them carefully, and then make the decision for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "When you apply for a job, at least in a tech or scientific field, the GPA may serve as a screener. Company X only wants job candidates with a GPA of 3.0 or better, while Company Y insists on 3.5 or higher, on a 4.0=A scale. Certainly some companies in some fields will be so impressed by your charisma, recommendations and family connections that the only requirement is passing. Graduate schools will likely have a formula to decides who gets in. I saw the actual secret formula at one graduate department in the 1970s. You got points for a high Graduate Record Exam, points for your GPA tempered by the quality of your undergrad school and its degree of grade inflation, the difficulty of the courses you took, the quality of recommendations, and whether you had done a research project. Points were then added to the total if the applicant was in certain minority groups. So a high GPA can help you get into a quality grad school, and to get a plum assignment in that school, like research assistant to a prominent faculty member. This can eventuate in a greater likelihood of getting a good job after graduate school. A high GPA in a terminal undergrad program can help you get a good first job. After graduate school or after the first job, no one will care whether you were at the top or bottom of your class, although it might help in a job search if you mentioned academic honors. Employers or clients will be more interested in your work experience and job history. ",

            "answer_text": "It matters to some employers, and doesn\u2019t matter to others. More or less depends on the country you\u2019ll be looking for a job at. However, the truth, whether it\u2019s hard or pleasant, is that it absolutely SHOULD NOT matter. Why? Let me give you a personal example here. While doing a bachelor, my GPA was around 3.7\u20133.8. Now I\u2019m a business major student (master) , and the curriculum has many similarities with my bachelor\u2019s, my GPA is 3.5, 3.48 to be exact. For a business major graduate it should be sufficient, though some require higher. However, there\u2019s an issue. \u201cIf an investment promises high returns why don\u2019t we put all of our money into it?\u201d That was the question asked by one of the students in my batch after 1.5 of studies during our last financial course. I stress on the word LAST. That student, as far as I know, has a higher GPA, probably around 3.7. She took several financial courses, and still doesn\u2019t know the concept that every business major student should: risk and diversification. Something we were told during our first financial lesson here. A very basic concept in the field, basically \u201c2+2=4\u201d of finance. Unfortunately, that\u2019s just a part of the problem. Did I mention that the school I study at is at the world\u2019s Top 100? Well, it should matter, in theory, until a professor gives everybody pretty much the same grade without checking his notes on who did better or worse than the others. The fact that I study in a semi-prestigious school also fades when another professor simply doesn\u2019t attend any of his own classes, sending his students, who themselves don\u2019t know too much, instead. He postpones the exam till next semester, and then he gives you C, a year after the exam was taken. Oh well, he doesn\u2019t give it to you himself, his assistant does, the assistant who tells you that the grade is based only on the exam alone, since they didn\u2019t have any other works done in class. The best thing is, it\u2019s not one and only occasion. Still believe that GPA is a good way to judge somebody? While I was troubled because my academic efforts simply don\u2019t pay off, my mom told me that she while studying in both school and university, she would also receive grades lower than she knew, she should have. Yet now, as she is a doctor, people come to her from different places of the whole country! All because of her hard work during university years, and, most importantly, after. I don\u2019t think those people care much about her GPA. Still think your grades matter? The truth is, unless we are talking about some of the science majors, one\u2019s ability for self improvement and education, learning skills and the ability to adapt plus some theoretical and practical background are the most important factors demonstrating whether a job applicant is suitable for a particular job or a graduate school applicant is suitable to receive a higher degree. That and the results of self education, whether it\u2019s a learnt programming language, foreign language, certificate confirming the level of professional skills, etc. To sum it all up, GPA and a higher education diploma in general, are very questionable criteria, in my humble opinion. There are many more better and reliable ways to prove your intellect, knowledge and skills. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you're asking about employment. The rule of thumb I've heard that has been true in my experience is that if it's your first job out of college, employers care about your GPA, and any relevant work experience you may have picked up while in school. That's it. They don't care about the individual grades you got in your classes. One thing I tried, though I have no idea how well it succeeded, is also putting what my GPA was inside my major on my resume, since it was a bit better than my overall GPA. After your first post-graduate job, no one cares about your GPA. They care about your relevant work experience. In terms of everything else, grades are relative. It depends on the scoring system the schools use, and how strictly they adhere to it. If grades are based on the teacher's knowledge of the subject, then it's a matter of whether the school is good at hiring teachers who really know their stuff or not. If it's based on demonstrated knowledge to a standard curriculum, then it may be more of an absolute score, where bad teachers will tend to produce low scoring classes, but then it's a matter of whether the curriculum is rigorous or not. In any case, trying to exceed expectations, I think, puts you in good stead in life, regardless of what the scoring system is. This requires some original thinking, and initiative. ",

It is kind of people you choose to make friends with. That will make or break your life. And usually your grade will decide which kind of people you will be with. Below average intelligence people God created them to be perfect audience. These are people with poor grades who will serve as waiter, driver, Butler, shop keeper etc. Company of such people will destroy your ambition and that will be the biggest failure. Your chances of being with them is very high with poor grades. Above average intelligence narcissistic people These are people with super high grades, they usually get an easy job as a Banker and typically fiance guy. They are usually the ones who run around professors, being ready to answer and prove they are the best and rest of the world is their slave. They do not make any friends and they never learn value of happiness without money. Good grades will bring you in their company where you will eventually become a good narcissistic leader. And ofcourse money will follow. Above average intelligence researchers These are the kind of guys with high grades but with absolutely no social interest. Typical book worms, and usually loners. They do good job, they truly invent everything that we use it. Be it touch screen phone, be it cancer medicines and be it x ray machines. Good grade will get you in company of such people where you will make best of your life by inventing something for better human life. Average intelligent people These are people like the ones who didn't make to school or business school but still created great products. Such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs etc. Such people usually do not run after grades because they truly understand that even without grades, you can still channelize your energy to make something great. These are people who value human relationships, and usually have perfect work life balance with happiness for everyone. So let your grades be as it is, choose company of good people and that will make your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes, absolutely! Never think otherwise. Don\u2019t ever listen to that drunk senior, sitting outside his room and preaching you during your first week at college, about how grades don\u2019t matter and things like cultural fests, student body posts, sports etc are the only things you need on your resume. Never ever. Disclaimer: Before you read ahead, I want to make completely sure, that in no way I am suggesting that college fests, extra curricular, sports etc don\u2019t matter. They do, but the line \u2018GPA doesn\u2019t matter, X is the thing you should do at college.\u2019 is the single biggest misleading line, I have heard during my college years. They are playing with your college lives, most probably because they didn\u2019t do much with theirs, or because they were really great at juggling things, and you might not be. Now, why GPA would matter, A lower GPA from the beginning would lower your self esteem and you would be drifting to even lower GPAs in the next years. Now, I am not saying you can\u2019t pull yourself back up, but trust me it\u2019s not that simple to wash off your sins. Pulling your GPA in the later years of your college life is extremely tough.Beginning from second or third year, you would mostly be doing group projects. And, if you have a lower GPA, you would have high chances of ending up with groups with lower average GPAs, less motivation for the work, a half-finished project, and again a lower grade on the subject. It\u2019s a cycle.Now, don\u2019t you want to bag that much talked about internship in your third year? A lot of companies, sometimes even after taking tests, end up shortlisting people with higher GPAs and top students in the class for interviews. So, you might end up not even having a shot at that dream company, no matter how good you were with your concepts.Do you want to pursue research? Most of the professors would prefer students with something to prove, and the easiest way to prove your mettle to your professors is a good grade at their course and a good GPA. Also, professors already know students with good GPAs from their peers and you would have a higher chance at getting that project you want.What about that MS/PhD at the top universities that you want to go to next? Your GPA is the single most trustworthy metric to gauge from your resume for someone who doesn\u2019t know you (unless you really have good research papers, noteworthy projects, and wonderful recommendations). And, remember, now you are not competing with just your college, but a very large talent pool, possibly the entire world. If you don\u2019t have great research/projects on your resume, then nothing else will stand out from someone else, except your GPA. A good GPA will at least give you a shot of being looked at from a heavy pile of resumes dumped every year.I am not insinuating that, GPA is the only things that matters, but, it is one of the most important things that does.

She knows she wouldn\u2019t have gotten into grad school without good grades, so for her, grades were really important. Jim doesn\u2019t have top grades, but he does have a lot of friends. Senior year, he applies to software engineering jobs, and gets referrals to all the best companies. He solves several hundred questions on LeetCode, and gets a great job offer right out of college. For Jim, grades weren\u2019t important; what mattered were friendships and interview prep. If you have great grades, you will find that grades matter a lot. If you have great work experience, you will find that experience critical to your success. If you have great people skills, you will find that matters a lot too. The most successful people recognize their strengths early on, and choose goals and activities that leverage their strengths. ",

            "answer_text": "Good grades tell you one of the two things, either the kid is a hardworker with reasonable intelligence or smart with low effort. There are several aspects of an individual that are needed to make them the choice of an organisation to hire. Fortunately or unfortunately, GPA is just one of them. If you have a high one then that\u2019s great, if not then you need to compensate. For example, the recruiter might choose someone who is charismatic/hard worker, ambitious/obedient subordinate/ attractive/ quick smart, street smart / skilled or experienced / has ability or aptitude / an appealing accent / similar personality, etc over GPA. The problem is that you probably need like 20 things right to get the job. Again GPA is one of them. A reasonable GPA grade is important for science(Engineering/medical). Mostly Grades matter less as you get older and into professional life. But in high school/middle school they help to differentiate. To conclude, it\u2019s better to have a high one than not. But if you don\u2019t have it then compensate with something else awesome. Exceptions are top universities or organisations where high GPA is a minimum entry requirement. Just because you have a high GPA doesn\u2019t mean everything else will fall in place. You still need to work hard in other areas and aspects. ",

            "answer_text": "A final year computer science student with a GPA of more than 9.5 out of 10, gets rejected from a company interview as he couldn't even answer the basic CS questions. That guy was my friend of 4 years. I saw him cry the whole night. In the morning, he chucked out his resume and marksheets as he settled down to study basics of programming. No interviewer ever asked for his grades as he went on to solve the most complex problems of computer science. This made me realise that GPA holds way less importance now than it did a decade ago. People have slowly realised the incompetence of our education system and know that good grades are not a measure of good skills and knowledge. Getting good grades involves just a good rattofying power and dedication a night before the exams. Even the course books are written in such a way. Recently I decided to study some marketing basics for my startup and came across a book that my sister(she is MBA in marketing) used to study during coursework. The book was framed in exact manner that the questions would come in exams, rather than being informative. Trust me, I couldn't move past 2 pages and started reading online blogs and watching videos to learn more. Many companies including most startups have realised the shortcomings of a degree and the GPA system and do not care about your degree as long as you are proficient in your domain and skilled and hardworking. However, I would not say that GPA has lost its importance in every aspect of industry. For example, you still need to show excellent grades to get into world's top colleges. The brand of your college degree still matters a lot when you apply for jobs in big MNCs or go to investors for money for your startup. However, the trend is changing at a significant rate and we can safely assume that in the next decade, most of the opportunities will be skill based, rather than GPA based. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on purely personal experience. I have two friends, Ex and Wye.  Ex was a very studious guy. He used to study everyday on the topics the classes focused on. He never missed any lecture without any extreme reason (like being sick or house catching on fire) and always listened to the words the instructors uttered very attentively. He was the rescuer for the other students. We constantly disturbed him with our inquiries and silly questions. He helped us, always. Of course Ex had a great CGPA. After graduation in the year 2017, he became a lecturer. He will be flying to Canada pretty soon for pursuing higher degrees. He will do MS, then PhD. He aims at being a great researcher. He is totally on track and doing great.  My other friend Wye, was not a very attentive guy in the classroom. He used to bring his laptop with him to the classes. During the lectures, while most of the students were trying to understand what the instructors were talking about, Wye would totally ignore all that and occupy himself with his laptop. In later semesters, he was hardly attending any classes. No, he was not wasting time. He was actually coding and solving algorithmic problems on various websites. In later years, he became one of the best competitive programmers in our university and his team did great in ICPC Dhaka regional site contest. Of course he had an average CGPA. He used to study only for few days before the exams. After graduation, Wye got a job in Singapore, now he is in Silicon Valley. He never cared much for good results. And this never stopped him.  The point is, if grades do not matter to you, something else should. And that something else should be worth it. If you fail to find your something else, stick to good grades. Good grades are not going to harm you anyway. This is how it works. ",

Don\u2019t be fooled. Depending on what you want to do, grades and standardized test scores are what matter most at certain points in your academic career. Try getting into a respected Law, Pharmacy, Veterinary, or Medical school with a \u201cC\u201d average and 50 percentile standardized test scores. For Law school you can find schools that may take you if you have ratty grades and low test scores (LSAT) but the reality is that those school either don\u2019t prepare you well for passing the bar exam and or will cost you an arm or a leg to attend. So can you be an \u201cF\u201d student, drop out of school and make it big? Of course. But if you want a well paying career, in MOST cases, your grades will determine what school you can attend and for example if you like computers\u2026. a computer science degree from Stanford probably is more valuable to your career than a computer science degree from University of North Dakota\u2026 Students really need to use their common sense on this topic and wake up and smell the darn coffee!

            "answer_text": "\u201cYou know, I'm fairly intelligent, but I don't think my grades reflected that\u201d- Every backbencher in this world I want to share an interesting story. I had a bad result in my 2nd semester, I was home for my holidays and instead of fooling around I wanted to do something productive with my time. I went to my dad and soon, he handed over a job order to me. It was an order to manufacture 2000 rotor blades. I was given the responsibilty of making 1000 rotor blades out of the scrap that was leftover in our warehouse. The purchase order was of rs. 10,00,000. I was just a 2nd year engineering student and I started sweating quite a bit. But my dad had his own way of making this game a bit more interesting. Dad Said, \u2018Meet Mr Shah, Siddharth. He had recently graduated and is a gold medalist engineer from M.S. University. He\u2019ll be making the remaining rotor blades in the other plant\u2019. After saying this my dad left and I was sweating Niagara falls ! We both had to complete the order within a month. I took it to myself as an opportunity to learn. Here\u2019s what all i did and learnt. While we have a CNC machine to cut out the work piece to the required dimensions, we needed to develop a vendor for shearing the blades at the lowest possible price as this type of job was a regular at our company. I hustled to some vendors in the city and found out a vendor who had reasonable rates. His price was rs 10/piece. I talked around a bit and bought down his price to rs 6/piece even though he had to cut the rusted scrap metal, risking the life of his machine. I learnt how to negotiate :)Total shearing cost: rs 6000. 2. I was given charge of 2 contractors for the job order. Together, they charged rs 3/kg to fabricate. The total job weighed 55000 kgs. First 2 days we just made a total of 7 rotor blades. I counted and figured that at this pace we\u2019re not even going to make it to 200. I divided the work load. I made contractor \u2018A\u2019 incharge of the CNC machine and Also of welding the blades . Contractor \u2018B\u2019 was given the responsibility to check the dimensions of the work pieces cut from the cnc machine and of grinding the welded joints. I declared, If the dimensions aren\u2019t right contractor \u2018B\u2019 will reach me and if the grinding finish isn\u2019t right, Contractor \u2018A\u2019 will reach me. I managed to develop a healthy competition between them. We manufactured the blades in 25 days with our quality department clearing all the pieces. I learnt how to manage a given situation :) Total labour cost: rs 1,65,000 3. The job required the use of electrodes, grinding wheels and paint. Our store has a policy of only providing the necessary amount of supplies required for a particular job. If required, it provides with extra supplies. expect for grinding wheels (required to remove the rust from the scrap metal), Our team never ordered for any extra supplies. I learnt to use resources judiciously :) Total Supply cost: 2,00,000 I knew Mr shah would have completed his job by now but I was happy that i completed the job assigned to me. I went to my dad\u2019s office with a small chit and a few papers on the 25th day. The chit read. Total cost: Rs 3,71,000 Total profit: Rs 6,29,000 How much of it mine ? - Siddharth. There were two papers I stapled behind the chit. One was dispatch clearance paper for the 1000 rotor blades stamped by the quality department. The other was the dispatch paper for the same. After reading my dad looked at me and said, \u2018 Mr shah hasn\u2019t even manufactured 500 blades\u2019 I was atonished and wanted to pat my back at the same time. \u2018you see son, Its not about the grades but solving real life problems\u2019 I felt better about my semester and wanted to pat myself twice. \u2018After all i\u2019m just a diploma graduate\u2019 I felt proud of my dad to have reached this far. I wanted to pat his back and hug him. \u2018i\u2019m proud of you son\u2019, he smiled, gave a pat on my back and hugged me. ",

I even went into probation in my very first semester with a CGPA below 2.0. My life should have been fucked, right? That\u2019s what I thought as well. After all, aren\u2019t good grades supposed to be the ticket to a bright future?  These are the events that took place after graduation Within 3 months of graduation, I started working as a UI/UX Designer earning the same amount of money as most of my classmates with a GPA above 3.0One year after that, I got the opportunity to work on projects with organizations like Mitsubishi (Autism Assisted) and the National Center for Big Data and Cloud Computing (Pakistan\u2019s Official Open Data Portal). At this moment, I was earning more than most of my friends with better academic records.How did I do it? Did my GPA have anything to do it? ABSOLUTELY NOT! In fact, none of my employers to date know my GPA. It\u2019s not on my resume and frankly, I have not even been asked about it in any of the interviews. For my first job, I had not taken a single design course throughout my degree and got it simply based on my experience as the executive council member of the design society at my university. For my second job, I was reached out by one of my professors who I had worked with on setting up a design conference in Pakistan. It was this side project and the relationship I had developed that got me those big opportunities. So what am I actually trying to explain here? Getting a better GPA in university does not lead to a higher paying job. The only thing that matters is how much skills and experiences you\u2019ve acquired in your university. Here\u2019s my recommendation. Instead of being fixated on the GPA, reduce your studying time by 50\u201360% and only focus on doing enough to get decent grades. Don\u2019t fail of course! :D Then invest the rest of the time in doing everything else in your university that will lead to your personal development. These could be running different projects, society experiences or even playing different sports. If by the time you graduate, you feel like you\u2019ve actually maximized your time at the university, trust me the market will reward you with the maximum gains as well ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Are we talking high school or college? GPA has different values depending on your current level of education? Let me start by just saying that many people believe a top GPA, the elusive 4.0, can get you into top schools like Harvard, Stanford, etc. This is not true. So many factors go into the college admissions game, even when I earned straight A\u2019s other students went on to much better universities.  High school: Do you want graduate top of your class? Do you want to get into an honor program? Do you want to go to a top college? Do you want a scholarship? If you care about any of these then yes, GPA matters. Let me tell you my story about how GPA impacted my high school life. I attended a public university and completed the IB program. I graduated valedictorian and earned a 4.0 unweighted and 4.95 weighted GPA. Now it may seem like I had my college and future locked up with such good grades. Not really. GPA is only part of the equation, especially for college. My ACT/SAT was not the best 96th percentile. Extracurriculars and essay were strong. I earned a half-ride scholarship to a small in-state university. The top schools I was accepted to were UCLA and UC Berkeley. Other top universities rejected me. In the end many students in my grade, with worse GPA\u2019s, ended up going to schools like Notre Dame, USC, Brown, Carnegie Mellon. Others even got full rides just because they got a 35 on the ACT and did JV tennis.  College: The importance of GPA in undergraduate school depends on a few factors. If you want to make the deans list then you have to carry an above average GPA, probably 3.75 to make the cut. Graduate school really cares about GPA, so many qualified candidates are competing for a spot at some of the best programs at the top universities in the world. Some jobs/internships also care about what GPA you earned in college. I also know that you have to carry a strong GPA to study abroad by junior year. College is an experience, it\u2019s more than just grades.  ",

            "answer_text": "It shouldn\u2019t matter but it does because we put so much emphasis on it. It is my believe that 90 - 95% of people have different talents. these include academics, music, art, entrepreneurship, sport, leadership, economics, oration, etc. Some people obviously posses more than one. The problem with school grades is they\u2019re designed to measure only one of these many talents. The result being that the 10% of kids who excel in it are celebrated as great achievers, 70% are average and 15 - 20% who can\u2019t cope are failures. Kids who don\u2019t achieve academically are conditioned early on in life to believe that they won\u2019t amount to nothing. They inevitably grow up with low self esteem and end up fulfilling the prophecy in many cases. Imagine for a moment if the primary focus of school was sport. You\u2019d probably have the same amount (10%) of top achievers, majority in the middle and the rest as failures. Music or art will bear no different results. I think that the education system should change completely from one where everyone is assumed and expected to learn and achieve the same thing to one where the abilities and talents that the child posses is nurtured and developed. This approach I believe will lead to many more balanced and confident people and will rid us of many of the current socio-economic issues that we face around the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly. Many of the people posting answers here say that grades represent hard work. That\u2019s not necessarily true. Good grades represent that you are a good regurgitator of information. It means you are good at acting in a robotic fashion - soaking in somebody else\u2019s information and spitting it out on a piece of paper, over and over. Grades are not necessarily a reflection of critical, independent, dare I say creative thinking. They are not synonymous with character, discipline and work ethic. The thing about education is they don\u2019t teach you how to be the next Steve Jobs, they teach you how to be the next Steve Jobs\u2019s good-boy employee. In most of the cases, the most successful entrepreneurs actually did not care about grades. In fact, they were downright dropouts. I really believe GPAs are a thing of the past, which is why I wrote a blog post detailing 4 critical reasons why I believe GPA\u2019s don\u2019t matter anymore. Here\u2019s the thing - we live in the most empowering age in human history. You literally have unlimited access to a plethora of information. You could easily pick up an online course or read a whole bunch of articles/tutorials about your topic of interest. And you know the best part is? All the barriers that existed in the past are down thanks to the internet and social media! You can apply your knowledge by using the power of the internet and share it with millions of people as we speak! I am literally reaching all of you and sharing my ideas (something I really enjoy by the way) without a 5 or 6 figure degree. None of this possible back in the day, so I invite you to take some time to think about the opportunities the digital age presents to us. I want to wrap this up by saying that, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m against education or graduating from university. But your peace of mind and fulfillment in life need not be predicated on GPA. ",

            "answer_text": "They definitely matter, though they\u2019re not everything either. I know that\u2019s a wishy washy answer, but to summarize, the more academic your goals are, the more important grades are. For getting into college for example, getting good grades is one of the key factors that could get you admission into selective colleges, or get you scholarships. Becoming a tenured professor, especially at a prestigious university, usually requires a great academic record. To get into a good PHD program one has to get good college grades which required good grades in high school. For careers outside academia, GPA in your more recent degree is typically less important. In fact, I heard google no longer relies on GPA when hiring, saying it correlates little with job success. For many other jobs, they may be willing to accept a decent GPA, perhaps 3.0 or above in the American scale. Past that, it\u2019s more up to networking and the interview. But many jobs, including professional ones, don\u2019t care about gpa very much at all, if you got the degree. This means that for a lot of people, the importance of gpa will look something like this, again in the USA: In high school grades are reasonably important if you plan on going to college. Decent grades are necessary to get into a good college and scholarships. In college grades are still important if you plan on going to graduate school. Otherwise, not necessarily as much. In graduate school, it depends more on the context but grades on the whole get less important further, given after this many folks go into industry. Typically, the last degree before your job is the one where grades actually matter the least. They still matter enough you\u2019d want decent grades, say a b average. Though take this all with a grain of salt, I\u2019m talking about the USA general context. Elsewhere I\u2019m not sure.

            "answer_text": "So there're 100 applicants for the same job. They have a 3.7 median GPA.-50 applicants are rejected only based on their GPA (everyone under 3.7).  The company takes a first look at the resume of the other 50 applicants -30 applicants are rejected because their resume is boring and forgettable, with no interesting experience, no big name school, no past internships. The company takes a closer look at the resumes -10 applicants are rejected again because their resume does not stand out that much compared to the others.  The company asks the top 10 applicants over for an interview.  -5 applicants are pretty disappointing at the interview. They are judged not to be a good fit to the company. The company hires one applicant. The four other applicants are kept in the database in case another jobs become available. Maybe it will be a year before the company needs to see them again. Do grades even matter ? Well, if it wasn't for your grades, you wouldn't even make it into the top 50 applicants. But in this economy, you need much more than grades. ",

            "answer_text": "In most of the cases, Yes. In a few cases, No. If you are planning to go for M.Tech, a higher GATE score is most likely to overshadow a weaker GPA. There are very few PSUs which take students directly on the basis of GATE score. Otherwise, candidates are called for interviews on the basis of their GATE score wherein their profile is evaluated. If you are planning to go for MS/PhD, it is natural for you to show your inclination in the field and a good GPA is the best metric to portray that. In case someone doesn't have a good GPA (and otherwise), your project work is also seen deeply and again, a good grade in Thesis project is an obvious metric to prove your interest and research. If you are looking to go for management studies, a bad GPA is heavily looked down upon. And not just your GPA, your 10th and 12th class percentage are also looked very seriously. Every year, despite scoring a great CAT percentile, people do not get calls from IIM A/B if they do not have a good GPA (typically 8+). Only IIMC comes to rescue in such cases because it doesn't consider graduation marks while evaluating profiles but you will still need a high 10th and 12th class percentage here. GPAs are taken way more seriously in B-schools compared to IITs (or engineering colleges). Some companies do not even take interviews for internships/placements other than the Top 10 (or so) Institute Rankers. Companies even try to get the ranks of the students from the institute (which is not known to the students) to make better decisions. If you are thinking in terms of job opportunities, the answer lies in a grey area. As much as it is obvious that any company would like to take a student with a higher GPA provided that the GPA earned is in the field of work that the company does, there are companies which value internships, extra-curriculars and positions of responsibility over GPA if the case is contrary. For e.g. A Civil Engineering student applying for a Business Analyst post, or Business Operations post, or in a bank. Now that the GPA has become irrelevant, the next thing a company would look into would be internships and PORs. So, that makes sense. However, there can be peculiar cases where companies may not prefer a student with a higher GPA even though the field matches. In such cases, companies think that the student may go for higher studies (M.Tech/MS/PhD) and will leave the job eventually. So, they hire students with less GPAs. However, such cases are very rare and mostly happen in PSUs or similar kind of jobs. GPA does reflect a lot about you, irrespective of any of the above case. A good GPA would naturally show your interest and dedication if you want to pursue the field further, otherwise, a good GPA shows that you are still good in doing things that you don't like. Work does get mundane/repetitive at times and any company would want a person who shows efficacy (and doesn't mess things up) even when he/she is not liking the work. To summarize, a good GPA can only do more good than harm. And your resume always looks better if you have it. ",

            "answer_text": "In certain circumstances where it\u2019s weighed heavily (i.e. Law School, Medical School, Business School), it definitely matters. In others, it\u2019s more flexible. I was a first year consultant at IBM when I got a resume for a student from my alma mater who had a 2.8 GPA, well below the 3.2 the recruiting team had requested for entry level positions. He had unfortunately chosen a major that was challenging and not aligned with his interests. This has given him a rocky start from his Freshman year that he had spent most of his college life working backwards from. Luckily, his current major, recent internship, and skill set was a perfect match for the role the recruiter had been seeking. Even she understood that it would be silly to refuse him a chance because of a simple number that he could clearly explain. Long story short is that - if an alignment fits, the GPA will be one of many variables considered. If an alignment is on the fence, the GPA is definitely a good reflection of whether you are a good investment. While your focus should be on a good GPA, if you have a perfect idea of what you want to do and how you can get there, it can be overlooked in favor of this alignment. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you're asking about employment. The rule of thumb I've heard that has been true in my experience is that if it's your first job out of college, employers care about your GPA, and any relevant work experience you may have picked up while in school. That's it. They don't care about the individual grades you got in your classes. One thing I tried, though I have no idea how well it succeeded, is also putting what my GPA was inside my major on my resume, since it was a bit better than my overall GPA. After your first post-graduate job, no one cares about your GPA. They care about your relevant work experience. In terms of everything else, grades are relative. It depends on the scoring system the schools use, and how strictly they adhere to it. If grades are based on the teacher's knowledge of the subject, then it's a matter of whether the school is good at hiring teachers who really know their stuff or not. If it's based on demonstrated knowledge to a standard curriculum, then it may be more of an absolute score, where bad teachers will tend to produce low scoring classes, but then it's a matter of whether the curriculum is rigorous or not. In any case, trying to exceed expectations, I think, puts you in good stead in life, regardless of what the scoring system is. This requires some original thinking, and initiative. ",

I was working at a company. It\u2019s filled with good and smart people. And as co-workers do, we sometimes caught in an arguments about works. Most of the time we could find a way out on ourselves, but some other time we can\u2019t solve the problem that we had to go to our superior. One time the problem was so hard that we went all the way to Director, head of the company who turned out to be the owner. He was surprisingly good with the stuff we\u2019re arguing about. And after a little talk we solved the problem. Some other time, I got a chance to talk to this Director alone. And after some work-related talk we went into a bit personal chat. He asked about my background and so did I. And to my surprise, he was just a high-school graduate with a so so grade back then. He was a normal student, nothing outstanding about him. A high school graduate hiring so many people with so much higher education than him. Yes to get to work in the company you have to be qualified and certified. You have to pass through every step of the interview just like in any other companies. But before you jump into conclusion that I\u2019m encouraging people to drop out of school, I give you a summary. In that company there\u2019re 2 high school graduates, and 20 with diploma/ master degree. The ones with diploma/ master were ranging from manager to new recruits. The 2 persons with high school graduates was the owner, and the other was a janitor. So there you are, YES and NO for the answer. So think carefully. ",

            "answer_text": "I think I am qualified to answer this question. When I was in high school I had lot of dreams, I was curious about building things and solving problems .When I say problems I\u2019m not referring to standard textbook problems but the ones that can either help me make my life simple or help someone else. I was curious about Artificial intelligence, I wanted to publish a research paper, I wanted to be at MIT, I wanted to build real things and solve real problems, I wanted to finally apply mathematics in real life. The decision day was out , and I was unhappy with my boards result. Seemed like everything is over . I ruined my relationship with some of the best people I knew and didn\u2019t perform much well in entrance exams. My JEE Mains rank was horrible. I was doomed! I somehow managed to recover from shock and took admission in a state college based on my rank, took education loan and decided to undo the injustice done by the Universe and the so called Education System. This was when things began to turn the other side. It was beginning of my first year. I started programming everyday , got my hands dirty in competitive programming sport , learnt more about web , explored the fields of big data and learnt about machine learning , took up lot of MOOC s , related to machine learning , algorithms , discrete mathematics, solved those assignments and cleared the final exam with good grades and hard copy of certificate from IIT Madras was delivered to my door step . After all this hard work , By the end of 2nd semester , I had an android application on play store( It was a team effort) and I knew how to code a neural network from scratch :) . July 2016,I was shortlisted among the few students who were invited at MIT to attend HackMIT from India.But unfortunately I failed my VISA interview and couldn\u2019t visit.Anyway I once again managed to recover the shock ( used to it by now ) and moved on. In second year , I got a chance to work as a data science intern at an analytics, IT services and process consulting firm. I finally had a real project to work on. After two months I published first research paper with the help of my professor and may be another one to come in next few months. The very next month (Today) I landed my second internship before the end of my 4th semester and got a chance to work on a Big Data project :) . So in sense I achieved my high school dreams , may be lot more to come in future (**hoping for the best**). Source of Motivation ? You have to create one for your own. Here\u2019s mine : Ever since I graduated from high school , I never celebrated my Birthday because for some personal reason birthdays remind me of things that I should not have done in past . So I decided to use that aggression to lift me up every year :P ( may sound dumb to some people but it works!) . And guess what , Nobody ever asked me about my grades or rank ever since. They may be important initially , but in the long run you should know how to bury them down under your experience and work. People really just care about getting their job done as quick as possible and not how much you scored three or five years from now. Practical skills are more valuable then grades. PS : Neither did I make it big nor did I understand what it means to you .But my point GPAs are not the only parameter that decides my future. ",

In fact, I\u2019ve got scholarships since an elementary school, junior high, senior high (in my time then, parents had to pay for school fees), undegraduate, postgraduate (2 masters overseas), and just completed a PhD in a foreign country last year under a scholarship. Now I\u2019m planning to do a Postdoctoral program under a scholarship, too. People may think it\u2019s so boring to spend so much time studying, but my poor family background that has driven me this way. This doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve never enjoyed my life. Depending on how busy I am with what I\u2019m really passionate about doing, I\u2019ll certainly spend time with family and friends. My poor family background that has made me standout from the crowd so that I can survive. I\u2019ve been offered good jobs from a subordinate level to management level. Having said this, it doesn't mean that I\u2019ve never been rejected\u2014I did have my disappointments too when they advertised a position requiring someone with a doctoral degree, but it turned out they had chosen someone with a master\u2019s degree. When they advertised a job requiring someone with a master's degree, one with a bachelor\u2019s degree was recruited eventually. As I have always tried my best at schools and universities, I have built up the habits of discipline in anything I do. And indeed this has helped me get the best outcomes/the standard that I want for myself and may or may not exceed a company's expectations. This doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve never had obstacles in my life either as a student or employee. I just wished to study the subjects I was really really passionate about so that I knew for sure what I could do best in my future career and could help my family as I came from a poor family. If I were to choose the subjects/major that I knew I had no interest and no capabilities, I would definitely have failed. So it seems that I had worked extemely hard to get good grades so that I could win scholarships. In fact, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, all scholarship agencies just pick up those with high GPA in their field of study. If I didn't get good grades, I wouldn't have been offered all the scholarships from elementary school to a doctoral program. At some point of my life after a PhD though, my good grades and a \u2018beautiful looking CV\u2019 didn't actually win over some universities\u2019 attentions as I was hoping to pursue an academic career. None of the 10 universities I\u2019ve applied has been interested in recruiting me since one year ago. This, to some extent, has made me think that good grades and a bunch of academic qualifications mean nothing in certain places and/or certain (developing) countries. However, I\u2019ve finally landed a job interview and a job without having to apply for it because a company was looking for someone with a doctoral background as noone else in the company had this qualification. And that person recruiting me via LinkedIn was my former network with whom I worked together under the same organisation, but not in the same office. So I\u2019ve learnt my lesson that good grades do not always win job recruiters but scholarship agencies. A good job is not always offered because I\u2019ve applied for it or of my good grades and a basket of academic qualifications, but because I\u2019ve advertised myself and known and kept in touch with good people. People may disagree with all I have said, but it's my own experience, and I appreciate and respect others\u2019 experiences and views on this matter. ",

Gathered some courage and went to Dad and told him about my failure.. His reaction was surprising. He laughed and said, So what? I said, It will affect my grade. He asked again, So what? I said, It will affect my career. He asked the same question again. I said, Dad then how will I achieve my big dreams? He said, Do you know how I used to give exams during my college? After every exam I went for a 3 to 6 movie show, then roamed on the streets, went for a 9 to 12 movie show and returned hostel. Then I opened book and studied for 4\u20135 hours and slept. Everyone thought I never studied and they thought i am gifted. I did not score much. My aggregate was 67 percent. Was it a good grade? Absolutely No! I never cared as I knew my field least mattered to me. I just wanted a degree. While I roamed, I observed how different sellers interacted and what were their policies. What was the demand, how was the supply. I wanted to grasp as much as I could from the market because I always wanted to be a BUSINESSMAN. I knew I am good at it. So, A drop of water in ocean has no identity. But a drop on leaf of lotus shines like a pearl. Be in the best place where you can shine. Grades do not matter.

My observations are that people who enjoy their job are also the most sucessful people. Everyone is not capable of making straight A's in high school. Old school grading on a bell curve guarenteed that most people would get a C letter grade! Only a small percentage could make an A. Sound fair? Probably not. Grade inflation has made most high school students a genius. Universities have had to consider many factors beyond grades to help sort out the kind of student they will accept. 800 on the SAT, captain of sports teams, volunteer work, special talents, great referances, all are used to select the most likely to succeed at their university. A top ivy league university will select the most competative, talented, very smart people. If you are actually a B type of student or have to spend day and night studying to get all A's and have no outside activities, you will likely get crushed at that kind of university. Not a good way to start life. A great gpa, 4.0 or 4.5/4.0 (credit for AP classes is what makes it possible for higher than just 100%, call it an A++) gives you more choices than a lower gpa). Just remember that some of these people never had to study, had all the time to play at the beech, were top athletes, did incredible volunteer work and are very driven to be the best. That's who you would being competing against in the best universities. If you are at the top of your class go for it. What about the large number if people that are in between genius and ditch digger? Yes grades, are very important, they unlock doors give you more choices. Just remember grades alone are not the only key to success. There is a very limited number of super achievers and a lot of room for normal people to fill in the difference. My opinion is that you should enjoy your chosen career, and if you do, you will also enjoy success in it. Remember all careers do not require a college degree, plumbers probably and make more money than a MD, and then there is Bill Gates and Michael Jordan. ",

            "answer_text": "I went through many answers citing personal examples or experiences but there is not an objective answer to this question to be fair. What I feel is if a person is so inclined towards doing something he will make it happen irrespective of any consequences. I ask this question to myself - How far can I go to achieve what I want? And that makes things clearer regarding what I should do and how should I weigh my options considering the present scenarioIf X has bad grades at school there are so many reasons for that which can restrict a person\u2019s true potential. But once something good comes along the way which suits her/him or makes him find the X-factor within which was untraceable all these years that\u2019s the breakeven point where someone starts to make big. For someone like Tendulkar who used to work hard to reach where he is today, had it not been his brother who could spot something in him or a coach who couldn\u2019t nurture his talent or parents who were unsupportive, all his talent and hard work could had lead to not something as big a thing he is today. Another good point which I can add is having good grades may accelarate the process of reaching your aim. However it could also decelarate due to overexposure and lack of focus due to many options.(better grades leads to a better college most of the times and hence many options) Making it big sounds personal to me as everyone is free to make their own definitions of making it big. For someone with poor grades, average intellect or poor living conditions, a part time job could mean a lot. Personally I think independent of consequences. That is, whatever the result I try to do my job, my day does not go waste, I feel satisfied. If you still whine over grades and lose hope of not making it big because of it then it will further push you into a pit. On an ending note, I would like to share one of my favourite quotes  Rome was not built in a day Keep working! ",

            "answer_text": "Short Answer: yes. Long Answer: Grades matter for a variety of reasons but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t focus on anything else. When you are studying in a college/school you should aim for all round development of yourself. Having good grades open a lot of door for you. For instance, when applying for jobs, certain companies restrict the applicants by setting a minimum GPA requirement, when applying for higher studies many top universities may simply reject your application based on your score. Now, I don\u2019t mean that you should work your ass off and aim to score the highest pointer. No, that is not the right way to do it. Like I said earlier, work on your overall development. Let\u2019s take a scenario to understand this: You are studying in an engineering college and your grade scale is 10 point system. Now, you will find students who are consistently scoring 9+ point every semester. Don\u2019t get disheartened by them if you ain\u2019t scoring that much because most of them(depending upon various reasons) might not be improving their knowledge or any of their interpersonal skills. You should aim and try to maintain something between 8 and 9 GPA. Next, you should focus on your extracurricular and co-curricular activities as they are very important. With your co-curricular activities, you will learn more about your field of study, you will get a better understanding of what you are studying and probably get hands-on experience. This will improve your subject knowledge vastly. Then, by participating in extracurricular activities you improve your personality, your social skills, your interpersonal skills, you gain confidence, you learn a new hobby, or improve on your existing ones. How will all this help you? Well, when you will go out looking for a job or applying to a high studies program you will have things to show for yourself. Your resume, your application will speak for itself. Not just a job or studies, you will see a change in yourself. A positive change. You will become more confident, you will be able to express better and most of all you will not shy away from a situation. Let us face a harsh truth, not everyone is Steve Jobs or Mark Zukerberg who can just drop out of their college and start a billion-dollar company. Most importantly what people don\u2019t understand here is that they were at Stanford and Harvard when they dropped out. You see getting admitted to these colleges is a huge deal in itself. You will need to prove yourself worthy enough to be part of their university. Never fall for anyone who says, \u201cDon\u2019t think about marks, look for knowledge\u201d. if anyone says that then explain them a very simple thing, \u201cIf you have knowledge then no one can stop you from scoring good marks\u201d. All in all, Grades are important, work for them, and at the same time work on yourself. ",

Grades have no role to play in a road to SUCCESS. All you have to do is instead of focussing on grades focus on experiences and knowledge because that is the one and only thing that is going to stand behind you and say \u201cIts going to be okay, you still know this.\u201d I\u2019ve done B.Tech, \u2026.YES , I\u2019m one of \u201cthem\u201d. Though my grades were low, it never bothers me as I really found a way\u2026..my way( and also asking you people not only finding a way is necessary, but finding YOUR way is more important) Right now, I\u2019m preparing for the civil services and chose Public Administration as an optional. Its was a total fucking mystery for me but as I told you I found my way. Learning about Public Administration fantasizes me more than a 9\u20135 desk or field job saying Yes Sir , Okay Sir to everyone. And now for me grades have lost their value, just suppose that I lost all my educational degrees and have no way to claim them, instead of going for a suicide I would save myself for something big that I could now achieve. As I\u2019m free to do anything or anyway I want. Remember that line from Tyler Durden , \u201cONCE YOU HAVE LOST EVERYTHING, YOU ARE FREE TO DO ANYTHING\u201d Grades just make you eligible not knowledgeable (my grandmother taught me great lessons though she had studied till 6th standard) ",

            "answer_text": "As a longtime educator, business professional, and job hunting expert and author, I\u2019ve fielded this question many times over the years. And the answer is that it depends. Grades matter to an extent when you\u2019re applying to school. So when we\u2019re deciding which students to admit into the college itself and your possible major, one thing that is a factor are your grades and overall GPA. For certain jobs, like being an SAT tutor, it\u2019s not uncommon for these prep companies to require applicants have a certain GPA or have graduated at a certain level. For instance, some ask that you graduated within the 85 or above percentile. However, for the most part, I would say that your grades and GPA are not of real importance. As I have written and spoken about many times, grades are not an accurate measure or reflection of your intelligence, capabilities, and ability to perform. So there are many things that can skew one\u2019s grades to the high-end or the low-end. For example, your having to deal with a personal or family crisis. Or having to deal with a teacher who is pretty lousy at explaining things and/or is not helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two parts of it: If you want to go for an academia or academically intensive job, grades do matter. Grades are an alibi to prove that you are smart enough to make through. You probably may not be asked for much questions. If you are really passionate about something and for which grades do not count then you should go for it. Indian education system and public service jobs are very particular about grades and qualification, so you need to prove you are apt. Passion are something more important for a person than grades. But, at-least know the minimum criteria for the course you are enrolled for to be better-off. I was always inclined to lead innovative challenging projects. These projects gave me insights at large, tremendous exposure, confidence to handle large events, projects and people. These projects are technically intensive, physically labour-some, financially tight. And I could just do it. All these neither do reflect in my grades nor a single certificate can explain them all. But, the joy and confidence always pushes you to do better. Life is nothing but a collection of the best memories that you can cherish and not some endless monotonous struggle. Some people are not very great in cracking exams like myself. But I have done a lot many innovative things in my career so far. But, bad grades do not deter me. Academically, I have started my PhD without decent grades. But, I do not spill sweat when it comes to academic discourse \u2018coz my grades never reflected what I know. If you have bad grade for for no substantial reason then it will be a tough time for you, academically as well as personally. And good grades do not ensure you are smart enough.

Those who propagate this theory are either indolent or cases of sour grapes. It does not necessarily imply that those with not-so-good grades are permanently & perennially disadvantaged and won't make it big ever in life ever. They may or may not. But, the probability of good graders making it big is way more higher than not-so-good & bad graders.So, why do unnecessary experiments with life rather than walking the treated time tested path of success. Having good grades definitely gives you a head start. Let me give my own example. I don't have any juicy story to tell. I was kind of serious about my studies right from my childhood. That helped me being the highest scoring boy in my school days. The obvious advantage was greater attention from teachers & faculty members, improved self confidence, reasonably high self esteem & great deal of respect from fellow students besides the opportunity to represent school at various events.

I would have seen him only 20 times in those 4 years. Not just me, our classmates and staffs too. I have never spoken a word to him. At the end of the year, he had over 40 arrears. Teachers used to beg him through phone to attend atleast the practical exams hours before the exam. In the first year of college, he arrived to the college out of the blue, that too late. It was already second hour. Our Sir asked him if he knew his name. He replied yes and said it wrong. We had a hearty laugh. I never had any respect on him until one day. Our HoD was talking about our future and the importance of CGPA. What he said made me turn back. \u201cDon't think that all can be like Gaurav. He is a national level Kho-kho champion who has represented tamil nadu in many matches. He will bag a government job and settle.\u201d Then he continued speaking about the importance of CGPA. He was a national level Kho kho player!  But none of us knew it. That's the respect we give for sportsmen! (sigh) As our Sir said, he got the degree completion certificate and a job. It took some time for our class topper to get a job. If you are really good at something in extracurricular or co-curricular activities, CGPA or GPA is secondary. If not, you seriously don't have an option but to join the rat race. Build your skillset and define yourself! Image source:- Google ",

Whether you are shopping on Amazon or getting a school admission or picking a gynecologist, grading simplifies the decision making. Once you pick a doctor and have a positive experience with them yourself, you tend to overlook any negative feedback from unknown others. Similarly, once you have a negative experience with them yourself, you tend to overlook any positive feedback from unknown others. But, the grading is what helped you try THAT doctor in the first place. School grades are no different. It helps schools, employers and society, in general, form an opinion about you without spending too much time assessing you. Now, you may have poor grades for whatever reason but may actually be a genius. However, the world doesn\u2019t have so much time and patience to \u2018try\u2019 you. Simply because it doesn\u2019t scale. So, yes, grades matter until they don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to share a story of a 17 year old Indian girl, Malvika Joshi. She doesn't have a class X or XII certificate. Her mother chose to \u201chome school\u201d her four years ago and discontinued her formal education when she was in class VII. In this while, she pursued programming as her interest and has been successful to win three medals (two silver and a bronze) at the International Olympiad of Informatics, commonly known as Programming Olympiad. This eventually led her to get admission (with scholarship) at MIT to pursue her Bachelors - which is a distant dream for many out here. You can read her full story: 17-year-old 'unschooled' Malvika Joshi makes it to MIT So it goes like this: if you want to make it big, either you have to be the best at what you are doing, or choose the conventional easier path - the good grades. The point is you have to work hard and there is no substitute for it. The pursuit of good grades gives a direction that is safe to head to. Everyone is on this path and hence this has been universally recognized. Even if you fall at some point, you know at least you are on the right track and with more effort, you can come back to win the race. And even if you don\u2019t win, your efforts will be recognized as all eyes were watching you closely. But if you try any unconventional way, you have to find your own direction, none of which will be a short cut. You may enjoy and love the journey, but high chances are that you will get lost. You will have to be sheer smart, focused and full of discipline to be able to reach where you originally headed to. And since you will be mostly alone, it will be very difficult to get recognized for your efforts. It will be tough but definitely achievable and maybe worth a try. Then the question arises, will you be able to accept if you get lost and do not get any recognition even after so much of your efforts? Also, if I may ask, how many colleges in India would give Malvika Joshi an admit? So I would say, yes good grades make it easier to make it big. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cINDIAN EDUCATION SYSTEM ONLY VALUES GRADES AND PERCENTAGES\u201d. It is the only parameter to judge candidates knowledge and experience. From the beginning of my studies, I am an average student. I am never interested in studies. Most of the time I am busy doing some other work which is totally worthless. Because at that time, i am totally unaware of the \u2018importance of studies\u2019. By the way at that time, I easily managed to score average marks and percentage without studying not more than 30 minutes in any examination. I always study 2 or 3 days before the examination. Here I am discussing the past scenario when I was studying in 10th or 12th standard. In 10th board examination, I scored 7.4 cgpa. When you convert 7.4 cgpa in a percentage it is equal to 70% ( 7.4*9.5 = 70) After completing high school, I opted for commerce stream for further studies. In 12th board examination, I only scored 65%. At that time I am totally disappointed with me and my performance. But my family always keep supporting me in my toughest time. After that, I take admission in Central @University of Allahabad. Where I was pursuing B.com. where I only managed to score 53%. But I am satisfied with my performance this time. Believe me, it is not that easy to get a good percentage from the University of Allahabad, \u2018I am a survivor\u2019. Recently, I have completed post-graduation ( Master of Commerce) this year from the University of Allahabad. Where I managed to score 7.78 cgpa, It means 74 per cent in aggregate. I got 7th rank in my batch. \u201cIt is my best academic performance till to date. ALWAYS REMEMBER ONE THING:-  Please don't study to score good marks or percentage. Learn for the knowledge, if you learn for the knowledge. You automatically score good marks in each and every examination. It is also applicable in the case of life. Keep learning from your failures or mistakes, One day everything will be sorted easily. \u201cLearning is the key to change, develop, and grow. Change your process, you will definitely get a better result in your life. Keep learning, enjoy learning. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. If you want to be an entrepreneur then perhaps not. (All of us know many success stories of people who dropped out of college or even failed.) However, I am told by my friends (who did an MBA at Harvard and UCL respectively) that in order to get good contacts in the business field, it is useful to do an MBA. To do an MBA in a decent place (whether in India or abroad) one needs to have good grades in their education up to that point. If you want to be a researcher, or an academician (in any field), they definitely matter. I mean, it is unlikely that you will get into a good university (for a PhD) if you have bad grades. It is another matter as to whether having good or bad grades is correlated with research ability. (It is, but perhaps only mildly with a huge variance.) If you want to be a doctor or a lawyer, of course they matter ! If you want to get any other job (including software engineering), once again it depends. I am told that these days companies value skills more than certificates. But that being said, there are quite a few skilled people out there and any small advantage (even through grades) will certainly help your case. Now if you an outlier like Einstein, Ramanujan, Bill Gates, etc, then yes grades may not make a whit of a difference. But most of us are Toms, Dicks, Harrys, Annas, and Lizzies. (Or if you are from India, Rams, Shyams, Ganshyams, Riyas, and Mahalakshmis.) So it is better to score reasonably well to be on the safe side. ",

The more prestigious the internship, the more grades will matter. Getting your first job out of college? YES. With no real professional experience, your grades are the only way your employer can gauge your ability to learn or your mastery of the material you should have learned in school. After a few years of working to the end of the road? NO. The further you get away from your school days the less people care, unless you are working in some industry where grades trump actual proven ability to do the work you\u2019d actually get paid to do. And I don\u2019t know of any industry where grades would trump experience. Employers when you are mid to late career want to know what you actually did for other employers, not about that class you got a D in 15 years ago. I suppose it is possible there are one or two employers that might ask being that anything is possible and I\u2019m not familiar with every employer on the planet, but in general, once you\u2019ve put some real world experience on that resume, your GPA isn\u2019t all that necessary or relevant. I don\u2019t even remember what my GPA is at this point. Nobody asks for it. I\u2019ve got 30 years of actual experience doing actual engineering work. That\u2019s what my employer cares about, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve focused on with every job I\u2019ve ever applied for after my first job. ",

            "answer_text": "The only time that GPA matters is if what you want requires it. Otherwise it is another set of measurement that has not relevance at all. If you are talking about college GPA, you have two: cumulative and major. The cumulative is used by the Graduate School as a minimum and the major GPA (the average of major upper division courses) is used by the Department. Both GPAs are a measure of how well you have done in your coursework and an indicator is that you are ready to do graduate work. The GRE is a measure that compares applicants to one another relative to one another. It allows for a standard comparison. It also is another factor in evaluating the applicants ability to do graduate coursework. A high GRE score will make up for a low cumulative GPA but not for a low major GPA. A GRE Subject Test if available makes up for a low major GPA. The SOP supported by LORs is the most important consideration since it is the only information that indicate whether or not an applicant can write a thesis that may include original research. Having a network of references is important because as with most things in life, it is what you know and who you know that will determine whether or not you get what you want. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they do matter a lot,I'll tell you why! I'm an average student, i got 7.8 cgpa in 10th grade and 80% in 12th board exams. I had always dreamt of being a student of university of delhi ,but with this percentage it seems to be quite difficult. Finally i got admitted into university of delhi's Satyawati college in the last Cut-Off (admissions were started in starting of july but i got admission on 30th august-last day of admission process. ) In the meantime,I cursed myself of not getting enough grades to get admission in starting Cut-Off 's of university, it was like you have your boat but you can't do boating until Water asked you to. After getting admitted i was excited that new phase of life gonna start and i have a chance now to re-develop my perpetual dreaming process. But unfortunately the life which was there,was not what i dreamt of,the environment which was there i never wanted( This is my personal opinion and I'm saying this with all due respect) . The starting two years were depressing i always cursed myself,got frustrated with myself that why didn't I study more in my boards, why didn't i get good grades,why couldn't i get into the environment which i always dreamt of. After passage of two years i promised myself that i will eliminate this frustration after this degree,i will give my everything to get what i want. I decided to go for LLB . I remained self motivated throughout the journey of preparing LLB entrance exams only because i wanted to be in environment of intellectuals and that was only possible if i could get through these entrances and get good score in these. Grades/marks weren't in my mind but they were necessary to get what i wanted. The time of entrances came, i wanted to live in north india so i gave entrance exams of top 2 law schools of north india - PANJAB UNIVERSITY and FACULTY OF LAW,DU. I got AIR 2nd rank in panjab university and AIR 18 rank in DELHI UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL. My family ,my friends and myself too felt so proud after getting these results ( even if they don't seem that great to everyone ,but they were great for us) and now i got admitted into one of the top law schools in india CAMPUS LAW CENTRE,DU. Moral- Grades not only get what you dreamt of,Grades not only helps you to surround by intellectuals, In addition they earn you respect in the society ,they make your parents proud,they make you feel that you are capable of doing great things,they give you the motivation which you can use in shaping your career. Every person is opinionated,this was mine. Thankyou ",

Due to some students and the activities carried out by them during the period of 4 years, the faculty had gone really furious on the whole class, resulting in constant sparks between both the sides. To add more tragedy in my life, my profs who were out of their minds totally, blessed most of the students from our batch with so less marks that made us look completely ineligible to work in engineering field! One would easily judge us by saying \u2018you cannot even score 55%(6.2 GPA) in Degree, how can you work in technical field?\u2019 Parents too were furious and complained about it to the University. I never complained about it to anyone and went to hyderabad to pursue training in core field. Despite being good at performance, I was hardly getting a chance to sit for placement process of core company which would offer 8-10K INR per month, just because they were not bothered about the academic scores. Even I tried to get into a firm by reference, but refused due to such a poor academic record. At the same time my colleagues over there from all parts of India are still getting lots of chances to sit for the selection processes of companies like NXP, Sony, bosch and many other big names which obviously offer bigger paychecks. I have lots of ambitions like working abroad, pursuing masters. Although As of now I cannot think of doing masters due to financial constraints of my family. I have to start from scratch to make it big and now struggling to get a job in Pune. I will win surely but not immediately. So If you want to win immediately, better have a good GPA. ",

But for some, gpa can be a strict cut-off. Once you\u2019re out of school and in your career, do they matter? Well, probably not so much. At this point, how you perform in your job should matter the most. Really matter if you\u2019re a trust fund baby who will inherit your mom/dad\u2019s spot as CEO of the family business? Uhhhh, probably not. But for everybody else, grades usually matter for everything in between high school and getting to that first full-time, career-oriented job. ",

            "answer_text": "For those who say that grades don't matter and talent alone can get them far enough, know that they are mistaken. They've forgotten the Indian scenario they live in and look outward for glorifying example of success without good grades. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that one can't succeed with great grades but those individuals are largely minuscule. There are others of course who think they are successful inspite of their meagre grades but reality they have just convinced themselves of their success. Now, what do great grades get you? (Largely in the Indian scenario and maybe globally) Great grades in your tenth gets you into a good college. Great grades in college gets you into a fancy university. From there on great grades will ensure you make your way into the ivy leagues.Your career prospects will be higher. You won't have to wait around for the next big idea to come your way in order to make it big.You will earn the admiration of your parents.You will gain the respect of your peers.You will lead the charge in literary events in your school/college.You will know the value of hard work and you will learn smart work.You will see that luck shines on you in plenty. After all, success is 98% hard work and 2% luck.Quora will be a hobby and not a full time job. (No offence to anyone)Now, for the other side. You can choose to say that grades are not necessary for success and that they are just numericals on piece of paper. This can be said if you fall under the following categories, You are a astounding sports person and have a knack for winning. (You can't be 21, pick up a sport and believe to make a career out of it)If you are in line to inherit a plump share in your families wealth.If you have a budding entrepreneur in you. (most entrepreneurs also have great educational qualifications)If you are okay with mediocrity.If you want to sit idle till that bulb on your head starts to glow.My personal take on grades in life, Grades are necessary and important. That doesn't mean one needs to stop themselves from engaging in extracurricular activities and a good amount of crazy fun. I played sports in college, captained the football team. Played water polo for a good bit. Backpacked alone across 6 nations. Travelled through many states in India. Drank, partied and made merry. With all of this I still managed to study hard. I got the third rank in my university in my Law Programme. Secured got medals for two law subjects. Most importantly made my parents proud. Now that's satisfaction for you. That's me being presented the Gold Medal by the Honorable Governor of Karnataka and the Chancellor of my university alongside other dignitaries.  That's me when I was in the northernmost part of Vietnam. A place called Sapa.  That me with my football team from college.  That's me having a patriotic moment in Xiamen, People's Republic of China.  In conclusion, great grades give you a large number of options. It gives you the option to pick and choose what you want. You decide your life and not let destiny alone do it for you. Always, keep the power in your hands and be the master of your own destiny. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a story, a story about 4 regular people.  Let\u2019s call them Indu, Giri, Dev and Raj. Indu is your typical straight A student, she aced her board exams and her undergrad with a near perfect GPA, pursued her post-grad from an IIM and emigrated to the US where she obtained a second masters degree from an Ivy League University. She went onto join a reputed consulting agency as a director in corporate strategy. After a few years she joined a famous MNC, rose up within the ranks and was soon elevated to the position of CEO; being the first woman to hold the post in the company\u2019s then 100 year old history. Giri was your average kid growing up, he wasn\u2019t that studious as a child and scored amicably in his Grade 12 exams, he went onto graduate from a small private university in south India, post which he got a degree in marketing from a little well known public university in Tamil Nadu. He initially moved across four companies within a span of six years and then landed up at a growing start-up where he was promoted to the position of Vice President of Product Management. He then decided to leave his comfortable corporate job to start a venture of his own, which is now valued at little over a billion rupees. Dev was born to an affluent family, growing up he led a lavish lifestyle with maids catering to his every whim and need. There was nothing Dev wanted, which he didn\u2019t end up getting; international vacations, luxury cars, and generally anything par the best. He was very smart and possessed the intellectual capacities one would come to expect from the heir to a multi-million dollar empire, but never exerted the same when it came to his schoolwork, he had the presumption that school was useless as a determinant towards his definition of success. He ended up scoring below average grades but because of his parent\u2019s position he ended up graduating from a popular international university and soon took up the reins to his father\u2019s company. Less than five years later, he filed for bankruptcy and is no longer associated with the company after being ousted by it\u2019s board of directors. Raj was a mischievous little child, he didn\u2019t have a care in the world, all day he would skip school to spend time with his friends. The little time he did spend in school, he was treated like royalty, all the guys wanted to be friends with him and all the girls wanted to date him. He was a typical jock who used to bully and humiliate the nerds for wasting their time by burying their head in books. \u201cStudying is useless, look at me - I own this school despite spending a fraction of the time studying.\u201d Because of his indifference towards his grades, Raj ended up failing his board exams and didn\u2019t graduate. He now works as a brick layer in the school he was once the very king of.  The people above represent four possible scenarios of the resultant benefit or consequence of maintaining the grade. Meet the four people mentioned above :  Indra Nooyi - (Soon to be former) CEO of PepsiCo.  Girish Marubootham - Founder and CEO of Freshworks[1] Devendra Vijay and Rajesh Kumar (names changed) were two people I personally knew growing up.  Suppose you are currently at point A and your definition of making it in life is at point B which is situated a 100 kilometers away. You begin the slow, long arduous walk towards your goal; while on the trail you start to question whether there is a way to get to where you wanna go quicker - your grades are like a car, in this scenario. Sure it is definitely possible to leg it, but having a car does make it easier to get to where you wanna go faster. Footnotes[1] Meet Freshworks, the new unicorn in the Indian startup world",

            "answer_text": "There is no black or white answer to this question. From my personal experience, more than 80% of time grades do not decide your future. But there are certain instances where grades do help you to get good opportunities, that\u2019s why I would give only 20% weight in favor of grades. I was 6.47/10 GPA and stood 46 out of 69 people in my class of engineering studies. Still, I managed to land a job at top companies like Deloitte and PwC in the United States. I am not saying that I have achieved something extraordinary but I am at least matching career standards with my batch toppers or doing better than most of my classmates. Well, did a low GPA help me? Definitely not, it was certainly not very easy for me to land my first job out of engineering school. If I had a better GPA, I would have got opportunities to interview with companies who only consider top 10% students of the batch. Needless to say, the salary offered by these companies is far better than those who prefer candidates with a lower GPA. Good grades definitely allow you to access initial opportunities. For this reason, I would assign 20% weight to good grades.  Let me tell you why grades do not solely decide someone\u2019s future or career accomplishments. More time to explore your superpowers: Students who are not solely focused to getting marks often spend their time innovating and exploring hidden opportunities. During engineering studies, I spent my time learning tricks of digital marketing. Today, digital marketing is very common but it was a pretty new concept back in 2008-2009. It helped me promote some of my initial ventures without spending a single penny. Broader opportunities: When your mark sheet doesn\u2019t reflect great grades, people consider you for tasks and opportunities which are different from monotonous technical work. My manager always focused on utilizing my soft skills like communication skills, presentation, and negotiation skills. Even my SOP for the US universities was more inclined toward my extra-curricular activities and business skills. That was the major reason I was able to get admission at Duke University with 6.47 GPA.Nobody cares about GPA after 2 years: As soon as you join the corporate world, there are multiple factors decide your progress like your problem-solving ability, communication skills, team building ability, leadership quality, and quick learning ability. Nobody cares about how much you scored in school. Here, life takes a completely new highway where you meet a thousand other people from all over the world and you can\u2019t compete with them just based on your GPA. Entrepreneurs don\u2019t need GPA: If you aspire to be your own boss then you do not need a great GPA, not even at the first step of your venture. As I mentioned in the first point, you need to spend time exploring your hidden talent which grades will never reflect.That said, don\u2019t be a part of the rat race. If you love studies and you love to get good grades, then definitely study hard. But if you have goals in a career which do not directly relate to your grades, focus on building your overall personality and build the network. Enjoy what you do, I promise you will surely succeed. Good luck! ",

Until my bachelor\u2019s, I had pretty decent grades. Not the greatest, but decent. For my my first job, or for my first serious (real or \u201cany other adjective\u201d) job, they did not even notice my marks sheet. They just wanted to know if I was meeting their basic criteria. I worked there for sometime and decided I wanted to study further. So I applied for master\u2019s program and I was lucky because they (admission\u2019s committee) gave importance to my grades and thesis but not my work experience. Lucky because I had better grades and a very good bachelor thesis. As of now, my grades are not good and not bad either. What do these grades reflect now? That I need to put in a little more efforts than I am at present. Working on the same and I still have a long way to go so let\u2019s see. Coming back to the original question, it mostly depends on the context and circumstances. What do you want to use the grades for? A PhD? It is damn important. A job in a huge corporation? Probably. A job? Maybe not. ",

            "answer_text": "Grades absolutely do matter and they matter more than you think they do. Not only can they matter to your first few employers (starting a career out of college) but they should matter to yourself. You should care about your grades because your grades reflect on the dedication and the work that you put into it. Like ANYTHING in life, YOU GET OUT WHAT YOU PUT IN. For 95% of people, I would bet you, that what you THINK you will be doing with your life, is NOT what you will be doing with your life. Students typically do not know because they do not know the real meaning of what it is to 'earn a living'. You are right when you say that people who think that making big dollars is the key to life and happiness, are wrong. I believe the same thing. However, one day you will have a wife, and kids, and the momentum will change. You will shift your thought process from yourself to your family. Then, you will wish you made the money.... to do nice things for your wife, allow your kid to play sports, go to a good college, wear decent clothing, put a decent roof over their heads, buy a home in a decent area so your child can get a good education, etc. All I am saying is, even if you don't care about making the money and don't plan on attending college. Do the right thing NOW so if you ever change your mind, you have the opportunity to. Good luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "Let me answer this in two parts (1) Does GPA matter? Does a rating of 4 or above matter for a product/ seller on Amazon? Hell yes, it does. Does a rating of 4 or above on Amazon matter if you are selling in an offline market? Well, not really. The answer to your question is a classic consulting/ MBA \u2018it depends\u2019. A good GPA is essentially a signal to the market that you work hard, are consistent with your effort and have high degree of skill in whatever your academic major was. This is only important if you plan to enter a market that values GPA with some degree of confidence (since all markets discount GPA by a certain percentage and hence you have an interview process). So if you want to become a sportsperson, a musician or a businessman, your GPA doesn\u2019t really matter. But in case you want to live a more \u2018regular\u2019 life with a job or want to pursue higher studies, unfortunately my friend, GPA does matter. (2) Does high GPA ensure you\u2019ll make it big? The evidence here is slightly sketchy. As I said, high GPA does imply that you work hard, are sharp and are consistent with your efforts. These are characteristics you\u2019d usually find in successful people who\u2019ve made it big in life. So it is the underlying set of characteristics and not the GPA itself that helps you make it big in life. Having said this, a good GPA does give you a better launchpad (and hence a time advantage) as compared to your peers if you plan to enter a market that values GPA. ",

Im not so experienced to tell that gpa is irrelevant, but it is not of a great importance if you want to live. Not all people have a good gpa, still have reached great heights. Gpa really doesnt matter. The thing that matters at the end of the day is knowledge. Education system in India, is really a burden on students. Not all students crack the high level GPA as dreamt by parents. Just take the case of a person who tops their school with a decent mark in grade 10. It is just a mark, just two numbers that are taken into consideration, when one joins in a high school. The persons talents,passion,personality are not even glanced by the system. Curricularly bright? You're in. This is my story till class 10. I don't know what would happen, but plus two marks are just relevant for admission in college, and the percentage secured there is overlooked for a job. That is why I hate the system.But people say, as the students cannot study, they blame the system. But great flaws in the system are utterly ignored. This is not going to improve, so gpa does matter if you need a good job, and other fortunes. But if knowledge matters more, give importance to that. They can change a person, their personality, and make them feel successful, as it is a ceaseless stream of information, which never ends. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, they may or they may not. Personally, I do not care. It is always debatable. The following arguments are generally given to justify why grades are not important. Things one learn in graduate schools are not at all related to the things one does in the outside, more practical world.Recruiters look for skills other than your grades.Many people had poor grades and yet managed to make it big.Grades just reflect your ability to grasp things and not at all an indicator of your true knowledge.Please note that, I am not refuting any of these claims. Personally, I agree with all of them. Here is the important part. You are enrolled in college. Now, the real test of a man or woman is how efficiently he does the task that is assigned to him/her. Come on, so you will not study because there are no seemingly tangible benefits? Do you need something to look forward to, every time you pick up a task? To tell my story, I have a decent enough GPA, and yes studying for exams helped me develop things other than grades, of course. It made me more responsible, sincere, resourceful. Now, here is the thing with being responsible and sincere. When you develop such attributes in one sphere, you reflect such things in other areas as well. Again, do grades matter? I do not know and I do not care. You are supposed to do something, better do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Simple answer, Yes it does. But what's more important is how does it matter. Being an engineering student let me explain it through my point of view. When you sit for an interview for a job profile with engineering background, you're not expected to be in love with your subject. Because the Indian education system isn't good enough to male us fall in love with our subject. That's a truth which everyone knows, even your employers. Then why does your CGPA matter to your employers? It's because they wanna judge how good you're at stuff which you don't necessarily love or aren't passionate about. In this ever so changing Tech world, Employers are looking for people who are good in multiple fields instead of a specialist. Through your CGPA they judge your mental strength to be successful at something you almost hate. If you're an Indian cricket fan, you would know how Rahul Dravid was made to keep wickets in the early 2000s so that India could afford another batsman in the team. Now Dravid is a wonderful batsman, but still he is also known for his short stint at something he hated, but something he did reasonable well. And If you're not a Cricket fan, instead a football fan, and if you have heard about Mesut \u00d6zil, one of the finest attacking players in the world, you would know that he's criticised heavily for his lack of defensive work, something he hates. Hope you got my point by these two examples. Grades are more about your attitude, mental strength and your resilience to succeed than your intelligence. ",

Do you want to enter some type of prestigious graduate program? If so, GPA really matters. Do you want to land a highly desirable job at a company such as Google, Facebook or SpaceX? If so, GPA really matters. These are just a few examples of when GPA does matter. Some people are high-achieving and some other\u2019s aren\u2019t - the latter group tries to justify their lack of academic motivation by stating \u201cgrades don\u2019t matter.\u201d Interestingly, I\u2019m sure some would claim health & fitness don\u2019t matter either. It all comes down to the individual person. It\u2019s worth mentioning, however, that high GPA by itself doesn\u2019t translate to success. You need to couple it with other characteristics such as strong communication & interpersonal skills. ",

When applying to nearly anything, whether it be a job or a university, those reviewing your resume will always check and see what your grades were when you were in school. Bad GPA, and this tells them that you are unmotivated, and did not care about your education, making them question if you are even qualified for the position. However, there is a caveat to this. Take two people, one with a perfect GPA but nothing else, and the other with a good, but imperfect GPA, maybe a 3.8, but this person has done numerous extracurricular activities in their field, maybe individual research, or started their own company. 9 times out of 10, the person reviewing the applications will choose the second person. So certainly keep this in mind. So, at the end of the day, keep your GPA as high as possible, but make sure to complete other activities along with it. ",

If it didn't matter in your particular life, then it wouldn't be part of your life and you'd know it didn't matter. Seriously.  Maybe your parents own the company you're going to work at, no matter how you do in school.  Maybe you're going to work as an mechanic or some other career where nobody is going to ask about your grades.  Maybe you have five years of solid work history on your resume.  Maybe you have a strong reputation in your community.  In cases like that, no, your GPA doesn't matter. However, if you're planning on applying to entry-level positions, you're competing against maybe hundreds of other applicants.  The hiring manager can't spend much time on any individual application, so they're going to filter out something that's easy to spot.  The easiest thing to select is a GPA, which at least implies that you did the work that was assigned to you. In ten years, you'll probably never have another discussion about college, but you have to get there, first. There are exceptions, however.  In some fields, I've heard of people getting asked about their SAT scores well into their thirties. ",

Your GPA stops mattering after you\u2019re out of school and have started your career. There are a couple of exceptions to this, like law, but generally no one will care once you\u2019re working. This is one of those things where being in school warps your perspective on what employers care about.\u201d While some are able to juggle extra curricular activities and academics simultaneously, there are are others who accomplish more outside of the classroom but are worried that a low GPA will affect them in the long run. If you have outstanding achievements outside of the classroom, but your GPA is low\u2013you should not be discouraged and just not mention it in your resum\u00e9 at all. \u201cLeave your GPA off your resume. Focus on work history and work accomplishments. Extracurriculars don\u2019t really matter unless you have a leadership role where you did real work. What employers want to see are jobs and internships.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I was an average grader throughout my life. I hale from a middle-class family where grades and your marks in Maths matters a lot. Though I usually manage to get a decent score in Maths and Science being my favorite subject, scoring in science was also not a big deal for me. But when it boils down to overall marks and class rank, I usually never topped. I manage to stay around 4th\u20137th rank. Except my mom, everyone in the family use to judge me a lot for not being a topper. I was always compared to my cousins and Sharma ji\u2019s Son. I use to pray to god and curse myself for not meeting everyones expectation. I struggled through out my Academics. I finally landed into wrong graduation degree and messed up my career. I wasted an year preparing for CAT. Now down the line I am pretty happy that I dropped an year. It made me realize my true passion. I just ran away like a rebel to chase my dream, but the path was extremely difficult- I had a wrong graduation degreeAn year dropBelow average communication skillsNo family support (as they concluded me a waste and loser, it was obvious too)Pressure of being eldest son.Lost huge money in (lacs) (I will write about this in separate), so economically brokenLove failure (College life you know)I was in Bangalore, new city, new language.Above all I had average grades in my boardsSo basically my life was screwed up and my career was messed up. I was on border line and a single wrong step would have destroyed me forever. So I badly needed a game-plan, I wanted to see my agility, so I left my mobile and money in my friends drawer (with whom I was staying). I went up the hill in a small temple. I stayed their like a poor, in same cloth, without mobile and feeding on Temples offering. I had enough endurance to know \u201cits time\u201d. I searched right course for me which would allow me to continue from business studies to Computers, I searched good college which would allow me with affordable fee and loan guidance, finally I found both after deserved struggle. Thanks a ton to my best friend, he provided me a shelter, food and internet. I was completely different version in my new college. I learned everything which was pulling me till now. I am not working in google or apple, but for tier 2 colleges this company \u201cInfosys\u201d is the best deal. All toppers want to get placed at Infy at least to enjoy its famous Mysore training. I was not topper here in this college too, but I had that hidden confidence in me. Finally placement results announced and guess what? - I was the only from my Class to get placed in Infy. Tears rolled out and a burst of accomplishment ran through my blood. Though I was never ever a topper in my whole academics- I was a batch topper in one of the toughest technical training. I am happy, my parents are proud about this. SO GRADES MATTER? No comments!! ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is it depends. If you are a recent graduate looking for your first job or looking you to pursue further studies then yes they do. However after you finish up with your first job and you are looking to move onto to another job in your career than no it doesn\u2019t matter as most employers don\u2019t even ask for grade transcripts if you are applying as an experienced hire. They care more about your experience at that point. It is tough when you are a recent or new grad looking for a job. I have had the opportunity to screen many recent graduate applications in the past and unfortunately because all these folks have close to no experience; grades, extra-curricular activities and the school that the candidate attended are the determining factors of who gets the job interview for the new grad position or not. From personal experience grades get you the interview, however once you get the job interview then they don\u2019t matter anymore. This is because you have already met the grade criteria that the employer has set and during the interviews they care more about your personality and other soft skills and will choose the candidate who has best \u201cfit\u201d for their organization. For a behind the scenes look at the recent graduate job application process you can read more about it in this post: HELP: What happens after you submit a job application? Here is a behind the scenes look Hope that this helps! -Justine ",

            "answer_text": "Well sure grades do matter a lot if they matter to you. If you think you are as a human being defined by your grades (bunch of letters awarded for turning in homeworks before deadlines and scoring few more points on the tests) then sure they will play a role in defining your career and what you do with your life because its you who is allowing that. And grades wont mean a thing at all if you dont give a damn about them. If you are completely sure of yourself and your abilities, believe you me, GPA will not play any more crucial role in your life than just being a passport to getting your degree from university. Outside of the university campus it would mean nothing only if you decide so. So what role gpa plays in your life is completely your choice. If you chose to let it control your life it will. And if you chose to be a master of your own self and not allow bunch of letters to take charge of your life, gpa will never matter. Personally, I have often wondered though what the grading criteria is like in this beautiful school of life that i am currently enrolled in \u2026 Or is there one ?? ",

They show how much you\u2019re willing to sacrifice in order to learn and understand new things, and of course, they matter for graduate school if you want to go right out of the gate. The no: Warning: rant ahead I never did well in school because I hated the grinding mill of the classroom. My teachers just gave out meaningless assignments just so they wouldn\u2019t have to do any work and got mad at me when I didn\u2019t pay attention in class. Don\u2019t they think I would have paid attention if I had needed to? I learned so much from reading and watching Cyberchase (a math TV show for kids) than I could have ever learned from listening to my teachers drone on and on about idiotic shit. In college, I failed organic chemistry, so I switched to math, and I got so much out of my failure than I anticipated. I got two concentrations in math, a minor in Japanese, and even some programming experience under my belt. I wonder which is of more importance to employers? Would you rather hire a 3.5 student who only focused on his major and didn\u2019t do anything else in school or a 2.7 student whose grades suffered because he was trying to take extra courses? I\u2019m glad I failed that chemistry course because then I never would have learned programming or abstract algebra: I would be stuck bent over a buret for 10 hours a day just to have the experiment fail anyway. Habits matter, grades don\u2019t. If you have shitty grades and no other activities or hobbies that you can leverage, then here\u2019s wishing you well, but I prioritize versatility over grades any day of the week. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they do. I repeat, GRADES DO MATTER! Grades matter because, Good grades mean better collegeThe college you attend because every college has a brand value attached to it.The people who you interact with will judge you immediately based on the college you attend. Should they judge you just on your college name? No. Will they judge you? Yes. Every - fucking - time.Sanket is a Stanford graduate and Harvard Business School MBA versus Akash, a Harishchandra University graduate and Sanskaar Business School MBA. Did you judge them?Better college means better people around youHere, I don't mean that people from low tier colleges are all bad. They are not.But, generally people in better tier 1 colleges are more motivated. More competitive. And most of all, they force you to get better everyday because the overall culture in the campus is like that.Better infrastructure(From engineering college perspective in India) It is true that many engineering colleges in India suck when it comes to infrastructure and labs.Almost always there is scarcity of equipments in the lab. My college did not have a spectrum analyzer (Electronics and telecom engineers will know its importance). And many other equipments which were only one or two in number. For 120 students.IIT's have a research and development budget in crores. Do you think students there will have any problems with number of equipments? Infrastructure is important depending on what you are studying. And it is always better to have good infrastructure.Better networkingNetworking. This is one of the most important things which will help you move up the ladder.Better colleges have alumni who have gone out in the world and achieved something. They come back and help the new students.There's a reason why many start ups come from colleges like IIT, BITS, NIT, IIM's etc. They have a incubation center, there teachers and alumni support them, guide them, and also sometimes invest in them.So, do grades matter? They sure do. Will you fail in life if you have bad grades? No you won't. You definitely won't. Your success will depend on how passionate you are. But it might take you a little more time to get where you want to go. And remember, during that time, your peers from better colleges have already moved ahead. People like to hear that grades don't matter. It makes them worry less. They give examples like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, etc and how they did not even complete college. But remember that Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard University and not Shanti University. Bill Gates was already doing wonders while in school. He was from Harvard. Steve Jobs made a radio when he was a teenager. Jobs was in Reed. Elon Musk built a video game when in school. Elon Musk dropped out from Stanford. ",

            "answer_text": "It always depends on the situation . I can illustrate few positions and situations where grades made no big issues as well as some other situations where they did. Having good grade and aiming for something that is lil\u2019 too out of reach is general scenario . If you dream to get something offbeat you must do the steps as no one can reach the top position just after landing himself on the ground of competition. Situation 1: I wrote my class 12th exam back in 2012 . That time I was very much into studies and always believed in self-studies and it literally paid off . I scored 95% in PCM. With this I availed one Physics admission in Jadavpur University. In this university they don\u2019t put much effort to take exams separately rather they take students in on the basis of their PCM marks. As it is the best university in West Bengal, India people generally go crazy to get in it. So here I can say your 10th and 12th grade will matter a lot . Situation 2: I never joined Jadavpur with physics hons. as it never was my aim. I wanted to pursue B.Tech on Electrical Engineering. In this very year I also appeared in WBJEE exam . I had my rank and applied for Electrical Engineering .In my college they literally don\u2019t bother about your Grade until you are having one decent Grade . The Grade cut off is 45% . I had that admission with someone with better rank and 55% in PCM where I had a slightly poor rank and 95% in PCM . Here the guy with very low GPA made it up to my college. Here my Grades never mattered . Situation 3: Last year during placement one of my buddies with 8.78 never made his dream job while another one with 7.3 CGPA made it. Though it is not clear to us why a guy holding one of top positions failed to get the job while one average student made it. Then we tried to find the possible reason and that can be the smartness . Here again it does not really matter how good grades you have , smartness and implementation matter a lot rather. Until you are having one decent grade you are all fine to go with . For job interviews they don\u2019t expect you be nerd rather they expect you to be smart and malleable .Here his grade never played the desired role. Situation 3: Few days back when I was in my 4th year few of my buddies wrote GRE . I will tell you the story of 2 boys. 1st one scored 328/340 with good Quant score and he applied 13 US universities with 6.97 CGPA . He never made a single one even after having a very good GRE score . On the other hand someone over there scored 310 with 160 in Quant which is pretty low but with this GRE and 7.8 CGPA he made it up to University of Waterloo. Here his grades mattered a lot and he availed full scholarship there. In this situation Grades played a role. Situation 4: Recently we wrote GATE exam to pursue M.Tech. One of my close buddies ranked 1400 with 8.13 CGPA where another one ranked 12700 with 9.3 CGPA. 1st one is in IIT Roorkee and 2nd one is preparing for GATE again as he had no good admission call . And for you information 2nd one is overall departmental topper :) but he failed to get him what he wanted. Here again CGPA or I better say Grade never played a role. Situation 5 : The other guy who is in IIT also applied for NTU, Singapore with me . I had 95 GATE percentile where he had 99 percentile in GATE and both of us had pretty same CGPA or Grade . So you can think the guy with 99 percentile made it up to NTU and I never did. But in reality he never made it while I did make it as I had some additional research experience which he never had. Here no Grade or no Exam marks played the role but the other factor did. In Singapore they put a huge weightage on both research and CGPA where in Germany they put huge weightage on your Research exp. only. So when there is a will there is a way. Summing up all events and situations it can be illustrated that not all the time grades matter a lot. If you have a poor one that is not going to matter a lot to hinder the possibilities for you to reach your goal if you wanna achieve it in one way or another. But if you have some good grade it will obviously be some value added. Reaching your goal is step by step process so try to perform the best you can and in any of these steps you failed to attain your level don\u2019t you fret you will be given lots of chances in future to correct it . Hope this helps :) ",

The GPA is calculated by averaging your grades together based on a point system, which is usually a 4.0 scale. There are two types of college GPAs: semester GPA and cumulative GPA. The semester GPA represents the student\u2019s progress for that specific semester, while the cumulative GPA displays the student\u2019s academic standing for their courses since matriculation into the college. How is GPA Calculated? Most colleges count only courses that were taken at that specific college. There are some exceptions to this rule. For instance, Wells College in New York will also count courses taken at an affiliated off-campus program, at Cornell University, Ithaca College and Cayuga Community College, toward the cumulative GPA. This means that if you are a transfer student you leave your old GPA behind to start a new one from scratch. When calculating a student\u2019s GPA, a college generally does not count grades of F, Incomplete, or Pass/Fail. But this is not always the rule, as Thomas Edison State College recently passed the policy that these grades will be reflected on a student\u2019s GPA. A report in US News & World Report shows the five lowest and highest GPAs by major. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics majors have the lowest GPAs - perhaps because professors tend to grade harder or simply because those areas of study are more demanding academically. Programs in the arts and humanities such as music, English and language have higher average GPAs. This may be because professors tend to be more lenient in grading because the work is often subjective. How to Raise Your College GPA Here are some helpful tips on how you can earn a high GPA in college: Learn good study habits. Don\u2019t wait until the last minute to cram. Instead, study in short periods each day. This is half the battle in achieving good grades in your courses.Show up to every class. Attendance can be a percentage of the grade.Be organized. Know when tests will be held and projects are due.Take a full course load. Don\u2019t take only classes that you know you\u2019ll get an A in. Challenge yourself with harder courses that may be weighted differently.GPA After College The importance of your GPA after college depends on your plans. If you want to go to graduate school or medical school, your GPA is going to matter, as admissions committees will look at your transcripts \u2013 much the same as for college admissions. If your grades were low during your freshman and sophomore years but improved during your junior and senior year, this could help you. Many graduate schools focus on GPA earned as a junior and senior. According to US News & World Report, maintaining a high GPA is essential to being accepted at top graduate schools such as Harvard Medical School (3.8 GPA), Yale Law (3.9) or Stanford Business School (3.6). If you plan on entering the job market immediately after graduation, it is advisable to list your GPA on your resume \u2013 that is assuming it is a respectable number. Employers may take into consideration a student\u2019s GPA as they are weeding through stacks of resumes. Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t have a high GPA. This is not the only criteria employers look at when considering applicants. Internships, other work experience, relevant projects in college and other extracurricular activities also weigh heavily on entry-level positions. It\u2019s rumored that Google won\u2019t hire anyone from any school unless they have a 3.0 GPA. But Gayle Laakmann McDowell, author of The Google Resume: How to Prepare for a Career and Land a Job at Apple, Microsoft, Google or Any Top Tech Company, said three out of the eight people she worked with at Google did not have college degrees at all.

            "answer_text": "They matter and they dont. Good academics works as a launching pad for your future career. Certain positions and professions have it as a prerequisite. I dont think anyone with throughout poor grades could get into research and be successful. Grades matter when you need that scholarship to continue your graduate or post graduate studies. In a country like India where an admission into IIT or IIM is a ticket out of poverty good grades matter. Then again being successful or intelligent is not dependent on good grades. There are numerous examples of people making it big without any formal education or good grades. Case 1: A classmate of mine got 40 marks in 9/10 subjects in first year of his engineering. Thats the minimum to pass any subject. His only achievement in engineering was to complete it in 4 years. Obviously he wasn't eligible for campus placements. He did manage to get a job paying 3k/month. He switched couple of jobs in a year to reach 10k/month. In that company he used to recruit people to work for him. Fast forward couple of years and 2 more companies he got recruited by TCS. In another 6 months he went onsite to USA. He is in USA for past 8 years, well settled and working for a fortune 500 company. He is doing better (financially) than 90% of his classmates including toppers . He is in no way a yardstick for success but makes a good case for making it in life with low grades. Case 2: Recently I came to know about this guy from my native place. He is not literate, cant read or write. He left his village 40 years back to find some work and settled down is Pashan village near Pune. Started working in brick kiln. With passage of time made some money and started his own business of making bricks. Invested all the money he made in buying agriculture land. Today he owns some 100 acres near his native place and 5 acres near Pashan within Pune municipality limits. Pashan is a well developed suburb of Pune now and the land there is worth crores. His net wealth comes close to 100 crores ( Maybe more ). No doubt he had to work his ass off to reach this point but he did it without any kind of formal education. My point is its fine if you have good grades, life will be easy but if you dont its not the end of the world. Life is a long journey and you will get enough opportunities to make it big. ",

            "answer_text": "Do grades (GPA) really matter? Yes, grades and GPA do matter, and matter quite a lot as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition to evaluate a person\u2019s abilities and even their personality to an extent. With the rise in standardized tests, often made for easy evaluation, grades are less a sign of knowledge, and more a sign of being good at test taking. Hours of repetitive practice and learning by rote are often encouraged so as to maximize scores. While one does learn this way, the objective becomes that of test success rather than learning and being able to apply it effectively. In the industry (away from schools/universities), test scores aren\u2019t as important as they\u2019re made out to be. However, they remain a very important benchmark for evaluating a fresh out of school student; that of their ability to perform within a system. Those who are a part of the system are noticed if they can do well within it. That\u2019d require a certain extent of effort, and the will to do things that might well be boring or outright distasteful, but need to be done, and done well at that. Thus, grades are important, but more as a sign that you\u2019re willing to get the job done than as a sign of one\u2019s knowledge. Grades alone aren\u2019t everything, but they\u2019re an important aspect.  Additions, corrections, and refutations are welcome. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course they do. GPA can open doors, the same way that a degree itself can. Some, but not all, employers care about your GPA. Some will check, and you don\u2019t want to be fumbling around about why you did not attain a decent GPA, if you are asked about it. In addition, the higher your GPA, the more doors you leave open for transferring schools or faculties, or for attending grad school down the road. Beyond this, a higher GPA just feels better than a lower GPA. I have never once felt good about myself for \u201cscraping by,\u201d or getting C\u2019s, whereas I feel good about myself for getting those A\u2019s. Grades do tell employers and school committees quite a bit about your level of motivation and about your academic potential. A student who graduates with a 2.0 is doing the trick to get to the podium, but will have little in the way of academic opportunities beyond graduation. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question, there is many ways to answer it. They matter to an extent, if you get very good grades and retain the information, it stays relevant. If on paper, an employer will be impressed but it would be better if accompanied by experience. Sometimes experience alone will get you a better chance than grades. There is also the possibility that you get very good grades but forget most of what you learned, it's then just on paper and isn't relevant to you anymore. It also probably won't help if you got employed by the grades you had in this case. There is also the case that you could have sat an exam and weren't able to perform at your best for some reason, so the exam shows a lot less of your potential that could have been seen if the employer had decided to give you a trial at a job. Then again, you may improve upon a subject through self study and unofficially have much higher grade than your result paper said a few years back. My own personal preference for grades is to get as many good grades as you can and use them as a demonstration of what you are capable of achieving, more so than what you know. Because employers are always going to look for grades. If you take something to a university level, then you should also push what you know as well as what you are capable of achieving. It seems sketchy sometimes since you often see people with the best grades ending up unemployed and addicted to drugs and find people who dropped out of school becoming millionaires. This is my own opinion on the subject, I am sure many other opinions will differ. Hope this has helped ",

I had a friend several years ago who applied to medical school. He really didn't have the grades for it. He was turned down by every school to which he applied. He inquired at one school if there wasn't something he could do to get into their program. He was told that he would need to apply to another undergraduate program and start over. He is not a doctor today. On the other hand, I have a friend who graduated with a 2.7 and got hired into his career right out of college. He didn't even list his GPA on his resume, and no one asked about it. That was eighteen years ago. His GPA has had absolutely no effect on his career. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a friend of mine from college. He was extrovert by nature, excellent in sports and pretty average in studies. He worked hard and with help of luck( he himself told) he got into NIT. During 1st semester he faced few problems as he was least interested in studies. He scored pretty average grades in 1st year. He was not much fluent in theory part but he was excellent in practical part. This somehow made him feel important in the group he was assigned. He found out that he has this amazing ability to memorize things faster than others. He started working harder. He was very well supported by other classmates. He even scored better marks( in some subjects) in later semesters than his intelligent counterparts. His overall CGPA was 7+ by the end of 3rd year. When campus recruitment started he was not allowed to sit in most of the companies. Not because of his 7+ pointers but because he scored 59% in 12th standard. Most of the companies required above 60% in all the exams 12th and college CGPA. While his CGPA was still good enough, his irresponsible nature in 12th standard started having an effect now. He has developed skills and acquired good enough knowledge to compete with others for the job but just because he was not over the line during 12th standard, he was denied of the opportunity to sit for the placement. Thankfully he got placed in one coaching institutes as a teacher and then applied for another job and doing very well there. But if you want to do anything in academic area or you need a job which requires good education, marks do matter. \u201cMarks doesn't decide intelligence and age doesn't define maturity\u201d I've read this shit on Facebook pages and trust me it sounds so good but in practical life it is highly disguising. If your grades are low then there are high chances of not making to top MBA colleges. If you are interested in higher studies your CGPA will be your biggest strength. If you are competing with an equally skilled person as you, then marks will give you an edge over him. While good marks don't guarantee success, it does create opportunity to be successful. ",

Grades do matter but not in deciding your intelligence but in indicating how serious you are about whatever field you have chosen. This applies to people who got the opportunity to do what they wanted to. So if you have taken this up to achieve something, you need passion, yes, but along with it some hard work and determination that will help you achieve what you always wanted to. Grades show how serious you are about this career choice. Are you willing to put in efforts to follow your passion? These are the things that grades will teach you according to me. I lost track in two semesters and because of that it affected my grades. I won't be able to get in whichever dream college I had aimed for with these grades, these are like entry passes at least. So I got more serious and put in more efforts and they paid off later and still working hard. All I can say grades and marks are just one of the factors that will help you reach your goal and not the only factor. Just know that this won't show how smart or dumb you are. It's all the knowledge you gain at that moment is what that will be measured. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no and here is why.What matters more is actually passing the courses to begin with not so much whether you totally aced the course. Now in some fields it\u2019s a deciding factor especially in very competitive fields such as nursing but trust me I\u2019m not envious of their jobs as much as they get paid, it\u2019s not enough for what they have to do but that is another story. Truthfully, I do not let grades define a person\u2019s character or intelligence which is something I think so many people are making the mistake of doing when answering this question, I know people with PhD\u2019s who still can\u2019t land a job for example in part because their social skills are so way off from everyone\u2019s norms and in part just because their luck is just plain bad. So to ultimately answer your question, no what it really takes to make it big is to know your strengths and capitalize on them and to work really hard at what you want and never fear changing the game plan up if it\u2019s not working.Sometimes your skills and talents are right under your nose just waiting to be used. No A+ in BIO 115 can define that for you. For the person who said \u201cGrades do matter and never let anyone tell you otherwise\u201d I personally could spill countless stories of people who succeeded who did not make the best grades in school so ultimately sir I think your statement with all due respect is incorrect.The new rule is ultimately that grades do not define your success in making it big, your actions do.

            "answer_text": "Grades/GPA matter coarsely. The GPA difference between a 3.7 and a 3.8 is nothing. It can easily be overshadowed by almost any other factor. Similarly, the difference between a 2.7 and a 2.8 is nothing. However, the difference between a 2.8 and a 3.8 is major! This is especially true as more (roughly all) companies handle in-school/summer interns or co-op positions through online portals. Filters ensure a low GPA resume gets automatically removed from further consideration. One thing I will say is that the difference between a 2.9 and 3.1 is huge. More that any other 0.2 difference, including 3.8 v. 4.0. That first digit has so much power. That being said, don't not challenge yourself to preserve your GPA. Taking a course or two to push yourself and getting a 3.6 on the semester can be worth much more than coasting to a 4.0. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me narrate my cousins story (as first person). YES, THEY ABSOLUTELY DO! Don\u2019t believe anyone who says it doesn\u2019t, because they sure as fuck do. Here\u2019s why. I scored 94% odd in my 10th board exams and I barely scraped through the cut off list in Army Public School, Guwahati after someone in the third waiting list dropped out. I scored 85% in my +2 boards and didn\u2019t make it through the college I badly wanted in Delhi. In fact, my grades were the reason I had to leave Delhi and move to Calcutta. I scored barely 52% odd in my BSc. I have an honors in Physics and for those who know Calcutta University, well, I\u2019m a survivor. And this was way back in 2007\u201308. Later, I interviewed for MSc positions in many colleges and universities that I badly wanted to go to. I was laughed at and ridiculed by some of the country\u2019s best colleges for my \u201cpoor\u201d scores and was told by many other top institutes that \u201cpeople who apply here usually score 80% and above!\u201d I answered every question thrown at me, I solved every problem asked of me, and I even threw light on a few alternate approaches to basic physics problems in kinematics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism at a few places. Yet, my scores, or the lack of it, were questioned. I finally had to settle for a piece of shit university, where the course content was nothing but a joke. Later, I scored 80% in my masters and I barely broke a sweat (thanks to a rigorous undergraduate curriculum). When I applied for research positions to professors across the country and abroad, I was always asked ONE thing: What happened during your Bachelor\u2019s? Did someone die? Were you on drugs? Girlfriend(s)? Every\u2026fucking\u2026time. 2 years after I finished my master\u2019s, I cracked a national level exam, got through a decent institute in a project I truly loved and started working on my PhD. But not before I was asked, What happened during your Bachelor\u2019s? So, well, grades DO matter. Ask that kid who\u2019s IIT dreams got squashed because he didn\u2019t score 60% in his +2. Ask that friend of yours who missed cracking the IIT-JEE by 1 mark. Ask that classmate of yours who scored 99.25% in his best of four and got through Economics (H) at SRCC, Delhi after the third cut off list while you didn\u2019t make the cut with 99%. Ask that super smart, highly intelligent inventor friend of yours why he failed his board exams or university exams because he felt learning from text books was obsolete and redundant. Ask that friend of yours, who gave CAT for the 4th time and missed out a call to IIM because he scored 99.2 instead of 99.4 percentile. Ask the son of a poor farmer who scored 75% in his 12th grade exams, studying under a streetlamp, only to realise that he was 5% short of getting a scholarship to go for his higher studies. Again, like it or not, grades DO matter. At least in India, they do. ",

People normally confuse themselves with end goals and mean goals, Grades are mean goals to reach an end Goal of making a successful career and earn well. Throughout my education 71% is the highest i have scored. and i started my career among many graduates who had a track record of 95% and above all time.. In a span of my first 3 years of career, i got best performer, Spot awards, Performer of the year, Value award what not for more than 14 times. I have helped many of this 95% graduates in getting their escalations resolved. if one has to be successful they can do it anyway, PASSION is what drives success. But if your Passion needs grades, and if those grades can take you reach your goals , then yes they would matter. so the point is.. Do no go behind grades, run behind your passion and make grades as just a means to achieve your passion. at times if you didn't score as per your plan , know that its not the end goal:) Thanks for reading :) ",

            "answer_text": "Read a couple of answers in this thread. Some say YES or you will starve , some say NO just get good at your thing and slowly rise to the top of the table. Coming back to my answer , the answer is that it depends on the person. There are dropouts as well as high cgpa students who made it big in this life. High cgpa means better colleges which means better infrastructure,opportunities and meeting more like minded people with goals in their life which increases the chances of succeeding in life . Now most low pointers who made it big were not average guys who wasted their time binge watching TV shows or running behind relationships but instead focused on their strengths and improved their craft and also marketed them selves in such a way that their cgpa would hardly matter to them and that they would only be judged based on their skills. Imagine a low pointer with an amazing Github and hacker-rank profile , you get the point. If you are a low pointer who lazes around all day and doesn\u2019t have any passion in life , its better to get high grades cause that is what is going to get you a job and feed you. If not , just pass your exams and work on your craft and become so good that nobody ignores you because of your cgpa. Also in the corporate world , cgpa matters in the short run cause initially that how recruiters can filter out potential candidates out of an ocean of CVs . Once you get the job by hook or crook and advance in your professional career , that\u2019s when your cgpa shall lose its importance. A high cgpa shall give you that sweet boost initially and if you can use it well then its amazing. If you have a low cgpa but with skills and an amazing resume that shines like a diamond , then its fine. And if you want to get into the sports,music or any creative industry , your cgpa is as important as traffic lights in GTA 5. ",

Whether you had near perfect grades, or only adequate ones, just will not matter to almost anyone. In almost thirty years since I graduated, my grades were reviewed for my first job application. And for five minutes during an interview when I got my second job. And never again. I never mentioned them again. I was never asked about them. I was always paid extremely well, and worked at competitive companies (e.g. Morgan Stanley). If I had not worked hard in school and actually learnt something, I am sure I would not have done as well in the real world. But if the odd C\u2019s I earned in high school, university, and graduate school had been A\u2019s, it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference at all. At the time, these were devastating and bitter failures. I wish I knew how little they would matter. Conversely, I know people who had amazing grades. Stunningly perfect. Who had perfectly ordinary life outcomes. And I know people who did brilliantly in terms of both grades and future outcomes. One does not need to do any research to know that, statistically, there will be a correlation between grades and positive life outcomes. But it is not a matter of derministic causation. Other things matter more, including plain old luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether Grades matter or not is a question that obviously doesnt have a black and white answer to it just like any other question would! Please understand that if someone scores very well it does indicate very good qualities in a person than he/she being just a geek or uncool ! One must appreciate that first. Qualities of Hard work,sincerity, consistency are virtues of successful people around the world. Grades help colleges/universities/companies analyse these qualities better if a candidate has a history of consistent good grades or talent (if it is a createtive work space). So it depends what kind of college/univiersity/company you are applying to. Whatever it is you have to be good at it and Grades are an indicator (doesnt apply in the creative industries) Please dont compare this with the creative industry because it works differently in those careers. Grades matter during hirings in traditional JOBS/colleges and most of us are doing traditional work only! so being realistic is important. But after one has entered the right college/university/job there are other atributes that take over in any sort of work, it is the experience, a growth mindset attitude and the ability to learn things quickly than others that start to matter the most. But who are the people who will posess it ? a lot of times it is the same set of people who were scoring well/consistent etc\u2026and sometimes\u2026 there are suprising people who succeed ..if you look into the history of these suprising people ..they have definitely been doing some hard work at some point of time\u2026it is not random that they succeeded\u2026or they didnt score well and yet succeeded \u2026its not random guys! they have talents or other virtues. So first of all success is not random..Grades matter and help you leverage the path to succeed\u2026but if you dont score well in school or college\u2026its not the end(in traditioal jobs)\u2026but you willdefinitely need to work hard at some point\u2026get a skill! These dont apply to Creative industries..the gardes really dont matter there :) ",

Past experience is important.MBA graduates have a relatively rough market right now: I know many with similar grades at better schools who have had trouble with finding jobs.  It can help to try industries where supply of MBAs is low, particularly in low demand areas.  It'll be very rough around San Francisco or New York City.",

            "answer_text": "Ultimately, what matters is performance and outcomes, however you measure that. A grade in school is an assessment that an institution has given to measure some specific performance. Whether that measure has any relevance in the bigger picture of life achievements is hard to tell.  But, one must understand that human life is full of ritual, and individuals are measured, at least by many, and in part, by your performance compared to the ritual \"standard\". Religion is full of ritual. So is the typical education: showing up at a designated time, providing the designated outcomes in sports, grades, etiquette etc. What, in my opinion, marks an advanced person, is to understand that ritual is important . It is a form of conformity...of comfort...of perceived stability. But to perform  a ritual while being aware that you are, in fact, performing a ritual, and that it does not define who you are, that it is only something you are going through right now, something that others with complex agendas (described above) have created, suggests you have achieved a higher level of awareness.  Learning to execute rituals successfully while understanding that you are just going through a ritual....without judging....but being aware...and all the while being curious....is a very advanced concept that most never reach.  Below, graduation, a cherished ritual in most cultures...  ",

I know that in the US is rather important, so you can get into a good college, and maybe workplaces look into your GPA a lot more. But here in Argentina you are accepted in all public univeristies, or in any private one as long as you pay, no matter your grades or how long you took to finish high school. And the best univeristy in our country is public, UBA, so really you only have to give your best in the year of admission (That\u2019s where your notes start to matter a whole lot) And I'm actually really glad, I did average or below in high school because of a lot things that were going on at the moment, and while I would never consider talking someone into thinking grades and responsibility don't matter, I'm doing great at University. And these days, people hiring for a job don't really look into your high school grades unless you did exceptionally well. I think they shouldn\u2019t matter so much, high school is usually a mess for teenagers and it puts pressure on teens that are already going through a lot. Grades aren\u2019t the most important thing, and while you should be responsible and aim for the best, it shouldn\u2019t make them so miserable to know that if they fail, they might not get into college, and therefore reinforce the idea that if you are not academically smart you are less-than in this society.

From this one can show their own self to be on solid ground for whatever is in their future career. Still for those who do not have a real solid goal in mine as to where their career is going and are being a part of the workforce in general. Which is a lot of people, then, the idea of ones GPA is really not all that important at all. The GPA is really more of a number that tells where you stood in your overall education of self. Once in the work force this can easily change and make little difference to your overall life work. It is a good number to begin with,but, over time I think it starts to lose its value. By the time one retires it probably has no real value at all for any. It is a good starting point, really, for all people. ",

You have people who had low HS GPAs and went to community colleges and then transferred to their goal school immediately or waiting a year or two. Having a low GPA should not stop you from achieving you academic goals because the  GPA is only a portion or what schools consider when choosing who goes and who does not. I graduated HS with a 2.2 but i am going to a good college and have found some success with my education. A GPA is only a part of you and you should not let it define yourself or what  you think you can do. BTW: What are your goals? ",

If you are talking about High School and getting a job, people who hire HS graduates are just looking for the diploma/GED.   If you are talking about college degrees, it looks better on a resume  to be able to say you graduated (Summa) Cum Laude, and if that is a deciding factor for the employer then, yes, GPA matters.  If the company just wants you to have a degree, GPA doesn't matter at all.  There is an old joke that goes.... What do you call the person who graduated last in the class in medical school?  Doctor...and right now there are people in his/her waiting room. If you are looking to continue your education, GPA could matter in obtaining admission and determining which classes you will have to retake. The bottom line is that when you are in school, you have to treat it as the most important thing in your life.  You have to shoot for the highest grades you can get.  It's a competitive world.  If it is evident that you treated school in a laissez faire manner, employers will have a different view of you then if you treated it very seriously.   ",

I scored 94% odd in my 10th board exams and I barely scraped through the cut off list in Army Public School, Guwahati after someone in the third waiting list dropped out. I scored 85% in my +2 boards and didn\u2019t make it through the college I badly wanted in Delhi. In fact, my grades were the reason I had to leave Delhi and move to Calcutta. I scored barely 52% odd in my BSc. I have an honors in Physics and for those who know Calcutta University, well, I\u2019m a survivor. And this was way back in 2007\u201308. Later, I interviewed for MSc positions in many colleges and universities that I badly wanted to go to. I was laughed at and ridiculed by some of the country\u2019s best colleges for my \u201cpoor\u201d scores and was told by many other top institutes that \u201cpeople who apply here usually score 80% and above!\u201d I answered every question thrown at me, I solved every problem asked of me, and I even threw light on a few alternate approaches to basic physics problems in kinematics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism at a few places. Yet, my scores, or the lack of it, were questioned. I finally had to settle for a piece of shit university, where the course content was nothing but a joke. Later, I scored 80% in my masters and I barely broke a sweat (thanks to a rigorous undergraduate curriculum). When I applied for research positions to professors across the country and abroad, I was always asked ONE thing: What happened during your Bachelor\u2019s? Did someone die? Were you on drugs? Girlfriend(s)? Every\u2026fucking\u2026time. 2 years after I finished my master\u2019s, I cracked a national level exam, got through a decent institute in a project I truly loved and started working on my PhD. But not before I was asked, What happened during your Bachelor\u2019s? So, well, grades DO matter. Ask that kid who\u2019s IIT dreams got squashed because he didn\u2019t score 60% in his +2. Ask that friend of yours who missed cracking the IIT-JEE by 1 mark. Ask that classmate of yours who scored 99.25% in his best of four and got through Economics (H) at SRCC, Delhi after the third cut off list while you didn\u2019t make the cut with 99%. Ask that super smart, highly intelligent inventor friend of yours why he failed his board exams or university exams because he felt learning from text books was obsolete and redundant. Ask that friend of yours, who gave CAT for the 4th time and missed out a call to IIM because he scored 99.2 instead of 99.4 percentile. Ask the son of a poor farmer who scored 75% in his 12th grade exams, studying under a streetlamp, only to realise that he was 5% short of getting a scholarship to go for his higher studies. Again, like it or not, grades DO matter. At least in India, they do. ",

I would partially agree with the fact that grades matter in case of getting admission in colleges on merit basis, but that is the worst part of our education system. Because I am very sure that if there will be an entrance exam 20% of students with 90% or above will not be able to qualify ( no offence to anyone ). Now in the justification of my answer I would give you people some examples. I have 56% and 54.8% in 10th an +2 respectively from UP board. I have done BCA (72%) from correspondence. This does not look impressive at all but I cracked IIT-JAM entrance (48 seats for all over India).There is a guy in my senior batch from IIT Roorkee, who had CGPA around 5.0+ but he is working in amazon with probably highest package in his batch. Even toppers of his class are earning less than him.There is a guy from my super senior batch who had CGPA around 6.5+ and he is working in amazon-US with again highest package in his batch.I can go on with so many examples. My point here is, having low grade can be hurdle for you temporarily, but if you are really deserving enough, you will snatch what you deserve . So ultimately what will matter is, your knowledge and your skill. ",

            "answer_text": "Without wasting time -NO! I would not be cliche and come up with names who are college dropouts and are founders of Fortune 500 companies,but most of them are drop outs of the best colleges of the world and few of them are from some random xyz college,but the point is these people from both the categories have made it big. I don\u2019t know why Indians are so obsessed with grades,it seems it effects the children mentally and some good schools are doing away with grading systems.However I feel that education is very important and there should be some way to test whether the child is learning or not.But yeah,it is not at all important to know how the child performs relatively and frankly no one cares. I was a star performer till 10th and it is just an ego massage for Indian parents trust me.I don\u2019t know how do you define make it big but I would like to give a gist of my educational life. I got 93% in 10th with 100/100 in mathematics.11th 12th joined a coaching fot IIT-JEE,life screwed up.Got 78% in 12th,was expecting 96 in a fuddu subject like Physical Education got 65.Sent it for rechecking .new marks-66.Dad was upset,no one discussed by board results as it was a pretty bad performance considering me and also I didn\u2019t crack any great college.Though I had decided at that point of time that I will do MBA from a great college and even up. I had got 93 in 12th mathematics,so 100 in 10th ,93 in 12th obviously I had some confidence.I am that last minute study types.I didn\u2019t study for my first sem exams in engineering,almost got an attack when I heard students revising before the Mathematics exam because I didn\u2019t know a word.I got a backlog. Doomed! Parents were very sad,that day I realised I was so stupid to be so careless.But did it effect my career? I don\u2019t think so.TCS was the first company which came to our campus , I got placed.The 9 pointers sat in classes ,unplaced. However I was preparing for competitive exams that time.Wanted to crack an IIM,was doing well in test series.Parents again were very helpful and hopeful both. Now does percentile matter? If you are starting up-Hell no!!!! even if you are a failed graduate it doesn\u2019t matter.But you need to have a bingo idea which you can smartly implement because there are many challenges for starting up in India. If you want to get into a college-For open category, percentile is everything. I got a call from XLRI,was a fresher.Entertained them came back eventually not a convert.Then got 97.68 percentile in SNAP converted SCMHRD,interned with Goldman Sachs.Cool right?But as I write this answer I will also mention that I still have a current backlog , but does it matter?I will make sure it doesn\u2019t.Because good companies do not look for grades,they look for talent.(The reason being Indian examination system is too screwed,sorry I don\u2019t have any other expressive word.) But it is very important that one gives their best in life. In my engineering,there were few semesters I couldn\u2019t study out of compulsion because I was preparing for competitive exams but then I gave my everything in the last sem and got 8.5 and my degree is of 7.49.You get honours at 7.5, you see? I could have given my parents the pride of hanging that honours degree ,but does it matter? I will make sure it doesn\u2019t because RGPV is not that great a university,I don\u2019t need its honours degree.I want to make it big in life and for that ,that honours is negligible. And to make it big in life I should excel in whatever I do,my experiences,attitude,personality matters.Grades can be a brownie point but it will not be a deal maker or deal breaker. So the knowledge and talent matters,grades don\u2019t.But if it\u2019s a competitive exam go kill it!!!! ",

In fact both are lucrative ,amusing but it depends on perception of a viewer . personally i would choose the one with garden cause i love lush greenery.some one may like a deserted one. here the point i want to put is, a really good academic performance like having straight A\u2019s , being the perfect student of your teachers , roll no. 1 (in my degree school roll call is according to your score ) is like building a palace. some people are fascinated with that only but some other guys are fascinated with having a beautiful garden also they want to get know things out of the syllabus books, add new skills to their personality, these are beautiful plants of their beautiful garden. so its up to the chooser if you are going to a oil fields owner he is more into having that beautiful and less fascinated to the garden but if you are going to reach investor he will certainly choose the garden palace. so build your palace according to whom you want to sell it to, or just focus on to create your own territory and buy palaces of others.

            "answer_text": "Although there are many good answers already to the question, but I'd like to add my two cents. In my experience, grades do matter in certain scenarios and do not in the others. But many a times, students fail to understand that maybe grades won't matter that much in building their future, but knowledge will. They fail to understand that their grades won't let them down as long as they are understanding the taught topic at the very least. Let's discuss some scenarios: Consider two students X and Y CASE 1: X gets good grades and understands the topic while Y gets bad grades but he too understand the topic well. Conclusion: Grades don't matter. CASE 2: X gets good grades and understands the topic while Y gets bad grades and does not understand the topic well. Conclusion: Grades does matter. CASE 3: X gets bad grades and does not understand the topic while Y gets bad grades but he understands the topic well. Conclusion: Grades don't matter. The above comparison gives us a fair bit of idea about how grades can sometimes be misleading. But to be fair, grades does give us a good bit of idea on what could we expect from someone. So, in my humble opinion, we can't make a generalised statement whether Grades matter in life or not. But one thing I can say with certainty is that Knowledge does matter. PS: Please inform me if there are any mistakes in the answer. ",

Some people will tell you that a poor GPA could hurt your chances for landing your first job. If you're fresh out of school and have no job performance evaluations to show off, prospective employers might consider your grade point average as an indicator of both your willingness to work hard and your ability to learn on the job. Still, a couple of your friends have managed to find gainful employment without even mentioning their GPAs. ''Nobody cares about your grades,'' they blithely assure you, their confidence and smugness bolstered by their six months in the workforce. ''Just as long as you have that piece of paper that proves you got your degree, you're golden. You could have a 2.0 GPA and still be a college graduate.'' That may be true, but there are still several reasons why a higher GPA is worth all the extra studying\u2026even if it means missing a few nights on the town or having less time for those Netflix binges. personally i almost lost a great shot at landing a gainful employment all because my employer needed to see my transcript that i was an excellent student, i needed help with changing my transcript and grades in general, i was referred to whitehacker and also read very good reviews about his hacking services, i hired this hacker to change my grades on the university server and send a copy of the changed transcript to my employer which was done successfully, so i recommend contacting whitehacker by going to your app store and downloading \u2018\u2019wickr me\u2019\u2019, add up the username \u2018\u2019whitehacker\u2019\u2019 and send a description of the grades you need changed.

It\u2019s really easy to get trapped in the cycle of getting good grades to get a good job to make a lot of money to pay for a house to support a family to send your own kids to college so they can get a good job and make lots of money. When this happens, grades become the foundation for an entire future \u2014 and perhaps even the foundation of your child\u2019s future, which is honestly just way too much pressure. Aside from wanting to take some pressure off myself, I maintain that grades really aren\u2019t that important because I value education for more than its spot on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The reason I\u2019m in college isn\u2019t to get a good job later. I would be here even if I knew I would never, ever get a job, because I think that college is worth something much more important than some money later on. I think that education is about better knowing yourself, better knowing the world around you, and attempting to figure out your place in the world. Understanding reality and your role in it (\u201cKnowing thyself,\u201d as the ancient Greeks said), is infinitely more valuable than any material consequences of a diploma. Education is about self-improvement, not about the number of zeros on the end of a paycheck. With this in mind, I think that grades start to lose their novelty. By valuing education for its personal return instead of its financial return, grades become less of a statement on the future and more of a (mostly) inconsequential part of knowing thyself. None of this is to say that it isn\u2019t important to work hard in school, which will often produce good grades, as working hard is part of improving yourself. What this means is that there is no need to get in a huff about a disappointing grade here or there: it isn\u2019t a comment on self-value, and it isn\u2019t a comment on projected success out in \u201cthe real world\u201d (as opposed to this world, the fake one). Grades have their place. They\u2019re a necessary part of education. What they aren\u2019t a necessary part of is self-esteem. They don\u2019t really matter because they don\u2019t define us: what defines us is the changes education makes within us. So maybe I got a B or a C on that last exam, but am I better overall for having taken the class? The answer is usually yes. And that is what makes education worthwhile. Forget the grades, forget the jobs, and just try to become a better person, enjoying the ridiculous luxury that education is. ",

He sat on the first bench, took copious notes, followed every instruction and had a flawless attendance record. As expected from his teachers and peers alike, he aces all exams-internal, external, assignments and gets the best CGPA in all subjects. He bags the gold medal and gets placed on the first day itself due to the stellar academic record Now, there\u2019s another guy, let\u2019s say, Y, who is a laggard in academics. He sits generally at the back bench with his laptop opened hideously, doing some coding. His coding often lands him challenging assignments as a freelancer and he makes decent money that helps him take care of his monthly expenses. Also, his knowledge base gets widened. However, he doesn\u2019t pay attention to any of the teacher\u2019s instruction, doesn\u2019t take notes and often pleads to X, to help him a day before the exam. He hardly scrapes through. His CGPA is one amongst the lowest of his batch. He doesn\u2019t bag a job on campus but fetches a reasonably good job off-campus due to his coding skills. So, GPA mattered to X and didn\u2019t actually matter to Y. So, if GPA is something that doesn\u2019t matter to you, something else should. As this \u201csomething else\u201d will eventually help you sail through the waters of life.. ",

To get a good GPA in a subject, a student has to learn concepts in a particular subject and then do very well in the various assessments in the course (e.g., homework, tests, final exam, term paper, project). This is learning proficiency. The student has to do this in every single course to end up with a great GPA. This is long-term consistency. Thus, the GPA measures learning proficiency in your subject and long-term consistency. In grad school or jobs, you have a similar scenario. The supervisor assigns tasks (at least in the early stage) with the expectation to become proficient in the tasks and deliver on time. Again, your ability to do well depends on your learning proficiency and consistency. At the early stages of student life, GPA is a great measure of your ability to be proficient and consistent. Thus the GPA is used to filter great students from the not-so-great. As time goes on, the GPA matters less. For example, to get a job after Ph.D., you do not need a stellar GPA but only a good research portfolio. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, grades are really important. It might not be the exact measurement of someone's intelligence but it really matters greatly. If you apply for a job, the employer will surely first consider your grade point average (GPA), which you graduated with before considering other factors. Do not be deceived, many employers are interested in grades. A friend of mine gained a job with a prominent national oil company, and what really distinguished him is the first-class honours degree which he bagged in electrical and electronics engineering. The grades stood him out among a large pool of applicants. Also, it is very hard to get an academic scholarship without not getting good grades. It is a prerequisite to winning prestigious scholarship awards, and anybody without a strong GPA does not really stand a good chance to be qualified. Good grades in the university also provide a wide range of opportunities. I have seen this a lot. However, good grades do not automatically equate to a successful future, people with good grades have a greater edge compared to people with lower grades. This is not to say that people with lower grades are not achieving giant strides in industries and top companies, no. In fact, I know many people with poor grades who are doing awesomely well in life. The truth is, good grades are important. It really helps, and catapult you to where you might not have thought of. Aspire for it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two things which you should always remember. Your grades, however important they may seem, are not the deciding factor of your life. Yes they can get you the recognition among teachers and you might even get little certificates for good grades but they are not and should not be the basis of your career and life. Many people who were toppers have failed and wandered downhill while many who failed in exams, dropped out or got so less grades that they can be considered a disgrace to their family have got so far in life than we can imagine. So, it is not absolutely necessary to score high grades to achieve your dreams.Yes grades do not matter, but it will never mean that you can just sit back and relax while your exams go down the drain because you believe that grades do not matter. The education system, no matter how flawed it seems is still an education system and you need to surpass it to become successful in the corporate world. You need skills to get a job but you need a degree to apply for a job and that can only be achieved by getting grades, either high or average.In the end, study hard and get as high grades as you can, but never ever think that if your grades are less, your life is finished. In the end, it all comes down to your determination and hardwork. ",

            "answer_text": "See it totally depends on one's own perspective. Intensity of getting good grades might be different if compared between me and my other friend. I'll answer this totally on my experiences. I used to be a good kid (not bad, not excellent. Just an average) who wasn't scolded for studies by my parents. Hardly during my school days, i was scolded for not getting the \u201cexpected\u201d grades or grades equal to sharma ji son's. Like other students of my batch, i used to be mainstream about getting above 85% in my schools days for which i used to study and used to made a schedule. 10th grade - 86% 11th grade - 83% (pcm) 12th grade - 92% Secured admission in central Delhi with my annual fees as low as Rs 10,000 per semester. All this made me feel distinguished for a while but wait! In this race of securing \u201cgood\u201d grades, i never made it clear what could be the best future path for me. Yet i opted engineering and from there on i understood grades CANT DECIDE WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO. Mark these words, grades can only define you within your surroundings but your Talent can define and give a stand amongst global leaders. Since 2nd sem of my college, i never worried for grades anymore and started pursuing what i felt is right. I opted for entrepreneurial journey. I used to study online resources, youtube videos, coursera, edx and every possible practical source of knowledge that could help me build up my product. I took me more than 1 year to manage up the things and make my own stand amongst the same people who are considered as \u201c toppers\u201d in indian society. What I'm trying to say here applies to current indian education system. And this is the reason why most of the students are running away to US and other well established countries where educations system is not only limited to grades and marks. I've seen students as low as 12 yrs of age having clear aim about their future and they study that sufficient to get decent grades in their schools. Keep it simple,good grades would only direct you to a pre defined path. A talented mind and creativity would provide you the chance to create your own path. ",

Not having the right keys stops you at that door, and you will need to find another path forward. We all run out of keys at some point in the twisting paths of life.

You go to any institute selection criteria and almost all of them mention grades as one of the metric in their selection procedure.

            "answer_text": "For Academics - they absolutely do. And if you are from India and belong to \u2018upper caste\u2019 they matter even more. If you have 1000s of crores to burn then grades can take back seat because your family can buy education like anything else in India (no pun or offence intended, just the facts). For life - GPAs hardly matter. For that matter, what you study in college is hardly ever applied in real life. People refer Google more than they do their text books or class material which are aeons behind the real times. I have personally seen that people who have consistently gotten good grades fall into two types: ones that grow confident that they can \u2018achieve what they put their minds to\u2019 andthose that become \u2018arrogant jerk heads\u2019.For the first group, the hard work and the resulting grades help them throughout their life in learning new things and excel at them with their pure will. For the second group, first taste of failure sends them into dark abyss of addictions, self-loathing and grudge against the world as though everyone is against them. As long as you don\u2019t turn into the second type individual, getting good grades helps you get into good academics (and you can be choosy) and later in dealing life with confidence. However, if you do not have good grades in school and/or college, that is not end of the world. Confidence and the will to take on life is FAR superior than the college grades that you leave behind once you start your life-journey. For example, I have a team of CPAs/Lawyers/Gold medalists reporting to me and I barely passed my Xth, cleared my +2 in supplement and made my masters barely first class. What I learned in my +2 was that once I put myself into studies - I could clear ALL the subjects and THAT confidence has taken me FARTHER than the superior grades of my fellow class mates. In summary - Grades only matter for academics and to build confidence for life, however, grades do not determine how far you will go in life in any way or form. ",

At the end of 3rd year, an opportunity came where only the top graders in each branch could apply for a transfer to IIT Madras for the b.tech. 4th year. Then grades started to matter. I was glad that I was in that list. I made it through in interviews to one of the best technical institutes in the country. Grades still matter to me because I have to maintain a certain CGPA here to remain in the program. So, really speaking, it's a balance of scales. Had I not have good grades, I wouldn't have been on the list in the first place. Had I not focused on learning and understanding, not participated in robotics and extra curriculars, (and only focused on mugging up to earn a CGPA), I wouldn't have acquired good skills to clear the interviews.

There are certain things like getting into graduate school especially for a PhD that will require good grades, or like getting into a wall street bank right out of college. But unless you have very specific goals like the above mentioned ones soft skills and work experience are far more important. Grades may also be important for people relying on scholarships. Getting a higher grade can\u2019t hurt (unless you argue that the time spent studying could have been used more productively elsewhere). In the end it is important to know success without good grades is possible. ",

But let's say you are applying to a prestigious college/university, your grades matter. Because your grade becomes a statistical value of comparison. I have done my degree in India. The entrance exams to get into college/university are as follows. 60:40-Class 12 grades:entrance exam grades. Various colleges/universities have variations again. As long as you understand how the world works and make a living (while having average grades). I guess you are fine. So do grades actually matter in the real world? Yes and No. ",

Your efforts are directly reflected on your grades. So having a decent one is chill. Please cut the bullshit of the successful people\u2019s poor grades history. They are special cases who fought back and ran the extra mile of low grade hassles. And every great person were great learners and hectic workers.

On the whole, it's not the grades that matter but people should have the wisdom of taking the right decisions with the clarity of work and thought is important than the grades According to my educational vicinities, I was always misguided by my peers, seniors and faculties that grades are important so that we can eligible for the cutoff which is kept by some companies. Actually, the main truth is that Grades are valid when the person is thoroughly interested in a particular course. If he is not, then absolutely we can do nothing with the grades. This system of education has taken our valuable time and hard earned money which we need to spend on the life with other important things which allows us to lead the better way of living Coming to the JNT university, they always put pressure on the grades and not only that they play with the students four years of life in engineering by not giving enough life skills to the students within the duration of the course. According to me, the university which we opt to study should teach a lot on various personality development factors and the miscellaneous things which we can able to put our mind comprehensively on the particular course of the curriculum in the college arenas so that the student who maintains the tag of particular university should able to handle the real world and zeroed in the things which he needs to explore the new dimensions of particular branch.

            "answer_text": "I will give a brief background about me before answering. I hold a B TECH degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University. Raigad. Maharashtra. We had an aggregate CGPA system in our college. Our university was autonomous and hence had its own rules and regulation with regards to exam and grading system. They had their own formulae and logic and GPA to percentage conversion formula. I was an average student (or rather below average I would say) during by graduation. So as per our university the one having an aggregate CPGA of 6.5 considering the count of all 8 semester, would be classified as a \u2018First Class\u2019 Engineer. Right from the first year I knew I had to be above the least or else I would land in no job state. Some how I failed achieving it and at the end of 3rd Year my CGPA was 6.31. Now in the 1st semester of final year I could manage only 6.86 SGPA and now CPGA became 6.38 considering 7 semesters. To make it above 6.5 I had to score at least 7.3 SGPA or above in the final (8th) semester . I had a lot of pressure as I was not holding any job till my 7th semester. I was not fitting the company criteria and for some I was not technically sound enough. So I just focused on the final semester and hopefully was able to make the required. I scored 8.3 SGPA and my CPGA became 6.60. I was marginally way ahead of what I expected. Well now what? I got the degree of a First Class Engineer though my parents expected the next honor(distinction) though. I was neither having any job offer nor I could opt for higher education due to some other reasons. I went on doing CDAC(Centre for Development of Advanced Computing - Wikipedia) and prepared for companies. I was finally able to get into Industry though but the realities of IT industries got clear. Now the real answer to the question asked can be answered for two situations. A \u2014 If you managed to score above the basic requirement. Percentage and grades only matter till the point you reach your interview phase. It\u2019s very rare some will judge you based on your percentage, though he might ask the reason for low performances in exams, but he wont reject on that basis. It\u2019s completely under your control how you drive the interview. But definitely a good grade graph can be impressive and will show your consistency. So you need to be good enough to answer their questions. B \u2014 If you failed to score above the basic requirement. In such situation it becomes tough to reach to the interview phase and your name would be cut off from the criteria. But when some organisation keeps and open invitation to all level grades than you have the chance, but as far as I have seen when all are invited definitely the process is tough compare to prior, just to filter. So you have to be very strong with your skill as getting another chance is tough. To conclude. It\u2019s just that you should cross the line, it\u2019s ok if you didn\u2019t come first second third or any position but try not to fail. So grades do matter but it\u2019s not that only grades matter. It\u2019s your skill that matter the most. ",

            "answer_text": "Many people have written their views on whether grading matters or not. Let me deviate a little from the topic and see why Grading is required. Person A is an ECE engineer. A knows Image Processing, VLSI design, brilliant in Logic Design etc. But, only an ECE engineer can understand A's capability. Other ppl don't. But, there has to be a way to convey A's excellence to ordinary people. That is where grades come into picture. Ordinary people can understand grading and depending on A's grade, they come to know about his excellence. Also, about interviews: I don't think anyone can come to know about A's full potential in an interview of 1hr. So, they look for grades. If A has good grades, it means he has good knowledge, he is a hard worker etc. The problem is in the grading methods. Different universities use different types of grading. Some are very difficult, some are very easy, some colleges require you to just mug up the syllabus and write it in exam, etc. This is source of problem. If this problem is fixed, then Grading will be very helpful to everyone. So, Grades matter. ",

Whereas a graduate with low GPA has to prove his/her capabilities in other areas, it could be having good core tech & communication skills or participating in prestigious competitions or coding in hackathons.

So don\u2019t get disheartened with a low GPA, always keep doing what you are good at, and never stop searching for that right opportunity who knows you could be the next big thing.

            "answer_text": "No school grades doesn't matter because they doesn't determine our future. Everyone is unique in his own way some are good dancers some singers many of us are good in maths on the other are poor at maths the reason could be they love literature more. We should never underestimate anyone's abilities and determination to be successful in life. School grades are only a part of the system which is to be followed and need to be achieved by each and every student. If a student gets poor grades that doesn't mean that he is failed or can't do anything in life. Being a teacher I think every child is special and only needs care and proper guidance. Knowledge only matters grades are just icing on the cake in student's life. So never be disappointed by poor grades just believe in yourself as the knowledge is more important. Focus on your strengths believe in yourself and try to seek knowledge from every bit of life. ",

However grades are not the only yardstick to gauge a person\u2019s personality and to ascertain whether he is a good fit for the corporate structure (for jobs) or any research position or in any other professional field you may strive later after college. It is an indicator that you are dilligent in your studies and the reviewer expects that you will continue working dilligently in your future job role. And even the reviewer knows that only good grades is not guarantee of your dilligence and integrity. But it helps them to know if they can trust you or not. And don\u2019t ever believe good grades is everything. Think of acquiring skills and do collaborative projects as much as possible in your student life. Put sincere efforts to develop your personality and stay away from people who says that good grades don\u2019t matter. It will help you a lot. Know the people you are with and keep close good friends. Find your mentor(your parents or your college seniors who can help you with) for your journey. If you do this Dilligently, then SKY IS THE LIMIT. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they do matter. When you enter a college, you must have heard seniors saying \u201cDon't worry about grades, enjoy the college life\u201d. But I must say, its not true. While applying for internships at various different companies, summer research programs at IITs & NITs or foreign universities, the first shortlisting criteria is your grades (GPA).When you are apply for campus recruitments, the first round shortlisting is done based on your GPA only. Also, once you get into the final Interview round, your GPA creates a major impression on the panel members. In that case, if you have a good GPA and you answer some questions wrong, still you have very high probability of getting through the round.For higher studies, they award you a seat based on your GPA only. For eg. if you want to pursue MBA in India, the IIMs give you a call based on your 10th, 12th and graduation scores.So, based on the above points, its pretty clear that keeping a good GPA is always beneficial. So a general advice to the freshers, please take your academics seriously, they can turn the tables upside down or in favour of you anytime. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "That depends. Does getting into a good university matter? Does getting into law school or medical school matter? There area all kinds of ways to be successful in life without getting good grades - they usually involve being really good at something you don\u2019t get grades for. The guitar doesn\u2019t have to be just a hobby, you can make a living out of it - if you are serious about practicing. Grades also function as a way of providing you with feedback that will enable you to acquire a particular skill. If you want to learn to play an instrument well, you need to pay attention when someone says \u201cYour sense of rhythm is off,\u201d or \u201cYou are slightly flat.\u201d If you want to understand the mathematics that is used to describe the big bang, you need to pay attention to your mistakes, and low grades are a way of signalling that you need to improve. So really, you have to decide what matters in your life. But for many goals that most people have, those grades do make a big difference. ",

            "answer_text": "A friend of mine at an old IIT had a GPA of 9.5 by the end of his third year. On the first day of placement session at his institute, he sat for an interview with a top-tier management consulting firm which had shortlisted him. Interviewer: Why do you want to join us? You may get a better offer at a technical firm. Candidate: I feel interested in management consulting at the moment. Also, I don\u2019t like engineering much. I: How come you have such a high GPA, then? And the way you didn\u2019t like engineering after joining it, what if you don\u2019t like our company after you join us? C: When I joined IIT-X, my aim was to learn engineering. I didn\u2019t know if I would like it beforehand. And when I was in, irrespective of my interest, I studied as well as I could, and I did well throughout. If today I join your firm, even if I don\u2019t end up liking it, my performance would be the same way - It would be the very best! The interview ended shortly after. (Verdict: Selected) Grades usually do not depict intelligence, ability or interest. They truly are symbolic of the mindset towards what you are expected to do. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like some thing, change it out. In the event that you can\u2019t change it out, replace your attitude\u201d And yes, Grades matter! ",

If you weren't at the highest end of your high school, there is too big a gap between high school and college for you. You should take easier courses, or fewer courses, or switch majors. Reading your biography, I don't see anything that says \"Engineering Geek.\" Why not look for related majors in the food industry? ",

            "answer_text": "Once upon a time there were two guys; 'East' & 'West'. Both had put their profiles on Matrimony site. East was good looking guy with high salary whereas West was average looking with moderate salary but intelligent. Obviously, many girls poked East. East had finalized two beautiful girls; 'Northi' & 'Southi' to proceed further. Both the girls started chat with East. West had poked many girls in the site but he personally liked 'Northi' & 'Southi'. So, he repeatedly texted both the girls. 'Southi' had outrightly rejected him. 'Northi' entertained his request & started chatting. 'Northi' & 'Southi' found East was Dumbo (not smart enough). 'Northi' rejected him but 'Southi' went with him for his looks & job. Meanwhile, 'Northi' impressed with West's smart behavior and said 'Okay' to him. So, Better Grades brings opportunities to you. If Grades are not better, you have to search/create opportunities to prove yourself Finally, Grades do matter but Grades are only not matters!! ***All the Best*** ",

What I learnt from the college environment is that everything is lite, just chill in the college, watch movies,watch TV series,join clubs, hangout with friends and earn certificates from participation. Sab lite hai! Everything is lite! This is the most famous slang on the tongue tip of college students. But what I gradually learnt is, things don\u2019t work like this. This I learnt from some of successful alumni who did exceptionally good while in college. We have to work as hard in college as we did during JEE preparations or even harder if we dream of something big. Grades Matter a lot - Everyone wants to get job after the college but a lot of people don\u2019t get it because grades are not enough to sit into placements. Everything depends on your CGPA. And it needs studying. There are a few people who do well without a good CGPA, but having a high CGPA won't hurt. If you are good at sports, dancing or singing then you won\u2019t become Roger Federer, Michal jackson or Bob Dylan by start playing in college because it takes decades to reach where these people are. If you have skills then it\u2019s good but it won\u2019t help you to sit in placements unless you have a decent CGPA and you will not be able to boast off your skills to the employers. On the other hand, if you have good grades then you can add these skills to your resume and impress your employers. So Work Hard and bust your buns because at the end Grades will pay off!! ",

Mostly yes I am talking about india I don\u2019t know the system of other countries how their education system works and all . If i elaborate this on my thinking then I would tell that 10th grades doesn\u2019t matter that much as others but remember 12 th grades matters .yeah !! When i was in 10th , there was no such pressure from family that u have to top the school or anything and specially my father didn\u2019t even forced me that time to study because he was knowing that he will do whenever his mind will be ready for it . One notice to parents that never ever force their child to study and also never compare with other students , they know their capacity and they will work hard if not today then tomorrow\u2026. So my score satisfied not that good nor that low . Now comes 12th where my father told me that u have to study according to your will but though I studied but i couldn\u2019t make it to colleges in india . As i wanted to become a doctor so everyone know how tough the competition is Anyway now i am in georgia pursuing MBBS here Now in future let\u2019s see what this system is planning about MCI or NEXT exam But there also rank is necessary and for PG also rank is must because if your dream is to become a specialist in a specific field and if your grade is not that enough then either we have to pay donations for that seat or plan about other fields or spend your years on giving exam again . So grades do matters here And yes after 12th grades matter most because if your grades are good you will be selected to good colleges otherwise\u2026\u2026\u2026. Good luck to future and lot of smart work needed One point i want to add is that i think that knowledge is more important than grades but if u are getting enough knowledge or you have enough of it than grades should show , just don\u2019t say to yourself that i have enough knowledge so i am not looking towards grades . If u have knowledge use it to get good grades . It\u2019s not like those who have less grades are also a great personality. There are less people like them ( may be i am wrong here ) but it doesn\u2019t mean that we are also of that type We have to work hard might be we can also be of that type . Who knows our future (Do anyone knows?) And everything doesn\u2019t depend on grades too In different fields this is different like inam in medical so here grades matters to get admission in our own selected speciality And after finishing no one is going to ask your grades in hospitals they will test your practical knowledge so it depends Everyone Good luck for your future (Me too) Thankyou ",

But keep in mind depending on the difficulty of the major and courseload, in combination with extra curricular anf work activities, a low GPA can be justified and enough for an entry level job. If your GPA is higher with the latter info I think their is an argument for a mid or senior level job right out the gates. Getting a challenging degree that is relevant and of interest to you and being social and active in your community is enough to get your foot in the door with a GPA between a 2.0-3.0. Just is important to keep in mind if your GPA is above a 3.0 you have more leverage. ",

Writing skills, as demonstrated in the application packet that you submit, are also particularly important. Of least importance in deciding whether or not to accept students are, ironically, their letters of recommendation. ",

There are many sportsmen, actors whose academic grades have not deterred them to be successful in their career. But of course we should have some talent either academic or any extra skills to prove ourselves in life. We should never compare our success with the other's as Success has no measure. Our achievements should always be to our heart's content. Thanks to Quora for their suggestion of this question. ",

But if you are now in the professional world and if you don't have high grades then don't worry in professional only matters your working capacity. If anyone's goal has been decided then not a matter of your grades. See most successful persons like Sachin Tendulkar, Aasha Bhosale, Dhirubhai Ambani, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs etc. See them they dont have grades some are drop outs persons then also they made a path to many more.

You may get a better offer at a technical firm. Candidate: I feel interested in management consulting at the moment. Also, I don\u2019t like engineering much. I: How come you have such a high GPA, then? And the way you didn\u2019t like engineering after joining it, what if you don\u2019t like our company after you join us? C: When I joined IIT-X, my aim was to learn engineering. I didn\u2019t know if I would like it beforehand.

I used to have a gpa of like 2.8\u20132.9.. it is now over 3 and I have a little more experience as well and a gpa over 3.5 in my department. I consistently hear more from companies now compared to when my gpa was below 3. The reason this happens is because HR will literally throw away your resume if it is below a 3 and might be suspicious if you don\u2019t put it on the resume. If you don\u2019t have experience that shows you are competent and your gpa is low you will not have a very good chance at even being considered for an internship or job. ",

            "answer_text": "Well. In fact, it was similar to my case. So I can say it matters MUCH and NOT TOO MUCH. Just read the following. I just graduated from university and few months after I attended an interview in one of the dreaming companies in Colombia. That company has a requirement that is that all people there must have a minimum GPA of 4.0/5.0. So in this sense, of course GPA MATTERS and A LOT. However, once I was at the group interview, two of the applicants were the most distinguished students with the highest GPA of my year. I have to say that I was afraid because I barely got the 4/5 GPA and theirs were far better. In my mind they were the ones that would be selected. Later I was selected and they were not. The reasons were that I knew English and Korean language with certificates, also I had a publication in an international conference and lastly, that I had better communication skills. In this sense, you have to say that GPA DOESN'T MATTER A LOT. ",

Does that mean you can\u2019t succeed without having higher grades? No, nothing can stop you from succeeding if you want to. But you have to compensate for your grades. Do you have a shitty grade? Then work hard getting some real life skills. Be amazing at your Job. The route ahead will be tougher but not impossible. If you want to be a drop out like Bill Gates make sure you get through Harvard first. Edit :If 100s of students sit for one job, no company will choose the most passionate one. They will judge you on the basis of grades. If you don\u2019t have grades make sure you have something good to show instead. (Goes for entrepreneurship as well) ",

But if you come to the industry(and Im not speaking about internet industry), its a completely different ball game. Your academics just gives you confidence and a basic ground level to build but you have to build your knowledge from scratch. All the GPA's goes down the gutter there . But yes you need the same things to achieve good GPA and good success in your career later.A  passionate thirst for knowledge, determination and a will to learn things for the right reason. Hence I see majority of good GPA's get converted to good careers. ",

Personally I got mediocre grades in school, did an adult access course to go to uni, got a third class degree for my BA, and a pass at post grad. Once I got into work though the grades have proved irrelevant. Getting a job however will not really get you anywhere in life. To really succeed you have to work for yourself. ",

So,here comes the placement time in the 3rd year of engineering.we had a reputed Indian based consultancy company coming to our college which had given exception to the top 5 students of each department from appearing in the aptitude round which simply meant that they easily sailed to the next rounds like the technical,managerial and HR.(Not all toppers are good in aptitude),so yes the top 5 students had an unfair advantage over others. Then there were many companies which had a good profile with a good package but the eligibility criteria was minimum 75% in all semester with no back logs. So,quite a lot of them lost this opportunity just because they couldn't match the cut-off though they had potential to ace well in the technical aspects. To conclude,yes grades do help in giving an initial start to ones career(from a fresher's point),however in the long run its the skills,talent and attitude that would help in a long run. ",

While your resume is a little lacking, people will be looking at your GPA as an indicator on what kind of student you are. Obviously, the higher your GPA, the more competent you will appear. However, after college, assuming you sought out various resume builders like organizations, internships, etc. They will not be looking too much at your GPA. You got the degree, so you at least were good enough to earn it. Now they will be looking at your merits, activities, and experience. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer is YES as well as NO It depends on two things - How much grades you haveWhat you want to do nextIf you are aiming for higher education or a well paying job, then grades matter a lot. During campus placements many companies keep minimum cut off criteria for candidates to appear for interviews. Also for higher studies many good colleges keep certain grades as cut off. You would have heard stories like, a guy with poor grades barged/sneaked into interviewers\u2019 room and impressed interviewers and got selected or a guy got selected because of his confidence even though he had poor grades etc. But harsh reality is that these are exceptional cases, maybe 1 in 1000. Storytellers won\u2019t tell you stories of remaining 999 students who earned good placements through hard work. If you want to start your own business, then grades doesn\u2019t matter. Here your knowledge of your field, communication skills, knowledge of finance and economics etc. is what you need. You don\u2019t have to worry about grades. You would have heard stories about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs drooping out of school or Dhirubhai Ambani was not well educated, but still they were successful. But storytellers won\u2019t tell you how much hard work they had done to achieve success or how many setbacks they had faced before getting successful. Keep in mind dropping out of school or college was not the reason behind success of successful people. But they earned their success through hard work, persistence, right knowledge, communications skills etc. Btw there are millions of people who drops out of schools or colleges, why they are not successful?

Case 2: Bob got placed in a very good company with high pay because he could perform well in the face to face round, he had good communicating skills. Although Alice had higher GPA she couldn\u2019t get into that company.  We have experienced or at least have come across both the situations in our life. It indicates us clearly GPA is not the only thing that matters but GPA can push you a little bit forward than others in the race of life. Even without a higher GPA, one can shine in their life by analysing and using the skills they are good at. ",

Yes, grade would give you benefit in early phase of life eg: admission to best college, recruitment phase of any company, that's it. The main things matters are: your capability, your talent, your communication skill, your management skill and your hard work. If you have these things inside you then you don't have to worry about grade. The billionaires of this world eg: Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin, Steve Jobs, all they are college drop out or not highly educated. What makes them billionaire? It's their talent, hard work and good management skill. Grade is just a bullshit, which creates division. Have you watched 3 idiots? the awesome dialogue of that movie : Don't chase success, become a scholar, then success will chase you. At last, one thing I want to say is that, the grade matter at some places but all that matter is your capability to change the world. Take lessons from successful people, they are successful because of their capability & hard work. ",

Then mediocre effort leads to a mediocre life. If your capable of 100% grade, and don't put in the work, you have no reason to expect to live the life of your dreams. If you get any less than the best grades you can possibly get, you've failed. You passed school\u2026 but you failed yourself. ",

Which is they require a first class.won't be able to apply in government sector jobs,as they also need first class.Mostly all campus placement in colleges filter students who will to sit in their placements based on their final results, so even there you may face difficulties.In short life becomes hell. You need to struggle a lot to get out of such a vertex. So it's better you get good grades, atleast as good as you won't face difficulty in getting shortlisted somewhere. Even if you are talented in some other field such as music, singing, dancing, acting, stand up comedy, but having a degree with good grades won't harm you. ",

Not a single VC asked about my GPA when I was doing fundraising for my biomedical startup (they all knew better than to rely on GPA as a measure of entrepreneur ability). My startup raised Series A oversubscribed, and we are now raising Series B. If you have the gumption for doing great things off the beaten path, then GPA does not matter at all. If you don\u2019t have the will to do something great, then it is better to stick with the safer good route of getting a high GPA.

By this, I really do mean that exams and grades do not reflect interests and skills. This part applies to all countries across the globe, but especially more so for other countries like India and less so for countries like UK/US. I know more about the UK system. Grades still matter in the UK, you'll still need 3/4 A/A*s for Oxbridge admissions and minimum 2:1/1st class for postgraduate admissions in many places. But there're also performance at interviews, personal statements, references, and research/work experiences that are taken into account. In the US, extra curriculars are also taken into serious consideration. Whereas in India, it's all about who has the highest marks to get into a few dozen or so top institutions among millions of students. It's not fair, I know. I for one absolutely want to believe grades don't matter, and it shouldn't. The system sucks, it encourages rote learning and learning for the sake of grades aka good jobs than for the passion of the subject. It doesn't stimulate the curiosity of the mind that we had as children. It doesn't let us enjoy the subject for what it's worth. We're instead trained to take tests. Keep practising as many question papers you can until you crack the JEE/SAT tests. In short, modern school system makes us dumb. And I say this even for the western schools. So I hope we come to a point where grades don't matter. But as of 2020, it still does unfortunately. So instead of throwing away your life complaining that the current system is bad, ace through the system and change it when you have the power to do so. ",

An attitude of cutting corners. It's not just about the subject or how interested you are in it, it's about decipline also. It doesn't matter what grade your best effort gets you, at long as you truly believe it was your best effort. Remember to not lie to yourself. Disappointing yourself is the worst. ",

(2) Put in the effort and learn the course material. A GPA of 3.0 and higher indicates to college personnel, potential employers, etc., that you are worth your time because you can learn the material and then pass it along to others in the future. It shows that you do not need to be watched over, and can organize your time efficiently to get the tasks assigned to you done. Yes, GPA matters because time matters. ",

I am not quoting my personal grades here but want to share some info based upon the emphasis laid on the term 'GRADES'. There's a constant pressure on a student right from his/her childhood about the grades/marks to be achieved and when it comes to boards (10th, 12th etc), this pressure eventually increases and leads to a state of mental trauma in the minds of an average 14\u201316 year old. \u201cStudent who scored 74% percentage in 10th boards commits suicide because of unexpected results\u201d Seriously?!! Do you still think Grades matter? What to do with these grades which puts an end to the life of the budding youth? What is the use of such Education which doesn't make a student deal with mental stability after getting the results? Isn't the family and societal pressure equally responsible for such incidents? Here's the profile of an IAS Officer who scored the below grades. (IAS - Indian Administrative Service, one gets selected by clearing UPSC which is the most difficult, competitive and coveted exam in India) Name : Awanish Sharan 10th : 44.5% 12th : 65% Graduation : 60.7% In this 21st century, there are hell lot of opportunities across all the fields and there are highly successful personalities irrespective of the scores/grades achieved by them. Every single area is developing in leaps and bounds. What's needed is the patience, perseverance and guidance in the right direction. Before all these, there's an alarming need to shape the kids mentally strong enough to handle the peer pressure and to face any situation in life right from their schooling. Both family and educational institutions have to take a foot forward and be responsible in this regard.

I would like to emphasize the practical aspects in two ways. Sharmaji, residing by the neighbouring society has a son who excels academics, extra curricular . He is appreciated by any tom, dick or harry around him. And why not? He is making his parents proud. Unfortunately, you are not fortuante enough to experience that proudly feeling from your child. But honestly, this happiness or sorrow may or may not be permanent. Your not so bright child may turn out to be more successful than the prior one. This does not mean that either of them got transformed into different personalities leading them to that stage. Maybe the child was not so bright, but he worked harder, had better focus. What mattered to him are the longtime outcomes of his deeds and not the temporary \"good feelings\" from good grades. The child must be encouraged, not pressurised. Encouraged to have better goals, and something most important to be learnt \" Grades wouldn't define his future but he himself\". Maybe the child has particular interests which have been sidelined owing to some wasteful subjects taught in the Indian curriculum. \" the long time focus should be the priority\" .

Now, if that particular part where you fail is of utmost importance or probably plays in a big role in what you are trying to do, it can be a mess!

Not your CGPAThe chances of you succeding in the company would depend on your technical and inter personal skill .

He was placed though in the same company I was placed but he chose to move to a different company suiting his passion and he is happy now with his work.Grades help you in case you need to go with your higher studies yet scoring in those entrance exams are worth more than your grades. My suggestion to anyone who studies would be to study to gain knowledge but not study to get good grades. Success doesn't depend on grades. We have plenty of examples for that. ",

But what they are missing out is that for every such single story, there are countless who didnt make it to that success list. What grades show to a person who is evaluating you is that given a particular task did you do well in it whether you liked that task or not. When you entered into the world of education especially post the age of 15 (Std Xth I assume) the choice was yours (though in Indian families many a time that choice is thrust onto you). But having gotten into that position could you be sincere about it, put your head down, not got distracted and achieved something remarkable? If yes, then the evaluator has a high amount of confidence that the person he is selecting is likely to do well in the field into which he is being recruited into. The onus is also on the evaluator to select highly accomplished individuals who are likely to succeed because that would dete4mine the evaluators success too. Remember you can only reject what you have been selected for. You cannot reject things/jobs/institute/partners who never selected you. ",

If you want to pursue higher level degrees and be more involved in the theory and\\or research of a particular subject then yea it \"can\" matter. Most of the time it won't matter. In the real world what matters is \"what you can get done\" which translate into skills. GPA doesn't reflect skill, at best it represents work ethic and aptitude. Those are valuable skills but can be achieved in other, more practical, ways that  translate into skills. Finish school if you can and get a good GPA, but don't kill yourself worrying about the difference between a 3.7 and a 4.0. ",

If you get a couple low grades in classes irrelevant to your major, it\u2019s not a huge deal. I mean, you should always try to do well, but say you are a math major with a 3.8 GPA and you get a C in Art History 101, it\u2019s not as big of a deal as getting a C in a course required for your major. Likewise, if you are an art major with straight A\u2019s, but get a C in a math class, it\u2019s not as concerning as getting a C in a course directly related to your major. My advice is to take all of your classes seriously. If you notice your grades are slipping, try to pinpoint the reason and address it. ",

There are exceptions to this, notably academia and (in some places) law. But if for you making it big is making it big in business? Probably noone is ever going to ask you your grades after your 1st job. Actor? You are not expected to HAVE grades.

As their cutoff is based on percentage or cgpa obtained in class X, this is a necessity.I guess cutoff for my school was, 10 CGPA that too not upgraded grade.When you are done with higher secondary and searching for a university for undergrad, universities like DU set cutoff as high as 98-99 percentage.Now done with your graduation, you are looking for a good post graduation course. You thought of doing MBA. You opened up the selection criteria of an IIM, you were shocked to see that academics weightage is almost equal to CAT weight.Move forward, now you are in an IIM, into your summer placement. The eligibility criteria for the first company is \u201cmore than 80% in class XII, graduation\u201d.In final placement, many companies use GPA as a criterion to shortlist your resume.Decide for yourself, what role grades play! PS: you might say that it is important in the specific career path that I have mentioned, but somehow it impacts our lives. ",

On the first day of placement session at his institute, he sat for an interview with a top-tier management consulting firm which had shortlisted him. Interviewer: Why do you want to join us? You may get a better offer at a technical firm. Candidate: I feel interested in management consulting at the moment. Also, I don\u2019t like engineering much. I: How come you have such a high GPA, then? And the way you didn\u2019t like engineering after joining it, what if you don\u2019t like our company after you join us? C: When I joined IIT-X, my aim was to learn engineering. I didn\u2019t know if I would like it beforehand. And when I was in, irrespective of my interest, I studied as well as I could, and I did well throughout. If today I join your firm, even if I don\u2019t end up liking it, my performance would be the same way - It would be the very best! The interview ended shortly after. (Verdict: Selected) Grades usually do not depict intelligence, ability or interest. These are typically symbolic of one's mindset towards what you're designed to do. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like some thing, change it out. In the event that you can\u2019t change it, change your attitude\u201d And yes, Grades matter! ",

            "answer_text": "Let me answer this question from the perspective of a 7 pointer. During our freshmen orientation one of our professors told us that CGPA was not a measure of the smartness of a student but a measure of his consistency and hardwork in academics. I have seen students who scored well below me in the college admission tests get a 9+ CGPA because they were determined to make the most of their education. I failed to get many internship, scholarship, job and many other opportunities because I did not maintain a good CGPA. I used to think, what do those 9/8 pointers have that I didn't\u2026 In my view, CGPA is used my many professors, companies, universities to shortlist students as it gives them the confidence that the person they recruit can work hard at learning new things (even if it bores them), solve and overcome challenges and also will be consistent in his work ethic. So, even though you don't quite like your current college major, aim to get a good CGPA because it's the only certified scale on how well you have used your education to benefit yourself. Otherwise it's a question of why did you choose this as your major in the first place which is another question for another time. ",

Because if you are looking for campus recruitment certainly to filter out students most of companies choose CGPA as filtering criteria so far as i observed. If you preparing for Post graduation in any of the cool IITs and other prestigious institutions in India they also call for interview based on overall CGPA of UG programme. Now the answer for no means that if you think if you think that if you are among top performers in the college then a big giant company like Google, Microsoft etc is looking for you then you are completely wrong .I know academics subjects are of no worth to study as far as education system in India is concerned, but you have to compromise.

If you are applying for jobs, most of the companies have a cut-off marks. So, you need that minimum GPA to qualify for that company. Once you are in the interview room, your GPA does not matter very much. There is a saying that if you are not good at something, hide that with something in which you are a master. Same thing applies here too. You put emphasis on your experiences, projects, extracurricular activities etc., to get the attention.On the other hand, if you want to be successful in life, your GPA does not matter at all. This are some numbers and number changes with time, with perspective and field of your interests. So, don't worry about GPA, keep faith in yourself and you will realize life is not very hard nut to crack. ",

Let's start with schooling, government schools it's ok but in many Private schools even to start education you need to pass there examination.!(I really never understood why.?) Now comes a decision in school itself after 10th, 60\u201365% above Science then Commerce and Arts. There are very few who even after scoring more chooses other than Science. Now College, either entrance examination or institution examination in both 10th and 12th marks is having a weigtage in the selection process. Campus selection:- MNC's make three division 70% above 65% and above and then 60% and above.(Grades again) Government Jobs:- Sit for the Entrance Examination again where again your Grades will decide whether you will make it or not. Further Studies:- Go through the college point again.! P.S- If you are not able to clear IIT or NIT there is a difference right there which MNC's make in providing salary package,no matter how good you are. ",
