The basic necessary of the education is to think oneself at their own to take the right decision at right time without the help of others. Education helps a person to be independent. Education gives us the Knowledge, Power, Confidence and decision making skills. A practical example of need for education: In my school days a guy used to sell the ice cream in the cart wheel out side my school.

            "answer_text": "Your question needs to be worded more clearly in order to get a solid answer. This really depends on someone\u2019s personal opinion as to what the purpose of education is. Some people believe education exists for the purpose of preparing young people for the workforce. Others believe education prepares everyone to be a good citizen. Personally, I believe that education should give you some basic tools that you need in order to be a productive adult: the ability to weigh the credibility of information, critical thinking skills needed to question an assumption before accepting it as fact, how to do research and learn new information and skills, etc. For any of these answers, education is something needed by EVERYONE in order to be a productive member of society.
