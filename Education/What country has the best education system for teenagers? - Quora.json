            "answer_text": "The US has the best system, I say with obvious bias. Despite all the reports and studies listing the US educational system poorly compared to other educational systems, the US still produces their share of outstanding graduates. Education systems have their faults and are slow to adapt, but they work. The US have an enormous variety of educational systems that apply varying educational philosophies with some more effective than others. Each school system continues to adapt to accommodate the ever changing population that attends their schools. The US has tradition high schools, vocational schools, magnet schools, specialized charter schools, online schools, correspondence schools, home schooling, and more. Additionally, many schools allow for open enrollment where students can attend any of a variety of schools in different locations. Each culture around the world help formulate the school systems and set the priorities for the students in order for them to be productive citizens. In the US, the citizens local school districts, with guidance from the State and Federal governments, set the parameters for what education is necessary and how to present it. My hope is that citizens from other countries will have the same answer as I have except they will be talking about their country\u2019s educational system. Each country (educational entity) attempts to set the best system that provides for their citizens based on what is important to them. ",
