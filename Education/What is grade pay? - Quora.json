            "answer_text": "In the 6 cpc the concept of grade pay was introduced by central government. While condensing so many cadres in the group A, B, C and D the commission introduced grade pay for the respective cadres. While fixing pay the element of grade pay is also reckoned. In the condensed cadre system due to duties and responsibilities devolved on a cadre there was difference in the grade pay component. But For this slight difference the minimum and maximum of the time scale remains the same. Obviously there are anamolies amongst juniors and seniors as latter in some cases get lesser pay than their juniors. Also in the lower cadre some juniors get higher salary than seniors in the higher cadre. This is applicable to pensioners also. Anamoly committee has to look into this early as 7 cpc has come. ",
