            "answer_text": "Challenger is absolutely the worst possible decision anyone could make for their children. I speak from experience as a parent of 2 children who went through the grind and as someone who has had the inside look as well (not going to specify how). The answer before this states that it depends on your kid, well, not in this case. Challenger subjects children to reformatory practices that brake them and shape them by telling them how and what to think. So, no! It is not up to the child. The students are labeled and watched without the parents knowing. They have a code system for the slow and failing students and the preference goes to one or two children in the class. Favoritism is rampant. The school under the founder Barbara Baker had ideals and a mission that was honorable. I have met Barbara on several occasions and I have had the opportunity to travel with her and hear her vision. The lady was nothing but a brilliant educator and a visionary. Her school was once (15 years ago) an elite institution, and the teachers were happy, and the students were above the norm smart and successful. Once the founder passed away, the military leader who became a Director of Operations (about 8 years ago, you can look her up she is a West Point graduate with standoffish behavior) took over and destroyed the students and the teachers\u2019 spirits. At the top, there is manipulation and brainwashing that trickles down to the staff and students. Teachers come and go every year, many leaving in the middle of the year, causing the directors to run around like crazy teaching in the classrooms, exhausted and inefficient. Most parents have no idea because they are immigrants from India, they work long hours, have no time for their children, and have no idea what goes on; besides, they like the military rigor because they think it is like the schools where they come from; but they have no idea what that kind of structure does to their children. Students are aggressive and will care little for morals and decency if they can get ahead. It is the only school where you will see absolute callousness and disregard for students, and where students will cheat, and lie to get ahead. For science fairs, most projects are done by the parents and there is a whole lot of other problems going on. The Regional Director is a Mormon who has been there for many years, but scared of being let go, he talks from both sides of his mouth and cannot be trusted, and this, in turn, makes students follow the same example. I have seen some of the scariest cases of vandalism, larceny, teacher-student inappropriate relationships, student-student inappropriate relationships all get shoved undercover just to pretend all is well. Again, my children did well, because I was vigilant, and because most of what they learned in school, I had already covered with them at home, but until today, when we have a get-together with former friends from the school, I hear them recollect some awful memories, and the scars are never going to become smaller. Stay away! There are many schools out there. Unless you can\u2019t afford any other private school; Challenger is cheap in every way, as they provide nothing for the money. Most of their teachers are not qualified to teach by any standard and the curriculum, although seemingly advanced, does not promote thinking but mostly cramming and fear since there is no permanent teacher that can stay and teach.

            "answer_text": "It depends on your kid, not the school. I have 2 kids in there, one is self-reliant, well spoken, critically thinking \u2026, one is not. He still hang in there. But it is a good school ( good enough that you got an answer from a Challenger parents with 2 kids :) ) And the price is high but not that high in Bay Area. I think your kid might get a better education if you send them to Hacker. ",
