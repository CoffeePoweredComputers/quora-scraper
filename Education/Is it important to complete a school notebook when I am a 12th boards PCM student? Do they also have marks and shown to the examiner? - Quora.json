This will also reduce your burden in case you have to show note book to your teacher. Well, it\u2019s not like that the examiner check your school notebook. They check your practical files and your knowledge as well through Viva. Learn more and give your time so that you could get the best marks as these marks of Viva/ Practical help in increasing your percentage. Best of Luck! Hope, it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I just say no, because 70 marks are obtained from main paper and rest 30 from practical.There is no need to submit notebook but I can say it very clearly it depends on school also that how they give internal assessment marks i.e 30 or 20 as per subject only on practical or also on notebook. So I suggest you should confirm it from your school. ",
