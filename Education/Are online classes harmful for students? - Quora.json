            "answer_text": "The online classes are the only alternative left for the continuation of education during this pandemic. However, the constant use of electronic gadgets has created a concern about the harms of the continuous use of these tools. Since, the use of this technology cannot be abandoned, it becomes our duty to ensure that we take precautions to prevent ourselves from getting harmed. Among this, the universities are ensuring by several measures that even though the education is being continued, the students do not get harmed by this. Once such example of this approach is being introduced by Graphic Era University, wherein only a fixed amount of time is being spent by the students on the electronic devices. Even though the approach is online, they are made to take assignments and notes in the form of hard copy, ensuring that the lectures are not being missed and the students do not suffer either in studies or physically. Therefore, the harm can thus be lessened by taking preventive measures in this time of pandemic. ",

            "answer_text": "Today, online classes are going on everywhere. It is because considering today\u2019s situation, online classes are the only solution. But online classes have certain drawbacks that are harmful to students like: It affects their eyes and leads to frequent headaches.It increases their dependency on gadgets like smartphones and laptops.They become lazy as they do not do any physical activity.But online classes provide guidance to students. Without these classes, students will start neglecting studies and will waste their time. Due to these classes, they have a particular schedule to follow like waking up early and taking their meals timely. In my view, online classes should be conducted but in a way that students can get time to play and can do fun activities. The duration of the classes should not be too long and the learning should be made fun. ",
