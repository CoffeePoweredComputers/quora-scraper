            "answer_text": "HI. Let\u2019s distinguish between the \u201cstudy\u201d of medicine and the \u201cpractice\u201d of medicine. You can \u201cstudy\u201d medicine at home. You can \u201cstudy\u201d medicine as a volunteer at a hospital. You can \u201cstudy\u201d medicine at any variety of clinics. However, to \u201cpractice\u201d medicine, to be a doctor, is something different. This requires long years of study resulting in a government-issued certificate after extensive testing. This means paying tuition for up to 8 years. It\u2019s an expensive commitment. But I would suggest that if you do not go that route, if you try to cut corners by attending some institution that offers a half-baked useless piece of paper as a certificate, then you are doing yourself and your patients a great injustice. There is an attitude problem here. Why not try to get into the absolute best medical college available to you? You can explore scholarships. You can ask for help from family. You can work part-time. It can be done if you have the energy and perseverance to do it. You owe this to yourself and your patients to get the absolute best education you can. Lives depend on it. Get busy!! ",
