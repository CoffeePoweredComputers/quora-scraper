            "answer_text": "The importance of special education is to provide equal access to education through a specially designed instruction. The goal is to provide a student with a path to independent living further education, employment, and independent living. It is a not place where students with disabilities are sent because they cannot be in the general education classrooms. Here is what special education is not:1. A place where a child with a disability is lucky enough to maybe live in a group home or get a job. We wouldn\u2019t put such limitation on neurotypical children, we need to not stifle children with disabilities in the same way. 2. A place for hands-on learning or a place where a student is sent because a student learns differently. Students should be accommodated in the way in which they learn best versus being placed in a different environment because a teacher can\u2019t, won\u2019t, or doesn\u2019t know how to teach them. 3. A place where children with certain IQ\u2019s go to exist. It is where a child received individualized instruction based on his or her unique needs. The important is the guide that student to a place where they receive more than de minimis of education, but meaningfully participate alongside, to the fullest extend possible, alongside their neurotypical peers, in the least restrictive environment.

            "answer_text": "What is special education?  Special education is meant for those students who are mentally, physically, emotionally handicapped or have a learning disability. They are at a learning disadvantage from the general population of students. For them to get their education, they need additional time and extra help to get them even close to where their peers may be functioning. In other words, we need to level the playing field! There can be students who are in self contained classes who have IQs from 0 to 70, called Severe- Profound; Moderate then Mild Mentally Handicapped. They are taught life skills. The lower level ability students will end up in group homes. The higher level ones may end up either in group homes or their own apartments with jobs. Students who are deaf, blind or in wheelchairs can and do get jobs and can live in group homes or apartments after high school. Students who have a learning disability or have emotional problems can do all kinds of things, based on the degree and severity of their problems and support they get. Some do go to and graduate from college. In addition to having these handicapping conditions, sometimes, but not always they might also have ADD or Social Anxiety Disorder or Depression or Health issues such as Asthma. Regardless of what a special education student\u2019s handicap, they represent about 10% of our school\u2019s population and they are our students and they bring with them joy, humor, love, intelligence, spirit, creativity and brotherhood! I am so very proud and privileged to have served them for over four decades! ",
