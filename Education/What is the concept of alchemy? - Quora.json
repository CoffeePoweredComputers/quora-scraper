            "answer_text": "There are two main goals to alchemy. The first goal is to find the fifth element, also know as the phylosophers stone. With philosophers stone one can turn lead into gold, and become rich. But furthermore, you can turn plain into noble. The second goal is to find the elixir of life, which can turn old into young and provide immortality. Some say one time is sufficient, others would say it has to be taken on a regular basis. It is also said that the phylosophers stone is required in order to prepare the elixir of life. But beyond riches and immortality, the real goal of the alchemist, or the goal of a true alchemist, is knowledge, to unlock the secrets of the material world and the secret of life. Of course in the alchemy golden era, knowledge is a secret, not to be abused by the wrong people who are not capable to use it beneficially. But in modern era, knowledge became available to anyone who seeks it. But people are too lazy. In a sense alchemy and modern science and technology have common goals with alchemy and magic. To seek for knowledge and truth for the benefit of mankind. ",
