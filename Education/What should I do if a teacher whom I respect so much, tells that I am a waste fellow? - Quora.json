            "answer_text": "Let your success be your answer to your critics. Our teachers play an important part in our development. Respect them, for they can guide you on to the path of a good life, as far as your conduct and your education is concerned. Criticism is of two kind and so is encouragement. Negative or positive. If a teacher says \" you are a waste fellow\", then I think he is trying to get you to improve upon your behaviour or your personality.  Ask your teacher what is the reason behind that opinion. I am sure she or he will comply and answer you. Have an open-view, so that you do not filter anything. There might be some point that may help improve you. Maybe she or he has analysed something that she or he thinks is related to your behaviour. Discuss this with the teacher. Never ever raise your voice, even if you are right. Be calm, but be firm when you state your side of the argument or your opinion. It helps in the long run. Hope this helps!!! ",

            "answer_text": "You should approach him/her, ask them for an appointment as you need to discuss something about your career. Be very punctual for the decided time. Tell them first hand, that you respect them, and the fact that they believe you're a waste, bothers you. Ask them what you can do to change that, in a way, that it's good for your career as well. This should melt them. But, in order to have their faith, you should follow their advice. P.S. - Please avoid asking me a question being anonymous. I normally don't reply to anonymous questions until and unless the query tempts me to answer. ",
