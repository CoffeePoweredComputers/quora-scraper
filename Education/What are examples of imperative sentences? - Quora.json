            "answer_text": "What is an imperative sentence? The following article defines and demonstrates the use of imperative sentences: Imperative Sentence: Definition & Examples http://study.com/academy/lesson/imperative-sentence-definition-examples.html Imperative sentences are requests, suggestions, advice, or commands. Imperative sentences often appear to be missing subjects and use a verb to begin the sentence. In fact, the subject is the person listening, or the audience. In other words, if an imperative sentence is directed at you, then you are the subject of that sentence. The affirmative encourages an action or directs that something happen. The following sentences are positive imperative sentences, indicating that something should happen or is desired: Enjoy some fresh strawberries.Give me a few weeks to make up my mind.Feel free to text me later.The following sentences are still imperative sentences, but they are negative instead, indicating that something should not happen or is not desired. Don't eat my strawberries.Don't wait for my answer.Don't text me.",

            "answer_text": "An imperative sentence is known colloquially as a \"command\" and has a particular form in English ( as well as in other languages--EX. In Spanish, the form of the verb itself changes:  sentir (to sit) becomes \"sienta\" in the singularand \"sientan\" in the plural.) In English, the most prominent feature of an imperative sentence is that it does not have a written or spoken subject as the other kinds (declarative, interrogative and exclamatory) do.  A  imperative  an be one word- \"Try.\"  or a verb phrase - \"Sit down\" or a  complete idea with many words - \"Put the papers over there and stack the  neatly.\"  An imperative can be punctjated with a period (Please be quiet.) or with an excla ation point (Be quiet!), which some teachers  may call an exclamation.  Orally  the volume and tone of an imperative give adequate information to the listener for him/her/th em to understand the importance of the command. ",
