            "answer_text": "There are two canteens in the hospital building, both located on the ground floor. First one is the old one which has limited basic options like samosa, chai, poha, idli etc. Even though their are less options available, taste is fine and they serve quickly. Some branded snacks and drinks are available too. Second canteen is recently established and being managed by RDA Aiims Bhopal. This canteen has slightly more options available and quality is also better but they might take a bit longer time to serve. There is no other canteen in the campus or college building. ",

Now we have a canteen in hospital building which doesn't even seem like a canteen. There are limited number of items. Whenever you go, you'll feel like they are broke and about to close. The samosa is, however, good and chai is ok-ok. The mess of boy's hostel runs a night canteen from 11pm-3am. They make a variety of food items, from tea, maggi to chicken chees sandwich and wraps. However, they do not open everyday. ",
