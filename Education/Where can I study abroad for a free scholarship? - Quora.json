            "answer_text": "All one requires is selecting a suitable study destination, a competent course to pursue, resort to tedious research in order to avail 100% scholarship. Some courses even provide 100% free accommodation costs with additional stipend. There are different consultancies offering you this service but I would recommend you to stick to AbroEduShip. It is unlike other education consultancies as its primary aim is providing scholarships. It is the first consultancy in India to be started by the scholarship students themselves. They provide individual improvement sessions to help one gain the scholarship spot. From starting the application process to building SOP, LORs, scholarships, giving visa-airfare assistance, abroad job help and a lot more. They provide a hassle-free experience and one-on-one consultancy to the students. Other consultancies do not focus on getting 100% tuition scholarship,free accomodation and additional stipends but AbroEduShip does. They also provide assistance on airfare or visa services (in addition, they put efforts to make the charges free). For further details check out my profile.The link has been given. ",
