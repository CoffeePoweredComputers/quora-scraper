            "answer_text": "That depends on whether you mean which Ivy League school has the best business school -- and the answer to that is Harvard for its connections or Penn (Wharton) for its intellectual depth. If you're talking undergraduate, the simple answer is \"Whichever one you can get into\". Aside from Penn, none of them have undergraduate business curricula, but good records from any of them in almost any field would qualify you for serious consideration at any of the top ten business schools in the country, and the odds against getting in to any of them are so fierce these days that you'll be very lucky if you get admitted to one, much less more than one requiring a choice.
