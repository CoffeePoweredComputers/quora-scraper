            "answer_text": "Generally current or former teachers or university academics. However the production of school textbooks is a competitive market today, requiring not just correct text but design and careful tuning to the examinations. Thus they are generally a group effort with skilled editors, educators and artists. In some cases the nominal author is a known expert (often recently retired) who is asked to write the text according to a perceived market opportunity. In other cases a teacher makes an offer of a text to a publisher, and this is developed into a product. New changes in exam syllabuses provide a lucrative market where schools and/or pupils have to buy something to fit the new assessment. In the UK there is generally an arrangement between the exam board and a publisher to ensure the availability at the right time, plus a marketing campaign to schools. There are of course textbooks which are published, but not taken up, except at the school where the teacher works. ",

            "answer_text": "I can't say I'm too familiar with university textbooks, but I would assume they are written by academics, professors, researchers, and other individuals who are involved in universities. I would hazard a guess and say the majority of university textbook authors have either professional or doctoral degrees. However, in certain fields where doctoral degrees are not as common or not needed as much, professionals that work in the field may also write textbooks. ",
