Because at the end of all the studies what matters the most is how much you have learnt and what you know in a particular stream. Also it depends on your aim, if your aiming to get a government job then also it's ok because nowadays it's asking more than 60% aggregate. If you are aiming at any particular private firms then don't worry buddy you just need talent and a firm attitude to get in. This is a competitive world and these marks won't affect much also lower marks than this might not fetch you anything, so look forward and pursue your education properly and make sure you won't go below 80% in future\u2026 happy studying..
