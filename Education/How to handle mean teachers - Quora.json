            "answer_text": "You don't have to. I never did. Let me share with you my experiences: I used to have a horrible teacher in high school. At first, she was really nice, and everyone agreed that she was the coolest teacher. She that talked about her Michael Kors \"jeans\" instead of genes. She talked about hamsters instead of the circulatory system. I probably learned more about her mother than about science. But she was never rude or anything to anyone. Then the second semester of school began. It started with a small incident where we were supposed to turn in an assignment with an article, and I accidentally detached the article from my assignment and turned in only my article. I was marked for plagiarism and she talked to me about not plagiarizing. I pleaded to her that I had my assignment as well and showed it to her and she still marked me for plagiarism. After that, I would be singled out for talking too much in class (which was a HUGE problem for me) and other little things. My friends from other classes claimed that she talked about me in their classes. But it wasn't too bad... Until I got her husband in the next schoolyear. He obviously heard all the news about this obnoxious girl and I was unlucky enough to have him as a teacher. In fact, he was the only possible teacher for me. I was never disrespectful to him, but whenever I'd have or answer a question, he would never pick on me. Throughout the whole school year. When we had labs, he would always tease me in front of the whole class. He would single me out and announce to the whole class which boys I was staring at, coincidentally or not. He was incredibly rude to people who had questions and would always boast about himself. When I saw him in the hallways and I was talking with friends, he would pester me. He tried to make my life difficult in any way possible whenever he got the chance.  One day, before class started, one of my friends took my pencil pouch. I took it back from him and placed his binder on a nearby cabinet. Class soon started, and he still hadn't found his binder. I hadn't realized this, but my teacher did. He asked my friend where was his binder, and he replied that he didn't know where it was. But very quickly, my friend spotted it and reclaimed it. My teacher asked the class: \"Who did hid his binder? We're not going to do anything until someone fesses up. Understand?\" How unlucky could I be! I had to consider over and over again to take the credit or not, but I did. I raised my hand, and he sent me outside of the classroom, and I wasn't to return. I was labelled as a troublemaker. He would continue to call me out all the time. There were many other incidents involving him, even outside his class. I hated the class, though I had the most friends in it. And there was nothing I could do to report him. The school itself was in such a dilemma that most of the academic teams relied on him. No one would listen to me anyways. I never got a chance to leave him until I graduated. I could also thank these two teachers for motivating me to teach others.   I hope you know that not all mean teachers are actually mean. They could be placed in a difficult position in their life or career that could cause them to not be able to enjoy teaching. No matter what you do, always respect your teachers. If it bothers you, you could try talking to them and ask why you feel that they are treating you harshly or different from others.  Worst comes to worst, you'll get used to it after a while; I know I did. Hopefully it'll only last a year for you. ",

            "answer_text": "I look in the mirror, scowl, point at myself, and say, \"STOP THAT!\" Sometimes I smack myself on the nose with a rolled up magazine if I have one on hand.  But in all seriousness, there are some teachers out there who are mean. Some are mean for no reason. Your choices? Keep your head down and do your work. Don't get noticed.Transfer to another class. If that is even possible.Figure out why the teacher is mean (there may be a reason), and don't set them off.Truth be told, these aren't terribly imaginative answers, but think about this:Ever given a presentation? I have. I give a presentation almost every school day for about 5 hours. Sometimes I get grumpy. Teachers are people. We do this job for different reasons. Some are good, others not so much. Just try to keep that in mind. Here's a story:When I was in 6th grade, I was sitting in band class. The teacher was an older guy. Well... Just old. My mother had him as a teacher some 30 years or so before. He wasn't terribly friendly or nice. One day, he got almost irrationally angry at a clarinet player for talking. It was one of those classic moments where the teacher asks if she thought she could teach the class any better. Then he slammed his baton down and stormed out. He never came back. It turned out that he had terminal cancer (if I recall correctly\u2014it has been almost 30 years, so I don't remember all of the details).   My point? A mean teacher could just be mean but might also be working through personal problems. That isn't an excuse, mind you. I guess what I'm saying is that I wish I could tell that band teacher that I'd enjoyed his class and that he'd done a great job, even though I didn't know the version of him who was likely a lot nicer when my mother had taken his class.
