            "answer_text": "Too late? I do not think so. A little late? Yes. However, there are some things worth considering. Financially, how are you going to finance your study? Are you currently in student debt from your first degree? Is there going to be any help from your parents? Are you working full time or part time to pay for the tuition fee? Age wise, you\u2019ll need to take this into consideration also. Ask yourself, can you finish it on time? This will hold your independence for another four years; that is only if you can finish it on time. Can you reduce that time? Do you have credits from your previous degree that you can transfer to your new school? You\u2019ll need to ask the admission department of your new school. If you can transfer credit, you can save one until two years in your new school. Major save on time and money. Think about this also. Do you really need the new bachelor degree? Don\u2019t you think it is not better to take a master\u2019s degree instead? Only proceed if you have a strong reason. If you are going to take the degree anyway, read a little bit more. What I want to say to you is that, you will be six years or seven years older than your peers. You will find some of your lecturers and instructors are at your age range. You will see that some of your friends in high school will be already married, have kids, get high paying job, get promotion, etc., while you are still learning. Although it is possible for you to work part time or full time at the same time. What I want to say is that if you compare to your life with other people, it will just be a pressure. This can cause stress. You need to keep in mind that each person\u2019s path is not the same. Say to yourself that it is your life\u2019s path and for the moment you are going to be take the different route than those in your age group. Instead of thinking those kind of things, focus on your study. As soon as you gain some skills, look for internship or jobs on areas you interested in. Build good resume, get to know some people in the area, join hackatons, tech meetups, create software, get involve in open source projects, freelance and others. The more you gain knowledge, networking, and experience the more you are going to be confident than you were few years back. Personally, I take my second degree in computer science at the age of 23. I can say that I kept wondering whether I was too old and whether this was a bad decision. That put pressure on me. Even worse, it affected my concentration. It took time to let go of the feeling. Though I don\u2019t regret it now, your mileage may vary. Good luck and stay positive. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not at all. Most of us naturally think a college career goes from age 18\u201322, but that's really just one of many common paths. Some folks go straight to the workplace for any number of good reasons. Some serve their country. Some travel. Some, like me, try in vain to be a rock star and just aren't ready for the rigor of college. Or for stardom. I went back to school at 31 and got my B.S. at 33 while working and raising two young children with a very patient wife. Not only was it possible, it was the best professional decision I've ever made and has paid many dividends over the years. I'm seriously evaluating starting grad program later this year, at the ripe age of 44. I like the answers others have written, and will paraphrase one of them: next year you'll be 24. The year after that, 25. The year after that, 26. You can choose to be these ages with or without a degree. You only get one life, my friend. I suspect you'll regret not going for the degree much more than you'll regret the tough challenge of school a few years late. Good luck to you! ",
