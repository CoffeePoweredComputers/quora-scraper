            "answer_text": "Rather than focusing on quick profit, your focus should be on long term wealth creation with diversification across various asset classes Here\u2019s how you can allocate the portfolio for this 30 Lakhs with sufficient diversification. Indian Equity Multicap Funds : 9 Lacs (Lumpsum)Most top performing Multicap funds currently have a portfolio that\u2019s significantly skewed towards Large cap funds, which is understandable and is geared towards capturing the maximum possible upside of the rally in equity markets that was on till Jan 2020, which was largely concentrated to large caps. However fund managers of Multicap funds are typically much better positioned than most of us to sense as to when a turnaround in the Mid and Smallcap space is likely to kick-in, and the mandate of these funds allows them to accordingly skew the allocation in favor of Mid and Small caps as and when they sense such a turnaround is imminent. A Largecap focused fund however will NOT be able to skew allocation towards Mid/Small caps too much as and when a turnaround in the Mid/Small space finally materialises, since they have to, by regulation maintain at least 80% exposure to Large caps at all times. On the other hand, Mid and Smallcap focused funds have to, by regulation invest at least 65% of their assets in Mid and Smallcaps stocks at all times, and that could mean that these funds will continue to underperform till a material turnaround in this space actually materialises. Hence a Multicap focused fund selection approach arguably makes the most sense at this stage. US Equity: 3 Lacs (Lumpsum)US Large cap funds in general and technology oriented funds in particular have been one of the best performing asset class in the world over the last 10+ years. This is a category that includes such iconic names as Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Facebook and their likes. US Equity as an asset class in my view serves another very important purpose for Indian investors - at a time when the rupee is, and is likely to continue losing value against the US dollar, exposure to US dollar denominated assets serves as a very powerful hedge against the continued depreciation of the Indian rupee. So as the Indian rupee continues to fall against the USD, the value of an investor\u2019s US stock holdings in INR terms goes up even more. Gold: 3 Lacs (Lumpsum)As the world looks for safe havens to hide in the middle of this pandemic, and as the largest economies in the world seek to borrow record sums to stimulate their economies out of this crisis and in the process further add to their already unsustainable debt piles, the one asset which will unmistakably benefit disproportionately is \u2013 GOLD! Gold has already done quite well in the last one year or so as economic conditions started to deteriorate even before the onset of the ongoing correction in equity markets, and the current macro situation augurs very well for Gold to continue doing very well going forward. Fixed Deposits: 5 LacsPassive income Plan: 10 Lacs (get an income of 10k per month)This portfolio offers a 3 fold benefit of capital protection, passive income generation and long term wealth growth.

Here are a few things you can do: If you have a house loan (or any other debt), you can prepay it with this money If you have children whose higher education expenses have not been planned, you can use it for their education If you have a business plan or have always wanted to do business, now would be a good time to start. You can put the money in a liquid mutual fund for the interim period If you are reasonably affluent and this is extra money, you can take that dream vacation to Australia/Europe/AlaskaIf you can't think of anything and would like to spend the money a few years later, invest it wisely in a mix of debt and equity Here are a few things that you should not do: Put it all in the stock market Buy a lot of gold Put it all in an FDBuy a house bigger than you needGive it all away to charity Tell your children that their future is taken care of because you have 35 Lacs Buy an expensive car Spend it on expensive electronic gadgets that you'll never use (that 72\" UHD Curved LED TV looks awesome and sounds surreal with the Bang & Olufsen 5.1, but is the entertainment worth 10 lacs?)On the other hand, if you could mix and match the above, a little bit of each, you'd have utilised the money well.

Keep anything lower than 10%,  debt is not bad especially if it is a EMI on a house. 2. Real estate: This could be either a great idea or downright scary (think real estate mafia). I would suggest rather than buying a plot or flat, invest in big firms (DLF, Lodha) etc 3. Precious metals not necessarily gold. There are metals which have outperformed gold (for example silver is expected to outperform gold) 4. Blue chip stocks, imagine very companies which do not give double every year. Put it in big stocks, but diversify here as well .DO NOT put in Mutual Funds you pay fee for NOTHING. Buy stocks, pick one big company from healthcare, energy, fmcg, financial and heavy manufacturing. 5. Last but not least if you have a senior in your household like father ot mother above 60, ask them to deposit some money in FD in their name with you as a beneficiary, safe and sound. 6. Some liquid cash to cover the rainy day in short term FD. I would not want to invest in either a plot or flat especially in India unless and until I can keep an eye on it. Most importantly do not let greed get the better of you and put the money in some chit funds or get rich quick scheme, be wise and patient! Good luck ",

Keep 6 months salary in liquid cash in short term FD for emergency use. Invest few lakhs in gold. Gold rates have gone up over the past 50 years! Invest few lakhs in mutual funds and/or shares of blue chip companies. Don't go by rumors or hearsay. Invest in ever green companies like Colgate etc., whose sales will never decrease! Invest few lakhs in a plot if you can find one! And forget about it for at least a decade. Or if you can find a small shop buy it and give it on rent. You keep getting regular income by way of rent and its resale value will keep on increasing over time. I personally don't advise insurance policies!! And if you happen to have any loans and/or credit card outstandings clear all of them totally. Try to live an EMI free life! ",

The important things that a planner should cover are as below: a) Emergency Fund b) Insurance Requirement c) Financial Goals  Once you have done this it will be easy to figure out what you should be doing  with the money. Any other way of investing this money will be incomplete and may or may not solve for your requirements.  Since you are possibly handling such a large sum for the first time, it would also be good to go slow on the whole process of investing.  Hope this helps. I could only suggest this much, given the information. Like I said its best that you meet a professional planner to get your investments / insurance sorted.  ",

Whether you are driving on the road or sitting in a park or sitting in the comfort of your living room, you are always at some sort of risk. You have not mentioned the time frame of your investment here. If it is for the next 10 years, I would invest 50% of it in good quality stocks (portfolio of stocks) and then rest 50% in Arbitrage funds which are low risk equity funds and can give returns from 6\u20139% per year. Your Arbitrage funds will be completely tax free after one year (at this time of writing) and you can either let it grow or do an SWP as a monthly income. Now how and when to invest in quality stocks is a big question and cannot be answered here. You have to invest wisely by picking up fundamentally strong stocks and get out of it when in good profit (if done in short term). Otherwise you can invest in some giants like HDFC, TCS, Maruti, Asian Paints and hold on to it for longer time. Hope my answer helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey. Your investment will depend on your investment goal. As you have stated risk free Investing that implies that your goal is Capital Protection, I would like to inform you that every investment has some degree of risk. Even bank FDs and Govt of India Bonds have minute risk but risk still exists.  For \"almost\" risk free investing go for Bank FD or Debt Mutual finds investing in only Government Bonds.  All other assets like Private bonds are a bit more risky, next is large cap equity and followed by medium cap and small cap stocks. So your options are limited to only debt instruments like: 1) Bank FD 2) GOI Bonds Through Mutual fund 3) Post office deposit. 4) Private company bonds (More risky than all above options but relatively less risky) ",
