            "answer_text": "Depends on the assessment. If the assessment required you to participate in something during the time you were absent, then yes. You might also recieve a lower mark if the assignment was due at the start of the lesson and you were late to class, thus handing it in late. Otherwise \u2026 i can not think of a reason to lower your assignment mark. ",

            "answer_text": "Possibly. In order to find out, you\u2019ll need to consult the school administration\u2026the principal\u2019s office. The best way to do that is to have one of your parents call anonymously, mentioning that he/she has a child at the school, and asking whether chronic lateness can be used to penalize students. Of course, the easiest thing to do is to arrive on time and get your assignments in before the due date. People who are habitually late insult others, when they show no interest in punctuality. They don\u2019t last very long in a job, when they leave school either. ",

If you are late, then your assignment is late, and it is very appropriate to deduct points. Where, in the \u201creal world\u201d is being late acceptable? In the military, medical, or even transportation, \u201cbeing late\u201d can quite literally cause people to die. Appreciate that your teacher still gives partial credit, and learn to be NOT late. ",
