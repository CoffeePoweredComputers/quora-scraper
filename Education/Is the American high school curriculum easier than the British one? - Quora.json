            "answer_text": "I think it depends on the schools in question and on the classes a student takes. Some programs in the U.S. may easier than some programs in the UK, but there would also be some programs in the U.S. that are more challenging than some in the UK. However if we look at test results it would be fair to say that the UK schools are performing better as a whole than are U.S. schools. According to U.S. academic achievement lags that of many other countries UK students surpass U.S. students in science, math and reading, though it is worth noting that in reading the scores are quite close to one another. The U.S. and UK systems are quite different in that U.S. schools offer a broad-based curriculum throughout secondary school while UK students begin to specialize in particular subjects early on. This can make them hard to compare. In the U.S. schools vary in quality and the curriculum varies by state. Students also have different options for the classes they take. A student who is academically oriented may take a series of more advanced honors or advanced placement courses. Another student may take less challenging courses and just meet the minimum requirements for graduation. U.S. students follow a broad-based curriculum from Kindergarten through 12th grade. They graduate from high school at the age of 17 or 18 having studied an array of subjects each year. The UK system is different in that students begin to specialize early. Students such as Elliot Town will begin studying to take (typically) five General Certificate of Secondary Education tests at the age of 13 or 14 then take the tests at the age of 16. Passing the tests signals completion of that stage of education. Students planning to attend university will continue their studies for an additional two years. During this time they will normally focus on three or four subject areas in preparation for taking the GCE Advanced Level tests. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps, I'm in year 10/9th grade and am preparing for my GSCE exams at the end of my next school year, all our grades are taken from the exams. English exams in particular are going to be hard (I'm in the first year to be taking the new harder GSCE) We must learn off by heart all annotations of 15 poems for the exam and we will not have our annotation book with us so it's all from memory (stupid I know) I have an American friend and when we message she tells me about how nearly all her grades come from coursework. Aside from the literal difficulty differences statistically girls tend to prefer coursework whereas boys prefer it to be in exams and get it all out of the way quickly. I suppose it just depends what subjects you've chosen to take whether you prefer exams or course work (for me I prefer coursework) Hopefully someone from an American school can give their opinion as clearly my point of view is biased having not experienced American schooling.
