            "answer_text": "The subject that YOU love the most. The subject that doesnt make you feel burdened but relieves you from the stress of studying when you read it! So it will vary from people to people. I liked studying biology but then i realized in class 11 and 12 i actually LOVED english literature\u2026while studing dramas like julius caesar and macbeth\u2026i was absorbed in them and never felt the pressure or the burden of mugging up the details. It happened naturally. So although i found interest in science subjects i felt english literature was the best because I FOUND SOLACE IN READING IT. So you just have to find yours!! ",
