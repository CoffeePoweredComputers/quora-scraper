            "answer_text": "Quick answer: culture and administrative practices. America has both awe and disdain for mathematics. On one hand, people are impressed by long, complicated-looking equations on blackboards; on the other, they say \u201cWhat the hell am I gonna need this for in real life?\u201d This influences the outlook of many math teachers: one subset will look to impress; another will look for the easiest way out\u2014both at the expense of efficacy. District guidelines strangle K-12 teachers in public schools; so, even the ones who are good are compromised by bureaucracy. Whatever passes the most students is the enforced teaching methodology. In most cases, that\u2019s memorization. In college, professors are just as susceptible to the memorization disease as their students. To make it worse, they\u2019re often responsible for reaffirming that ideology and oiling the gears for another cycle when their students become instructors. Memorization leads to poor explanation. Sycophantic memorizers can complete doctoral degrees, and they are precisely the types preferred for the task: they\u2019re easily molded to fit the department\u2019s every whim. Their personalities don\u2019t magically turn when they\u2019re the professors and running the operation. Math professors work at research universities for the prestige, for churning out papers and securing funding. It\u2019s a show to impress, not to teach. As such, they\u2019ll cut every pedagogical corner they can, conveniently blaming their students when it all goes down. \u201cThe course is hard.\u201d All the more reason to prepare to address the points of difficulty as smoothly as possible. \u201cStudents don\u2019t read the textbook.\u201d A lot of good reading the textbook will do them if the professor is incapable of answering questions coherently. Efficient, clear communication skills are apparently neglected in math departments. For several months, I worked for a proofreading company that services even top-ranking colleges in the United States, and most of the mathematics submissions I encountered were atrocious. I actually lost that job because I could not bring the last paper up to standard without rewriting it, and my suggestions for improvement \u201cweren\u2019t indulgent enough\u201d for the professor. When I was a math instructor in college, I was sorely disappointed at how lazy and apathetic many of the other instructors and professors were. Yes, there are students who don\u2019t want to lift a finger, but too often this image is wrongly assumed, especially by professors. They\u2019re minimizing the flaws of their in-group and maximizing the flaws of an out-group. ",

            "answer_text": "This isn\u2019t true for all maths teachers, of course. But let me give a few possible reasons: Some teachers may think that if something is obvious to them, then it\u2019s obvious to everyone. From my experience teaching mathematics, this is something I used to believe is true that I later learned is very far from the truth. Perhaps your teacher thinks that  and  are obviously different, so it\u2019s useless explaining the obvious. But you cannot see why you can\u2019t write  instead of .Some teachers believe that everyone learns through step-by-step guides. People who are good at mathematics tend to be sequential, structured thinkers. But not everyone has a brain that functions sequentially and orderly. Not everybody requires a set of instructions to build a piece of furniture, for example. If you are in the \u2018not requiring instructions to do things\u2019 category, you may find your teacher\u2019s step-by-step instructions to solve a particular equation confusing or even maddening.Some aspects of mathematics are difficult, or even impossible, to teach. I wonder how Art teachers teach art. How do artists know where to place the brush, which colours to use, whether to use brush or pencil? I don\u2019t, and I\u2019ll never know. The same thing is true for mathematics. If you\u2019re stuck solving a trigonometric equation, then perhaps you have chosen the wrong brush. That\u2019s something your teacher cannot always teach you.Some teachers can be just plain bad. Perhaps teaching mathematics was never what they intended to do, or they are unmotivated for some reason or another, or they cannot even handle a class. In other words, they hate their job. No wonder they are terrible at explaining things \u2014 they\u2019d rather be in a different job.In short, the problem may be the teacher, it may be you, it may be the nature of the subject, or it may be a combination of all three.
