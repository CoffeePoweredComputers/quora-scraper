            "answer_text": "Some of the ones I know are:  Scholastic Art and Writing Awards - This is probably one of the most recognized awards for writing, and there are tons of categories to enter, from flash fiction to memoirs. You can submit samples of your writing to all categories you desire, the catch being a small submission fee for each one you submit. The writing awards are judged on two different levels, the first being regional/state. You may either receive a Regional Gold Key, Silver Key, or Honorable Mention for your piece. If you are awarded a Gold Key, you then advance to the national level, where a national committee judges your work, and likewise you can earn a designation of Gold Key, Silver Key, Honorable Mention, or other topic-specific awards. I believe the deadline for the competition this year is approaching, so go check it out: http://www.artandwriting.org/National Council of Teachers of English Achievement Awards in Writing - For this one, you must be nominated by your teacher in order to enter, and the teacher has a limited number of nominations depending on your school size. However, this is only open to juniors. So something to look into for next year. Here is the link: http://www.ncte.org/awards/student/aaThese are the ones I am familiar with. Best of luck! ",
