            "answer_text": "If you are planning to do class 12th maths directly after class 10th and skipping 11th, then strictly no. Class 11th makes you mentally more mature for math. Some of the concepts overlap with class 12th, such as Sets, Relations, Trigonometry (very important in majority of chapters), Combinations (for probability), Straight lines (for 2D, 3D) and probability itself overlap. Though you can study class 12th from scratch by studying only required 11th concepts. ",

And also time to time, formulas from class 11 (trigo,binomial etc.) are used. So for full command on ur 12th maths. u should have also the knowledge of class 11 In ur mind too. However u don't need to study whole syllabus again. u can short list formulas and do well with calculus . And u will do nice in class 12Good luck. ",
