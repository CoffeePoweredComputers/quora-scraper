            "answer_text": "Don't worry. Happens with most of the students. There is always something good. I am not saying this to keep you calm or something. There are literally thousands of things to do. If you are interested in designing, go for graphic designing. Freelancers are the most paid employees nowadays. If you want to design a game, search for the materials and start studying. Start with whatever you get, you will find your way soon. Getting a computer science degree is a plus for designers like you but if you have the talent they don't have, then no one can stop you from getting a good job. Give the exam tomorrow and see the results. Get into a college and get a degree. Don't choose any other stream otherwise you will be scr*wed. Even if you don't get a good college, you will do well. Just be passionate about what you want to do. College will open many doors to you and who knows that you will find something else interesting than this. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. From what I can understand I believe that you may have been forced to study Science. Even if you crack JEE I would suggest you not to take up Engineering as you would end up being frustrated. If I were in your place, I might have taken a year off. I would have used that year to develop my drawing skills and also take courses on animation. games, etc. To practice I would have created small games and comics and uploaded them to see how people reacted to them. But this is what I would have done. Since you are in a really delicate situation I suggest you to have a good discussion with your family members and someone who is well versed in your area of interest. ",
