            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not. First let\u2019s look at what liberal arts is. Natural sciences, social sciences, humanities and artistic rendition (praxis and theory)\u2026 Many of these fields might examine religion. Might dissect it. Might interpret its relations. Might try to find answers for the codification of mysticism into formal religiosity. Might be used to enhance religious worship or discover new in roads into spirituality \u2026 But none of them espouse dogma on their own. More often than not, the liberal arts undertake on its own revolutionary stances against a perceived cultural bulwark that suppresses its evolution. For example, like how everybody blames Nietzsche for burning Western academia down. More accurately, this often is expressed in terms like a historiography conflict. These are called \u2018History Wars\u2019 \u2026 one of the most famous and relevant to the politics of Western societies that happened fairly recently was the Historikerstreit. Another example is the postmodern critique of visual arts. For example, the rebellion against things like minimalism and the desire to break away from art being some anal, rhetorical journey to discovering a \u2018core\u2019 of art as if quantifiable outside its relations. You also get such conflicts in things like museology\u2026 and the how, why, and moral considerations of organizing public digestion of information in exhibitions. Which is an incredibly fascinating field of science to think about. The ethical and practical codes in how we present, why we present, and what we value in, artifacts of common cultural narratives for public information transmission\u2026 What you\u2019ll notice in all these sorts of dialogues, however, is none of them are dogmatic. There is no central liberal arts texts. There\u2019s schools of thought, but none of them are considered sacred. ",

            "answer_text": "Coming from a Christian background, it got me thinking about life. I wouldn\u2019t throw the whole Bible out because someone is hung up on the word God. Also, people are very literal in their interpretations\u2026 It\u2019s a sin not to tap your head three times and do 4 squats\u2026 really might mean it\u2019s a sin not to exercise. It\u2019s really old. Where science can\u2019t explain it religion sorta takes over. The Ancient Greeks have a religion tied to science that was parables and symbols\u2026. but the religion would change according to what they discovered\u2026 it was a sort of open source religion\u2026 if I can call it that. Church did some pretty sick stuff though. They both have a positive message, I haven\u2019t really seen them exactly conflict on every issue\u2026 I think man wrote The Bible though\u2026 there is stuff the public probably doesn\u2019t get to see in terms of documents and writings\u2026 so we might not ever know. Plus, a few libraries have been burned down (oddly enough) so there\u2019s lost history neither side knows about anymore. They are similar in that they teach leadership, albeit differently. There are more books than just The Bible as well, there are the missing books, and Satan\u2019s view in Satanism. ",
