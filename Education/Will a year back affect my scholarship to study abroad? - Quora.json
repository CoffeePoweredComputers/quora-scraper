            "answer_text": "Well it may. Most of the universities have limited amount of funds to give scholarships and they choose whom to give scholarships on the basis of merit list. Different universities have different criteria of preparation of merit list. But most common method is scoring your overall application i.e., CV + LOR + SOP + GRE/GMAT score. Since one of the factors affecting your CV is your GPA, and having a year back have its own demerits, so it may affect your application for scholarship. But, if your year back reason is not GPA and something else like medical unfitness or likewise, you may mention that in your Personal Statement, and then I don't think it may affect your application for Scholarship.
