Less homework means more time for sleep, and more importantly, less stress.[1]  Regardless of how much homework kids are actually doing every night, most parents and teachers are happy with the way things are: 60 percent of parents think that their children have the \u201cright amount of homework,\u201d and 73 percent of teachers think their school assigns the right amount of homework. Students, however, are not necessarily on board: 38 percent of students in grades seven through 12 and 28 percent of students in grades three through six report being \u201cvery often/often\u201d stressed out by their homework. The sleep portion is especially important. In the US, 73% of high school students aren\u2019t getting enough sleep.[2] Most adolescents aren\u2019t getting enough sleep, increasing their risk for health and behavioral problems, according to a new study. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine\u2019s recommendations, which have been endorsed by the Academy, call for children ages 6-12 years to sleep nine to 12 hours each night and teens to sleep eight to 10 hours. (\u2026) Researchers found 73% of high school students across 30 states are not getting enough sleep, up from 69% in 2009. Rates of short sleep ranged from 62% in South Dakota to 83% in West Virginia and were highest for females, Asian and black students. Among middle school students surveyed in nine states, 58% did not meet the sleep recommendations. New Mexico had the fewest short sleepers at 50% compared to 65% in Kentucky. Females, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and black students were most likely to fall short. You should also read up on Why lack of sleep is bad for your health and The Effects of Stress on Your Body  And unlike what the shibboleths pushed by the sect of youth-hating, villainous cretins say, homework doesn\u2019t teach independent learning. It only teaches them to do the minimum amount of effort (which is often too much) combined with asking for help from their parents to get it done. Actually pursuing an interest without anyone holding your future at gunpoint if you don\u2019t memorize enough useless shit teaches independent learning. Homework only makes students less happy and negatively affects their health. Footnotes[1] How Much Homework Do American Kids Do?[2] Study: 73% of high school students not getting enough sleep\n   ",

            "answer_text": "No. I see college students who won\u2019t do ungraded homework, then go and fail their exams. Homework is often something students can get good grades on by putting in the time and effort, whereas test scores can be lower than students would like due to test anxiety. Less homework won\u2019t boost test scores. Less homework might drop grades. If you want to improve homework, focus on making it meaningful or relevant, or limiting the hours/minutes per subject per day (perhaps some classes assign homework on alternate days). I would like to see the school districts provide some free tutoring resources for students who need help with homework, but they don\u2019t really have the budget (although I\u2019m not too busy at the community college to help high school students who come into our tutoring center).
