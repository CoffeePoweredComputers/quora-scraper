            "answer_text": "Absolutely! Students are discriminated against in many ways over many issues. They are discriminated against due to their intelligence, their abilities, their disabilities, their ethnicities, their genders, their sexual preference, their socio-economic status, their relative privilege, how they look, how they walk, how they talk, and a whole lot more. You name it, they get screwed by it somehow. I\u2019m going to relay a story from my school. About 10 years ago, on the first day of school, one of my coworkers told me about the happenings of summer school. It was grand. It was glorious. It was\u2026 summer school! Summer school is very rarely planned terribly well. Students have little access to things they need like a library, textbooks, novels, computers, or\u2026 air conditioning. We also did a marvelously poor job of scheduling students. One class of English 9 might have 40 students, while another class of English 9 had a mere 20. It came to pass that year that such an imbalance occurred. One class of sophomore English contained 25 students while the other was at 35. That obviously isn\u2019t fair. My coworker had the smaller class. The other teacher who, for obvious reasons wasn\u2019t terribly popular with students had the larger class. Some might chalk this up to her strange and unplaceable European accent that sounded vaguely German. A bit of balancing was necessary. The two teachers agreed that they\u2019d split the difference and balance the classes at 30. My coworker went to the other class to pick out some new kids. The first thing he noticed was that there were six black students in the class. The second thing he noticed was that they were all in the same row of desks. Is this necessarily strange? Don\u2019t students often choose to sit with students of the same race? Sure\u2026 kind of. But they usually sit in clusters, not in the same row so that they can\u2019t talk to each other. This was clearly a matter of a teacher-designed seating chart. She was also kind of an angry woman, so she somehow got the upper hand in choosing which students she would send. She sort of hedged around a bit, pretending to think it over\u2026 and then said, \u201cHere\u2026 just take all the kids in this row.\u201d You know exactly what row she chose. The row of all black students looked at each other in disbelief. The whole class was looking at each other thinking, \u201cDid that just happen?\u201d And then\u2026 it was done. To this day, my department refers to this as \u201cthe ethnic cleansing.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, my coworker reported back that those students he \u201crecruited\u201d were awesome. This is an extreme example, but it isn\u2019t necessarily all that rare. This past year, I was standing on the walkway during my prep period watching my neighboring teacher have an interaction with a student. The student had arrived just after the bell. He was raking the kid over the coals. Normally, I\u2019d do the same thing\u2026 and then I\u2019d let the kid into class without sending him for a tardy pass. My coworker chose not to. After berating him for being late, he sent him for a tardy pass anyway. Then he turned to me and, quietly, as if we were sharing some great secret, said, \u201cYou know how they are. You know. Lazy. Laze Mex.\u201d How are we doing? Having fun? Trust me, teachers are human beings. We aren\u2019t all great. ",

While it it highly less unlikely that a teacher would consciously act on these biases, thus causing an act of discrimination, it does happen. Children and teens should have a conversation with an adult they trust. Share their (non-dramatically interpreted) version of events, and ask their confidante to help them navigate the intent. Possibly even partnering with the student to bring the concerns to said teacher\u2019s attention for a conversation and clarification. ",
