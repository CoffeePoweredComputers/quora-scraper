            "answer_text": "It's more like a cycle, things have to be cleared to make way for more  and better. It's been there since the beginning of the universe.Let me take some examples from different areas Technology, Mythology and Physics. 1. Technology: I am a computer science student, and whenever I code, be it any language, We do apply garbage collection. What is garbage collection you ask? Well it's the simple technique of clearing the extra memory or the unused memory to make way for new execution. Now if your system's memory is full and there is no place, you have to clear the used memory which was used in the previous program. This concept is applied through Constructors and Destructors ( Try and focus on the words) 2. Mythology: In the Hindu mythology, there are 3 main Gods: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma is the Creator of this Universe, Vishnu is the preserver and Shiva is the Destroyer. Whenever the evil takes over the Good the universe is destroyed, cleansed and created again. This cycle has been carrying on since the beginning of time and will go on till the end of time. If you study the Vishnu incarnation, the first is the Matsya, or the fish. When the earth was full of evil, it was on lord Shiva to cleanse the earth. It was decided to flood and finish the universe. At that time the ruler of the earth of king Manu, a Vishnu follower. Before the cleansing while Manu was praying to Lord Vishnu, he appeared in front of him and said he will incarnate as a fish and will row a boat carrying King Manu and the Saptarishi (The 7 sages who manage the universe).  Long point short, The earth was flooded cleansed by Shiva and then civilization prevailed again. 3. Physics: You must have heard about theories named The Big Bang Theory and The Big Crunch. Here's what those theories state in short. Some Billion Years ago, the Universe started contracting, everything started to come close and everything was falling in itself and slowly our whole universe began reducing in size, gradually turning into a small point (The Big Crunch). A point of infinite density containing everything in itself, even the dimensions, space, time; incredibly dense, infinitely hot and unimaginably unstable. Then this point exploded (The Big Bang) and created a Big Bang and the Universe began expanding and it has been expanding ever since. Then there is this Hypothesis that after Billion Years, the universe will stop expanding and will begin Contracting. So you can say creation and destruction are in a loop. ",
