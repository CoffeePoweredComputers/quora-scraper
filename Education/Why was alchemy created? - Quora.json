            "answer_text": "The question as it is, is unanswerable for diverse reasons. To better understand what alchemy actually is, would facilitate a working knowledge of how it works. We can never really be certain of the true \u201cwhy\u201d of things, since it requires infallibility and omniscience- two things humans have never possessed. For starters, let\u2019s consider what most people think alchemy is. Here\u2019s Oxford\u2019s: \u201cnoun. mass noun. 1The medieval forerunner of chemistry, concerned with the transmutation of matter, in particular with attempts to convert base metals into gold or find a universal elixir.\u201d Now let's consider what alchemy really is, according to the esoteric lineage of initiates which has descended to the modern day from its historical source. To put it plainly, the turning of base metals in to gold has always been an analogy for turning mundane, baseline, physical-associated consciousness to a pure and bright, comprehensive spiritual consciousness. Essentially, alchemy has always been a spiritual alchemy, disguised as a perverse desire to create gold for personal wealth. It was a self-keeping secret. Those who were sincere gravitated toward the spiritual, occult aspects of the mystery while others wasted precious time trying to accomplish something that, while not impossible, has the opposite effect of making one a more spiritual person. And yes, morality is a very real thing, as regards spiritual development and power. This is why so many powers that be don't want us to believe in, or have morals. This is as far as I may go in to this topic, as I feel I've satisfied the general query regarding the purpose of alchemy. Perhaps some further questions? ",

            "answer_text": "Alchemy has a long history in humanity and developed in different cultures independently of one another. European alchemy was rescued by Arabic alchemists during the Dark Ages but neither knew of Chinese or Indian alchemy. Although very practical chemical discoveries came about through these diverse explorations (including the ceramics in China that became known to us even today as \u2018china,\u2019 or metallurgy in Japan, the focus was for magickal and transcendental \u2018substances\u2019 depending on whether it was internal or external alchemy. The internal form developed in China within Taoism and sought extreme longevity or immortality (production of the \u201cimmortal foetus\u201d). It drew on Indian Yoga for its particular take on psychic centers of inner transformation. In Europe or the Middle East, transmutation of base metals to gold and silver was only part of the endeavor. One had to be spiritually perfected in order to accomplish these feats so alchemy (from al Khem, \u2018of Egypt\u2019) so alchemy was first and foremost an esoteric spiritual discipline. Those ignorant, greedy people who sought to turn Lead into Gold were not alchemists, they were derisively called \u201cpuffers,\u201d in reference to the bellows that heated their furnaces (athanors). As Phil Wheeler pointed out, Sir Isaac Newton considered himself an alchemist first and foremost even though we remember him for his mathematical genius. Alchemists were not primitive chemists, ignorant of atomic theory. It is an arcane thing and utilizes premises that embody astrological concepts (see The Kolisco Effect) that today would be connected with C.G. Jung\u2019s Synchronicity (\u201can acausal connecting principle\u201d), as well as spiritual ideals. A motto was and remains \u201cOra et Labora,\u201d Pray and Work. The modern mind that condescendingly and reductionistically relegates alchemy to a primitive development of science is simply ignorant of the mind-set of alchemy (which endures) and is merely laying a post-modern scientific mentality on an ancient spiritual phenomenon. Iatrochemists were interested in healing disease (see Paracelsus), and some were way ahead of their time. Spagyrics was plant (vs. mineral) alchemy, which was conceived of differently than later homeopathic medicine was, but one will today see this term (which means to break apart and re-assemble) in some herbal health products today. It too has certain premises which partakes of astrological configurations in the production of these tinctures, elixirs, ens, magisteries. Unlike physical chemistry which is replicable independently of the subtle conditions required by Spagyrics, \u2018astral\u2019 influences are involved. If one is a dyed-in-the-wool materialist, neither homeopathy nor spagyrics, nor alchemy in general is going to be understood and are likely to be dismissed outright. ",
