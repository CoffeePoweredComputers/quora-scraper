            "answer_text": "Find something you truly love to do. Then, find a way to make money at it. To be a bit more detailed: you are young. At 17, you have a great deal of changing and growing to do. When you are 40, you should be a wildly different person. Today, for someone to find one career path and never deviate is rare. So, first is to not put too much pressure on yourself to find the end all by 18. However, to find something that should last a long time, look at the things you both love to do today, and what did you love to do over the last few years? Your interests change, but you may find some patterns. If you liked film, and have moved into music, what did you like about them? The creativity? Prestige? Challenge? Videos? Accessibility? What is it about those things you like? Start from there. Find a few people in a field you might like. Not the top people, but people who work in the field and maybe have not made it to the top. Don't try George Lucas, find a director who is still working their way up. Reach out to them and find a few who will allow you to talk to them for 15\u201330 mins. When the time comes, be prepared. Have questions ready. Ask them what it is like. You will find most jobs are nothing like what you think they are. I started out as an actor. After a few years of making a living at it, I realized that the real job of acting wasn't so much fun. So, I changed. Oh, and if you asked for 30 mins, stop at 30. Be respectful and don't waste their time. (If you are meeting in person, buy them a coffee.) At your age, find internships or like that so you can see what it is like. Depending on what you want to do, find the right person and ask to work for them, for free. Bust your butt to impress them. That's how you get experience and connections. Don't be afraid to try things. Jump in and do it. You will regret what you didn't try, not what you did try. Go do! In short, my guess is that you are over-thinking this and really need to learn to get out there and do things. Take a risk. At your age, failure is OK. I expect you don't have a wife and 3 kids to feed. (If you do, do not take my advice. You need to be much more conservative and fulfill your obligations to them, not just go and experience things.) Hope that helps! ",

Your vocation is based on your ideals which are developed in combination with your passions and your talents. Your vocation is the intersecting point between what \u2018the world needs\u2019 and \u2018the work that others are prepared to pay you to do\u2019. This work is oft-times different from the \u2018work others value\u2019 which is best tagged as your profession. Your profession is based on your strengths and is developed in conjunction with your experiences and your talents. Your profession is the work that you\u2019re \u2018great at doing\u2019 and for which \u2018others are prepared to pay you to do\u2019. Your vocation is still work you get paid for, unlike your mission which is purely altruistically driven and defined by your values and your own meaning to life. Your mission becomes self evident from your life\u2019s experiences and your identified passions. You mission is the work that you \u2018love to do\u2019 and which the \u2018world needs\u2019, but don\u2019t expect others to pay you. Happiest are the people whose profession is also their vocation. Teaching does that for me and I\u2019m sure that others have also been able to enmesh the two in their careers. I think that this chart sums it all up pretty well:  ",

From what you say it would seem you are more art oriented than, what I would call, hard science based subjects. Art is a wonderful sphere to be in because, almost by definition, the requirements for one sector overflows into another. Parents can be good, bad or indifferent when you are 17 but they have seen you grow up. They will know your strengths. Talk to them for input. You do not have to do as they say but take down notes. Then talk to others, it could be cousins, friends, people who see you doing things in normal life. You may find, if you are open, that there is a vocation right in front of you. It could be acting, story telling, writing or even something totally outside what you think would be your vocation such as design. In the world today there are so many career options it is hard to know what they all mean. When all is said and done though you will need to earn enough money to leave home and support your lifestyle. So choose wisely my friend. Alan ",
