            "answer_text": "Teaching is more than a vocation, It is a means where you have taken a lifetime of what you have done in your career and the skills developed using practical and theoretical abilities. Every career is considered a vocation; from being a doctor to a general laborer. If you look up vocation in the search engines, you can get a better feel of what a vocation is. In order to teach courses relating to the vocation you were in, you then can further your education, getting a bachelors degree in vocational education so you are able to teach other students what you know. To be a good teacher, you have to take core courses in teaching. Some of these courses are: learning how and the correct way to teach, work ethics, special needs students, lesson planning, grading tests, developing tests, etc. The whole key to teaching is to develop a good relationship with your students. Teaching is not a one way job but a consistent feedback method between teacher an student. Both teacher and student learn together. The reward is when the class ends, your students will raise their hand and say \u201cI really learned a lot and you were a great teacher. That makes you feel very good inside. ",

            "answer_text": "Teaching successfully requires developing a personal connection with each student. Being able to form good relationships is the \"magic sauce\u201d for teaching. People can tell if you care about them and want to help. Just as ministers feel \"called\u201d to religious service, teachers often feel \"called\u201d to their profession. Teaching also requires a curiosity and drive to learn more ways to support the students that extends beyond the workday. Yes, everyone knows teachers grade papers at home and on weekends. However, the successful teacher then looks at those graded papers and looks for patterns in order to decide the next step of instruction. If the students failed at something, a great teacher takes ownership of that and tries to find another way teach. Reading books and taking courses are other ways teaching is more of a lifestyle than a job. Teaching requires that their professionals become life long learners because there is always something new to try, even if it's just an old strategy tool wrapped up in new paper. ",
