            "answer_text": "Luckily i had a bad experience with whitehat jr. And ended up in a much better way.. So i called whitehat jr and organised a free lesson for my son to see how it goes When the lesson started the instructor was not really teachin my son, rather she was only kind of ordering him what to do without giving him the chance to think or even make mistakes by himself to learn or conclude things, Nevertheless we agreed to go on with the classes and i requested that they call me next day in the afternoon so we can do the registration coz i got busy. They agreed, and we hanged up .. 5 minutes later someone from whitht jr is calling me i told him i was busy and that they should call me next day at 12pm as instructed by me 5 min ago. Nextday they called me at 7am then at 9am then i felt they are forcing it at me, they called at 12 and i didnt answer coz i was not really in the mood after all .. so they called my wife, and she asked them not to do that, they called her again asking why i dont answer .. it was horrible, i never said no to them i wanted to wait and see if they ever respect my time .. they kept stalkin me for 2 weeks they offered huge discounts from $400 to $300 to $200 to $120 and they kept sayin that my son is very smart and he got a scholorship thats why they give me a discount, i felt there is something suspecious about them eventhough they are legit, but the fact that they instructrd my son all the way for 1 hour without giving him a chance to think made me conclude that they ll just continue doing that and my son will follow the instruction brainlessely. He wont be learning anything! \u2026 i dont like to be forced or pushed into somethin so i went to youtube and started researching some other resources and i found here Learn computer science. Change the world. Seriously they have 10 times better excersis and toturial and it starts very simple u can learn it urself while u go through it with ur kid .. its fun game and its free. my advice is to save your money, spend more time with ur children and learn together with them on that site What they are going to learn either in code dot org or in white hatjar is the same, its what is called abstract coding, its not real coding, its coding through playing a game and putting buliding blocks of functions together, kids will learn the basic concepts and the logic behind coding and how to apply loops, create functions and if statments but its building block only, Which brings a very important point i would like to mention for all parents, when u teach ur kids abstract coding it is very hard to convince them to migrate from abstract coding to real coding , which also involve mathmatics most kids would give up, , so parents should be aware of that and introduce simple coding languages such as logo (turtle academy) or html and improve their mathmatical skills along the way ",

            "answer_text": "Update (July 16) At the time of posting the below review on April 16th, I had no clue or expectations on how the review would be considered. After 60k views and 200 upvotes, I think it\u2019s time for an update. Why the Review I wrote it for the same reason anyone would write a review. It is for the reader to make an informed decision. My review was received positively as well as negatively. Those who were positive were kind enough to state that my review has helped them make an informed choice and those who gave negative feedback has stated that I\u2019m doing marketing or WhiteHat Jr is sham or I\u2019m not a real person. About Me I\u2019m a Corporate Employee and this post isn\u2019t sponsored or is neither a marketing sham for WhiteHat. The review is an honest opinion on WhiteHat based on the Trail class my daughter attended two months back. Two Months Later I stand by what I have written below. My daughter continues to enjoy using WhiteHat Jr and the classes. In fact she looks forward to attend these sessions. There have been occasions she has found the course tough and in that cases, we have sought the teachers help. Advice for Parents I often read in the comments about the marketing strategy of WhiteHat. I guess it\u2019s fair to say that every organisation has the right to market their product they want to unless they are misleading. My recommendation is to check if your kid is showing interest in the trail class and whether you liked how the format looks. Don\u2019t expect your kid to make any money or your kid to become a coding vizard. Coding takes time and this is the first step. Keep your expectations real. Original Post I\u2019m literally taken aback by some of the strong negative feedback WHJr has received in this platform so far. I may be too early to comment on the feedback as my 8yr old daughter is in the initial stages of her paid classes. Having said so I have to be mindful of not being drawn into giving overtly praise just because I have paid and have to support the organisation. Before I get into the review of other reviews, let me give you an overview of what WHJr is and how it works. I will then get into some of the criticisms given by disappointed parents. What is White Hat Jr They are an Online learning platform that give 1:1 classes to kids.They have 3 different type of courses that you can sign for. One for 1 class which can ignored, other is for 48 classes and the the last one is for 144 classes.The course fee is based on per class. 48 classes courses are more costly than 144 classes.They conduct these classes on their own Coding platform which, so far ,my kid has absolutely loved. How are the classes conducted?You have to book the class in advance based on your preferred time slot. If you want to change the time slot you can do so 24 hrs prior. It makes sense as you need to give teacher advance notice for them to schedule their day. What happens if it\u2019s last min cancellation? I have no clue.How is their platform? My initial impressions are that they are really good. For the initial classes, which my daughter is still in, its completely image based. This means the child doesn\u2019t have to write the code but drag and drop the code that\u2019s already written.This gives an easy entrance into coding world without having to worry about writing textual bases coding. It can be a disadvantage if your child is already into text based coding.The coding classes are more of game based with point system to encourage the kids to attempt. I haven\u2019t found any fault yet and hope I don\u2019t find any in the near future.What\u2019s their USP? I guess it\u2019s the 1:1 on coaching. An undivided attention the teacher is giving to 1 student. For me, that\u2019s a blessing.The classes can be moulded as per the child\u2019s leaning potential.I have also been provided with a Relationship Manager\u2019s number who, apart from the teacher, is a touch point for any challenges or issues. Since I\u2019m at the initial stages, I haven\u2019t used any of these resources. (Update July 16: I have used the resources and they are have been supportive)Do you need a high speed internet? To be honest I don\u2019t have an idea as my internet plan is of high speed. (Update July 16: A teacher from WhiteHat has mentioned in the comment that the minimum speed required is 15Mbps)I have read parents complaining the need for high speed internet. I recommend that you check during the trial class.Is it mechanical teaching as one parent said? I don\u2019t understand what the parent meant by it. I didn\u2019t find anything mechanical. They follow a pattern during the course and ask the student to follow the steps. It\u2019s the same as any school syllabus.What, as parents, we should understand is that whether your kid liked the session or not. Since my daughter loved the trial session, and I liked their course structure, I decided to go ahead with the paid plan.Do you get a certificate for attending the trail class? Yes, you do and it\u2019s funny. There is nothing of value apart from igniting the passion of the student and of the parent.It\u2019s a neat sales trick, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t see any harm. They are doing business and the only question you need to ask if they are keen on delivering what they promised. (Update July 16: So far, they are delivering)Does teachers have industry experience? I haven\u2019t enquired as my interest is on whether the teacher can teach or not.I\u2019m a 17yr experience professional Sales Trainer and I can vouch for the fact that top sales people can\u2019t train and top sale trainer\u2019s can\u2019t sell. People are good at their respective jobIf a teacher is able to identify the kid\u2019s talent, that\u2019s all what\u2019s required.I have to wait and see if that happens. If yes, I\u2019m happy. If not, I will stop the session and get the pro rata refund.About other claims of improved focus and stuff While WHJr do claim that kids have improved focus and stuff, I think it\u2019s a by-product of their interest in the class.This can happen even without a coding class. If you put your kid to any activity they love, they will give their undue attention. Have them sit in front of a tab and watch an animation movie, they will pay undue attention. Simple.However, \u2018coding\u2019 develops logical and analytical skills because at the end, they need to know Maths to solve certain issues. Coding is about solving a challenge.Warning - Coding doesn\u2019t make your kid Einstein. They don\u2019t make them Bill Gates or Mark. For that, they need to learn Business.",

            "answer_text": "In a nutshell White Hat Jr = Ride sharing platform + Social Networking App + Retail Store App albeit under the cover of education. It is a mere sales company that runs on gorilla marketing targeting FOMO social anxiety. COVID helped them to get much attention than possible. After almost 40 classes there is no actual coding, still playing with blocks. My kid lost his excitement on programming. The app implements exactly the ride sharing philosophy. The app announces for the availability of instructor matching the requested timings l, After timings-instructor match making the instructors gets allotted. Riders (Child\u2019s) background is irrelevant. The instructor then \u2018drives\u2019 (probably bulldozing is a right term) the student to the \u2018destination\u2019 ie., complete the session. No driving is taught. The platform is not responsible for any wreckage. 10 hour per day duties for the instructors. I believe White hat Jr is cashing out on the craze for the reputed institutions than actually sharing what they were taught or learnt. Poor souls who have fascination for IIX, Google, FB, NASA, Polar Expedition,, Ride to Mars etc whatnot for your beloved ones - you are a pretty nice target. Even worse they are annoyingly a marketing mill. Looks like they sold my data to other \u2018education services\u2019 without my obvious consent. I keep getting related calls relentlessly, at least half a dozen WhatsApp messages per day ( by the way you won\u2019t be asked for your consent to blast you over WhatsApp). What kind of service that bombards ads with flying balloons, flashy coupons, raffles, Tesla car? Doesn\u2019t sound familiar? My honest suggestion particularly to those who stretch themselves financially hoping for a reasonable outcome for their beloved ones - don\u2019t risk. Go find someone who teaches with a heart full of warm feeling for the education. ",

            "answer_text": "TL;DR: WhiteHatJr fools people with buzzwords and mines & profiles every shred of their kids' (and probably parents' too) data. I will use Wayback Machine links for references so as to save the snapshot incase they change the website. I will also use mobile screenshots instead of a desktop so as to make them more readable for mobile users.  Let's start with a cursory look at their homepage.[1]  1:1 online coding classes. Does that mean every child gets personal attention? The teacher's seemingly stock photo there makes me think they want that to imply. *Last 19 Spots Left We all know this strategy, needs no introduction. Also, it seems like their coders, or the program they coded doesn't know the rules of grammar.  Lots of buzzwords sprinkled here and there. Silicon valley, Google, Waymo, and what not. I doubt a kid who doesn't know what is 23\u00b2 would be able to handle the heavy data and statistics used in machine learning at Waymo offices. Also, more than 3 lakh reviews by students. Earlier they said there was 1:1 teaching. Do they have 3 lakh educators? Lmfao. Okay you might say let's cut some slack since the company is fairly recent. So we can assume they have atleast 10% the number of educators. 30k teachers, is it? Apparently, they have 7k teachers. If every educator made the kid capable for a job involving stuff with driverless cars, they are either very supreme beings who decided to stay underground for years and then suddenly come together to work for this company, or the claim is fake. The homepage consists of more buzzwords (including a claim about 1 million+ students (1M == 10L) being associated. Adds a cherry to the 1:1 claim) and extolling about their teachers. One particular thing I would like to point out is their age and price requirements:  Huh a class 1 student who generally doesn't know trigonometry will code for space missions. Just for a nominal price of \u20b91L. I guess all our schools and colleges are soon going to be obsolete. Finally! Thanks, whitehatjr! /s  Before proceeding, let us take a quick look at the detailed curriculum of their \u20b999,999 (or I should say \u20b91,07,999) plan for grade 1.[2] They don't even use the Indian numbering system, so much for educating India's kids.  Woah! So advanced syllabus! Jokes and sarcasm aside, I don't even need to go into that \u201csyllabus\u201d to point out it's total scam in the name of \u201cAI/ML\u201d (like almost always). Most of it seems like drag and drop stuff branded like AI/ML. Let's cut some slack considering its class 1, let's look at class 10+ curriculum.[3]  BRUH MOMENT. You are paying ONE BLEEPING LAKH RUPEES for this, which is just school education. Why do I say this? Here's why:  Hmm cool, let's look at the juicy things I'm gonna learn for building the next Google! Aatmanirbhar Bharat, here I come!  For teaching AI/ML to you, they will first teach you what are variables, if else conditionals, loops, and functions.Then they will teach you graphs and Pandas \u201cdataframes\u201d and numpy \u201carrays\u201d. Without any knowledge of what's happening and how their data is actually fed or manipulated!AFTER teaching you numpy and cooldude hackerman data science stuff, they will teach you the basic building blocks, viz., strings, list, tuples, and dictionaries!Then you'll study some basic statistics taught in class 12. Remember, after graphs, plots, Panda dataframes, and numpy!So much bluffing. Similar goes for the tasks on the right.  Some more class 12 statistics and CS stuff. The major bluff here is about \u201cXGBoost\u201d. The arxiv print[4] (submitted on 2016) has the following abstract: Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems. And the paper consists of stuff like this:  or  This is not the stuff a 14 year old learns (unless your kid is some math genius like Terence Tao, at that point you would know it's futile to waste money here). Even yours truly does not know it and hence is unable to explain it to you. Finally let's look at the third part. You'd expect some more advanced and juicy stuff.  Oh, so we are back to statistics marketed with buzzwords and captivating tasks. We also see a mention about absolute basic things like matrices and covariance, taught in class 12 and college courses which are not on AI or ML. Whitehatjr doesn't fail to disappoint you more, isn't it?  Before proceeding to the last part, I chanced upon a blog post of theirs. This absolutely shreds any credibility they may have in your mind, if you know stuff about programming.[5] A prior knowledge about programming helps here.  Oh, >programming language of HTML >best use of PHP is interactive pages with WordPress and Drupal >PHP is LITTLE difficult for \u201csmall\u201d kids >it is EASY to learn for more mature kids  So according to them Lua is the best introductory language, and Lua code is upon Roblox's default (?) boilerplate (they didn't even use the correct word and terminologies lmao).  Well, it turns out learning PHP and Lua was just scratch. Now the actual beast, Python, has entered into the game! Wow! Also, there is a very kid friendly reference, Python.org, quoted there!  >So the reason Java is popular is because of Minecraft. >Minecraft has its own name among programming languages. >Inb4 Java == Minecraft >Minecraft as a learning tool for Java. >Tfw you realise Minecraft is closed source.

This includes, without limitation, any information that you have made public through your social media account, information that the social media service shares with us or information that is disclosed during the sign-up and sign-in processes.So any social media you link to them, they have the rights to store and mine every single shred of information on that profile which is public, plus the information you give them access to while signing in. Basically, you are allowing them to collect every data available on your social media sites. If any of the Users allows us to collect information from his or her device phonebook\u2014and you or the Child\u2019s are one of that User\u2019s contacts\u2014we may combine the information we collect from that User\u2019s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with the information we collect through the Platform.So they are correlating your profile and information with others, which includes using phonebook and mobile numbers. So basically, you're giving them a free pass to profile your children from their digital infancy.

These uses improve the Platform and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with an efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Platform. So whitehatjr is basically Bluffing around both at the homepage and at the curriculum.Got technical about programming itself wrong. So much for teaching programming.Meanwhile they capture every bit (pun intended) of information about you and your child to profile you and use it for more targetted advertisement and more tracking. Essentially monetising it while your child is profiled since day 1.Your child gets nothing to learn and you lose money on sketchy claims.

            "answer_text": "We sat for a trial class. The first try, the teacher's headset didn't work and she cut in and out. When we could hear, I noticed two things. 1) the accent of the teacher made it difficult to understand 2) she strictly followed a script while teaching 3) when we explained we couldn't understand, she simply repeated whatever was on her script. Strange. They let us reschedule so we tried again\u2026 Next try, no technical difficulties and less accent but like before, the teacher read from a script. She sometimes restated things but made little effort to personalize the session to the student. She was constantly trying to get back to her script. The decision was not to use their service. I wasn't confident the teachers would individualize their sessions so what was the point? I was interested in paying for tutoring, not a script. After that, came a daily bombardment of marketing through every medium they had access to. I had to quickly unsubscribe from text to several different numbers and then finally block the numbers. I also had to block them on WhatsApp. Then email. Then had to tell more than one telesales person to stop calling. That was pretty annoying. They sent lots of childishly manipulative emails before the unsubscribe about how my kid is top rated for a bunch of random stuff that they made up. The over-the-top marketing paired with underhanded manipulation makes me ill at ease. That along with the scripted teaching and the sales pitches from the teachers made me feel not too confident in the service. I get the feeling this is a money making scheme with as many untrained \u201cteachers\u201d as possible with little caring as to the successful learning of the individual student. Not for us. ",

            "answer_text": "I actually figured out that it was a scam while the call and thirty minutes after it. I\u2019m actually the one that was on the call, I\u2019m 12 years old and i figured out something was fishy while talking to them. First of all, on Oct 4th, I was a few minutes earlier than expected, I was waiting for it to start. The meeting was supposed to start at 6:00 and I was surprised that she still isn\u2019t there, and i know you\u2019re wondering why did you think there was something fishy there? Well it\u2019s because the program is for a \u201cscholarship\u201d from a great school in canada and they\u2019re supposed to be proper and always on time,and if you\u2019re trying to get students to enroll in your school, you must maintain professional. that\u2019s the first red flag. Second red flag. MY TEACHER WAS INDIAN. No I\u2019m not being racist, it\u2019s just cause indians are known for their scams on the internet and the \u201cscholarship\u201d isn\u2019t even from india IT WAS ON CANADA. If the \u201cscholarship\u201d is for canada then aren\u2019t the teacher,technicians, and creators supposed to be canadian too if that\u2019s the case? But I let it be ;-; Third red flag. The compliments and rewards. I too was kind of fooled by this, if you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s because children are desperate for compliments any kind of compliment you say they will accept. The compliments were very iffy too, It was like they were trying to get the children to ask and beg their parents to get enrolled in the course. WHEN I WAS ASKED A QUESTION I DIDN\u2019T EVEN ANSWERED CORRECTLY AND THEY GAVE ME A HATS OFF FOR IT???? WTH! I also think she was done with me cause it took me thirty seconds to find something hehehehe. (btw im kind of a dumb kid so yeah) But i let it be again ;\u2014\u2014-; Fourth red flag. After the \u201clearning\u201d After \u201cteaching\u201d me she told me to look at a link which showed the \u201capps\u201d and \u201cchatbots\u201d children made while learning at whitehatjunior she also showed me what I will be learning when I enroll at that course, some of them were \u201cmodeling\u201d,\u201dcreating bigger apps\u201d and etc. She showed these things so that the children and parents will believe it which I gotta say is pretty clever ;))) Here I was actually kinda more sketchy about it. Fifth red flag. The DM\u2019s After the \u201cclass\u201d they sent some things to my mother\u2019s google account, some of these said \u201cWow, your child is as smart as Einstein\u201d BS which is not true (believe me) And they also sent some pricey \u201cDiscounts\u201d for the scholarship. When my mom showed these things to me I told her that It\u2019s probably a scam(And here I was immedietely sure it was) and We should not enroll there. A few days later until today I wondered and wondered whether it was a scam or not so I just searched the internet. Also, during my meeting my teacher had trouble with her internet so I had to wait for a little while again, AND THEN, the technicians came in the call and told me my teacher had problems, \u201cwhy?, why are you so suspicious of them their just technicians\u201d If that\u2019s what you are asking it was because they were m e n, and sometimes men are untrustworthy, also i think they just did that to see how I\u2019m doing in the call idk it\u2019s probably just me. Parents side note: Never pay for sites that may seem sketchy to you, always remember to research more about that site and be careful. And yes I am a child :DDD ",

            "answer_text": "Literally, the best place to learn coding for your children is YouTube. WhiteHat Jr is just a joke. I went on the website just by reading on an article, a coding platform for kids, I mean the what? And this is how the site looks.  Let me show you how hard it is to be a silicon valley engineer. This is William Lin, one of the favorite channels of whom I watch to keep my coding gist to then top and learn new concepts. He is also a class leading competitive coder, one of the best I have seen.  If you have any issues regarding understanding, why I am comparing them together, just look at the First screenshot and then go to his channel and give a watch to his videos. If you are a parent yourself, you should see his videos and learn, how hard is it to code in the competitive ground. Yes, app development is a different thing but whiteHat.Jr claims to be making your child a silicon valley winner and I don't see him/her getting the S of silicon valley unless your child is a competitive coder. App development is way below or way after than that. Now just ask yourself a question? Is whiteHat.Jr a proper coding platform for your children? Or do you even know what sort of basics it requires to even understand the ground of coding. The concept of coding isnt just writing code that will do a simple task. It's a mere engineering term if you don't know. Why? Why bring Engineering in coding? When you write a code, you usually define a task to the computer which it will understand from the code and compile it to produce a machine language program which the processor in the computer will understand and produce the required output. So what you actually do here? You write a code indirectly for the processor.You have to mention the steps and the sequence to process.You have to give the data.You have to specify the location for the data.You have to define the right syntax which I think isn't that hard if you know the language.You have to understand the basics of general programming.You have to build logic which is the most important part.You have to understand sequential analysis of coding to generate a working simulation of the problem.You have to understand the concept of output and it's manipulation process to generate a pattern if required.And most importantly, you have to know how a computer processes these in the most basic way(else you are stuck with conditions).See all these issues related to coding? This will come up on any child's mind and the necessary answers are required to given to them. This is relevant whether you write a hello world program or a linked list with self evolving and optimisation feature. Coding is now taken a very common concept which everybody can learn. But the reality is very less know. Out of millions students, only a very negligible percentage of 0.01% get to understand the main motive of coding. So what to do for your child to teach him coding ? There is always a basic for everything. You cannot learn mathematics not unless you deal your way wit numbers and Arithmetic. Similarly for coding, your child needs to have a brief understanding of logic, computers and very concept of bits. The best for book for your child to start learning coding is to grab this book.  The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold. In this book, you get to know about computers right from the basics of bits, how they are used in a variety of fields and how it advanced to the computer technology with architecture language. The entire book is written like a story book and your child won't even find it boring, just that not many pictures are present though. But the entire book is very interesting, for almost any one who is starting to learn coding, whether he or she is a 6\u20137 year old or a engineering student. I am not against the platform, but they are actually missing out a bit of context that should be available to the young minds. Coding is a complex subject, that basically belongs to Computer Science. Only a tiny part of it is taught in Usual Primary Schools for students to have a liking towards programming. I am saying from the perspective of experience, as in my days of high school, I was not even able to write a single line of code on my own, as the concept just went right through my head. But when I joined college, I got myself acquainted with base programming easily, since I found out missing concepts on my understanding. I started from very basic and got the actual idea of writing code that made sense to the computers. I have written a very basic and simple concept based programming book that actually contains all the basics to learn any coding language fast, just with the right basics using simple algorithms and Flowcharts(which is a very basic concept introduced for 10\u201311 year olds). It has lots of exercises for your child to easily understand and learn easily. You can download it from here for free! Conceptual Programming_AS_2020_done!.pdf ",

            "answer_text": "I weird I am writing this answer, because I thought it was a joke a few months ago, but I only realised the seriousness of this company a few days ago. So let me start a few months ago, as usual I was searching around Quora and reading a lot of stuff, after getting bored, I was watching some food review shows and ended up getting an ad from white hat jr. So basically it was some 10-13 year old girl called sakshi or arushi writing some application and starting a company. There was a was fishy feeling from that weird ad, so my inquisitive nature started to push me to look at some reviews and I ended up searching Quora. Almost all the reviews were written in a positive manner, I really started to doubt whether they were actually written by customers or employees. That's weird!! Like it's a rule to have atleast one negative review even if you have something that could save the world. How could some product or service not get a single bad review? So after some detailed researching I realised these guys at whitehat jr, did not even teach people how to code, they used some sort of block.ly based scripted webapp to design their so called 'apps'. All those media articles that they tell you about often are authors who get a commission to write their stories. Yes such people do exist, even those people at Forbes, often they use it as a Marketing space to promote products. So forget the flash stories of going to silicon valley and meeting Elon Musk in at spaceX or becoming the CEO of Google (wait if people who do their PhD's in the US cant get a job in the US, where will chintu get a job with a useless certificate) those certificates almost have no value, simply because those kids haven't programmed in an actuall language. Imagine If a guy in a suite asks you a $100 to teach a kid to ride a toy car, and you say some confusing buzz words and car jargon. Then once you have done that you get a certificate with a big logo and a name, do you expect the DMV to give your kid a drivers license?? (I know the analogy is horrible but hear me out) In their curriculum PDF for the APT course , they haven't taught the kids python, but they move on to k-means algorithm, better than that neural networks algorithms. Wait a minute, kid if your 7 years old you probably don't know what 7 multiplied by 7 is, then how the heck do you do differential calculus? (Anyway how did you get past the LMS learning rule and the General Delta rule? Heck how would the average angry bird playing 7 year old know what a logarithm is?) The thing is, if you find whatever buzz words extremely confusing and can't understand what that meant after an extensive Google search, that's just the tip of the ice berg, because you could not have run a simple Adaline with out understanding the theory in that. Even PhD researchers have to scratch their heads when it comes to ML and AI, I know many companies have to hire mathematicians just to get their algorithms to be written down on the white board. Heck, how would chintu get through this ? ( If chintu could write a neural network himself at 7, he would never be paying for white hat jr.) So essentially this whole concept spreads from the Indian IIT rat race. Making a 6th standard boy to 12th standard maths and memorize sums. The problem is coding is not about what you know or can know , it's more about questioning and rethinking what you know. (It's not abt making or breaking stuff). If this pattern is repeated, it just enforces that same mediocrity in computer programming. Most of these kids who finish their white hat jr courses will probably not be able to code in actual python or javascript. Heck these people think java become famous because people play minecraft, you think linux (sorry it's GNU/Linux) became famous cause penguins were starting to die in antartica?? So now we come to a few weeks before from today. At that point I got very annoyed by the unrealistic white hat jr ads and adverts that kept popping up in my window. But ironically white hat jr, was doing one good thing, it was actually making people watch more free online content that actually had some quality time in them or a good read. It made kids do more, atleast try to learn a useful skill. But chintu can never get a job at Google for 150 crores per annum (edit: even Google VP makes salary of $710,000 per annum which is about 5.2 crore ruppees.), nor can he even get a simple technician job with any of those certificates as they don't have value. In simple language it is a plain legal scam, do not join it. Comments are welcome!! Thanks for the upvotes!! ",

            "answer_text": "One month ago, I was searching for some online teaching websites to utilize some extra time effectively for my children Ruhi (11 years) and Kajal (8 years). While I was scrolling down, I came across a 7 years old girl- Sharika Mahato, who developed the PEEK 1.1 DOOR APP. I was shocked by knowing how a 7 years old child can build an APP. It looks impossible, however, it is not. Kids like Sharika forced me to think that if they can do it, then my kid can also do it. I too started wishing the same for my daughter. I started looking for the platforms which teach coding to children. Fortunately, I found WhiteHat Jr. On the first day of online demo class, I sat along Ruhi to analyze the teaching format. It was quite good enough to enhance the coding skills of children. Even, she was looking excited and got totally involved in it. Teachers are informative and they make sure that a child may never feel the session to be boring. They make use of interesting games to teach coding. I can see improvements in my child\u2019s skills. WhiteHat Jr. also assists in improving the logical thinking of children, and my daughter is the proof for this as she has started asking me questions which I have never heard of from her before. WhiteHat Jr. is worthy of every penny. They also give money-back guarantees, if anyone doesn't find the classes useful. I think this situation will not come as they put efforts in delivering the best to the children. If your kid is comfortable with online classes, then enroll them in coding classes to secure their future and polish their skills. Thank you WhiteHat Jr. and the team for your dedication. ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr is a great platform when it comes to teaching coding to kids. Whitehat Jr is founded by ex-CEO of Discovery, Mr. Karan Bajaj, and within a span of two years, they have created a successful benchmark and is one of the most remarkable startups. WhiteHat jr offers live one-on-one online classes conducted by eminent professional teachers who teach sessions for one student at a time rather than having to divide their attention among many students and not being able to pay attention individually. Coding is also like any other skill. Coding is also fun and exciting if they are taught well. WhiteHatJr focuses on teaching kids early and keeps them technologically interested and updated. I hear 9-year-old kids are developing apps on WhiteHatjr, which is a good thing because they become aware of their potentials and how much they can learn and progress. The Curriculum of WhiteHat Jr. is thoroughly researched and is divided into 5 categories:- Age 5,6 - Beginner Age 7,8 - Intermediate Age 9,10,11 - Advanced Age 12,13,14 - Professional Age 15,16,17,18 - Applied Tech Kids are working on coding models, apps, game apps, etc. worthy of appreciation, considering doing this at such an age is a great thing. WhiteHat Jr offers AI courses for children aged six to 14 years. The app helps children learn computer programming and encourages them to create games, animations, applications, and more. They follow a thoroughly researched curriculum. The subjects range from the data structure, app, and game development to machine learning and space technology. My brother is also enrolled in Whitehat Jr, and it has been an excellent experience for him. My parents also attend an interactive session with the respective mentor assigned to my brother so that my parents can keep track of my brother's progress. It is really good that they make sure that they deliver value for the money parents invest by informing parents about the progress and scope of improvement for their kids.  ",

            "answer_text": "As there are many ads on TV and newspapers about WhiteHat Jr. and how they are teaching coding to young children from classes 1-12 , I am sure it has got many of us wondering what exactly is WhiteHat Jr. about? And do they actually teach coding to the young children and equip them with the right tools to develop apps, websites etc.? Well, I was one of them when I was searching for coding websites and courses for my 12 year old brother and we decided to try WhiteHat Jr. in order to see if they are even that good as they preach. After taking the demo class with my brother, I was absolutely impressed by their way of teaching and their idea of providing a demo trial class which allowed us to make an informed decision. After enrolling my brother in a program with WhiteHat Jr. I have never been disappointed by their services and it is surely a great platform to learn coding from for young children. They acquaint students with concepts like UI/Events, Logic structure, Turtle coding, space coding , etc. thereby, enhancing their knowledge and developing their intellect. I found WhiteHat Jr\u2019s curriculum bifurcation to be quite efficient with courses divided in accordance with the grades in which the child is studying such as: Beginner for class 1 ,Intermediate for classes 2-3, Advanced for classes 4-6, Professional for classes 7-9 ,Applied Tech for class 10 and above. Their one on one live teaching sessions are undoubtedly productive as students are able to understand better when the teacher concentrates only on one student enabling him to ask his doubts without being shy or hesitant. Their rewarding system truly inspires and motivates the students to learn with due diligence and focus. Their challenges such as The Silicon valley Challenge inspires the bright young minds to create unconventional ideas using their knowledge of coding. Seeing my brother develop his logical and analytical thinking with efficacy and seeing an increase in his creativity level , I personally through my experience feel that WhiteHat Jr. is one of the very best platforms teaching coding to the young children. WhiteHat Jr. is undoubtedly creating a whole generation of creators that will lead the AI driven world to come. ",

            "answer_text": "Closure of schools in the pandemic has led children to stick to phones or gadgets for the entirety of the day in virtue of their online classes. But this reason is quite frequently used as an excuse or to veil their wasteful activities on the internet. So why not turn this routine into an actually productive and learning experience? Coding is the new cool, the current trend in the economy. Understanding and realising its importance, even the government has introduced coding officially into the school curriculum. For all tech savvy kids, this might prove to be the best option to enhance their logical understanding and improve their intellectual approach. Not to forget that till the time they reach your age provided they follow coding religiously, they might be termed as the brains of the country having perfect and ample knowledge and experience in coding. Creating and monitoring programs will efficaciously give them a upper hand in the AI driven world. As of now, WhiteHat Jr has become one the of most famous and reliable platforms providing genuine mix of theoretical and practical knowledge to the young minds. Kids learn and grow under the guidance of trained professionals that too in 1:1 live and interactive session which also prevents any kind of digression on both ends. Even the aspiring engineers start their coaching couple of years before they actually enroll into it to have a firm grasp at the subject matter. So why not prepare your children before they actually have to face challenges in school? WhiteHat Jr teaches kids the fundamentals of coding logic, structure, and algorithmic thinking to help kids generate creative outcomes. Your kids can use code to build their own games, animation, and apps, fundamentally changing their relationship to technology from consumer to creator. One can go to YouTube searching for things to learn but will ultimately end up getting frustrated. What it lacks is not material but a systemised system for learning. WhiteHat Jr provides that maintaining professional and personal touch in a parallel manner. The curriculum is very intelligently designed keeping in mind the needs, abilities and capacities of children belonging to various age groups. The supervising is done by teachers who already have an expertise in the tech domain. WhiteHat Jr offers a wide range of online coding courses that make coding accessible to kids and young teenagers. They have developed programming courses that allow kids, teens and young adults to learn how to code at all ages in a systemised and supervised way. The courses offered by WhiteHat Jr are designed to teach kids to code with core programming skills, and then improve the proficiency of the kids coding languages. Their facilitators align digital literacy into coding courses, as required by the existing skills of the learners. The curriculum is developed by industry experts and the most important activity of teaching coding is done by top 99.9th percentile of certified teachers. This helps the learners to get high quality tech education and unfair advantage when joining the industry. WhiteHat Jr.'s coding courses are oriented towards coding and programming that covers the following spheres: The essentials of coding: Logic, Structure, SequenceTo create Websites, Animations & AppsHow to manipulate data using the programming languagesTo think of being a problem solverUnderstand how technologies converse with each otherThe curriculum is intelligently designed for kids belonging to various age groups. The list of different levels involved in it are: Beginners: (grade 1)Intermediate: (grade 2\u20133)Advanced: (grade 4\u20136)Professional: (grade 7\u20139)Applied Tech: (grade 10 onwards)Completion of these grades makes the students eligible for the following Certificates: Coding Basics: sequence, fundamental coding blocks, loops (1 month - 8classes)App Developer Certificate: events, UI/UX Conditionals, Complex Loop, Logic Structures (6 months- 48 classes)Advance Coding with space tech: space tech simulation in space lab, professional game design and many more (18 months- 144 classes)This was a detailed explanation of their functioning. What I would suggest is for you to go to the website and book a trial(first one is free) in order to clear all your doubts and misunderstandings. Do not let any kind of negative comments fool you or hinder your children from enhancing their logicality. Visit the website to decide on the basis of your understanding not letting yourself influenced by any comment on the social media handles. Hope this helps! ",

I am a developer and will answer from this perspective. I had lost my job and was desperate few months back to find any thing and everything. Though I am very much patient in my search now. I shared my interview experience on Medium[1] That's when I introspected. All they want is a 45 min scripted class. You need to mug up the script step by step. Line by line. The first thing as a teacher is you should have no mother tongue influence. Okay, mother tongue influence makes me a bad teacher? Maybe. There is a long pitch which you have to deliver at the end of each demo class. Their focus was more on the pitch than on my code. Even in industry one doesn't mug up code. One has to write logic to solve the problem. There is no teacher sitting at the other side of the screen to help you.  This post was shared by one of the parents.  Their advertisements to lure teachers claims to meet the financial goals of the teacher. There are no words like passion or interest in coding. How will a child learn to code when a teacher shows them how to think at every line. Typing on a screen is not coding. An easy work from home is amazing. But not at the costs of young minds. Now I think I was saved. In this era of joblessness any source of income is a boon. What if I would have been hired as the coding instructor? I would be still working for them. But in future if I want to join the industry again this experience of coding scripted games would take me nowhere. Image Source: LinkedIn Footnotes[1] http://\u201cWhiteHat Jr Interview experience.

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr is an awesome live online coding school for children. Many others do not even offer one-on-one sessions with real, not a robot or something automated, instructors. WhiteHat Jr, on the other hand, is a virtual yet hands-on type of educational institution. They keep their eyed on their students and they are available to answer questions. A lot of people still think that parents who would let their kids under 10 learn coding are irresponsible or are simply wasting their money. They\u2019re young, after all. They should be playing outside or watching TV. As a parent myself, I understand that kids absorb information and knowledge better and faster than adults. It will actually be easier for them when you start them young learning things as complex as programming or coding. Of course, I asked my daughter first whether she wanted to learn how to code. I explained to her what she can do and create once she has reached a professional level on WhiteHat Jr. Although I was the one who opened up the idea, she was the one who made a choice. I personally like WhiteHat Jr because they make it easy for us parents to understand what\u2019s going on. We see the curriculum way in advance. Kids would even receive official certifications each time they advance to the next level. As the actual student of WhiteHat Jr and the one getting first-hand experience with them, my daughter said she liked the teachers. She enjoyed the classes. Since live sessions are one-on-one, she is not embarrassed to ask whatever questions she needed to ask. She can get real-time answers too from a credible source, a top 99.9th percentile certified teacher! So yes, I am giving WhiteHat Jr my two thumbs up. They\u2019ve been great and have met my expectations so far. ",

            "answer_text": "As a computer engineer, it is really humiliating when some website comes up with an advertisement stating that some 6 year old Chintu can also learn coding and make their own apps. This kind of things put us in an inferiority complex and it makes us wonder what did we accomplish in engineering college? I had been learning programming since Class 9 in Java. Over the years I have learnt many more programming languages and built academic projects with teams of 2\u20136 people, personal mini-projects and I know how much amount of knowledge and team effort is required to do all these. And then suddenly one kid whose age is less than the number of years I have been coding comes up and tells they can learn coding from some website and built an app of their own. And apparently, angel investors will be fighting against each other in front of your house to invest in your product.  Hence I decided to check how authentic this website truly is and the best way to test it would be to attend their class. But I know I cannot attend their class since I don't look like a school kid anymore. But my brother recently passed out from school and I made him my guinea pig. I registered him as a Class 12 student and he did the rest. He created an account on the website and was looking to book a trial class. Now, do note that they advertise their free trial classes on the advertisement. But in reality, you cannot book that trial class. It shows that all the trial classes are booked and one had to buy the paid classes subscription.  A very nice marketing gimmick to attract students to their platform and then redirect them to the paid courses. But I decided to explore their courses and take a look at what they offered. The first one that caught my attention was on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  Where on Earth would you find a course priced at Rs 1 lakh? Can you imagine paying one lakh rupees for an online course? I mean, there are so many free platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Khan Academy and of course, YouTube where you get far better content. And yet they mention this as their 'most popular' course, tricking the parents to buy this one! There was another course on the landing page next to this for Python.  Eight classes cost Rs 6,000. What would they even teach you in eight classed? You'll learn absolutely nothing in 8 days. It takes a longer time get a grasp on a new programming language, specially if you are a school kid. I learnt Python during my second year of engineering from various online platforms but free of cost. And it definitely took me more than eight days. Truth be told, eight classes will cover nothing at all.  This proves that Whitehat Jr is on a mission to brainwash the young kids and deceive the parents into enrolling their children into these overpriced courses. The teachers at Whitehar are not even qualified. They recruit teachers without any coding experience as it is evident from their job posting.  Apparently no coding knowledge is required to teach coding. You can very well understand what your child will learn from them. They train their teachers on sales and marketing, how to convince the parents in buying their product rather than actually teaching them. This is the exact same thing, their parent company BYJU's does and Whitehat Jr is no different. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, I would say everything from my experience. I had a chance to experience WhiteHat Jr a few years back, when my cousin wanted to learn coding and after a lot of research we landed on WhiteHat Jr. Today I would like to proudly say that it was one of the best decisions I made. My cousin was so lucky to learn coding from such a prestigious institution. It gives you everything that you want to have to have a better and best learning. From a good tutor, to opportunities you can find it all. They were motivating my cousin every time he used to be upset or worried. WhiteHat Jr gives you a personal training where you alone with your tutor learn coding. There is a 1:1 teaching method that is offered here. I think this way of teaching is a must because there are kids who are not comfortable speaking in public, also there are kids who do not like to put their doubts in front of any peer member. This gives them an infinite platform to be themselves and clear each doubt they have in their mind. Also, if you are at a stage that you are not fully confirmed that you want to pursue coding as your career. They give you a trial class which is also a 1:1 teaching and you would have a chance to book a free trial class for yourself. You would get a glimpse of what you are going to learn in that one class. You can accordingly make up your mind. Also, they will give you a detail report about the child. How the child was during the class, his ability to understand coding, and much ad much more. They would also give you a certificate. They also give various incentives as a source of motivation. They have various tasks that you can complete by forming a clan with your friends. I think this also help you widen your network. The more you complete the tasks on time the more incentives you are most likely to achieve. So, I think this platform is a complete package that all the future coders should go through. ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr has been a huge blessing to my kids. I am honestly surprised why some people would think it isn\u2019t worth it. Two of my three children are currently enrolled in their classes. At first, I didn\u2019t think it would be worthwhile too. But then I saw how my kids\u2019 grades in school have significantly improved after a few months\u2019 of classes. And of course, they have gained a whole lot of coding knowledge and experience, too! While other coding institutions would probably just teach about the coding language and how to use it, WhiteHat Jr makes the child learn how to think and become creative. It\u2019s not as if you will be given a bunch of modules and videos to study. Instead, there are live 1:1 sessions with certified teachers who your children can communicate with directly. They can ask questions and get their practical exercises and exams evaluated. I have to admit that before WhiteHat Jr, my kids were average students in school. While I am happy with that, my spouse and their grandparents aren\u2019t. They have higher expectations from our children. While I want that as well, I supported what my children wanted to do. For as long as they are good people, even without amazing grades, I will be happy for them. When WhiteHat Jr happened, that\u2019s where I saw entirely different habits formed. They both look forward to studying now and I would even hear them talk to each about their activities and achievements. It was just natural for them. Perhaps because they are very young. They easily applied the logic and discipline they have learned from coding classes in their regular school classes. WhiteHat Jr accepts students from 6 to 14 only. My youngest son is only 4 years old. I don\u2019t know yet whether he will be interested in coding or programming. If he will be, I wouldn\u2019t think twice about enrolling him in WhiteHat Jr the day he turns 6. ",

I enrolled my daughter in one of their course few months back. Let me mention that I have bought the course only after the free trial session. It was my daughter\u2019s choice to go with Whitehat jr as she found her teacher really interactive. My daughter developed a keen interest in coding since when she saw one of my colleague\u2019s son doing it. The first day of my daughter, Jiya was pretty good. She was already been instructed about the course structure and curriculum. However, I was also been explained about the course structure which I really appreciate. They have divided courses according to the age of kids to make it manageable and easy to understand for students. Whitehat jr has 1:1 student teacher interaction to provide better attention to each and every student. Her teacher named Harshita Jain usually informs me about the progress of my daughter. The graph of her progress is going upwards, however, she never stays back to tell me where jiya was lagging. The communication I had with Harshita makes me understand my daughter well enough in academics. The doubt sessions and class hours are flexible and usually schedule by my daughter\u2019s routine. She never faced any kind of difficulty managing her school work and her coding assignments. Whenever, she wants some time for her school exam, Harshita reschedules her coding work so that she doesn\u2019t feel any kind of burden. They understand the value of your child\u2019s school work which is the best thing I found in Whitehat jr. My daughter has learned a lot from Whitehat jr and I am really happy to see her growing. ",

I checked a couple of their advertisements and this is what I concluded: Computer Science is a lot more than coding. The way WhiteHat Jr. has approached the subject of Computer Science is the typical Indian way of making kids memorize code blocks and syntaxes, but coding is more than just programming some pre-built app in a 45 minute class. It has got a lot to do with solving real world problems. They claim they teach SpaceTech and AI, Machine Learning to kids. I honestly don\u2019t think a kid would have the aptitude in mathematics to learn these kinds of things:  And if you think this is just some random image from the internet that I have pasted here to scare you, you are mistaken. WhiteHat Jr. boldly claims in their syllabus that they would teach regression, advanced statistics with Machine Learning to a kid in 10th grade. Seriously?? Even university level mathematics would not suffice to learn such concepts, in my opinion. And the claims about 13 year old kids and 9 year old kids getting jobs at Google are false. How can a 9 year old get a job at a FANG company if there are bucket loads of adult applications being rejected?? Google is hyper selective about whom they hire, and they want top talent. A mere WhiteHat Jr. certification simply cannot earn you a multi-million dollar job, it is the reality. India\u2019s top quality engineers are from the IIT\u2019s, right? Now, the way media hypes up the 1.5 cr packages itself is fake, because only about 5\u201310 engineers across all IIT\u2019s get such high paying jobs abroad. Then how can a 9 year old who hasn\u2019t even finished primary education learn AI and get such high salaries. It is nothing but a mere marketing tactic. They are playing with your mind by making it look like coding is a very advanced thing. It isn\u2019t. And there is a lot, lot more to computer science. A mere coder who can only copy paste and drag and drop code has a 0% chance of being hired by Google. There are much better sources on the internet. You only have to find them. And 90% of them are free. They also have the same syllabus. Don\u2019t waste your money on the very definition of a piece of crap- WhiteHat Jr. All the best! ",

Only problem they have is w.r.t the teachers. Some of their teacher are actually not up to the mark. They just read out like some robot. My friends daughter joined for a trial and the teacher teaching her, was so horrible. She went on putting this fake smile through out. Her teaching pattern was like a robot. The kid had a lots of doubts and still the teacher went on telling instead of solving the problem that she needs to try that herself. When the teacher herself doesn't know how to conduct the classes and solve student\u2019s problem then how can she expect the kids to understand. Worst experience. My friend even complained to their support team and all they gave an answer was we\u2019ll replace you with an other teacher. Find it so funny with this solution, because replacing the teacher will solve the problem for one particular child but not for other kids.The same teacher goes on to teach other kids and has the same bad impression on other kids. Note to WhiteHat team: You need to take the customer complains seriously and start keeping only good teachers with you, if you want to go long.Too much marketing and only giving education to make money is is not gonna do any good to you.",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll tell you the story of my nephew- he is a self-taught programmer. Curiosity and a little interest is what I think is needed to start programming, because he is very curious by nature. Back when he was in 6th grade, he was taught HTML, a popular language used to design web pages. When he tried it himself, he complained that his webpages never looked anything closer to what we actually see on the internet. So, he started digging deeper to find the cause and came across many languages in the course of 6 years. XML, CSS, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript and Python. He did go a little haywire in learning languages- he was just jumping from one language to another in every few days. Back then, he didn\u2019t know how to start programming. So, he just started everything that he came across. By the time he passed grade 10, he was familiar with XML, CSS, C, C++, Java and a little bit of Python. Then last year he joined WhiteHat Jr\u2019s coding courses. He was initially not sure about joining but he decided to start with the basic course and loved it. So he upgraded directly to the advanced space tech course instead of the intermediate one as the advanced course includes everything that\u2019s there in the basic and intermediate course. After completing the 144 sessions, he felt a sense of satisfaction that he\u2019d actually learnt something and developed his skills. It has been a year now. Today, he is proficient in all the above languages plus, working on various new languages and frameworks like Ruby, Flutter, Angular, PHP. He has interest in AI and machine learning and even full stack- he developed a hobby in that. He used to write things down in a notebook and has still kept it with him. We can say that he has developed an attachment and he is now aiming to even work for WhiteHat Jr once he graduates and gets a Master\u2019s degree in Computer Science. ",

I actually decided to take a demo class in WhiteHatJr!!! Even my father was quite curious about it\u2026. He agreed to this proposal\u2026.. So I attended a free class. At first, I found the environment quite peculiar\u2026. And it needed a very HIGH internet connection\u2026. I couldn't even attend the meeting Man, me and my father were like F this hat sh!t So I did a more of a research on it\u2026\u2026 First of all 1:1 teacher is to student ratio. Quite good huh??? But another thing, in the advertisement, they are showing that an 8 year old can create an app. Wait Wait Man\u2026\u2026. At age 8 I prolly didn't even know what is BODMAS!! All I know was basic addition and subtraction\u2026\u2026 I mean, with that limited knowledge, how can you touch the basic of it?? Forget making apps, even the basics include BODMAS\u2026. And in one videos related to WhiteHatJr, the teacher was telling that designing means making things attractive\u2026. Wow, explained in layman's terms\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Also looking at the advertisements, it seemed that they were teaching block based programming\u2026. I am not sure though\u2026 But the biggest culprits are the parents. I mean, you can be so mean to let your 8 year kid to join programming course. This is perhaps the greatest fault of our society\u2026. Parents always wants their wards to succeed someone else\u2026 Yup, greater than Sharma ji's beta? GREAT Worse than that? Worthless\u2026.. You can expect a fish to climb a tree, even if you give it RedBull. Every child is not same\u2026. Every child is not born with the intent of going to CS, Engineering, Medical, etc. There are a million things to do in this world\u2026. I have question to y'all\u2026. You can hear to the words of your neighbours, you can hear the words of your peers, you can hear the words of your colleagues, then WHY can't you give a damn to your child's words?? This scam is going further because of y'all\u2026. If we have not ventured into this scam of TEACHING CODING TO YOUNGSTERS, then they would not have gone this far\u2026 Stay tuned:) ",

But it would be good if you also have career counselors for guiding the parents and students.You give you a certificate for completing just 1 hour of free trial. The certificate is not useful, but also feels like cheating. Do you really need to do this?You tried to put my kid into a lower level coding course, which I got to know only when I contacted other coding companies. Hopefully this would be solved if you have career counselors.My kid is now learning Python and Javascript at another company, whose school kids were admitted to top colleges like Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, etc. She really enjoys it, so I am happy with my choice. Should I choose WhitehatJR or Coding Elements for teaching programming to my kid?  ",

I have told you 100\u2019s of times? did you revise what we read in last class \u201c\u201dLots of marketing thus good website etc..someone has to pay which is why the 22$ I pay for each class .Why do I do it? Kid gets a routine ( 2 classes per week) and hopeful that he may find interest in it which may help his STEM study later on.Its pricey yesss\u2026.If you know another platform let me know Im happy to have my kid try it, since there is no connection between teacher and him it doesn't matter if we go to another platform..at the other end there is just voice coming out so happy to try other platforms in future.They will give some marketing gimmicks about taking your kid to google..blah blah blah\u2026im so close to giving them earful the next time if I get a call.",

Upon asking people for recommendations I received demotivating replies. After months of looking around and browsing the net, I made no progress. That\u2019s when WhiteHatJr.\u2019s TV advertisement caught my attention. I immediately looked them up and booked a trial session. What actually made me interested enough to book a trial session right away was how their website projected their motives clearly and straightforwardly. They are driven by their mission and not the money. There is also a same-day 100% refund in case you want to withdraw your decision of investing in their course. Their reasons of contact are also highly defined. They promise to not contact, be it email, call or any other mode, for any other purpose other than to update you of your Child\u2019s progress. After thoroughly studying them, it seemed to me that at WhiteHatJr, they let the child be the scriptwriter, the director and the actor in his own play. Ofcourse, these were the things I noticed as someone who was going to invest in something. As a parent, the site itself was shockingly convincing. I, myself, as a parent found myself so engaged with everything they had on there. I went through reviews of parents and also of tutors at WhiteHatJr. and was amazed even more. But I decided to let my child decide for herself and waited for her to take her trial session before confirming on a course. I attended the session alongside my child just to watch her and I was surprised at how engaged I, too, was. It has been about 3 months since my daughter has started taking their course and she loves it. ",

            "answer_text": "Note that I do not have experience with whitehat jr in person but hope the below is useful. I am Software professional into core programming and having 17+ years of experience, I do believe I can give a good insight into the world of coding. Note that programming or coding is serious work and not all can take it up. It is upto to the kid if he/she has a real aptitude for it. If the kid is really interested, then I would suggest sites like pluralsight/udemy (not promoting any particular site here check for other options) which has courses for absolute beginners to enter the world of programming. Coming to whitehat jr, I don't understand why they just mention coding. Note that coding is one part of huge IT industry, to make a real impact one needs to understand other technical aspects of Computer Science. Of late, there is also a gradual shift towards low code solutions in IT industry but coding still remains relevant. Since I search for tech videos on youtube, I am bombarded with their ads featuring bollywood/cricket celebrities. My initial reaction was that these ads are laughable and I cannot take the platform itself seriously since it is spoken by celebrities who does not even know the basics of programming. For a change, I would have had a +ve attitude if they had shown some genuine ad sans celebrities who are in no way associated with coding. I am a parent myself and I can teach my kids better if they need to enter programming. I am into the profession myself and I will not be swayed by these laughable ads. ",

My Profile: I worked as a Software Engineer over 10 Years and worked as a Data Science Faculty. all my students are minimum B.Tech or Degree pass students. I worked in Python, Perl and PHP etc. I really wonder, what the students can learn? can they learn?. My observation is like this, I have seen Computer (PC ) in my Post Graduation, but now even kids know how to play with Laptop/PC/mobile phones. So students can learn. yes they have difficulty in understanding Trignometry /calculus / algenra etc. But, I never used these in my coding at all !!2. Whitehat is creating environment, where kids can learn some thing in coding. Actually Whitehat, does not mention any Programming Language or name of any database, eventhough \u201cCurriculum\u201d looks beautiful !! Good Layout of a Building, but No material to build any house from that !! 3. This is like learning playing Video games like \u201cTemple run\u201d. These courses probably creating interest among kids, and for \u201cprogramming\u201d. probably reducing fear !! 4. what is misleading is, A) jobs after this course b) jobs for childrens ( actually, minimum age for job is 21 in IT companies, some relax for 18 years c) huge salaries. 5. Sachin played international cricket at age of 16, A.R rehman is a music director at age of 15. so Age is just a number Conclusion: Intention of whitehat might not be wrong, but results may be disastrous. Just Eg: Learning 9 Years kids become Doctor and doing Operation of Heart !!. ",

            "answer_text": "So, I came across this Instagram post (IGTV) a few days back:(Read if interested)  Now this man here, does not comment on whether WhiteHatJr is a scam or a genuine organisation. This man here, elegantly exposes how the Marketing Team of this organisation, silently exploits the mentality of most Indian parents.  Now, I\u2019ll brief here what I mentioned in the above image: So, WhiteHatJr, very smartly, exploits this attribute of India parents wanting their children to over-achieve, the attribute of parents maintaining their reputation on the basis of their child\u2019s marks. \u2018Sharmaji ka launda toh 95% laya. Tumse toh sirf 90% ho rahe hai? Bas phone pe lage raho aur!\u2019 [Translation: Sharmajis son(a household surname in India\ud83d\ude1c) has scored 95%. And you struggle to score even 90%? Keep using your phone!] This aspect of wanting children to over-achieve isn\u2019t seen in any other parents in the world. Take American parents for an instance, children over there become financially independent by the age of 18. (While studying in a premier college) Whereas in India, a person of 18 years of age hardly has any life skills. He/she totally depends on their parents for basically everything. Financial independence is a distant thing, we don\u2019t even know most finance related terms. I know I\u2019ve gone off-topic, but I felt like this is worth saying. Speaking about WhiteHatJr, I don\u2019t know whether they are a scam or whether their services are good, but I do know that the Marketing and Advertisement team exploit and hit the right spot in the Indian parent\u2019s minds when they watch their advertisement. Thank you for reading!    Would like to express my opinion through memes. \ud83d\udc46 So, 2 comments which have puzzled me: By \u2018@\u2019Adarsh Pandey : \u2018I would like to elaborate your answer sir. White hat jr is actually a scam. I being in grade 8 applied for their online trial class and they promised to provide me with a certificate. I didn't get any certificate though the class was quite good the price of the courses that they offered was very high. It was 750 INR per class. That was too much when you can get better teachers on edX, YouTube or Udemy, the list is quite long. So, I don't think that it matters whether they teach good or bad if they are financially exploiting you, hence they are a scam.\u2019By Angad Dube : I have a neighbor, who is learning coding since 1.5 year from white hatjr. he is placed in Amdocs at the age of 18, with a package of 15 lakhs. Many people in the comments section said that Whitehat Jr let's kids create app basically through an already made inventory. Use Google Appsheet for free instead. \ud83d\ude09 Edit: Have a look at this:  Zoom in and have a read. (He\u2019s getting my comments deleted.) Fox Gupta and Wolf Gupta and all are exposed. ",

(it\u2019s *such* an easy biz-tactic: just get parents who are at gunpoint because all they want is a good future for their kids, and\u2026suck em dry! - Should be SHOT, these guys!!) If your kid is interested in coding, try this (it\u2019s completely FREE!): The Coding Train That kind of thing makes it FUN - without that, no kid will ever learn. I know! :) Also check out these: Tell Stories. Build Games. Learn to Program. Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share (beware of this one, this \u201cblock-based\u201d or whatever, coding is a Bad Thing!) And as soon as your kid is about Class 6 or so, introduce him/her to An open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories - it\u2019s absolutely lovely :) If you can, try buying a paper book - it\u2019s tremendously expensive for a book, but THIS is what your kid needs. Just take my word for it :) Once your kid is a bit older, say Class 8 or so, get him/her to check out Processing - Processing.org I think this would be a REALLY cool way to get into programming, exploring further :) Once again, there are paper books - many of them, the one in that link is not as expensive as the Twine one! :) Please make sure to install and do all your programming on the LINUX Operating System (it\u2019s Free! :) ). EDIT: All the \u201cWhitehat is great\u201d posts on over here seem to have been written BY WHITEHAT THEMSELVES - there can be no doubt about it, from the sheer NUMBER of them which all basically say the same thing!

And take legal action against them for it? :) ",

The way of teaching and making kids understand the concepts in great. Overall its a very good online class and you can choose if your kids has interest towards computer programming, robotics etc. Yes they need high speed internet because its needed as its live interactive session. The only thing that may stop you is the high fee. High fee is understandable for advanced course packages but starting packages should be introduced with at-least 40% low fees and we do not need a live teacher for every class at the beginning. A parent can read the instruction and help his/her child to understand and finish the course. Once a child develops a keen interest then they can provide a live teacher and can charge this much. But in the beginning don\u2019t its very costly to pay INR 750 per class. ",

One day, I was just searching over the internet regarding a query of JAVA, and I came across Whitehat Jr. With a desire to know more about this, I clicked over the Ad and found that it is an online teaching platform that teaches coding to kids. Competition has become so tough that even kids are enrolling for coding classes. I have a son who is 6 years old. My son loves technology so I decided to give it a try. On any random day when he was free, I scheduled his trial class with Whitehat Jr. just to get an idea- what they actually teach to children. We both were astonished by the way they engaged my son into the demo class with some interesting and innovative ways to do programming. As it was a trial class so they didn\u2019t get into the detail of the topic. They kept the class casual with some basic knowledge of coding. The class was really worthy. I and my son both loved the way the instructors put their efforts into the online class. Now, he is the part of the pilot program where he is clearing his basic concepts of coding. He is very impressed with this kind of initiation where he can pursue his passion along with his academic studies. He never misses the lecture and keeps on describing me to the whole class once it is over. I must say the team of Whitehat Jr. is doing a good job in shaping the careers of technology lovers. My son Vishal is happy with his classes and is looking forward to building an app. I would be the proud mom when he will achieve his goal at such a tender age. Thank you Whitehat Jr. for emerging the coder from my family. ",

They scheduled their trial classes without any input from either her or any of their elders. And they shared with me, a snapshot of what happened in the so called coding class. They were taught so called hacking. They were taught about how to buy an ipad for 0 rupees. A simple dom modification to alter the price in Amazon webpage. And the teacher told them that how to buy for that price, they will teach later on. And from there on, the torture started. Calls, messages, whatsapp on my sister's mobile number. Tired, and totally out of sorts, she called me and I asked her to give them my number. Had a Frank chat with them and asked them to shove their plans to the place where the sun doesnt shine. Yet to hear back. So basically, the business they are into is not education at all. Their business is simply making money from gullible parents. If the parents are willing to pay if their kid gets a job at Google, they are going to promise exactly that. They are just selling you a picture of your own dreams for your kid. More than the kid, it's you who is being sold something totally useless. ",

Yes , you read it correct, yesterday I got call from my uncle saying that his son took a free trial class from WhiteHat Jr and what he said next ,shocked me, those teachers in the first class (free trail class) had taught them how to change the price of a product in Amazon. I was like WTH!! ,so those who know how to inspect a web page know that this is a simple stuff,but what might go into a kids head ,he might think that he has done some great thing and if parents of those kids who dont know about this ,they also think that this is a great thing for a little kid to do in his first class itself. So if your kid want to learn a magic trick ,tadaaa take only WhiteHat Jr free trial class, if you enroll even after this magic free trial,then they will do magic on your money !!!! Here is the link to the video where I have shown how we can change the product price on Amazon( basically inspecting the web page). PS : The change done by inspecting a web page doesn't get reflected in backend,or simply put this change happens only on our side and until you reload the page.  ",

            "answer_text": "Since One of the answer by Siddh Raman Pant already covered a lot why whitehat jr is fooling around, I would just like to add few more things to it. The cost of the cheapest course is about 5K to 6K INR and that too for grade 1 students. Now if you go to coursera and see the price of Machine Learning course by Stanford University by Andrew Ng which is of 11 weeks is just for about 4K INR. And in case you don\u2019t know Andrew Ng is like one of the gods of Machine Learning and Deep Learning tech. I don\u2019t think these whitehat jr teachers comes anywhere near Andrew Ng and neither the knowledge they are providing will ever worth more than him to charge that much price. Even udemy provides far better full courses for just about 350\u2013700 INR.Now the next thing is a bit of a common sense, as a kid of grade 1 I should be more interested in playing computer games rather than making computer games. And actually that\u2019s how we all learned to use a computer, right!!. The interest in making computer games comes naturally and out of curiosity. Just tell me which of the two things below will make a kid want to use a computer a game or a code  But few idiots won\u2019t understand. They just want to make fool of people who don\u2019t know that there are many free tutorials available on youtube itself which can make you a far better coder than what this whitehat Jr can ever do.",

It\u2019s been very long I have been searching some online portal which can provide online classes related to languages to the kids and finally I got stick to WhiteHat Jr. when I checked WhiteHat Jr. website it impacted a lot to me as it was something which is designed by IT specialist for bright future of kids and are trying to remove fear of coding from their heart. My daughter Samiksha age 14 years is in class 9th. She is very intellectual and brilliant student. Where coding fears the kids my daughter Samiksha play with codes very efficiently. It really seems great when you see your kids best utilizing their time rather than killing it. Basics of C++ were taught to her in school. To add-on in her interest and efficiency I let her opt an intermediate course at WhiteHat Jr. She joined it on 20th December 2019 and she is successfully moving on with the classes whenever she is getting time without hampering her school assignments and task.She conveys me that the curriculum designed is very interesting and tutors are very interactive which makes learning process very efficient and comfortable. Till now she has designed a static website with working contact us form with the help of php coding. Flexible timings, refund facility and one to one session with the faculties makes this portal different and unique from all others which are running in the market. Samiksha already was very much interested in performing calculations and coding but sometimes her silly errors minimize her efficiency and level of output but WhiteHat Jr. not only help her to move on step by step and understand the algorithms or problems cautiously but also improve here critical and intellectual thinking. Positive experiences must be shared to let others get right direction and motivation. ",

            "answer_text": "I was left astonished when my friend-Ajay told me about his son Sanchit- a young game developer. Ajay said that 3 months back, he enrolled his son in online coding classes. He went to a few of the platforms which provide online teaching to kids, but he was looking for something that may provide learning with fun. So, he found Whitehat Jr. Initially, his son was not in accordance with him to join any online classes because he found studies boring. When my friend requested his son, he agreed and attended the demo class. I just met his son last week. I was unable to relate that boy in the demo class and the boy which was in front of me. He was looking studious and intelligent. I was like- how this happened! Then, Ajay revealed that it was all due to the efforts and dedication of Whitehat Jr. who transformed his son completely. The teachers are very patient and they never frustrate on any kind of query brought by children. They deal with them like their own children. He is still attending the classes 3 days a week. Upon asking about Whitehat Jr., he said that their teaching techniques about coding are quite simple and instructors teach children in a friendly manner with which they neither hesitate nor feel monotonous. It is a one on one session and a practical way to teach coding to children rather than just making notes. I am impressed by watching the journey of his son. I will definitely be visiting this website for my daughter. She is in class 5th and struggling in computer science. I want her to excel in computers due to the rising graph of the digital world. I hope Whitehat Jr. may solve her problem forever and she might take the subject as interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "According to a research 90% of parents want their child to study computer science. However, only 40% of schools teach computer programming. In order to make your kid keep up with the ever-changing tech world, you should enroll them with a professional brand that focuses solely on teaching coding to school kids. Now, kids have their own school timings, their homework and playtime to cover. So taking online classes, without the hassle of going out, would be a very convenient way. WhiteHat Jr is a great option in that case. I would like to recommend this amazing platform because of the following reasons, there may be a lot but few I would like to mention here: 1) Take the course live 1:1: Sitting at home and enjoying the live video classes in the comfort of your home with help from highly qualified teachers. Courses are done via live streaming so that students can provide real-time feedback and queries.You can choose time slots for the classes as per your convenience. 2) Visual Blocks to take coding baby steps: Using block-wise learning programs starting from the beginners to applied tech. These fun and interactive activities help your child learn the concepts of logic, sequencing, data structures and algorithm. 3) Quality of teachers: They repeatedly receive incredible feedbacks on the quality education of the teachers from parents and children. All the teachers are highly trained in unique and original proprietary curriculum. Also coding with teachers helps your child to improve academic performance, and build soft skills. Most of WhiteHat Jr\u2019s students have also developed mobile games and apps, that are live on Google Play Store. You can book a free trial class with them to know more. ",

            "answer_text": "So far, WhiteHat Jr has been exceeding our expectations when it comes to my child\u2019s coding classes. I was actually surprised that they\u2019re really doing the one-on-one lessons. I thought this wasn\u2019t exactly easy since they have plenty of students. But they do give time for each child enrolling in their courses and that made me appreciate this online school very much. It is worth every dollar I spent. However, it still boils down to why your child wants to learn to code. If it\u2019s simply out of curiosity, peer pressure, or he or she thought it was all about playing and games, then a course such as those found in WhiteHat Jr might not be the best choice. But if your child truly wants to learn for the purpose of building something or creating his own apps, games, webpages, and so on, then programming and coding lessons from WhiteHat Jr is definitely the best choice. My child has been with WhiteHat Jr only for one week now. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to learn too many things since he\u2019s taken exactly 4 classes only. But he already can\u2019t stop talking about his lessons and how he\u2019s excited about this and that class. He already has plans for what he will be creating and building for his exercises. This kind of enthusiasm I rarely see in him when it\u2019s his usual academics. I\u2019ve seen some reviews about WhiteHat Jr that when kids start studying here, they improve their arithmetic, logic, comprehension, and other skills. This is the primary reason I enrolled my child here. He said he wanted to learn how to code, and just like any parent, I thought twice when I saw the course price. But considering the lessons they offer and these other skills my child will learn, of course, we\u2019re taking the chance. I am very satisfied so far. ",

The trial course was not at all engaging and also they also blamed net speed issues, even though there's no issues for other learning sites with the same net speed. The teaching quality is far lower then the high price they were asking! The highest one so far among all the alternatives and average quality. Also they're very rude. Keeps on calling and forcing from early morning onwards, doesn't even respect time scheduling! Harassed my brother and when he blocked the no, they started hounding me thinking I'm the child's parent (I'm her aunt but that was still so annoying experience!). This level of irritation and forcing parents to cough up the money was a huge turn off! And their nonstop ramblings about sending kids to google is just pathetic. Now my niece (age 6) is learning from a computer teacher at a reasonable price and from other online youtubers and she's able to make simple games and apps! She's very happy with her teachers and always eager to learn more about codings \ud83d\udc97 ",

            "answer_text": "I came across this ad by WhiteHat Jr. a few months ago and decided to dig deep on the internet regarding whether or not it's worth the hype. Went through a lot of mixed reviews so decided to let my nephew, Rian, try it out before making a firm opinion about it. Here's what my takeaway was: 1. No, it's not going to make my nephew the next Bill Gates and you can't be expecting that of your child. My nephew enjoys the 1:1 sessions and it's an amazing course for getting him started. I do believe Rian has enough potential to achieve something big and WhiteHat Jr. is helping him in the right direction. 2. Many parents get their children enrolled for language classes at a young age as it helps them grasp faster and learn better. It's the same with getting your child into coding at a young age. Rian was always interested in coding as I myself am a programmer. He was inquisitive to understand my job which is why I decided to introduce him to WhiteHat Jr. Not once did he feel any sort of pressure and has been enjoying. 3. The pricing is as good as it can be. If you expect to have a course and curriculum as great as the one provided by WhiteHat Jr. at anything less, I would say you are expecting way too much. Other than this, the faculty is well qualified and honestly, I couldn't find anything negative in spite of trying very hard to look. We are all entitled to our opinions and according to me, WhiteHat Jr. is a great platform for coding for children. ",

            "answer_text": "Luckily, my child has a keen interest in coding which made me happier because I too love coding and it is the most secured option career wise. With a desire to make my child champ in coding, I looked for some of the best online platforms to make her learn coding. I went through a few teaching websites, but none found to be suitable for my daughter. She is in 6th standard right now and I don\u2019t want to put extra burden on her. So, I was searching for a kind of platform which may offer 2-3 days of class on a weekly basis. One of my friends whose daughter was also taking online classes for coding referred me WhiteHat Jr. I went through it. This website was exactly what I was looking for. When my daughter took her first demo class, she built a great interest in coding. I must say WhiteHat Jr. is a genius in building the child's interest and to nurture the skills in coding. They offer one on one session which is quite commendable. My daughter was fully into it and loves the way she is taught. When she received the certificate for completing the trial session, she was over the moon. This motivated her to do better in the upcoming classes. No nervousness or hesitation; in fact, she was very active in her online session. I saw quick improvements in my daughter; her basic skills were covered in the few classes which included fundamentals, loops, and sequence. This is all due to the highly skilled professionals who use innovative tricks to build the interest of children in the session. I must say- investing money on WhiteHat Jr. is quite worthy; you will never regret your decision. I recommend WhiteHat Jr. to all the parents and students. Kudos to the team and efforts which they put into for laying the strong foundation for kids. ",

So my sister asked me to find something suitable for her. So I thought of recommending some books to my niece which might help her. Later, I felt that kids' attention span might not last for a long time if she just kept on reading about coding. I decided to then find an online coding course as the teacher will make it interesting and interactive session which will keep her interested. I surfed through the web and came across WhiteHat Jr. I read about the benefits coding has on a child's brain. On realising the benefits it had I wanted to get my niece into a coding course to as well as I didn't want her to feel that is she is not as good as other children of her age. Coding makes our children a creator of technology rather than a consumer.  WhiteHat Jr teaches coding to kids of ages 6 -18. So they have this method of 1:1 teaching which will be really impactful for my niece or beginners in general.The main aim of teaching children how to code is to improve their logical, structural, and algorithmic thinking abilities. They provide a wide range of courses from mobile application development, space-tech coding to a lot more. They offered us a free trial class which was a satisfactory experience as the teacher was punctual and friendly. We received a reminder call as well which was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "You have already got some reviews from the parents. Whether WhiteHat Jr is a good or bad platform depends on your target and achievements. Recently, my daughter Sara completed her \"Advanced course\" from WhiteHat Jr, and she has an outstanding experience. WhiteHat Jr coding course is an absolutely unique course and kudos to the instructors! Sara has developed a strong interest in coding after doing the WhiteHat Jr course. Her logical thinking is sharper and can now easily relate to structures and algorithms, and wants to create new real-world programs by herself. It gives students the benefit of learning to code from their home.  Review : Overall experiences from WhiteHat Jr Classes : Sara loves her 1:1 online live classes; she has an excellent understanding of her instructor. WhiteHat Jr divides the advanced curriculum in 3 modules [Total 144 classes]. Curriculum : WhiteHat Jr has a structured curriculum for 6-14 years of kids. Check out the curriculums before enrolling in a course. It's a kid-friendly curriculum. Quality of Instructor : Sara\u2019s instructor (Poonam mam) was an IIT (Bombay) graduate who also worked in an IT firm. Besides her job, she connected with WhiteHat Jr to teach programming. So, my kid got someone as her instructor, who was well-trained and had professional experience. Support : I got some excellent suggestions from Poonam mam to continue the coding practice of my kid. Still, Sara contacts her instructor when she faces any difficulties during her coding practice. Expectation Vs. Reality Programming learning is a continuous process. Don't expect that a coding course will make your kid a programmer. Lots of practice, problem-solving, and sacrifice makes a programmer. Programming doesn't make your kid Einstein. They don't make them Bill Gates or Mark. For that, they need to learn Business. ",

I dont care if madhuri dixit\u2019s kids have done coding and who ever did coding etc. Stop sending ur desperate mails, texts and whatsapp. You are bound to loose 80% of ur clients only cz of ur desparation. U r literally bombarding non stop with ur emails, mails, texts and even automated calls. 2) not many people have enrolled for the course so its really hard to get an honest feedback. I checked company\u2019s profile on glassdoor as i believe a good company will always have happy employees. To my utter shock, almost all the reviews even on glassdoor are fake. Anyone can tell that. It looks like they have copy pasted canned notes from somewhere. I am a reader and observer since a long long time and i can tell by reading reviews here on quora and glassdoor that they all fake and many of them are even similar which makes it evident they are copy pasted. Its because of their deseprate marketing strategy and fake canned reviews that am taken aback. I still cant say if the course is worthit or not, please do some research bfre anyone invests in their courses. For me, its a no no cz of their dishonesty on the reviews and desparate behaviour.. ",

One such creative change of teaching coding to toddlers is being brought into action by WhiteHat Jr. Making the kids between the ages of 6-14 years is a challenge in itself as they have a very short retaining power, but the professionals at this Ed-Tech corporation are well trained to reap the benefit out of this situation. When I first went through their website, all I could focus on were the huge accomplishments their students had achieved at such a young age. The path these kids are headed on is full of success and glory as coding and Artificial Intelligence are the two skills which are in huge demand these days. But learning coding has its own benefits other than helping in shaping your career. It makes you more creative as well as increases your logical perception. The cherry on the icing about WhiteHat Jr. is that it delivers only one-to-one sessions so as to concentrate the class entirely on sole student. It not only helps in doubt clearing but also in ensuring the interest of the kid doesn\u2019t get reduced along the way. Another interesting thing is the weekly and monthly assignments which include making your own game or building a program through simple code blocks. This really gets the kid hooked on coding and he doesn\u2019t think of them as assignments because he enjoys doing it. WhiteHat Jr. is doing a tremendous job and I really wish there was something similar when I was kid. It would have given me a huge head-start in life. Alas, we can\u2019t change the past but we can ensure that the younger generation makes the most out it this terrific opportunity.  ",

As a student who spends most of his day coding and working on a multitude of software projects, i can personally assure you, that company is sh*t, oh and dont worry, every single NIT/IIT/Whatever college you could find is probably sh*tier than the courses found online, but that doesnt change the fact that this WhiteHat Jr. is a legal scam that engages in false advertising Its cringy name is more than enough to demonstrate what kind of a product it is offering, any one involved in software would agree that all this \u201cWhiteHat/BlackHat\u201d courses you find online And here is the biggest deal of it all, Kids, dont, need, to, learn to code.Trust me, the average <14 year old neither holds the capability nor interest in regards to software development, its simply pointless and kills of their time, rudimentary education is all thats needed for a child of that age, not excessive pressure from obsessed and desperate parents. Oh and the parents, boy do i not completely despise and hate the average indian parent with every single cell of my body, trust me, i am not whining, but you would agree with me if i say contemporary indian parents are almost always younger versions western boomers who almost always try to block their younger kids from accessing a pc or mobile with their own privacy, that single action, that always ruins any form of possible interest in software from forming in the child If you are going to tell me making your son go to 10s of coaching classes throughout his teenage for entrance examinations, bullcr*p like calculus and thousands of other bulls*it that is completely irrelevant in most software sectors is \u201cpart of making him a \u2018software engineer\u2019\u201d or whatever, you are stupid, you ruined your son\u2019s life and the only thing he may end up at best is some shitty service based IT company and type his way through the rest of his life. Yeah, all those hours you put in to studying how integrals work and organic chemistry wont come in handy when you are trying to learn how sql engines work, and for some reason, the 60 year old sharmajis deciding this country\u2019s education policies continue to believe calculus actually f*cking matters for cse students trying to get in some good nit with decent facilities Should Math be a Prerequisite for Programming? - Linux.com God i should stop with this rant already, i hope you got it tho, this company is shit and cs education in india is an even bigger pile of shit.

            "answer_text": "I will answer it with one of my twitter posts.  White hat junior only teaches you to drag and drop. It makes children use specific templates to make an app. But coding is much more than that. When everyone says that coding is important, it doesn't mean that you should know how to make an app. Learning coding moulds your brain into thinking in a different way which helps in many life challenges. For example, there is a concept called recursion. Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the solution to a problem) in terms of (a simpler version of) itself. When you solve a problem, initially you think about what you have to do first and then the next step and so on. But in recursion you first have to think where do you have to stop or the base case as we call it meaning where you have to end. For example, if you have to find the factorial of a number n, (factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than the number) you would multiply n by factorial of n-1 but you would have to set the base case as when it reaches 2 or 1 (because any number multiplied by 1 is the number itself) it has to stop. Thus you are thinking about the end first. This is just one example. So I would recommend not teaching your children coding through platforms whose primary motive is to teach children their drag and drop feature in the name of building apps. Instead start with teaching them a programming language and making small programs from them. I would recommend from youtube for a start and then professional courses. ",

In the face of these changes, it becomes imperative to tweak the educational curriculum for children as such that they become creators rather than just consumers of technology. WhiteHat Jr., founded in November 2018 by former Discovery Networks CEO Karan Bajaj\u2019s startup focuses on kids aged between six and 14 years and enables them to learn coding online in live one-on-one classrooms from anywhere in the world. WhiteHat Jr. is an excellent platform to hone a kid\u2019s coding skills. That\u2019s not it. There\u2019s more. Much more. A good platform for learning isn\u2019t that easy to make, and Whitehat Jr. is one hell of a great one. They teach students coding through one-on-one video classes with instructors that offer AI courses for children. It focuses on teaching coding for kids aged between 6\u201318. It has recently joined hands with Byju\u2019s and is now the world\u2019s biggest ed-tech platform. In 2020, it has around 4 lakh certified students and due to the recent collaboration with Byju\u2019s, the team has become invincible. It is a great platform for teaching kids coding in an interactive manner. From app and games development, space technology to the data structure, and machine learning, WhteHat Jr. offers a fulfilling curriculum for students depending on the grade in which they study. The different curriculums of WhiteHat Jr. are divided very conveniently and this makes it easier for parents to select the ideal curriculum for their children. One thing which I liked the most is the demo sessions and refund facility provided to the customers to have an experience of what kind of tutors, curriculum, and study pattern is followed by White Hat Jr. authorities to teach them. There may be multiple coding platforms offering coding classes to kids, but this platform has an innovative approach towards learning. Their teachers are selected based on a 99.9 percentile selection criteria. This ensures that only the most top-quality teachers are selected for being a part of their team. This platform has overall, been satisfactory for my child and I would definitely recommend it to parents whose kids want to learn. It's time to make learning to code for kids- more fun! Thanks! ",

That is a fair amount to be worried about but Karan decided to do something about it. When he learnt in depth about coding from MIT and leant that the analytic and problem solving skills are needed and which are highly essential for today\u2019s generation kids. When researched furthur he found that there were hardly any in organizations doing something about it. Karan says that the problem solving skills and analytic skills required in solving coding will help steer the child\u2019s future. As far as the platform is cosidered, it is meant to be suitable for the mental age of the child so that nothing goes over his head. Few Simple examples are of this 9 year old girl and this boy . If they can, everybody can. The curriculum is itself designed in such a way that everything is caught well by the child in the 1:1 attention he/she gets.  That\u2019s the overall eagle eye view I can give you, for any furthur assistance I think you can contact directly and by attending the FREE Demo Class they give you ",

Time and money both are equally important and they know the worth of it that\u2019s why Whitehat Jr has come with the unique concept of 1:1 online teaching classes The course and teachers both are certified. The courses are categorized into four parts based on the student\u2019s age and the complexity of the topics in them. Kids will start learning programming through puzzle and game-based activities. They are as follows 1. 5 to 6 years of children-, this is marked as the beginner level where they teach core-programming concepts. 2. 7 to 8 aged group kids- This is an intermediate curriculum where children are exposed to some advanced concepts of algorithm that enhances reasoning ability in them. 3. 9 to 11 years students- Now comes the advanced course curriculum. In this, students create a responsive web app. They get a better understanding of AI and machine learning. 4. 12 to 14 years of students-, These students become eligible for Professional courses where they get an idea of Python programming and data science. Proper stratification of courses with age groups just not add skills in the children but also give them lifetime career opportunities that they can create by themselves for themselves that will benefit huge people.

I was introduced to WhiteHat Jr online platform by my brother who is a software engineer, when I was fed up with a very annoying habit of my son to use his mobile phone continuously. He suggested why not divert his mobile dedication towards something fruitful, innovative, and interactive. Resulting, amongst a list of suggested online platforms by him, we went for WhiteHat Jr as we both were impressed by its uniquely designed curriculum, future benefits and teaching methods. I discussed it with my son, explaining how learning to code will be a great source of improvement in his logical and abstract thinking and this time he will be the creator of games and apps and others will use it. He very much liked the idea and got ready for the trial session. We decided to have a session on Sunday to have opinions from all family members before the finalization of the portal. My son said, \u201cmom, I genuinely loved the calm attitude, engaging teaching method and ease in communication with WhiteHat Jr mentor\u201d. Finally, with positive feedback from all, my son enrolled for a beginner\u2019s program at WhiteHat Jr. as suggested by the tutor. It really brings a smile on my face when I saw my son performing great and remaining involved in something of worth. Well, I hope my experience will help you out and your child will experience a tremendous improvement in his overall growth, which will be noticeable to all. And also, if you have any other queries, then you can clear it out by opting trial session of WhiteHat Jr. at no cost. ",

            "answer_text": "Coding is one of the most important skills to have in the 21st century. Every job that you want or you want your children to have, are going to be directly affected by their ability to code. Countries such as Russia and Canada have understood the importance of teaching children how to code and have made it compulsory for children to start coding from grade 1. Our government has also made a similar decision, and made coding a compulsory subject for students from grade 6. If Kids today start learning to code when they are young they are always going to be ahead of the competition. Knowing how to code converts your child from consumers of technology to creator of technology. Coding not only helps you converse with computers but also helps you improve your logical thinking, abstract thinking and creative skills.  There are a lot of websites where you can enroll your child to teach them how to code, but I would recommend you have a look at WhiteHat Jr. They not only teach your child to code but also helps then improve their creative and logical thinking. They teach coding with the help of animations and games, so that your child not only learns how to code but also enjoys the process. They teach their lesson from scratch. They conduct 1:1 live sessions so that the students can ask queries anytime throughout the lesson. The top 0.1% of the applicants are only selected as tutors, and they focus more on project based learning rather than bookish learning. By taking 3 classes a week, they ensure that children are able to mange their course as well as their schoolwork. Check out the Trial class and I'm sure you won't take a step back. You'll move forward and choose your course in the curriculum. I'll show my big thumbs up for WhiteHat Jr. ",

            "answer_text": "TLDR: Why you shouldn\u2019t even consider WhiteHat Jr.1) A complete unnecessary burden on any child in an already very tough competitive Education System2) Same or Better content available online for free The state of the education system is already extremely hostile. We Indians have a culturally habit of taking a pride in our academic achievement due to which our current state of the education system is so competitive that young students are forced to study 10+ hrs every day for years in the hope of getting in good colleges Failure to do so seems like the end of life to many. At the age where you need to find about yourselves of what you like or dislike and discovering about yourself of what you would like to do in life, most of the teenagers are deprived of this option because our society dictates that only good academic performance can act as a benchmark for success. We have created an environment that is so hostile that students basically kill themselves and throw themselves in studying every day because the next guy is doing the same. But what is the result of this, most college students when entering college don't have any kind of personality because they were busy studying and knowing of laws of Physics and Nature but had no time of knowing who themselves really are. They are shy and awkward. This leads to many resenting Engineering and realizing later that would like to do something else with their lives. We are already have created an environment when students as young as Grade 8th are attending FIITJEE, ALLENS, Aakash, VIBRANT etc. I am afraid WhiteHat Jr. might also initiate a snowball effect where kids as young as 1st and 2nd grade are expected to learn to code.

            "answer_text": "Until a few years back, I didn't even know that such an amazing platform exists. Though I'm a programmer, I was unaware of any facility like such for kids. During her leisure time, my daughter (8 years old) used to paint, play games, and spend a hefty amount of time watching the television. I always used to encourage her to learn and gain knowledge. But she never used to sit focused for any longer than just half an hour. After all, kids are kids! I always felt her weekends and vacations going into vain in useless things. One day, at the dinner table, my husband told me about the suggestion of his colleague for our daughter. He advised my husband to introduce our daughter to coding. Along with being a trendy topic, coding is loved by most of the kids. We decided to introduce the concepts to our daughter so that she could practice the problems during her free time. But the problem was how to introduce a kid to the new and difficult concepts of coding? Well, we soon found a satisfactory answer in our family WhatsApp group. Someone had forwarded a wonderful article on WhiteHat Jr. online coding platform. The message also included the platform\u2019s website URL. Upon visiting the website, we entered a completely new world of teaching coding to the kids. The amazing parent testimonials, curriculum topics, and demo classes drew my attention. After a couple of days, we booked a slot for trial sessions. We appeared with our daughter for the same and found the platform as a best-fit for our daughter. Soon after this, we bought a course package for her, and since then we are watching her grow into a pro-coder. Concludingly, I\u2019d say that WhiteHat Jr. is the platform meant for the kids. ",

            "answer_text": "My son Aarav, took a demo class at Whitehat Jr. to experience an online learning website and honestly, he loved it. After the demo class, he was provided with a certificate for his successful trial class. He is in 9th standard with a subject of JAVA. He finds this subject little bit tough, so he switched to Whitehat Jr. to sharpen his skills. He is at the beginner level which includes 8 classes at first. Frankly speaking, he was not sure initially whether he should continue with coding or not. However, when he cleared all his concepts in JAVA, he developed an interest in this online teaching coding platform. Even his teachers at school praise his coding skills. The team of Whitehat Jr. is doing a wonderful job in delivering the best to our children. Their method of teaching is very simple and innovative; they also keep motivating students in between the sessions. I had never imagined that any online learning websites can make a huge difference in my son\u2019s studies. Whitehat Jr. delivers basic coding fundamentals to children including- logic, sequence, structure, etc. I am happy with my choice of teaching platform. I am quite sure that under your guidance, my child can become pro in coding and that too in a very less span of time. Why I found WhiteHat Jr. to be beneficial for my child: 1. 1:1 live online classes 2. Fully engaging classes 3. Experts from top institutes in the world With all these benefits, one can easily improve their coding skills. Till now, everything is going good and I hope my son may keep learning new techniques in coding so that he may become an expert coder before entering the professional world. These online teaching apps are very helpful for students who prefer online studies. Just keep up with the good work guys. ",

I was so surprised to receive these back to back questions. As parents, it is our duty to give them multiple options to pick a career from and I thought this could be one of them as I knew if my son was intrigued by something, he would go all the way and see the end of it. That\u2019s when a friend of mine from the same industry recommended WhiteHatJr. to me saying they\u2019re the new hot-shots. At first I was not at all convinced but because my friend insisted I enroll my child for it, I did and I was surprised. I realized my son was more curious than I thought. For each thing told to him, he had two things to either say or ask back and I was amazed at the tutor because she, never once, got tired of it or gave him an unsatisfactory answer. Which course would suit your kid is a difficult guess but WhitHatJr. Has one on one consultancy facility as well. Their curriculum charts and daily updates on your child\u2019s progress are truly helpful. I thank my friend for recommending it to me and myself for taking the recommendation every time I see my son attending his online training and having fun with knowledge. ",

Of course, I did a little research on my own as well before I bought a couple of the courses for my kids. I\u2019m quite amused at some of the feedback here because it\u2019s the complete opposite of my kids\u2019 experience during the trial and now that they have started with the actual course, I must say that WhiteHat is certainly worth every penny spent. Truth is my kid wasn\u2019t too excited about studying coding but I managed to convince him. I\u2019m an online freelancer so I know very well the value of learning coding as this skill can help shape his future. I told my kid that if they take this seriously, he might be able to build and design their own apps or games in the future. Turns out, that\u2019s something that he would love to do. I do not know how to code but I was following the classes from behind during the live 1:! session during the first few classes. It was perfectly fine! The curriculum was followed religiously and the teachers were good. I didn\u2019t personally focus on their classes all the time, but my child ended up enjoying the coding course and the activities that were taught there. Now he is telling me about the games he plans to create after the course is over. ",

Only an expert who understands the thought process of a kid, and knows how to simplify the learning can make it possible. This was my major parameter for searching for the best programming course for my twin daughters. I wanted some actual user experience for a platform, before getting deeper into the curriculum, methodology, etc. Social media is the only place, where we can find such original reviews from parents and students. So, I raised several questions in social media groups. And the mixed reaction for every platform was so confusing that I was left frustrated after some weeks. Owing to too many queries about coding classes for the kids, my Instagram feed started showing up content related to the same. One day, while I was scrolling through my Instagram feed, I came across an interesting advertisement of WhiteHat Jr. online coding platform for the kids. I visited their profile and reached on to their website. I started looking at so many great features. From expert IIT/IB qualified, to teach members, 1:1 teaching methodology, and latest curriculum, all the features are world-class. Though I was partially impressed with the platform after reading the user testimonials from their website, I wanted to hear more from past and existing users. I found huge positive remarks from many users on social groups. This led me to enrol my daughters with WhiteHat Jr. online coding platform. After 6 months of enrollment, I am happy about my decision and feel proud to be the father of two highly groomed junior coders at my house. I am greatly positive that my little princesses will achieve great heights of success in their lives. I feel WhiteHat Jr. is the best in teaching coding to the kids. ",

I admitted my only daughter in WhiteHat Jr last year. First she attended the free trial class offered by them, and then continued as a regular student. I went through their coding curriculum and followed the classes since the very first day. Considering the fact that they are teaching the kindergarten children, I must admit that their design and implementation of the syllabus is absolutely appropriate, radical and brief. I can assure that WhiteHat Jr is not only an institute that brags about their administrative group consisting of alumni from Google, IIT and Boston Consulting Group and does nothing. That's what is proved by their success stories. Some of their students got a chance to pitch their ideas to Silicon Valley\u2019s top venture capitalists. They have created some mind-blowing systems like a chatbot integrated to the school website for parents, app that is intended to enable the hearing impaired people to learn sign language, app that helps students to reduce the weight of their bags and many more. Moreover, they achieved all these successes in just 16 months. 1:1 classes with the instructor made the environment friendlier to learn difficult mathematical reasoning and algorithms. My daughter liked it too. However, the feeling of seeing my own daughter learning things so fast and making her projects was unparalleled to any other things. This is my success story as a father and I really owe WhiteHat Jr a lot. I would like to recommend everyone to admit your children at WhiteHat Jr, since coding skills will take your kids ahead of others. ",

Seems more like a data capture campaign such as phone numbers, email addresses and identity ! Prompts to fill up a form on age criteria bases then backs off by declaring that it's on CBSE classroom/ standard level bases !Takes parents by surprise and then backs off by demanding an unrealistic internet speed connection of 05 Mbps\u2026a speed yet to see being offered by JIO in a place as central as Nagpur city.No effort seen from teacher or client care no. to help out a student to establish the portal. All they have is some technically incompatible reason and quit. If this is the state of affairs for the trial class, wonder what would happen if payment is made for the course and followed. Possibly, the system is designed only for kids of Mumbai and Delhi. 05 Mbps is even not possible in Kolkata through hot spot. Only broad band may help it appears.Really wasted my time and energy persuading this course involving coding for my child. Now it really makes me wonder if coding is really useful at a tender age of 8yrs ! There is no research to suggest that introducing coding at primary school improves comprehension in the child's mind. Rather it could be an undue stress I guess. ",

They conduct these classes on their own Coding platform. The initial classes, it's completely image based. This means the child doesn\u2019t have to write the code but drag and drop the code that\u2019s already written. This gives an easy entrance into coding world without having to worry about writing textual bases coding. It can be a disadvantage if your child is already into text-based coding. The coding classes are more of the game based on a point system to encourage the kids to attempt. I haven\u2019t found any fault yet and hope I don\u2019t find any in the near future. The classes can be moulded as per the child\u2019s learning potential. They follow a 4-level curriculum-:Beginners- (grade 1)Intermediate-(grade 2\u20133)Advanced-(grade 4\u20136)Professional-(grade 7\u20139)Applied Tech-(grade 10 onwards). I believe every parent should at least give it a try once. ",

I did my research on the web, and I feel the courses offered are really good for kids. Learning in a fun format and keeping them engaged with a productive activity instead of simply wasting their valuable time. Coming from a tech background, I reckon that a student who is introduced to coding could do wonders at school, in college, and even in life. The value that the folks at WhiteHat Jr. offer is amazing because they focus on the long-term benefits of coding at an early age (with stats to prove it) instead of merely selling courseware. Their attention to detail, personalisation for every child, and practical applications through commercial-ready projects is something that makes them stand out amongst EdTech platforms for kids. Keep going guys, keep coding! Make the techies proud. ",

It would be best if you had to be very careful in selecting a perfect course for your kid. Otherwise, you might not get the full benefit of the class! How can you choose the perfect course for your kid? (follow my checklist) Age: WhiteHat Jr. has designed four curriculums for different age groups. Check their recommendation.Kid's capability: After checking the recommended curriculum, justify with your experience. If you think the recommended curriculum won't fit your kid, consult with a support assistant (+91 22 6833 7300) for better suggestions.Choose a perfect instructor: If you think your kid doesn't seem able to collaborate with the Instructor, immediately inform the authority.Check performance: You should check what your kid learned during the live class session.Appreciate and encourage: Appreciate your kid in his/her little success and encourage him.her to do better.Follow-up: You should get in touch with WhiteHat Jr and consult with the director and Instructor for the further learning of your kid.I hope this information will help you to make a decision.

However, in the market where there are other EdTech startups like Udemy, Vedantu, Edx, etc. what makes WhiteHat Jr. different and special? We know that not everyone's the same. Few kids pick up coding easily and enjoy it, while others do take time to gain proficiency. And an EdTech like WhiteHat Jr. has realized this and has taken exceptional measures to cater to everyone\u2019s needs, unlike many other Edtechs. WhiteHat Jr. has teachers who are specially trained in getting kids to not only learn but also enjoy the process of coding and due to this, I have come across so many kids create some great apps on their platform. As my brother is currently enrolled in the intermediate level of their classes, I have come across how their classes are taught in a live one-is-to-one virtual classroom by teachers who are specially trained on our unique, completely original, and proprietary curriculum and only the top 99.9th percentile of teachers conduct the classes. They\u2019ve repeatedly received some incredible feedback from the parents on the quality of their teachers. The response from parents and kids has been overwhelming and a lot of their customers come via referrals.

Agreeing to the fact that be it anything it will always have both negative and positive sides but what matters here is to know which side outstands the other and in case of Whitehat Jr the positive side takes over. I would like to present some points to you so as to why you should think considering WhiteHat Jr for your child: WhiteHat Jr has come up to be the most successful startups of its time surpassing all it\u2019s competitors which somewhere gives it a thumbs up.WhiteHat Jr has been designed and launched after a lot of research and the best brains were working on it, people from IITs and IIMs to be specific.A child of age between 6\u201314 years is the centre for all its features designed and the curriculum followed at WhiteHat Jr is also very specific.It has got some really unique features like, 1:1 live classes which proves an undivided attention of the teacher to the student and also giving the same classroom experience.2nd unique feature of WhiteHat Jr is that it is giving free demo classes to all be it child or parent for them to decide whether to go ahead with WhiteHat Jr or not.The timings for the classes are completely as per choice of the student and can also be changed on prior information, which makes it very friendly and avoids uncomfortable time slots.5 level course designed starting from Beginners to Advance level and also they provide with certificates with every level crossed which builds up self confidence in the child an also motivates children.The teachers here are selected after a very scrutinized 5 level interview process stating the quality of service offered to be top class.The students are also acknowledged for every small achievement which helps in building up their self-confidence.Very personalised experience for both students and parents.I hope this would help you in taking the right decision.

            "answer_text": "It is nice. I recently had a friend working for that organization who told me about Whitehat jr. Since a lot of my friends are into programming and coding and stuff, they insisted me to introduce the curriculum of Whitehat jr. to a brother of mine. He is a lot in coding and stuff. Now, coming to the point, if you think that your child or your siblings have that affinity towards coding then you must try Whitehat jr. I have been a part of a lot of conversations as of now and have known a lot about White hat jr. The ex CEO of Discovery India launched it and now it is growing at a very rapid rate. The courses are divided in such a way that they perfectly match and get accustomed to the tender aged Kids ,also keeping in mind about their needs. Like,I have seen kids asking questions that hardly make any sense and the patience with with the teachers respond. You can learn more about the courses if you visit the website . A lot of videos are there on youtube as well. It's divided the curriculum into 4 parts according to the seniority of the children and that helps ,I would say. Beginner (5-6 years age ) Intermediate(7-9) Advance (4th - 6th grade students) And Professional. (7th- 9th grade students ) The trial class shall be free . Like it was free a month back. Go check it if you want. You can trust it. It is good . Like I have read articles saying or illustrating a 9-10 year old building app so that an Ambulance can reach to its destination faster ,or how the medicine left over could be donated. Would you even think of such things or applications at such a tender age. Like for me a major concern then was why I couldn\u2019t bat for more than 2 balls . It is really revolutionary . All the coding freaks could just go and check it out. Have a great day ahead !! ",

My daughter took up their intermediate class since then, she has transformed into a different person. She was shy and never really had an interest in learning anything. But now, she is keen to attend every lecture they have to offer. Recently, I gave her a problem she analyzed it and then provided me with the solution. I was shocked to see her this trait. She recently constructed an app to teach kids how to grow plants. I was proud of her. Honestly, I have never seen her being so creative. I will always recommend WhiteHat Jr. amongst other platforms.  According to me, WhiteHat Jr is unique from its competitors because: They offer 1:1 online class, where your kid will get the undivided attention of the teacher.They have top 0.01% of certified teachers.Their course if curated after five years of research.You can schedule classes according to your convenience.They offer a free trial, so you can decide before investing.Topics covered in the curriculum are artificial intelligence, machine learning and Space Tech.The curriculum is divided into five parts according to age.Focus on building a student-teacher relationship, which enables your child to understand the concept more clearly.I hope I was able to answer your question ",

I am a 20+ yrs experienced programmer and taught hundreds of students in my career and really it is very challenging to clear programming concepts to even 18+ students.If you want improvement in their logical and analytical skills then please let them complete their math topics of the schools.Kids are already bored attending online classes then why another online session for them! Please let them enjoy their days. Don\u2019t make them robot. Kids are kids let them enjoy their childhood days.. they are already busy in doing their school assignments and classes.Last one.. very important - they don\u2019t teach programming concepts as we learnt in our time instead they just teach few plain concepts and I don\u2019t think it will make them a developer or coder.It can help kids and their parents in understanding the area of interest. But investment of USD 22 for per class to just know the interest isn\u2019t a good decision.Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr., as such is one of the most promising edtech startups out there, due to their uniqueness and credibility. So what does WhiteHat Jr. do? Probably you would already know the answer to this. But just to brief, WhiteHat Jr. is a platform where children of the age 6\u201318 can learn coding online, by enrolling to the many different courses that this platform offers according to the age requirements. The courses are age-tailored so that the kids don\u2019t feel they are being pushed too much or too less, which is crucial to an interested learning curve. About the teachers, they have an esteemed teacher panel, who can be said as experts in their regimen. Out of a 100 applicants for the teaching post, only one gets selected, which is why the kids will get the best teacher out there.  Coming on to the student teacher ratio, they have a 1:1 ratio which is unbelievable right? But it\u2019s true. Yes, they have achieved to have a single teacher pertaining to a student, such that many students have given feedback of developing bonds with their teachers, which made the learning process even more special. The board panel consists of alumni from esteemed organizations like Google, Amazon, Discovery networks, etc. So they have a clear picture of what is required for kids to make it big in today\u2019s world. They overlook all the processes, making this platform even better to catch up with the times. Overall, WhiteHat Jr. is a wonderful platform to get started with, and I wish all success to your child for their future coding endeavours! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you are looking for, and what other options you have, and how your children learn. What WhiteHat Jr. does is provide one on one tutoring to take kids through free online tutorials (mostly those available on code.org), and back it up with disgustingly aggressive marketing, which makes the whole thing feel slightly slimy. But, at the end of the day, your kids don\u2019t see that marketing - they just have conversations with tutors who are there to give them confidence in completing these free tutorials. If what you want is your kids to learn coding, and they are good self starters or you have a lot of free time, just go through free tutorials with them. If you want them to get a good deep understanding and they are good in standard classroom settings, there are plenty of paid courses of one teacher to many students that can do this for less than WhiteHat Jr. If you think your kids learn best from 1 on 1 conversations and you are working full time (or just don\u2019t have confidence in your own technical ability), and you can put up with agressive marketing, then WhiteHat Jr is a good choice. I\u2019m happy with it becasue it suits my needs, but I can understand and relate to all the negative reviews on this thread. ",

If not, then let me mark that WhiteHat Jr. online coding platform for the kids is the leader in the industry. Surely, you must be wondering how did I conclude about WhiteHat Jr. being the leader. Well, my personal experience with my 7 years old daughter helped me reach the verdict. I am a programmer mother and have experience in working at a top MNC. Due to some complexities, I had to give up on working. But I am still attached to the concepts of coding and also, keep increasing my knowledge in the domain. When my daughter was about to reach 6-years-of age, I started teaching her to code. Surprisingly, I witnessed a keen interest in my daughter for coding. Without any delay, I decided to bring her professional mentor to train her into industry-oriented coding. I approached my coding mentor for some suggestions about coding packages for the kids. He suggested that I look for WhiteHat Jr. as the platform has groomed many of his suggested kids into pro-coders. I made many efforts to find out the features of the platform. I came to know that it offers interesting coding packages for the kids above 6 years of age. Their expert IIT/IB qualified teachers are helpful and friendly. I was excited to see the cutting-edge technological concepts to be a part of their curriculum. Soon, I enrolled my daughter at WhiteHat Jr. It's been a year, and she is already a master in basic concepts. I\u2019m glad to have enrolled her with the leaders who are training her to code in the right way. Trust me, you can blindfold your eyes and choose WhiteHat Jr, for teaching coding to the juniors. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, Many marketing professionals would write great sophisticated reviews here hence don't get into that trap. The whole idea is to play the sentiments of parents and make money. The whole idea of teaching kids programming is useless. Programming is all about basic logical thinking and maths. Teach them that so that one day they will become great programmers if they are willing to. I have coached and mentors 100s of kids got of college with little or no experience in programming. They learn the skill usually less than a month. Anything which they can learn in such a short time, do you really want to screw up their childhood and teach them. Moreover, everything typically gets obsolete in 5\u201310 years and the way we are going, it will get obsolete in 1\u20132 years. The AI tools will write the code, while the new generation of kids will just learn the art of using it in the right way. Stop the nonsense of byju, whitehat jr, and all platforms. They are doing more harm than good. We are converting our kids to machines which is ridiculous. ",

            "answer_text": "The advanced tech era has made knowledge easily available to everyone. Nowadays, kids are readily learning and getting hands-on practice on the latest technological concepts with the help of online platforms. Among all such wonderful platforms, it becomes highly confusing for the parents to pick out the best one for kids. Some months before, I was finding a good platform for my son to learn professional coding. My son is a coding enthusiast and has had some basic knowledge since he was 7. But we wanted professional mentoring which can lead him towards becoming a programmer. We used to spend several hours on the internet to find out a great coding platform for our son. But so many suggestions and options led to utter confusion in the end. Thanks to our social media groups which helped us in picking out the most fantastic coding platform for the kids. The majority of the social media users and parents suggested we enroll our son with an ed-tech platform called WhiteHat Jr. Within a few days, my wife came up with all the details regarding the platform. She told me that WhiteHat Jr. is the leader in providing quality education on coding and other trending topics like app development, game development, and so much more. They have specially designed curriculums for kids above 6 years of age. WhiteHat Jr. has a highly qualified teaching team who teaches in a 1:1 teaching model. After knowing about so many features of the platform, we were fully convinced with WhiteHat Jr. My son was already excited about coding with WhiteHat Jr. Soon, we bought him a package according to his age. I\u2019m glad and proud to mention that he is excelling in coding ever since he joined WhiteHat Jr. According to my opinion, WhiteHat Jr. is the best out there! ",

            "answer_text": "Put simply, coding is a way to teach a computer how to do something through a specific language. In its earliest form, code looked very different from the way it looks today. Today it looks more like standard English, though not entirely. As computer programming evolves to become more like English, it is becoming easier to learn and so more popular but also far less specialised. There\u2019s a direct correlation between the amount that computer systems permeate our lives and the ease with which more of us can instruct them. While it used to be a specialised skill for mathematicians and IT graduates, coding has now become a core skill and salaries reflect how much that skill is valued by employers. Coding is the language of the modern world. Whether it\u2019s the app that brings emails to a mobile or the car that knows how many miles to go until refuelling. Any smart device needs code instructions to tell it how to operate and communicate with the outside world.  WhiteHat Jr. is a Mumbai based Edtech startup that focuses on teaching coding to young kids. It prepares kids age 6-14 years for this new world. The curriculum is precisely divided into 4 levels- Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Professional. Their USP is their elaborate curriculum with personalized attention. Not only are kids as young as six-years-old creating industry-grade applications downloaded by thousands across the world, but they\u2019re also seeing massive improvements in concentration and logic. Kids use the fundamentals of logic, sequence, structure and algorithmic thinking to create tech products eg. games, animations and apps. I hope this helps in clearing your doubts. ",

Who is teaching, what are the takeaways? It is very easy to fool the children, and also their parents. They do performance marketing and fool them. Taking the advantage of COVID-19 these are mushrooming up, fly by night operators. Quality AUDIT CHECK should've been made in our education systems. Fooling people is not business, rather sustainability is difficult in the long run. What YOU promise, YOU deliver, don't make a false commitment, teaching coding is easy( It can be Roto System), but creativity is difficult. WhiteHat Jr advertisement showing Bill Gates, Sunder Pichai, etc are fooling parents. Can they give a guarantee, your kid will become the next Bill Gates and Sunder , if at all what is the probability? In a simple calculation, all IITs and IIMs put together produces 22,000 passes out every year, how many of them make it to R&D or any functional strategic dept ( International Sales, Finance, Process dept of FANG? Maybe 100 or 200( Maximum) so the percentage is not even in whole numbers. Well anybody can process the rest of the information. 6 Years, the very LOGIC has not come, without logic, how come the ALGOS will come? So as long as a firm can fool the parents, they will make DIRTY MONEY. NIIT came in 1980s and made money and vanished, but look at SAP, AUTOCAD, ORACLE, they have a product and quality courseware and training materials of GLOBAL STANDARDS, they are still there. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite intuitive. To begin with, the dashboard itself is very appealing to the child. The overall score, weekly score and earning hats and badges motivates the child to learn. Peer leaderboard is something I am not convinced with as the child would definitely like to know their rank. Trust me, there's enough of competition they are facing at school and we, as parents, enrol them online so that they can learn something without being judged. Children are so sensitive and if their name doesn't appear in top 5 or in the list, they rebel and choose not to show up again for the class. Leaderboard should be removed, if possible, as kids are here to learn. Another noticeable aspect, parents are given an option to schedule a child's class in advance and cancel (although recommended a day before the start of the class). In case of an emergency or for that matter due to any unforeseen event, the parent can speak to the Relationship Manager directly and the class can be rescheduled. The coding Classes by WhiteHat Jr. are quite interesting as the trainer keeps the participant engaged throughout 1 hour and gives the child coding exercise to do after the completion of each class. What really makes online interactive courses work and worth it, is the internet bandwidth. As long as the connectivity is seamless from both ends (trainer + participant), there's no issue. No harm in giving a try, as they offer 1 demo class for the child. ",

Do not understand the relevance of knowing school detail by whitehat. Support team is only there to call you at an instance if complain but not to actually resolve but close it.

Even I had been the part of many online classes and I had to be focused all the time on the material I am reading and not on the material present over the internet. If you managed to maintain your focus on one thing at a time, then the other difficult segment is to find which platform one is most suitable for learning because there are many appearing on the internet. Therefore, wasting time on a thing which is not best will lead you nowhere. One of my school friends used WhiteHat Jr. and his feedback includes that WhiteHat Jr. can be tried once if you are tech-savvy and want to become a software developer. The word disappointment is not included in its list. The cost per class and according to the program selected. They make sure that whatever they provide is best and up to date. Their teaching method is also very unique as they include some fun games to teach coding to children. Platforms like WhiteHat Jr. are delivering online classes as per your preferred time slot which means you can learn coding at your own pace. When I joined this platform, it changed my mindset about online teaching websites. They have experienced mentors and the collection of data for different courses. I can say that every online teaching session are not the same. They all vary and provide varied study structure. I found the one according to my needs and happy to be the part of WhiteHat Jr. If you love coding and looking for any online platform where you can enhance your skills, then feel free to go online. You can find everything there; stay focused and become a coder. ",

I myself can say that because few days back one of my junior reached out to me whether I would be interested in teaching kids and make good money as she is already teaching there and earning good. I told her I am a Project management specialist and coding is not one of my greatest skills. She still tried to persuade me that you can just learn some concepts and teach , you can learn few programs . It's for very young kids , they don't know much etc etc.She might be good teacher for coding but I am really not. I finally said No that I am not comfortable doing so. I really wonder how much this app will help kids. I feel It's just as one of the booster for parents ( another hat to boast )oh my kid is learning from white hat jr. Let's wait . ",

The model is unique, where kids can interact with their trainers live on a video conference. It is the best website for autistic children also. Kids with autism, however, struggle with basic skills such as social interactions, relations, and non-verbal interactions. There are a number of important reasons why it is beneficial to introduce autistic children to coding. Children with autistic spectrum disorders are proven to have a strong logical thinking style, which is necessary for coding. They have a more dominant left side of the brain and are naturally drawn to writing code. Thus, they have higher chances of employment opportunities for jobs that require precision and repetition, which are skills required for coding.\" ",

It provides me classes 3 times a week which is easy for me to cope with. The one thing I like the most about this learning app- it allows me to study my field of interest along with my academic subjects. The instructors are highly knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. They make concepts understandable in a very simple and clear way. If any student wants to get involved in this digital world through coding, then opting for such online sessions could be a better idea. If you are aspiring like me, then you can enhance your minds creativity, thinking, and logical skills through coding. From day 1 to till now, I am continuously learning new concepts in the field of development. At the present moment, I can say that all my basic skills and knowledge regarding fundamentals is cleared.

Coding is the best way to trigger the mental abilities of kids at the proper age. I have been surveying for 4 years now, and there are only a few platforms who have achieved truthful bonding with students and parents in the aspects of real time coding. And whitehat jr. is one of them. It's a 24 months old company which has managed to understand the actual problems of kids and parents. One of the reasons behind such efforts might be that it's new to the market and its need for them to create their identity with a good rapport, in any case it's on the beneficiary side for users only. The course structure is designed by IIT and IB trained professionals. It is a 5 level course classified according to different age groups from 6 years to 14 years old kids as follows: Beginner (Grade 1)Intermediate(Grade 2-3)Advanced (Grade 4-6)Professional (Grade 7-9)Applied Tech(Grade 10+)It provides live 1:1 interactive classes with doubt solving sessions. One of the best things about whitehat jr is it's flexible class hours, which lets your kid learn without burdening them with excessive stuff apart from their curricular and co-curricular school activities. In the end, the mental health of kids is important. Whitehat jr provides a positive and playful atmosphere. They follow the 5 step process for selecting the best candidates to teach coding to kids. Apart from coding, such courses will bring the sense of discipline in the routine of the kid. Hope the answer and whitehat jr works best for you. ",

I was initially not into coding unless I came to know that my close friend Arjun is skilled in solving most of the C++ queries in minutes. I was impressed by him and upon asking, he revealed that he has taken online classes from WhiteHat Jr. to polish his C++ coding skills. When he said that he is getting classes at home, I also desired to learn the basic concepts of C++. One day, I went to his house to get an overview of the online session. It appeared interesting to me and asked my mother to get me enrolled there. From there, I started loving the computer subject at my school. My mother was not sure about the online method of teaching. She believed that studies are not taken seriously when taught online. However, Whitehat Jr. was successful in turning the viewpoint of my mother in the demo class. She examined the first trial class and enrolled me for 48 teaching classes as it was appearing cheaper than others. I began my sessions with full interest. Today, after completing 25 classes, I feel that I am eligible to solve many of the C++ programs. Whitehat Jr. helped me a lot in improving my logical thinking and creative skills. I am grateful to the instructors who always listen to the problem and suggest ways to solve it. I have seen many children who created various apps. They inspire me as well to do some extraordinary in the field of developing. I will fulfil my desire very soon. By doing so, I want to make my parents proud of me. Thank you Whitehat Jr. and the mentors who keep on supporting us. ",

            "answer_text": "For children i really dont think whitehat jr is good, because from what I can see, even though it does require logic, it teaches a language called Blockly. Its basically adding blocks which isnt real coding. If you look at any applications made which you use right now or even the popular apps, blockly isnt used. The most popular coding language which a child can learn is Java for Android apps, and Swift for IoS apps. This is not taught by WhiteHat Jr. If you ask my opinion, the best languages to learn right now are Python, Java and C/C++. These would help children learn more and also would be better in case they take an interest and want to make a career in coding with it. So I feel that WhiteHat Jr is not really good and you should not waste money on it. If you want there are many courses on YouTube, Udemy, Coursera, and Coding Blocks which are some free or take a small amount and your child can actually learn a lot more and learn coding and not Blockly.

WhiteHat Jr. teaches children key coding concepts and foundational tools through a number of live-and-experience-based classes. Using an interactive curriculum, WhiteHat Jr. will lead kids through exercises on coding, using different languages, building apps and games, and other essential principles of computer science to help their learning progress. The professional educators are experts in working with young children at all stages. They'll help students build their coding skills through video-interaction with a teacher. A WhiteHat Jr. instructor will provide tips, tricks, and strategies to build your child's coding skills. Kids can then take their skills beyond what they learnt in the class and develop confidence in their coding abilities. This confidence results in a more confident coding ability for themselves and the future of computing. ",

It's not going to work out like the advertisement where people in suits suddenly fight outside your home to hire your kid(s) It took me months to make apps for communication with an embedded hardware. And I used MIT App Inventor and Kodular. Coding (C, C++, Python) is what excel nowadays. For making applications using Microsoft Xamarin or Android Studio, you need to learn a lot of coding. And it will take you some time to make fresh applications. Java is NOT easy, by the way.

            "answer_text": "I grew up in a generation that did not know what mobile phones, computers and the internet meant. But one cannot survive in today\u2019s world without the above-mentioned items. With electronic gadgets and devices becoming an inextricable part of our lives, we have no choice but to adapt and as parents, we are willing to do anything to help our kids strengthen their footing. I first came across WhiteHat Jr. in a Facebook post by a fellow parent. My son Amartya had just completed his 7th standard and I wanted his summer vacation to be fruitful. Initially I was quite skeptical since he had no prior experience in coding and computer programming, but the trial session completely changed my perception. Amartya enjoyed the session and even received a certificate on completion of his first class. The one-on-one class with a well-qualified teacher had made him excited about the prospect of coding, and he started looking forward to the next class. The timings are flexible, the syllabus is promising and innovative, and the students get individual attention and the opportunity of clearing doubts on the spot. My son is now able to grasp concepts quickly even in school, and is even helping out his classmates with their work. Nowadays, he is interested in website development and animation. He continues to attend classes with WhiteHat Jr, and they continue to nurture his logical reasoning and creativity. The classes have provided him with a strong foundation to pursue his interests and easily manage his schoolwork, and I am sure that I have made the right choice by enrolling him in the classes. ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr was founded by Mr. Karan Bajaj, he has studied from the top management schools of India. He is well educated, knowledgeable and a clever man. WhiteHat Jr is his startup which is now being recognised now all over the globe. WhiteHat Jr is an ed tech platform which teaches coding to kids of age 6 - 18 years of school going kids. They provide 1:1 classes by the top 99.99th percentile of certified teachers. The main reason for WhiteHat Jr standing out from all other online platforms is that unlike other edtech platforms it prioritises teaching coding. They understand the importance of coding and the future it has. According to me this company is visionary and will be having a long way ahead. WhiteHat Jr. tells us about the benefits coding has on a child's brain. Coding makes our children a creator of technology rather than a consumer. So they also have this method of 1:1 teaching which will be really impactful for beginners in general.  The main aim of teaching children how to code is to improve their logical, structural, and algorithmic thinking abilities. They provide a wide range of courses from mobile application development, space-tech coding to a lot more. Their courses are made specifically according to the age groups. They also offer a free trial class which gives us an insight about the quality we are going to receive. The quality they provide is really mind blowing. They generally increase the quality rather than downgrading it. It was a nice experience for my nephew too. I highly recommend all the aspiring young coders to go check their free trial class out. ",

Price of one full month course-15 thousand (approx) Byju\u2019s is the parent organization of Whitehat Jr. They would first give you a free class for coding and if you like that then you can continue by giving a hefty amount. Corona-induced lockdown gave them an golden opportunity to teach children(making money instead) because they were forced to stay indoors. And most of the parents want their child to be precocious than others. Overnight, we saw many ads about the free courses be it on mobilephone, TV or on big hoardings. There are cases that after paying money for a course on Whitehat Jr. many parents felt that the courses were not upto the mark. Some teachers even hurled at students. And if you are in India, you must have seen an ad in which some bussinessman fought with eachother to buy the app made a boy. That is too hilarious\u2026.I mean this is not a way to buy an app. Whitehat Jr is indeed not worth the price. Thank you Have a good day ahead!! ",

Here is the story of a White Hat Jr. student, 9-year-old Mae Mae from Shillong, who created the Anti-Bullying app for kids to report bullies anonymously and alert parents, teachers, and friends about them. Mae Mae and her sister had faced bullying at school, and she wanted to put an end to this. While learning to code on the WhiteHat Jr. platform, Mae Mae thought of using her knowledge to create an app to help other kids cope with bullies. Once logged in, the child can anonymously share details of the incident including the name of the bully and give a detailed explanation of how they were mistreated. This will notify their parents and teachers and encourage them to take necessary disciplinary action to nip the problem in the bud. ",

Yes even my friend pursuing m.tech from IIT Madras also got same thing. He is pursuing m.tech in CS but it was mentioned no coding knowledge required to teach coding to children. So how exactly are you going to teach coding to children without knowing how to code? That meant, they would give us pre-designed course that we would have to just read it out to children. Is that teaching coding! Man even we had better History classes in school than this. They were not going to pay us for using our laptop for their work nor going to pay for our own internet which we were going to use for their official work. So the overall pay was shitty.

WhiteHat Jr. takes a straight-forward approach, teaching real text-based code in a manner that even 9-year-olds can understand and apply their knowledge to build apps. Here is the story of a White Hat Jr. student, 9-year-old Mae Mae from Shillong, who created the Anti-Bullying app for kids to report bullies anonymously and alert parents, teachers, and friends about them. Mae Mae and her sister had faced bullying at school, and she wanted to put an end to this. While learning to code on the WhiteHat Jr. platform, Mae Mae thought of using her knowledge to create an app to help other kids cope with bullies. Once logged in, the child can anonymously share details of the incident including the name of the bully and give a detailed explanation of how they were mistreated. This will notify their parents and teachers and encourage them to take necessary disciplinary action to nip the problem in the bud.\" ",

I am a computer science engineer, and recounting all the hardships I faced in my initial engineering days because of my null experience with coding, I advised my brother to get into coding at a young age because he too aims at becoming a software engineer, to avoid all the clueless times I had faced  I came across Whitehat jr\u2019s advertisement on TV and decided to book a trial class for my brother. My Brother got enrolled in the \u201cIntroduction to Coding\u201d program and in no time he began to develop a strong logic and his understanding of coding increased. His teacher was supportive and helped him over his mistakes and encouraged him for his achievements. The curriculum is also pretty industry-friendly because it has been designed by IIT and MIT alumni that empowers kids to think outside the box. Moreover kids from Whitehat jr. have already got applications published on the Google play store and many have had the privilege of visiting Silicon Valley. The National education policy of India too encourages students to learn coding at a young age because expertise in coding can make the shine apart from the crowd. I truly believe that kids should start coding at a young age because that makes them more creative and logical for life, because coding trains the left and right brain simultaneously. I hope you found the information useful. ",

I am a programmer myself and working in the industry for more than 13 years. When I checked the syllabus for AI/ML, I wonder how they can teach those complex concepts to Children. No doubt they have a big budget for Marketing and they are fooling the parents with their \u201cChintu campaign\u201d. If you really want to teach, there are many other platforms available which are cheaper and might have quality teachers. I am using the below one for my child, it is really cheap and teacher is also good. It is like coding tuitions without any false promises like \u201cYour child will go to Silicon valley\u201d or Space Program. Try this if you want to: Home - CodeVidyaJunior ",

Multiple notifications, emails, text messages, calls reminding about the trial and coming on time. When we show up on time - there is no one there. After 5 mins I call them to ask, and then later the teacher showed up.I am not sure how the lesson was, I wasn\u2019t present, my daughter liked the experience. But again, pressure continued with emails and calls. Now, after months, I still receive emails from them. I\u2019ve asked to unsubscribe - no result. There is no unsubscribe button in the email. They are clearly not aware of the CASL. So the next step - forward their email to the anti-CASL organization in Canada - spam@fightspam.gc.ca. And I suggest other people do the same.Even if they have great classes, their marketing strategy looks like a scam, and those emails need to stop! ",

            "answer_text": "Here is my tip. White hat junior has lot of discrepancies regarding their charges. The pattern they follow\u2026 1)They are charging 1000 US $ from my american friend in US for 6 months for a 5 year old boy. His teacher is from india. So i am assuming they are paying her in INR not in $. 2)My another friend in Delhi, her son in 9th grade, paid only 75000 INR for 2 years of classes. First they asked 1lakh ,later they gave discount of 25000.With same resources, means again with same teachers residing in India. Ofcourse you can bargain. But bigger picture you see how they loot ppl outside India. With no offices in america and no running cost, and paying teachers in india, they are charging 4 times from NRIs. Ofcourse earnng in $ , but the living costs are too in $. And none is earning 4\u20135 times. College education is super expensive here. So such huge differences in their rates is absolutely bizarre.

Seriously ? with their over hyped, unrealistic advertisements they made even most experienced coders look like noobs for a second. To be honest most of the answers are fake here. If you really want to make your child a successful coder you can digup loads of content over youtube starting from basics to advanced programming just for FREE. Just you need to find some time with your children and laptop. If you have IT background its very easy otherwise you can focus on content. Its the best way you can have more time to interact with your children rather leaving them to some bot telling stuff like \u201cwe take you to the moon\u201d. This is my opinion. ",

Be it for the students joining the FAANG phenomenon or of the parents teaching coding to the kids. Starting at an early age is always a plus point.While, you have developed the zeal to learn and code in the early ages, you need to keep the spirit high and look forward with the same outlook. Below, here you gonna find many posts about the curriculum.The teachers employed here are quite trained in the overall development of the child maintaining the curiosity of the child held up high.Keeping up this spirit, I hope the students and their respective parents take a free trial class for themselves and see the results. Happy Coding!  ",

It is only when the child enters his teens and hits 14\u201315\u201316 that he may be capable of truly learn hard-core coding. Not to undermine White Hat Jr. because it does help build logical and analytical thinking but just stating the facts. BYN believes in saying it like it is. ",

Any sane parent could guess that, I can understand children can get fooled because they are children but parents are getting fooled, that means they are desperate and really think that by doing these shitty classes their child will become Bill gates. :) I am from India and I can understand Indian and NRI parents because they are always jobs(big fat money), America and status show. They never care what their child wants or could be something else other than doctor or engineer. But I saw some kids from other countries enrolling with white hat jr, that was shocking, how can those people be fooled? Then they will complain again someone from India scammed them, why don\u2019t people apply their common sense. Whitehat jr is a scam, the sooner you understand it the better it will be. Good luck to all those who enrolled their child and wasted their money :D ",

I recommend just searching on google what coding is, how powerful it is ( by showing some demos of apps and games with code, you can find a lot on sololearn. ) , and which coding language to start with.

The platform, unlike a textbook is an interactive space where students can engage with the content. And therefore, these platforms are in huge demand in schools and universities across the globe. Because every institution wishes their students to understand the concepts and its implications in the real world.  This high demand has ended in the production and availability of many such online education platforms in the market, putting educational institutions in a dilemma. How do they decide which platform functions best for their students? Every vendor claims to have the best learning platform which is best for students and teachers. They all have many features are more or less similar to one another. 1. Fluid-to-use interface First of all, we require an interface that is easy to use. The icons and text should be visible and legible. Teachers and students must be able to navigate through the app easily. A lot of teachers are still getting used to the idea of using eBooks and online content delivery platforms in classrooms. 2. Own Branding Any institution would wishes for a platform which offers a touch of personalization. Just like all the educational resources provided by an institute has their logo over it, similarly, the educational platform must also incorporate their brand image/logo and color palette. 3. Offline material Though it\u2019s an online education platform, it must also be available offline. Students might want to download some material and read later. And in case there\u2019s no internet connectivity, students should not be missed out of the chance to study. So, there must be an feature for users to download content and read it offline. 4. Interactive Factors You should be able to benefit by interactive elements to the platform. Online interactivities include quizzes, audio competitions, videos, simulations, gamification etc. The tool should also allow students to make notes and share with their peers or teachers, bookmark pages, search for information, highlight texts, etc. Including interactive elements develops student engagement with the courseware. Hence, look for all the interactivities that the platform offers. WhiteHat Jr. has all the qualities of a good teaching platform for coding. And thereby it is one oof the most sought after platforms for it. Try it out and begin your journey! ",

My son, Vihaan has completed the \u201cprofessional\u201d course from the platform and his experience has been outstanding. He was always interested in coding but I could not find the right platform for him, because either the lessons were recorded or the curriculum was extremely difficult. But ever since I enrolled him at WhiteHat Jr. not only his coding skills improved but also I have seen an improvement in his logical thinking.  WhiteHat Jr. teaches kids the fundamentals of coding such as algorithms, sequencing and structures, which improves their concentration, creative and abstract thinking skills by 300% and 75% respectively. Each aspect of the course was up to the mark: Curriculum: The curriculum is developed by professionals who are alumni of institutes such as IITs, IIMs and Discovery Network. The curriculum focuses on teaching coding to children between the age of 6-18 and is divided into five parts ranging from beginner to applied tech.Tutors: The tutors are selected after a rigorous 10 step process and only the top 0.1% of the applicants are selected. They are adept in every way to clear the doubts of the children.Classes: The classes are 1:1 live online sessions so that the children are able to clear their queries at any time throughout the course. They offer 144 classes throughout the module, and with 3 classes a week the students get a lot of free time to complete their schoolwork.My son is really enjoying these classes and I hope you also have a wonderful experience with WhiteHat Jr. ",

            "answer_text": "A good online platform should have the following aspects: Global Compatibility There are many online learning platforms with a varying number of users. As a student, the right online platform to start with would be one with a good number of active users worldwide or in the geography of your choice and features that compliment the diverse set of students who might be opting for the same course. Moreover, a platform with support for many languages is also a very important feature, which means that students can learn without worrying about the language barrier. Scaling of teaching effectiveness Online portals that allow teachers to build their online academies and get actionable information about their courses, classes, and content delivery. Such handy features enable teachers to get insights into students\u2019 activities through informative reports which cover information, such as content consumed by each student, live classes attended, and the percentage of the course completed to keep a tab on the number of dropouts. Teachers can use this data to refine their course content or courseware design, improve their teaching approach or methodology, and do a lot more to increase student engagement to improve learning outcomes. Content Protection One of the ways to claim content ownership is by controlling the dissemination and access of content so that it\u2019s accessible to only the assigned students. Server security, encryption types and other such technologies are used to protect your data safe on online platforms, so before deciding on which one you are going with, make sure to get a good understanding of who gets to access your data and how they get to do it.  Versatility The versatility of the software or platform decides the type of online learning activities that you can do. You need to take into consideration the level and type of interaction that you normally have with your teachers and choose the platform accordingly. Mobile methodologies As pedagogy and learning needs change, learning tools change. With the online education landscape changing rapidly, teachers and students are adapting to novel technologies. As more and more people join the online community due to ease of use, scalability, flexibility, affordability and choosing the right platform or software continues to remain a crucial factor in the success of your teaching, training or business. WhiteHat Jr. is a platform which fulfils all the expectations of a good online platform and brings in many elements to improve the experience even further. They are a quality organization with a lot of visualisation. Cheers to Coding! ",

However, WhiteHat Jr. was successful in changing her viewpoint during the demo class. She examined the first trial class and enrolled me for 48 classes package as it was a great starting point. As I began learning with WhiteHat Jr., she was convinced that it is a great way to leverage tech to teach students across the globe solve problems around them. I had some difficulty adjusting how to apply my skills when I began my classes. However, after exploring TensorFlow and understanding the power of data during one of my projects, I learned that connecting the dots matters most when solving a problem. My teacher and mentor was so sweet that she guided me during every step of the course. ",

It's the basics which is very important so I'll suggest that make sure they start from the easiest things and they know them and they gradually work up the ladder. ",

Coding is just writing something in a programming language. Everything is present freely on internet. For self learners, any online course will be good since they didnt bound them on a single instructor to get knowledge of some topic. Some people needs a live instructor. For them, it depends on which instructor is going to teach that topic. If he is good enough to complete all topics with indepth explanation, then thats good, go for it. Good instructors are not bounded to a single online teaching platform. ",

This gives kids a chance to clear their doubts as they come. The curriculum is also designed specially for kids after five years of research by IIT and IIM alumni. What I like best about White Hat Jr is that the curriculum is in 4 levels... Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Professional. Your kid can take free trial lessons and decide which one is best for him/her. Cheers! ",

That's what is proved by their success stories. Some of their students got a chance to pitch their ideas to Silicon Valley\u2019s top venture capitalists. They have created some mind-blowing systems like a chatbot integrated to the school website for parents, app that is intended to enable the hearing impaired people to learn sign language, app that helps students to reduce the weight of their bags and many more. Moreover, they achieved all these successes in just 16 months. I would like to recommend everyone to admit your children at WhiteHat Jr, since coding skills will take your kids ahead of others. ",
