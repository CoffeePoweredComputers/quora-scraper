            "answer_text": "I am old enough to have lived as an adult without the internet. There are several things you cannot learn on the internet You cannot learn to properly interact with other human beings. Much of the friendships and human interaction on the internet are not real. The person you are talking to is probably a fantasy. Oh they are a real person but they can pretend to be anyone they want to be instead of being totally genuine. I have noticed over the years that people will be totally rude and abrasive on the internet when they wouldn\u2019t do anything like that in person. In person people have a greater chance to see who you really are instead of the fake person you pretend to be.You can see photos of things but you cannot experience those things. You cannot feel a snowflake hit your nose, or the warm spring rain hitting your body, or the sand between your toes on a beach. You cannot look up at the stars and feel amazement at the size of the universe we live in. You cannot year the sound of songbirds in the spring and smell the fragrant spring flowers. You cannot feel the rush of a crowd at a concert while watching youtube.You cannot enjoy any physical activities on the internet such as walking, running, riding a bicycle, skiing, fishing, or loads of other physical activities that your body needs to extend your life. You can watch basketball on the internet but you have to go outside to actually play and experience it yourself.I could go on much longer on this vein of thought. The bottom line is you cannot experience real life on the internet. The touch, sounds, smells and sensations of real life. It\u2019s out there not on the screen\u2026. You can read about life on the internet but to experience it for yourself, you must logoff\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "The bonds between family and friends is something you just cannot learn or understanding the concept of in the internet as it is considered an abstract term. Why do we need to learn about family and friends you ask? Do you know what really matters in life? It is a question that many have asked, and many have answered. The answers offered to this question have been varied and variegated, but there are a few that consistently bubble to the surface. Two of those are \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cfamily.\u201d With so many people offering those two answers time and again, it would be unwise to discount them outright. However, what most people mean when they say \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d may not be the definition that carries the most significant meaning. How Important Are Friends and Family? Family is important, to be sure \u2013 and by family, I don't necessarily mean the group of people with whom you share the greatest genetic similarity. I mean that core group of people who really help define and frame who you are. Those that see you, warts and all, and accept you and care for you and act in your best interest (sometimes even in spite of yourself) and help you when you need it. Those people who know what you are capable of, and do what they can to nurture the best in you. Those people who really do want you to be the best you that you possibly can. Friends are equally important \u2013 and by friends, I don't mean people with whom you are on a first name basis, the people with whom you are cordial with and with whom you don't experience great personal or professional conflict, the people with whom you will eat pizza and drink beer. I mean the people who, while not actively trying to nurture and care for you and think of you and grieve with you and celebrate with you, generally add more happiness to your life than they cause sorrow. I mean people who take the edge off of the hard times by reminding you that there are good people out there, and even though you are not an integral part of their lives, nor they a part of yours, you can make the world just a little more pleasant with your interactions. Family and friends. Certainly two very important pieces of a happy life. I propose adding a third category, one that is never directly addressed, but one that is talked about indirectly and has a profound impact on a person\u2019s personal happiness. Self-integrity. The ability to look in the mirror at any time during the day and not be ashamed to meet your own gaze. The ability to sleep well at night because there is no guilt, no pangs of regret. The ability to know that, at all times, you were you, and that was good enough, and you didn't compromise your values as a human being for love or money or respect or acceptance. You were honest and consistent with everyone with whom you came into contact, and never once took action and had to hide that action from others out of fear of retribution or judgment. The ability to hold your head high and be proud of who you are, and the impact you have on those around you. So, how Important Are Friends and Family? Vitally important. Along with self-integrity, these are the three things that are absolutely required in order to live a self-fulfilled and happy life. Family, friends, and self-integrity. These are the things that really matter, in the long run. You know what doesn't really matter in the long run? Everything else. ",
