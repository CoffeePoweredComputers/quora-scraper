            "answer_text": "Strength of conc H2SO4 is approx 36N, so using the formula N1*V1=N2*V2 you can calcluate the amount of conc H2SO4 to be added in water. 36N*V1(mL)=2N*2000mL from here V1= 111.11. Now take some water around 500mL or 1000mL as you wish and add gently 111.11 mL conc H2SO4 in it slowly now make the whole solution 2L and that splution will be of 2N solution of H2SO4. ",
