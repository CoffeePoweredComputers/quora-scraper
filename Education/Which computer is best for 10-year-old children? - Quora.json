            "answer_text": "Maybe. It depends on the kid. I gave my 8 year old (she\u2019s now 10) a PC (just a cheap 100$ thing off craig\u2019s list). It won\u2019t do anything fancy, it\u2019s cheap! But, it does let her learn about computers, get comfortable using them, teaches her how to work with the computer. She wanted to write, so I taught her to use Word. She want to learn about programming, so I showed her Khan academy. She wanted to play games, I helped her learn where to find them and how to be careful and safe in online games. I taught her about privacy, security, etc etc. The list goes on. I setup the PC with safeguards through windows and google to avoid inappropriate search responses for example. She is starting to want to play more advanced games and do things that her PC can\u2019t handle yet (she wants to do digital graphic design, I mean she wants to draw\u2026). So we talk about what it would take to make her PC capable of that, how much it would cost. She saves her money (and I usually chip in some too), then helps me install the hardware and setup the software so she knows how it works. We had bumps though, we caught her uploading things to YouTube without our permission. Nothing torrid, but we had explicitly told her to ask our permission first because we wanted to make sure she wasn\u2019t telling anyone something she shouldn\u2019t, like where she lives or our phone number etc., she\u2019s innocent and just may not think of these things yet. Anyway, she was grounded and lost her computer privileges for a while. She learned an important lesson about following directions and online safety. Now, she just asks us if it\u2019s ok and we look at the video before she posts it. No problem, she does some cool stuff! Now this works for my daughter, I allowed it because of who she is and my belief that she was ready to handle it. I won\u2019t tell you that will work for your kid. You make that call. But, if you do decided to allow it, my advise would be to make them part of it at every opportunity. ",

            "answer_text": "An older computer. A 9 year old deserves a computer of his own to play with, but not one that is top-of-the-line, nor maybe even built in the last 5 years. When I was 9 years old I had just enough computer to explore. Since I couldn\u2019t do much online back in the early 1990s, I learned how to program and did so, for hours on end, being creative and learning important skills I still use to this day, 32 years later. If your son needs one for school, which is the case in some regions, that\u2019s a different story. If you want to buy him one, don\u2019t waste your money on a tablet, buy a used laptop from Goodwill. But, keep an eye on his computer. Talk to him about the computer and supervise him as much as you can. He can not only get in trouble, but be preyed upon, especially if the computer has an internet connection. Here\u2019s a good article on How to limit Internet bandwidth on your PC Why do this? Because it will keep him out of trouble. Give him just enough network to do one or two things in a browser, not everything. That way he is forced to do things other than play online games and watch videos. You should also encourage him to learn Processing, and maybe how to program a game. Check out this link and he can instantly learn from taking this short course: Processing Hour of Code Eventually, even with an older computer, he can learn how to work with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis and make cool geeky stuff. You can buy kits from their website, and follow other people\u2019s projects: Adafruit Industries, Unique & fun DIY electronics and kits \u2014- Here are some other examples if you search \u201cArduino Kits for Kids\u201d on Amazon: Amazon.com: arduino kits for kids - these Arduino projects also use the Processing IDE and language (a variant of Java). Another tremendously helpful step would be to get him two monitors for a single computer. This is a skill that is sadly learned too late in life and starting someone young with multiple monitors will not only spoil him, but train him to multitask. These don\u2019t have to be expensive either. At my local Goodwill, you could easily gather 2 monitors and a desktop for around $130. Compared to new fangled gaming PCs, tablets and uber-smartphones, this is cheap. ",
