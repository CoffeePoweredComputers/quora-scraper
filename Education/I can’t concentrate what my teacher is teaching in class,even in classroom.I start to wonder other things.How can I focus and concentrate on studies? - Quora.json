            "answer_text": "My rough sense of you from reading your question is that there are two levels of \u201cproblem\u201d scenarios in your personal case: At the macrocosmic level: you probably don\u2019t know what you want out of life, because you lack overarching and compelling long range goals in your life, in the form of a game plan to drive you;as a result of 1) you don\u2019t know your priorities;At the microcosmic level; 3. you also probably don\u2019t have a study plan, which should be part of your game plan in 1); 4. you also probably lack the knowledge of effective study skills to help guide you in class; the foregoing factors, 1), 2), 3) and 4), explain why you are easily distracted; For your information: Goals, priorities, and a written game plan, set your forward direction and trajectory, and keep you inspired, motivated and focused on the things that matter to you the most. Using a military analogy, goals, priorities, and a written game plan are like precise commands preset into the flight plan of a Tomahawk cruise missile, homing on to a predefined, long-distance target. I have already written extensively about goal setting and goal achieving, including how to set up a systematic game plan, on top of a plethora of effective study skills and techniques, on Quora. Here are some web-links to Quora for you: Say Keng Lee's answer to What's the best way to set and attain goals? Say Keng Lee's answer to How do you make studying easy as possible? Say Keng Lee's answer to What are some ways to improve my focus and manage endless distractions of the present age? I like to leave this nice parting shot as food for your thought: \u201cWhatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon\u2026 must inevitably come to pass.\u201d ~ Paul J Meyer; ",

            "answer_text": "IT\u2019S ALL ABOUT HOW YOU SEE THIS PROBLEM. CONTROL YOUR THOUGHTS. First calm down . Relax . AND FOCUS ON WHAT TO DO NOW.  THINK ,THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY: your brain is the power house of creative energy. My answer for you is pretty simple - go and talk to your teachers directly. Tell them your problems and the things you are unable to get at one go. All other tips will fail unless and until you find the exact reason for such distractions. It might be possible that you are distracted by social media . Shun them off. They aren\u2019t going to help you out in your life ,they are complete wastage of time. As its a growing age it might be possible that you focus more on a person and less about your studies. Remember you are going to meet many \u2026yes many alike people in your life but you need to do what is expected at this precious time of your career. What i used to do was to think and talk about all my thoughts to my best friend only during the lunch time . You can even maintain your secret diary (..haha.. i do it.) . Lastly, meditate . you can go for this link: Ishita Gupta's answer to How do I concentrate better in the classroom? i hope this helps :) ",
