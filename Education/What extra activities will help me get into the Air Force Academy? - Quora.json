            "answer_text": "Hi Tyler, thanks for asking. If you haven\u2019t done so already, please take some time to review the Air Force Academy Admissions website. On there, make sure you check out the Extracurricular Activities page, which will tell you, among other things: Participation in a variety of athletic and non-athletic high school activities is an asset in preparing for the demanding Air Force Academy program, and is a competitive factor in your application to the Academy. Sustained participation and leadership in a few activities is desirable. Remember, they are looking for sustained participation in a few activities. You don\u2019t need to do a hundred activities. You just need to do a few, consistently, and show leadership in that activity. The Academy is looking for people with demonstrated leadership potential and the ability to succeed in a high-stress academic, athletic, and military environment. Showing high academic achievement as well as sustained participation and leadership in a few extracurricular activities will achieve that goal. Also, if you have not reached out to your Admissions Liaison Officer (ALO), do so. If you don\u2019t know who your ALO is, find him or her and reach out. They will help with the entire admissions process. Good luck! ",
