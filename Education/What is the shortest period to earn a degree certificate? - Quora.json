            "answer_text": "Well... I am currently pursuing two graduate degree certificates at Wayne State University. Most graduate and undergraduate degree certificate programs have two or three core and/or required courses and two to three elective courses. So, the total number of courses for the typical graduate and/or undergraduate degree certificate program is four to six courses which can be completed in one to two college semesters full time (which would be about 4\u20138 months at least). I hope that answers your question:) ",
