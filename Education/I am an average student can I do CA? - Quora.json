            "answer_text": "The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India does not prescribe any definition of either averageness or brilliance that would make one student incompetent in comparison to other. It treats all students equally, sets a syllabus which a professional of the finance field should be well versed in, and then tests you on the same. If you clear, you are a Chartered Accountant. Your past history of school or college results despite their averageness have no bearing on your title. The CA course is definitely vast and challenging, I will throw some light on it so that one may assess whether they are suited for it or not. It is divided into three level which take approximately five years to complete. Apart from clearing the exams, you have to undergo three years of training under a professional CA as well. So, for a good portion of your journey you will have to balance education and work side by side, which naturally means long days and a lot of hard work. Further, the course is vast, it covers all aspects of commerce, accounting, finance, law, audit, costing and taxation. The exams are unforgiving, if you are not prepared, you will suffer. But on the optimistic side, if you are well prepared nothing can stop you. Thus, if you are ready to work hard, put in the necessary time and stick to the course for the required years, it will be a walk in the park for you to complete CA. It does not matter what sort of a student you have been up to now, all that matters is how you plan to study the CA course. It is often noticed that previously unsuccessful students shine in CA because of their dedication while most presumable brilliant students fail to clear the exams. To summarize, yes, an average student can do CA, as long as he wants to sincerely do it. ",
