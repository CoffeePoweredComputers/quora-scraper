            "answer_text": "In the US? The Declaration of Independence. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Elsewhere? Exactly the same as the arguments against white supremacism and White Man\u2019s Burden. In fact, the three are precisely the same: an assertion that some people should be more equal than others and have the right and the responsibility to decide other people\u2019s fate for them on the grounds of seeing themselves as more civilized. The \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d crowd changes with time. There was time when Irishmen, Catholics, Jews were not allowed into the club, and now they are deemed kosher. Likewise, Obama would have never been given a chance to lead the first two movements, but now is very much an \u201cin\u201d guy. It does not really matter. Even if tomorrow Russians or Arabs are admitted into the club, as long as the club exists, it will be singling out some savage outsider groups out there to baptize/civilize/liberate/democratize while quietly steeling their gold or oil or whatever it is that\u2019s valuable at the moment, because the club\u2019s entire concept of self depends on it. They can\u2019t just live and let live. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there are actual arguments for or against. American Exceptionalism (like any exceptionalism) is a faith; one either is a believer or not. Every country, every region has unique traits, and in this sense is objectively exceptional. But American Exceptionalism means that America (well, not really America\u2026) is \u201cmore\u201d exceptional, and in that \u201cmore\u201d is in itself exceptional. This all gets a bit weird if you think about it. So I stick with my opinion that this is a question of faith and not of arguments. There\u2019s no point in arguing about faith\u2026 ",
