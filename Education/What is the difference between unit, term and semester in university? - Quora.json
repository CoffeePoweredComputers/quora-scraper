            "answer_text": "A unit is a portion of one course (e.g., the ANOVA portion of a statistics course that also includes a unit on Regression.)A term is the length of a course at a particular institution (e.g., if the institution divides its year into four quarters, then a term is one quarter).A semester is supposed to be one half of the academic calendar (e.g., Fall semester and Spring semesters). The \u2018semi\u2019 refers to \u201chalf\u201d. Of course, many institutions on the semester system offer more than two terms (e.g., abbreviated Summer and Winter terms). So many institutions that use \u2018semester\u2019 are not actually using the term according to its original meaning.",

            "answer_text": "A unit is an academic module which forms part of your course of study, which represents a credit point value that contributes towards your course. Your course program will state the total number of credit points you need to achieve (and often the specific units required) to attain your award. - from Google search An academic year may be subdivided into 2, 3 or 4 terms. Some university may use two semesters instead with possibly a third semester to fit between the two. ",

            "answer_text": "Read the answer by Nick Byrd first. I have only one thing to add: A unit may also refer to the load/credit you get for taking a specific course. For example, \u201cMath 101\u201d may be a 3-unit course. In the example below, \u201cquarter\u201d refers to the \u201cterm\u201d of a course. For example, at UCLA Undergraduates must enroll in 12-21 units each quarter. Students wishing to enroll in less than 12 units or more than 21 units must obtain approval by submitting a petition to Message Center prior to enrollment. ",
