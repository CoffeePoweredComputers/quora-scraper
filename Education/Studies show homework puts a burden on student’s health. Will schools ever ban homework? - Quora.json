            "answer_text": "I have been a teacher for many years. I have taught all grades and most subjects. I taught high level English at high school for 7 years. I always assigned homework\u2026.most nights. They were extensions of my lesson but in more depth. So\u2026if I gave a lesson and assigned 20 questions\u2026.most students would complete at least half the questions in class if they used their time effectively. They could turn in the work and get a passing grade. If they took their assignments home and spent time writing thoughtful answers to the rest of the questions, they would achieve top marks and have good notes to study for their exams. There is no short cut to this process. I have tried many other ways to assess learning\u2026we do group work, projects, discussions in class and those are all valuable because the learning is done actively and using different models reaches the majority of students effectively. But nothing takes away from reflective learning. Students can recall what was discussed in class, read the original text, research on line for deeper meaning and translate their thoughts into thoughtful responses. Just the act of reading, reflecting, writing, revising, embeds deeper knowledge. This cannot be done well in the hurly burly of classroom activity. It needs solitude and reflective thought\u2026probably done in the quiet of a study space in their homes. All my top students worked this way. I know because they told me. They appreciated the opportunity to work this way because it has been effective for them in the past. For those who do not do the extra work, they get the average to low average mark\u2026and many students are not interested in high honors\u2026they are happy with a good passing mark. And their effort reflects that. If you do not believe me\u2026that\u2019s ok. You or your child can work the way that suits you best. But just know\u2026that there are millions of students around the world working hard to achieve good grades and enroll in top schools. Do you really think that not putting in extra effort leads to success? Good luck with that idea. It just might work for you. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a sadly silly question really - why ask schools to consider 'banning' homework? Will schools ever develop reasonable policies regarding homework - would be the serious question to ask. For teachers who insist - as they do in other answers to your question - that homework is an absolute necessity - reasonable school policies wouldn't ban homework but they could foster a better approach to it. I never encountered a school that had policies on homework - I've heard there are schools that limit it to ten minutes per subject but in my experience homework and assigning it met with no restrictions. Schools should have websites where daily homework is entered - so teachers can see what all has been assigned - and hopefully coordinate the workload - and administrators should come out from behind their desks and create proper homework goals that work to support learning but support families as well. Hours of homework night after night and then every weekend as well is counterproductive. Homework on holidays is unnecessary and to assign homework on school performance nights is just plain dumb. The rather extreme question posed doesn't foster discussion on a topic that sorely needs to be discussed - the current general unorganized free-for-all more the better approach to homework doesn't serve well and it doesn't speak well of us as teachers - ",
