Binomial distribution involves only two situations, either a success or a failure and hence the name.is related to the binomial theorem with its PMF. For any PMF to be valid, it must sum up to 1.Let\u2019s see if binomial\u2019s PMF is valid  where n=number of trials p = probability of success x = sum of the outcomes of \u2019n\u2019 Bernoulli trials Therefore, its a valid PMF according to the binomial theorem and hence the name.

            "answer_text": "It is because the distribution is defined with a binomial variable x, either 1 or 0, success or failure, etc. Binomial distribution describes the distribution of the number of y, of which times the x=1 is observed in n times of observations. (When n=1, Binomial distribution degenerates to Bernoulli distribution.) This is similar to multinomial variable and corresponding multinomial distribution. ",
