            "answer_text": "I think I can answer this well. I was at Naduthottil for the year 2018\u201319 the second batch of the hostel.I tell you. It is THE BEST EVER BRILLIANT HOSTEL YOU CAN EVER GET !! If you have any second thoughts on EMERALD,then hold on. I had the rare opportunity to be there too. Having stayed at both the places, I think naduthottiyil is the best to be at. Never mind the 5 min bus ride (which brilliant arranges) you get to relax on the way to and back to you classes. We have 4 floors and each with a warden. And each floor has 4 flats and each flat has 5 rooms spacious enough. The rooms are A,B& E has only 2 people while C&D have 4 people in it. The mess is the best. They play music at dinnertime. And the food is the best you can ever ask for.The rules are strict and they make sure we study and not spend the nights lazy and chatting with friends. If you really want to have a nice healthy competitive atmosphere and a nice place to study then go for it.You\u2019ll definitely wont regret it. ",

The wardens change year after year but i heard they aren't too strict as long as you don't cause trouble. The food isn't super great but its good nevertheless. ",
