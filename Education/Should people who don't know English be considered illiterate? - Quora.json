            "answer_text": "Sure, let\u2019s go with that logic. How illiterate are you? Do you speak the most spoken language on earth - Mandarin Chinese? No? Hmm, that\u2019s a problem. How about Spanish? Can you converse or communicate in the second-most spoken language? No again? Oh dear, this is really not looking good. How about any of the other 4,000 languages on earth that aren\u2019t English, know any of them? What makes you think English is the end-all marker of literacy? If English is the only language you know, wouldn\u2019t that make you mostly illiterate? ",

            "answer_text": "That is a very inconsiderate thing to say. You are generally restricted to what you know, from your family historical lessons and teachings, your education and state mandates, and your own personal experiences. Some people have not read widely, traveled far, or heard much about the world other than English-speaking. In this case, it is harder to understand other cultures, visit new lands, or be labelled as a more naive or new tourist when coming into foreign places that are implicitly governed. Many of these places are old, usually called the Old World, to contrast with what is new and attempting to create or develop anew into a society, the New World. There are many languages in the world that are older than English. ",
