            "answer_text": "The way things move. Specifically, the movements of living things, be it people, animals, insects, whatever. I think about the muscles and other parts that have to work together to make even the smallest movement possible. There's a lot that just watching someone/something can tell you. A cat's tail can convey his whole mood, you can look at someone's body language to understand how they are feeling as well. Other times it's just artistically interesting to watch movement, seeing the way that it all works. Sorry if this post is a bit unclear, but this was the best way I could think to describe it, haha! I don't really know why I find this sort of thing so interesting to me, but it is. ",

            "answer_text": "Playing chess. Well, okay, it might not be that fun, but it's definitely entertaining. It's a game that I enjoy playing because it requires a lot of concentration, and also because of its complex rules which makes it much less boring than playing checkers (don't be offended if you prefer checkers, it's just a little bit too repetitive for me). Anyway, I've only started playing chess a short time ago, so I'm not able to precisely describe why I like it, but my opinion is that even if you think it looks boring and uninteresting, I think you should still give it a try and see for yourself!
