There was a time when I would workout twice a day.. I\u2019d start mid mornings for about 2 hrs doing burpees, navy seals, rocking chairs, and basic calisthenics with running about 3\u20135 miles. then I\u2019d workout again mid afternoons chest and back one day. Next day legs, and then following day shoulders/arms and usually took about 1\u20132 hours and run again at least a mile or 2 and repeat the process I did this off and on for about 5 yrs and then really started to workout consistently for the last 10 years up till my discharging my CDCR number\u2026 We get plenty of rest as it is in prison, but I What I really learned that\u2019s most important is everyone is built differently and everyone\u2019s metabolism is different\u2026 I can pretty much eat whatever I want whenever and I\u2019ll just stay at 150\u2013155 but if I workout I get up to 170\u2013175\u2026 you have to give yourself 90\u2013180 days and you will see results\u2026 If your in Ad Seg your working out everyday because it\u2019s mandatory workout for all whites unless your SNY/PC it just depends on your race and what their program is..

            "answer_text": "They have a daily routine just like you and me. If they are in General Population they have access to things like chin up bars, and they can lift heavy objects over and over. (Weights were removed from most yards in Cali.). To get the bulk they go to the store and buy protein supplements. In their house they do push ups and isometrics. After the weights were removed from the yard I saw no change at all in inmates bulking up. In Security Housing they fill plastic trash bags with water and lift them for hours. If the inmate has a job, its 8 hours a day usually. They can work out before or after work and on their day off. Its just something to pass the time. Now, the funny part is when an inmate paroles he can look like Arnie used to. I mean the guy is seriously buffed. When he hits the streets he stops working out and starts doing drugs. They shrink back up into a walking skeleton. Then when he is violated, he gets back to working out, eating regular, taking the protein, and he buffs right back up again. You can look at the before/ after Mugs and it almost looks like a balloon being blown up and then the air is let out. ",

I stayed away from the weights because the crowd around the weights during rec were all gangs and they used that time to lift and discuss business. It was better for me to not overhear anything I wasn't meant to. Basketball was favored by black inmates, but not exclusively, handball was played mostly by the Mexican and white inmates. Volleyball drew a mixed crowd. Games could get very competitive but fights weren't that common. Maybe one or two a week. We were supposed to get rec daily but because of prison employee shortages it didn't always happen. The inmates that worked in the rec yard sweeping and stuff were the dudes that worked out all day. It was one of the most sought after jobs. ",

Therefore you have more time on your hands that you\u2019ve got to fill. If it is a prisoner in prison who has a job he won\u2019t have the time nor the energy to work out that much. If he is in the SHU he still doesn\u2019t work out \u201cnearly all day.\u201d He will likely have a workout \u201cprogram\u201d amongst other things.

They can and will come up with stuff to lift, press, curl, what have you. Using the basic premise that a gallon of fresh water weighs 8 pounds, you can imagine how fast they will build muscle with a couple of trash bags filled to a safe limit with water, and then tied off inside two mesh laundry bags. Out of the yard they jog, do pull-ups of every variation you can imagine, and will do push-ups at every angle with their cellmate sitting over their shoulders. You don\u2019t find the extremely \u201cyoked\u201d convicts you see in the movies, but most inmates are in very good shape. I\u2019ve seen quarterly vendor packages come in filled with protein powder, and vitamin supplements, so even with the lousy food they get that make things work. ",

I would do at very least 2 workouts a day each one lasted several hours. ",
