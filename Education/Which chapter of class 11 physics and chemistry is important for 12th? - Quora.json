            "answer_text": "Physics: Units and measurements: Never ever leave this chapter, because not only it is easy, it will help you derive some formulas or relations even if you don\u2019t remember the actual derivation itself. This is helpful especially when you are solving numerical and helpful while eliminating options in objective questions.The unit involving Kinematics and Laws of Motion: These are basic and easy chapters, even you have mostly the electricity and magnetism part in 12th and these may not help you directly, physics is incomplete without this portion. Here you learn the problem-solving methodology and develop the physics aptitude which helps you throughout your career.System of Particles and Rotational Motion: One of the toughest chapters on 11th and 12th physics combined. I suggest you reading these, here you will develop skill to derive formulas, this will help you in deriving formulas in field of physics, not every physics is dependent on it, but the skill you gain here is the most important thing, the 12th physics would be cakewalk for you after this.Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory of gases: You should read these, because some concepts are repeated in chemistry.Work, Energy and Power: One of the basic chapters, this will help you develop a foundation in physics. It indirectly helps in all areas of physics.Now, other chapters all also important, they indirectly help in 12th physics, but I think you asked this question, because you are planning to skip some chapters, so I would suggest, at least read these thoroughly, solve all types of questions in them. But, if you are planning to take admission in big colleges(IITs. AIIMS) then don\u2019t leave other chapters. Chemistry: Structure of atom, Chemical bonding and Molecular structure: If you really want to understand chemistry, then no sane person will advise you to leave these chapters. Why? because all chemistry is dependent on them.Classification of elements and Periodicity: It is a gist of all periodic tables, the trends which lead to the classification of elements, you will learn the concepts, it will help you to understand which element is placed where and why, a general idea of groups is must for proceeding further.Thermodynamics, States of matter: Some concepts repeated in physics. These chapters will help you bridge chemistry and physics.Hydrocarbons and Organic Chemistry introduction: Since, you would be learning about them in deep in 12th, an outline of concepts given here will help you next year. Even if you will leave it, you will learn it next year, only it will tough.Equilibrium and Redox Reactions: Helpful in understanding the complex equations involved, especially in 12th. You will learn to balance reactions here, which is an important part of chemistry.I would advise you against skipping Hydrogen, s block and p block part, because you will learn many new things here, this will help you to easily connect to concepts involved in 12th inorganic chemistry.

            "answer_text": "First of all , try to study each and every chapter and concept deeply and thoroughly, so that u can remember the concepts for a longer period of time. Remember , everything should be important for you if u wanna be a champion. Now coming to your question , (in chemistry we've physical, organic and inorganic) First , organic of class 11th is directly connected to class 12th's organic ,so try to cover all the basics significantly in class 11th itself. In inorganic , ur P-Block is very important for class 12th as they have covered boron and carbon family in 11th and the rest of the p block groups in 12th. Physical chemistry is a conceptual one & it's not directly connected to 12th but ya like your Solids and Liquids in class 12th are much like the continuation to your Gaseous State or States of Matter of ur class 11th chem. Also , study Atomic Structure very well in eleventh\u2019a chemistry as it will directly help u in Modern Physics in class 12th . Now , in physics there is not much of relation like u have Mechanics , Waves , Oscillations, Thermodynamic \u2026in 11th whereas in 12th u have topics related to Magnetism, electricity , optics ,\u2026So , even if ur class 11th physics gets screwed up somehow ,still u have a chance to make a good comeback in 12th :p Work hard and Best of luck ;) ",
