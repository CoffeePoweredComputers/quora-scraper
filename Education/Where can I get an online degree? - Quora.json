            "answer_text": "These days the question is better asked where can\u2019t you earn an online university degree? There are a large number of schools that have been doing this for years. Many of these are primarily or exclusively online. There are an increasing number of schools that are offering online degrees that are traditional state or non-profit schools. Quality varies a great deal. My recommendation (my wife went there) is Fort Hayes State University in Kansas. They are a state school that has been doing online for a long time and do a pretty good job at it. Tuition is reasonable. They are not well known, which I have always appreciated since I worked at other schools. ",
