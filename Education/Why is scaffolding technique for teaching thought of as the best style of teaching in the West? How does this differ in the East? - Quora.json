            "answer_text": "No idea about the east, though I have found a lot of theories tend to cross that divide now. Scaffolding is based on solid academic theories about childhood development and has been shown to work far better than previous methods. Certainly in my experience I have seen it work very well. It works, if done right, by making the concepts being taught more accessible to everyone. It does this by providing just enough support so that the student is just out of reach of the answer - pushing them into that \u2018zone of proximal development\u2019 where they can push themselves and understand it. This is compared to the widely used previous system which basically did no support and just expected them to catch up regardless of their ability. This meant the clever students were bored, the medium level students were bored and the low level students were frustrated at being seen as \u2018the stupid ones who never get it and slow things down for the rest\u2019 by the rest of the class. This does not happen with scaffolding because each student is given exactly the help they need to achieve what is expected of them. So, if done right, every student feels like they have worked hard at something and achieved it - a hard won but doable battle. Say, for example, the students need to do a practical to demonstrate a concept in science. Your low level kids will be given exact instructions, a step by step protocol, and maybe some help in setting up the experiment. They will have some questions about the data collected appropriate to them - with some slightly harder ones at the end. Basic knowledge - what happened - questions. Maybe a short \u2018explain\u2019 at the end. Your mid level students will get the same protocol but will not need help. Their questions will be harder - that explain question will be included and maybe some harder ones. Maybe a question like \u2018how could you do this better?\u2019 Your high level students might get a list of available equipment and an instruction to work out an experiment to test the theory. They may need help with this (at the very least teacher should check the proposed protocol for sense, errors and safety stuff) but should be expected to come up with something that will work. Their questions will include stuff like \u2018how reliable was your method?\u2019 and \u2018How could you improve it?\u2019 and so on. In this case, everyone is challenged and no one is waiting for the slower students to \u2018get it\u2019. ",
