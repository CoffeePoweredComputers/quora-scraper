            "answer_text": "As a student at Conestoga College, I feel like I\u2019ll have an advantage over other universities when I graduate. I\u2019m currently in the Mechanical Systems Engineering Degree program and it\u2019s been the best one and a half years thus far. Our hiring rate is through the roof in my program and Conestoga in general and that\u2019s because of the raw hands on experience we receive, added on to the one on ones we have with our professors and Faculty. There\u2019s a reason why more and more graduates from universities are going to college after getting their degree and it\u2019s because they never learn the practicality of their job there. Here we mix both theory and practicality and it helps you understand the concepts and also apply them! Of course, since I\u2019m in an engineering program, it\u2019s a constant stream of hard work and sweat and to add on I have a relationship, going to the gym and extra curriculars, but it\u2019s worth it. Also, the community here is amazing. I have three friend groups and they all feel like family to me. They would do anything for me and I\u2019d do anything for them. We\u2019ve cried together, laughed together and even puked together. If anyone is choosing to come here, I\u2019d highly recommend going into residence the first year and trying to find a group of pals in the residence or in your program. Conestoga does have its down fall of being small and being a commuter school, but take advantage of that. Let yourself be known by your professors and find friends that make you feel like home. Hope this helped! ",
