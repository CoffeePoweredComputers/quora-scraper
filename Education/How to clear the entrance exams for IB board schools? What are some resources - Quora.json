            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll take it that you are trying to get into an IB school. The first thing that I recommend you do is that you become absolutely fluent and understand the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of the school's first language (normally English). This means having a deeper analysis and evaluation of the language and how it is used in courses. Also, having the ability to critically think about different perspectives is crucial. I have linked some resources for you. https://ibresources.github.io/#ib-past-papers theibstop.com International Baccalaureate \u2022 r/IBO IB Notes & Resources (Updated 2020) - Nail IB IB Revision & Resources Hope that helps and good luck :) ",
