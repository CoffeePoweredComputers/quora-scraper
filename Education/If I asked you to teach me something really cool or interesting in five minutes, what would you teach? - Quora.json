            "answer_text": "First thought: Okay, so far, me personally, I don\u2019t like the other answers here. So I\u2019ll answer something different. . Second thought: Besides, teach positivity and motivation in just five minutes? Also, how long does it take to read that? Nevermind. If I\u2019m gonna teach you something quick, it must be something you relate to, understand, or makes sense to you. That way, it will be easy for you to learn. . Third, thought: I\u2019ve given answers like that already. But what\u2026 hmm\u2026 oh, I know! How to talk to girls. So it goes like this. Instead of asking what girls are looking for, ask what girls are not looking for: Anxiety. Anxiety is the true women repellant. But you can go to the restroom and release it before talking to women. Chewing gum might help too. Make sure it\u2019s icy mint not mouthwash flavor. Two birds with one stone. Don\u2019t rely too much on either the restroom or chewing gum, cuz at any moment you could find yourself without both. Either way, remember all the time, no anxiety. And if something isn\u2019t working, examine yourself to see if you\u2019re being anxious.Too nice or too rude. If you\u2019re too nice, she will see you as a doormat (even if you\u2019re not), and you\u2019ll get friendzoned. Well, the other extreme is also bad. Don\u2019t be too rude. Cuz nobody wants to be with someone who\u2019s just gonna make them feel bad all the time and never do anything nice for them or tell them anything nice. So be nice, but not too nice.A sense of humor. And this is more than just making jokes or knowing jokes. It\u2019s also clever comnents with comedic timing. This is a bit of a weak example, but my grandpa was once talking with someone who said \u201cI cannot drink coffee at night, or else I can\u2019t go to sleep\u201d. And he said \u201cwell, coffee doesn\u2019t let me sleep either. I can\u2019t sleep thinking about that cup of coffee I want to drink. I drink it and I sleep fine\u201d. Just remember, clever, and timing. Specially timing.Awkward silence. Gals want guys who know how to make conversation. And the best way to learn to talk with girls is to practice. Start conversations wirh girls, and with strangers (but be careful) when you\u2019re sitting somewhere waiting for your turn, or on the bus, on the train, so on. If it doesn\u2019t go well, you can say \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m trying to learn to make conversation\u201d. Memorize that.A guy that talks too much. Because nobody likes that. It\u2019s annoying. So again. It is a balance. Not be too silent, not talk too much.Don\u2019t let her know you like her. Compliment her, talk with her, spend time with her, give her space (it\u2019s a balance), but in a way that could be excused as friends, but is actually flirtatious. Whatever you do, don\u2019t confirm nor deny that you\u2019re friends. Same for whether or not you like her. As you spend more time together, you\u2019ll become closer and closer until you two get together.. Fourth thought: With that second thought you could learn how to teach something quick, and in under five minutes. . Fifth thought: with that third thought, you could learn to make conversation, and that nobody likes someone who talks too much. . Sixth thought: you probably will forget everything if you try to learn everything in five minutes or less. So if that\u2019s all the time you have, stop reading, and focus on the tips from third thought since they are the most helpful stuff in this answer. . Seventh thought: not to brag, but I think I\u2019ve probably taught you way more than the other answers that were here by the time I started making this answer. . Eigth thought: I probably taught you something else with the sixth thought. . Ninth thought: actually, even if you read all of this instead of focusing in one thing, some if it might stay with you. . I had some other thoughts but I\u2019ve spent too much time here anyway. So I\u2019ll leave it there. ",

            "answer_text": " There is one 5-minute habit that I\u2019ve incorporated into my day about two years ago. I practice it every morning. And what it\u2019s done for me is quite impressive \u2014 it\u2019s made me feel better about the day, more optimistic, and I\u2019d say even happier. What is this small habit? I take a few moments early in the morning to sit and quietly think how grateful I am for what I have going on in my life right now. Practicing gratitude isn\u2019t an isolated activity. It makes a shift in our mindset (the way we think about situations, things, people), and this in turn has a huge impact in the way we see our own life. What are specific benefits I\u2019ve noticed from practicing gratitude? It trains my brain to think about positive things. These can be specific things that I\u2019m doing, thinking about, or working on incrementally in small steps. They\u2019re not things or behaviors others want of me, or things other people have, or achievements by anyone else. The biggest benefit? When I start the day thinking about the + and not the - , I\u2019ve found that my brain stays longer focused on the good stuff. It\u2019s as if the positive becomes a theme for the whole day, and it keeps my mood up.It helps me see my life as plentiful. Ever heard of the saying, You can see the glass as half-empty or half-full? Here\u2019s how that saying pertains to real-life scenarios. Think of experiences and people, not just things. It helps you expand your understanding of the word have. And it works \u2014 I\u2019ve found that there are always new items I want to add to this list. For example, this morning I thought about how grateful I am for spending a fun day with family over the holidays, as well as for several beautifully written comments on my Quora answers.It improves the attitude I have towards other people. As you know from your own life experiences, other people\u2019s behaviors and reactions are difficult to predict, and often impossible to anticipate. In some cases, there are people who we enjoy spending time with, and there are others who will provoke, irritate, and upset us. With a gratitude mindset, I started treating every interaction (both at work and in my personal and social life) as a learning experience. I also try to find one small thing in each conversation that can be beneficial to me in some way. For example, if I talk to a person with a negative and critical mindset, it motivates me to brainstorm new ways to practice optimism. Conversely, enjoying a discussion with a curious and intelligent friend motivates me to optimize ways to boost my imagination, shape ideas for personal projects, or incorporate shortcuts to work smarter.How can you start building this simple habit into your day? It\u2019s easier than you think. If you read these 3 tips, you\u2019ll see what I mean. Tip #1. Practice early. When you start your day expressing gratitude, you will feel the effects throughout the day. Take a few minutes when you wake up and before you start getting ready for work or school. Give yourself some quiet time to focus on what you want to say. You might want to close your eyes while you think about it, or maybe you\u2019ll want to write your thoughts down in a journal and then say them out loud. Pick whatever feels more natural to you. Tip #2. Start small. Practicing gratitude isn\u2019t anything abstract or philosophical\u2014it\u2019s about real people, things, experiences, and events. As you sit quietly, focus on 3 things you are grateful for today. It can be the simplest of things: having a warm bed to sleep in, a roof over your head, a sunny sky, a close friend you trust, a pet that you like spending time with when you come home, etc. Or, it can be an object you find beautiful and that you have in your home, but that you don\u2019t always pay attention to \u2014 a plant on your windowsill or a painting on your bedroom wall. Finally, it can be an enjoyable moment you shared the day before with a close friend or partner \u2014 think about how the time spent with them made you feel. Tip #3. Be specific. If it\u2019s that one person \u2014 friend, partner, or confidante \u2014 that you\u2019re grateful for having in your life, be sure to emphasize which of their qualities you are grateful for (they\u2019re warm, smart, funny, creative, honest, etc.). If you really like having your own room or apartment, point out why this is important to you (you have personal freedom to enjoy quiet time in the evening to relax, and to sleep undisturbed when you need to). And if it\u2019s being part of a group (your running mates with whom you hike on weekends or friends who share your love of music or film), reflect on how being around them makes you feel, and recall a recent event you all attended together and what made it fun and enjoyable.
