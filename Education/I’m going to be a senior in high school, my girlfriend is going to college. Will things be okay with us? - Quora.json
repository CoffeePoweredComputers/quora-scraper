            "answer_text": "It is possible, but less than likely. I remember my first and second year at college. It is slightly embarrassing first of all when you are at college and admit your boyfriend is in high school. There will be snickers and jokes. Then there is the fact that she is practically living with college guys. You say she can be bad and at college there infinite opportunists to be bad. Also the players always work the long con and the short con. Meaning they know who they can get in a weekend or two and those that take a semester or two. They employ different tactics for each so she will be a target for one or the other. The key is honesty and communication without being possessive. Just know when to cut your losses, but don\u2019t give up yet. I remember a very attractive super intelligent girl who had a high school boyfriend and then he joined the Marines so they were still apart and they eventually got married. I knew about ten more that the relationship was done by Christmas. ",

I\u2019m going to add one new piece of advice: Let\u2019s say you are still together a year from now. Making a post-secondary education decision is tough enough. Now your judgment is going to be clouded even more by your desire to go to Bowling Green to be near your girlfriend. Important questions like: Should I be matriculating at a four-year college?Can I afford Bowling Green without excessive student loan debt?Is Bowling Green strong in the marketable major I have chosen?Is living in a college town right for me?etc.Are all going to get lost in the shuffle.
