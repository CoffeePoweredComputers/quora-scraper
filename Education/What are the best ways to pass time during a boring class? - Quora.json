            "answer_text": "Back in high school, I had a trigonometry class so boring, I often found myself physically holding my eyes open to stop from falling asleep. I would ask to use the bathroom and do jumping jacks or speedwalk around the building just to get some wakeup circulation. The teacher was also a stickler for rules and constantly on the lookout for any phone use, doodling, or dozing off.  accurate depiction of how everyone felt in that class So I eventually turned to my thoughts. I wanted to find out just what made a person boring. I intently studied the variance in speed and tone of the teacher\u2019s voice compared to my classmates\u2019 when they answered questions. I listened to the teacher\u2019s vocabulary, counting the pauses, fillers and length of words used. I also used the time for worldbuilding my then work-in-progress scifi novel (it\u2019s out now). I couldn\u2019t write in class, but I before class, I would plan out what I would think about. I came up with backstories for characters, economic policies of countries, and the tactics used in battles all while staring glassy-eyed at the whiteboard. I mentally memorized specific wordings of scenes I would later write. Sometimes I could get away with taking \u201cnotes\u201d that were just sentences I would use for the book. In the end, I passed the class and swiftly forgot everything related to trigonometry. Never once have I come close to needing it, and neither did anyone else I know. We\u2019re raising a generation of kids who know advanced mathematics but not how to maintain their own car, pay taxes, or budget their income. We overload on trinomial factoring while being totally unable to express our ideas in words. We judge people\u2019s worthiness for hiring based on a number that reflects their ability to calculate the cosecant of a wave form, but allow people to vote without knowing the three branches of government! It\u2019s a faustian bargain that can only end in disaster. ",
