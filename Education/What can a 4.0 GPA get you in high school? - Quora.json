            "answer_text": "The caveat is that all 4.0s are not created equally. First off, I\u2019m assuming the 4.0 you mention is unweighted and on the College Board recognized scale of 93% or higher for each grade. An unweighted 4.0 by a student who has taken a rigorous schedule filled with honors, APs, IB classes has accomplished much more than a student who has taken non-rigorous classes. It can be a rather empty achievement to have a 4.0 when you haven\u2019t pushed yourself. And if you were able to get all A\u2019s in non-honors classes, you probably didn\u2019t find your maximum potential. There are some funny YouTube videos out there of salutatorians discussing being \u201csecond best\u201d to valedictorians who spent four years chasing only APs, while the posters also took an array of fun electives (along with a full AP schedule) and had a blast in high school. While it hurt their weighted GPA, they had better high school experiences - and likely grew more well-rounded as human beings. All that said, students taking college prep classes who nail a 4.0 should be proud. All top colleges hold class rigor as one of the most important (and required) parts of an application. Adcoms see entire transcripts, not just final grades. What can a 4.0 \u201cget you\u201d? Well, as with standardized tests, it can keep you from being disqualified in the college application process. Grades don\u2019t get you in, but they can keep you out. A 4.0 is also attractive to merit scholarship committees, whether institutional money or from local businesses. In the end, a 4.0 GPA is part of the holistic puzzle when it comes to college applications. ",

            "answer_text": "A 4.0 GPA in high school is something that I achieved. I say this not to brag, but to speak from experience. A 4.0 GPA is a great thing to have because it will allow you more opportunities from a college standpoint. The higher your grades achieve in high school, the amount of collegesyou can get into for further education increases by a lot.A 4.0 GPA can help you get scholarships. There are thousands of scholarships available for academic merit so a 4.0 GPA is a good achievement to have under your belt when applying for them. Not paying for college is a huge hole you avoid digging for yourself to get out of in the futurePersonal pride. Acheiving a 4.0 GPA can be a personal goal one may set and achieving it allows you to prove to yourself you can achieve things you work hard for.Those are the main benefits I see from a 4.0 GPA but grades are not everything. If you get a 3.5 GPA because you don\u2019t want to spend all your time doing school specific work and spend a few hours a week learning another skill such as coding, writing, etc, then you are also developing yourself as well. Grades are not everything, education is about how much you are actually learning and how you can apply it to what you want to do with your life. ",
