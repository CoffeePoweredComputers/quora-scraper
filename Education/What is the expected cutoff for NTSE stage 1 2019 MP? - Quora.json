            "answer_text": "Clearly this year level of question paper was easy specially in paper 1 one can easily score 95 marks. score in paper depends on your knowledge of history, political, economics and geography but questions are easy for an average student. So I thought cutoff will be around 160 to 170 If you're scoring above 180 then be chill you're in comfortable position. For below 150 I thought it will be difficult considering the huge competition. Thanks And wait for better results\u2026. ",
