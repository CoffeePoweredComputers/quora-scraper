            "answer_text": "Yes! But what most people realise is that they are not only useful for applying to universities! Let me share with you some ways the IB certificate has been useful. For applying to universities\u2026 duh?The IB certificate is really useful for applying to universities, mainly because it is an internationally recognised examination. This means that countries from all over the world will know what the IB is and the rough benchmarks that surrounds it. Most universities have an entry criteria specific to the IBDP. So, scoring well in the IB can give you a good chance to enter the university of your choice! (Although, you should check if the university of your choice accepts IB as an entry requirement). 2. For applying to jobs. In countries like Singapore, where the IBDP isn\u2019t as prevalent, having an IB Diploma can actually make you stand out as a candidate. As the IB is rather new and upcoming in Singapore, many of the older/middle aged employers may not know what the IB is or may simply be curious about it. So, having this certificate can actually make them curious about YOU. 3. Building a different network. This also may not be as applicable to everyone but it was the case for me. I was able to instantly connect with many acquaintances just due to the fact that we took the IB. No, it wasn\u2019t because we thought we were special and unique. Rather, it was because the IB isn\u2019t that prevalent in Singapore yet and thus, finding someone who also did the IB was an instant connection. For example, the first few questions I normally get are: What was your subject combination?What was your EE about?Non-IB students may not understand what these are or how the IB system works so finding someone who was an IB student would definitely be an instant connection. Some friends who I met locally also were able to relate to me once I shared that I did the IB examination. ",

            "answer_text": "The full Diploma is definitely more recognised by universities than certificates alone. However, doing a certificate in a subject still means you\u2019re taking it at diploma level, meaning you\u2019re not learning less in a subject, but you just do less subjects in total. I take four IB subjects at the moment plus tok and I have applied to six universities this year, and after having to explain to some of them what certificates are, I got an offer from all of them. Certificates are definitely useful. ",
