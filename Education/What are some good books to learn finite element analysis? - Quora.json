            "answer_text": "There is no one set of books that would work for everyone. You will need to scout out a few and try to find the best that suits your style. Some books are too mathematical while others leave out a lot of essential math. So depending on one\u2019s mathematical background & how much time is available to digest new content, a suitable book can be opted for. In general, I personally prefer For general overview on FEM (related to all areas), the three volume book by Zienkiewicz and Taylor. I have not found a topic not answered here (in general). Volume 01: The Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals\nVolume 02: The Finite Element Method For Solid and Structural Mechanics\nVolume 03: The Finite Element Method for Fluid Dynamics If you are looking at Nonlinear Finite Element Method, I can strongly recommend the book \"Nonlinear Finite Element Methods\" by Peter Wriggers. It is slightly mathematical but an understanding of nonlinear FEM needs a basic understanding on Tensor calculus. Some people also prefer \u201cNonlinear Finite Elements for Continua and Structures\u201d by Ted Belytschko, Wing Kam Liu, Brian Moran, Khalil Elkhodary for Nonlinear FEM. If you go into specific topics like contact, fracture, damage etc, then one will need books related to these specific areas to address more detailed questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately , there is no single book to cover my taste on the subject. In any case you will end up iteratively deepening on the subject. For someone with zero knowledge, i would suggest starting with Thirupati Chandrupatla as mentioned above and then go and study the Bathe book. In order to program simple FEM , you do not need deep knowledge of the mathematics of the method but as soon as you hit nonlinear you better understand what is going on. If you want to nonlinear, then the 2 Crisfield books are a great reading ",
