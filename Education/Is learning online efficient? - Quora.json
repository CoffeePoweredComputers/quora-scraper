            "answer_text": "Four years ago, I would have said maybe. Today I\u2019m saying 100%, yes!  In terms of efficiency, online learning is far superior to in-person courses. This is why many courses and programs are exploring online models, and why several in-person coding bootcamps like Dev Bootcamp and Iron Yard have recently shut their doors for good. [Full disclosure, I am a co-founder of The Firehose Project, a coding bootcamp that moved from in-person to online because we anticipated the change in the market and spent the last four years building an online education experience that\u2019s engineered to make things click for our students]. With online learning, you can spend more time on challenging or interesting concepts, and spend less time on concepts that come easily to you. Rather than being held at the pace of a classroom, you can move more efficiently at your own pace through the curriculum. When you consider this in addition to not needing to commute to a physical location and being able to participate in the course when it works for your schedule, you\u2019ve got much more time on your hands to dive into the material and learn new skills. The question you may want to consider is whether online learning is effective. This will vary greatly by program, so it\u2019s helpful to know what to look for if you\u2019re exploring online learning options. Considering these 6 aspects of online learning will help you find an effective online learning program: > Support when you need it - just because you\u2019re learning online doesn\u2019t mean you should be on your own. Good online programs will have support available when you need it. Some effective ways of getting support in online programs include: Forums where you can ask questions, and get expert helpLive Q&A sessions1-1 mentorshipChatting with fellow studentsGetting regular feedback on your work> 1-on-1 Mentorship - connecting with an expert means you\u2019ll receive guidance during your learning process to ensure that your skills are developing at a professional level. When learning skills, mentorship is a great opportunity to pair program, work through challenges together, and make sure you\u2019re making progress each week. > Curriculum - the curriculum of the program should give you both a foundation and specific hard skills. When learning skills, gaining a solid foundation will set you up for long-term success. Technology changes fast and mastering the fundamentals means you\u2019re able to think like a programmer as you adapt to changes and learn new skills throughout your career. > Community - since you won\u2019t be attending a physical classroom, it\u2019s important that you\u2019re still able to benefit from a community so you can engage with other students and build out a network. Online programs that foster community and allow you to network with students, alumni, mentors, and other professionals will make sure you\u2019re not missing out on this key aspect of learning a new skill. > Education vs. \u201cEdutainment\u201d - some online programs air more on the side of \u201cedutainment\u201d than education. With coding, the best way to learn to code is by writing code - simply following along with videos or recorded lectures isn\u2019t going to cut it when your skills are actually put to the test. Good online programs should include challenges, hands-on work, team projects, and real-world applications of the skills that you\u2019re learning. > Not too good to be true - as with many things, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Any program that suggests you can \u201cbecome a professional for free in just 6 weeks\u201d is probably not going to get you to the level you need if you\u2019re looking to start a new career. Learning to code, or any new skill, is hard and you should expect to put in a lot of time and effort to be successful. While it shouldn\u2019t take 10,000 hours to learn a new skill, I would prepare to dedicate several months. If you\u2019d like to see an online learning platform in action, you can sign up for our online coding bootcamp for free, and get real feedback on your first lines of code from our dedicated support team.

            "answer_text": "Learning online is incredibly efficient. In fact, working online, learning online, teaching online, etc. is currently the most efficient method to compartmentalize aspects of your life IF you are willing to stay motivated and be honest with yourself (and your teacher!). You cannot get lazy if you\u2019re shifting your life online: be responsible and self-motivated and enjoy the rewards and convenience. Online learning is not for those who are completing a course because it is mandatory. It is for those who are truly inspired and motivated.  Some advantages of learning online over the traditional classroom: Personal assessment before learning. A good online company or teacher should be able to test your status and pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses, helping to define your study plan and curriculum.Personal attention and feedback. In most online learning situations, it\u2019s just you and the teacher. No distractions, no repeating your classmates\u2019 errors and mistakes, no waiting for others. You get feedback with each step of the journey.Convenience. No, online learning doesn\u2019t mean you can be lazy, or watching TV in the background, it means that you can attend your class regardless of the weather, your vehicle\u2019s condition, traffic and so many other factors. If you travel for work or leisure, you can take classes from the comfort of a hotel or quiet cafe.Record and Replay. This is an advantage that many learners don\u2019t realize or take advantage of. Learning online, students can replay their lesson as many times as they\u2019d like, pausing and re-watching as they wish.Affordability! Many personal teachers and tutors charge high rates as they factor in travel time and lesson preparation. With online learning, you don\u2019t have to pay London, New York or Sydney hourly rates if your teacher is located in another part of the world. Online lessons are very often cheaper, as was in my case. My Own Story Before arriving in China and enrolling in a Mandarin Chinese language course here, I had began my Chinese learning at a community college in the USA. Unfortunately, it was too easy for me to fade into the background. I wasn\u2019t being forced to speak with the teacher each step of the way and I wasn\u2019t getting the personalized feedback that I needed. The speaking tones of Mandarin Chinese were difficult and I was repeating the mistakes of my classmates. I decided to enroll in online lessons. I first took a free online assessment test with a teacher in China. The test pinpointed my strengths and weaknesses and helped me develop a study plan. In just 30 minutes I felt like I\u2019d already make great progress. You asked about efficiency? That 30 minutes was the same as my commute to school. That intro college course I took in the classroom ended up being my last. I was making such good progress with the online lessons that I wasn\u2019t getting enough from the course to continue. Since I was saving some time, I focused on self-study through apps, websites, blogs and textbook. I took additional Mandarin Chinese classes online to help with all levels of my HSK tests. I made such great progress that I changed my life plan and moved to China to finish my degree here. Being a somewhat shy student, online learning really brought me out of my shell and got me speaking. Not just for efficiency, but also effectiveness, I can certainly recommend online learning.  ",
