Usually the level of academic requirements is very low, as is the quality of the \u201cpublications\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t recommend enrolling in any, as they make for lousy education and even lousier career prospects. If one is interested in those topics, it is best to study them from departments of Economics, Psychiatry, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology and such (and, even then, one must always be a bit skeptical regarding the latter three).
