            "answer_text": "Now a days students become very conscious about their studies and start preparing for class 12 board exams right from the class 11 itself. You may find the notes anywhere on the internet. But do not collect a bulk and start reading from it instead choose the good material for quality knowledge. You may refer to M LEARNING INDIA for the best of study material. But the best is you make your own notes so that it is easy for you to learn and understand a concept while sitting in a lecture just write down what you feel like it is important for knowledge of for exam point of view and your notes are ready. I suggest you to subscribe to M LEARNING VIDEO STREAMING APP it will help you a lot moreover it contains a lot of questions for you to practice and after learning and practicing the concepts you will become master in it. Hope it will help. All the best :) ",
