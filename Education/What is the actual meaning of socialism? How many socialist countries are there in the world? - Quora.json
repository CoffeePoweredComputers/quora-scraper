            "answer_text": "Socialism is actually the society owning the means of production (read other answers about what it means, it's said there plenty of times already.) It it an economical system, where contrary to Capitalism, Private ownership of Capital, and therefore even wage-labour are outlawed. It can be done under almost any current political system, imagine all corporations turning into collective-owned enterprises. Do you get the idea of what is it going to be? Less organized, yet more equal, maybe more reactive to the market situation. It encompases:a) in politics: 1) Full State Socialism (or even State Capitalism) - planned economy USSR style, it's a Frankenstein mix of the worst of both Socialism and Capitalism with heavy governmental involvement, barely democratic. Though some people like it. 2) Limited State Socialism - Purely theoretical. Imagine a today's liberal democracy with Socialism implemented instead of Capitalism. Some political changes may be needed though. 3) Libertarian Socialism - basically LSS with emphasis on low government involvement. 4) Anarcho-Socialism, Anarcho-Syndicalism - Roughly tried, with unclear and very short term results. Certainly not long-lived (Such a society lived for a year at most in recent history.) Sometimes didn't stand up for the ideals it followed, sometimes did. 5) Crazy forms like Monarcho-Socialism and other things. I list it here just for fun, nobody believes in that. Though I think it could be entertaining to think about such society. b) in economics1) Market Socialism - There is still \"free\" market in its current form. The difference lies only in the ownership of Capital. 2) Traditional Socialism - Competition is outlawed in favor of cooperation. The society democratically decides the price, is moneyless (closer to Communism), or uses any other imaginable solution for the problem of no competition. 3) Planned Economy - Pseudo-socialist system, since it doesn't behave like Socialism at all. Socialism is in this case interchangeable with Capitalism, since a single entity still holds the Capital (the State is just the last capitalist), but the State also represents the people. Since wage labor and other things are still present, I wouldn't use failures of this system as an argument against theoretical Socialism. Social Democracy, Welfarism, etc. - not forms of Socialism (could be categorized as forms of State Socialism), but instead POLITICAL PROGRAMS. They're not really subject to the economical system, but their roots sure can stem from the Socialist ideology.  I hope this answer can help with expanding the perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "Socialism exists in almost every country in the world and implemented to varying degrees. They're projects and programs designed for the betterment of the people. Roads are a basic form of it. Everyone benefits from a paved road.  Most notable one is welfare. It provides a safety net for everyone in society to keep a modest standard of living should anything go wrong. Obviously, it has become abused in recent years with a certain race in the US identifying it and wearing it as a badge of honor.  The problem is that socialism is a word with multiple meanings and varies from person to person. Nowadays, its most identified with communism. Many (not all) who call themselves liberal socialists nowadays are authoritarian socialists which is a half step down from communism.  ",
