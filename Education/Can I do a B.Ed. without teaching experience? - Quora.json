            "answer_text": "You can certainly start a B. Ed without prior experience, but you will be required to do all of your Practicums (Pracs) in schools. It\u2019s one thing to learn theory - another to apply it effectively. you can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t complete a B.Ed without experience. You need to find out fairly early whether you\u2019re going to enjoy the school system. It\u2019s often a good idea to spend a little voluntary time in a school, but not required. If you find out during your first Prac that it\u2019s not for you, you should be able to use your units towards a B.Arts. Your Education won\u2019t be wasted. However, if you don\u2019t pass your first Prac you may not be able to use all of your units as credits. I should point out that the first Prac is generally observation, so you\u2019d have to do something terrible, like hit someone or not turning up to your school to fail it. You\u2019ll have a mentor teacher during your Pracs. You cannot gain a B.Ed in any country that I know of without spending assessment time in a school. It wouldn\u2019t make any sense to! Your Pracs will increase your level of involvement in the classroom, hopefully ending with an Internship of up to 12 weeks where you have complete control of the classroom - setting up, assessing students for Individual Learning Plans, taking a register, applying OHS, Behaviour Management, perhaps contributing to reports, but mostly your effective communication with students in particular, but also staff and parents - usually without support but occasional observation. You\u2019ll probably be required to keep a professional journal so that your intrapersonal skills can be assessed. No one would expect you to work anywhere without experience and support. A B.Ed (In-Servic) May give you some credit towards time spent in a school as a Teacher Assistant, but you need to apply your own theory in the classroom. Even studying by Distance Education will require you to have a formal relationship with a school in order to implement your program. School Practicum are core units required to complete a B.Ed. You wouldn\u2019t be able to complete theory units without demonstrating that you can apply such learning. You wouldn\u2019t expect a doctor to get his experience without working with patients, would you? To specifically answer your question: You may be intelligent enough to pass an exam, but you also need to develop your communication skills to support students and to deal effectively with parents in order to gain your B.Ed. You\u2019re not expected to have the necessary skills and knowledge as an Undergraduate, but are required to learn them along the way, with support and underpinning theory. ",

You must have a graduate/ postgraduate degree from a recognised university. B.Ed is a professional degree which prepares students for work as a teacher in schools. During the duration of the 2 years course, the students under go a practical teaching training in a school for 4 months. In this teaching training the students get a real teaching experience. So,you don't need any teaching experience before pursuing B.Ed. You will get the teaching experience during your B.Ed teaching training. I hope it helps. :-) ",

It is just a degree level course cum eligibility criteria. After completing you can apply for the post of teachers in India. Different universities take their own entrance before taking admissions in B.ed. Basically, during the course duration you learn how to teach students. At that you learn teaching methods and manners. So, there is no requirement of teaching experience for B.ed admission. Thank you, Good Luck ",
