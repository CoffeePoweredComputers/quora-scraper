            "answer_text": "It makes sense to say that this is potentially quite a demand on life, commmitments to study and the practical idea of managing time. What might be a good option is to talk it through with someone who is closer to the situation and to you in order for you to access the best insights possible and consider all necessary to make the optimal decisions. In general, the understanding of 10 hours in school, is more a relative idea and would not necessarily clarify your position in the progress of your school aspirations, how much time is being commited to, the type of classes and your background as a student. The point is there are many factors worthy of consideration toward setting you up for success. ",

            "answer_text": "Is that ten hours a day or ten hours a week? If it is the latter then you'd better get a job to fill your time with useful stuff and help pay for your studies. In the breaks between terms at school I sometimes worked sixty to 70 hours a week to earn money to pay for my studies. Seeing there are 168 hours in aweek that still leaves over a hundred hours a week for reading, eating, sleeping and exercising. If you are already studying 10 hours a day then there are another 14 hours for other necessities each day, so three hours a day working for money is definitely possible. ",
