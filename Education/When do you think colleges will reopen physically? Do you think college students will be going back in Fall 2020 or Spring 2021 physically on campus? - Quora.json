            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve no idea, and many colleges have no idea either. I live in an area with many colleges and universities. All but one of them (one of the community colleges, and even that one closed down except for certain programs) closed and shifted to online learning for the rest of the spring semester. All of them are tentatively planning (hoping really) to have in-person classes come fall, but they\u2019re hedging their bets, because no one really knows whether the curve will be flat enough to justify having in person classes. Only yesterday one school listed their partial plan for reopening in the fall: they\u2019re planning to have smaller classes, to have students sit further apart, etc., but since it is a large university, they haven\u2019t figured out residential life. About half of the undergrads live on campus, in huge dorms. There are communal bathrooms and dining commons. Many of the dorms have double, triple rooms (meaning students have roommates), and others have suites (meaning students have separate rooms but they\u2019re in a suite with five or six other students. As for the juniors, seniors, and graduate students who opt to live off-campus, rents are very high, which means they have roommates, and in either case (live in the dorms on campus or off campus in apartments) it means the university will have to figure out social distancing for a large student population (with most students living in very close proximity to other students). For students who live locally (close enough to commute), they might opt to live at home with their parents, but that presents its own problems. Social distancing in dorms won\u2019t be a problem, but there\u2019s no way to ensure that even these students could avoid getting COVID-19 and then bring it home to share with parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. I don\u2019t how they\u2019re going to reopen and maintain social distance, not with so many students living in small dorm rooms, sharing bathrooms, eating in huge dining commons, etc. Even the smaller colleges face the same problems. Classes are smaller, but still\u2014are there enough bigger classrooms on campus so there can be social distancing in the classroom? What about the labs, the library, the gym, the studios, or do the small colleges eliminate this? And they still have to figure out how their students will live in close quarters in the dorms, how they\u2019re going to feed them when people need to be at least 6 feet apart. Additionally, if this virus does what the Spanish flu did in 1918, it means it may lessen over the summer, seem to go away, then return with a vengeance (even worse) in the fall and winter. I suppose if the colleges and universities decide to reopen to in person classes in the fall and COVID-19 returns, they\u2019ll shut down again, but that too presents problems, particularly if students can\u2019t get home, and then there\u2019s the risk colleges took (knowing that things could get worse in the fall/winter) and still reopened. There\u2019s risks to faculty and staff as well as students, plus the relatives of faculty and staff. I think schools should have two plans\u2014one for continued online education or perhaps even an entire shutdown, at least until there is a vaccine and it is truly safe to reopen, and one for reopening for in person classes (and a plan for how the students will live in the dorms with the social distancing guidelines), then decide which one to implement based upon where we as the states are come August.

            "answer_text": " Boiler up! \u201cWe have every intention of being on campus this fall.\u201d Those are the bold words of Purdue president, Mitch Daniels. Citing 'zero lethal threat' to students, Purdue works to reopen college for fall 2020 I suspect Purdue will be an outlier. There are some states that were only lightly hit by COVID-19, e.g. Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The schools tend to be smaller, e.g. the University of Montana and the University of Wyoming, both have fewer than 10,000 students. There might be some colleges and universities in those states willing to follow the Boilermakers in taking the plunge. IMHO, it will be next spring when most students will get back on campus. The opening of the fall semester is only 120 days away. I\u2019m just guessing, but it seems to me schools are going to have to publish their game plans in about four weeks in order for parents and students to make plans. Notes I keep tabs on Daniels. He was an executive with Eli Lilly and a two term governor of Indiana. He has done a lot of innovative things at Purdue University. (I suspect many of them will be dropped when he retires next year, because he has ruffled a lot of academic feathers.) Most COVID-19 models show a rebound in a November/December timeframe. That doesn\u2019t bode well for a school trying to get the students back on campus. Texas A&M and Texas Tech just announced they plan on being on campus this fall. ",
