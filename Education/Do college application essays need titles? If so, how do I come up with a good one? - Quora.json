            "answer_text": "College application essays do not need titles. In fact, most application essays do not have one. You may, of course, choose to add one if you feel like it adds value to the essay, but in most cases I would suggest not using one if not explicitly asked to provide a title. Other than the possibility that you might come up with a cheesy or otherwise less-than-optimal title, adding a title might create preconceived notions for your reader of what to expect, which may not be what you want. A college admissions officer who has taken an interest in your application is guaranteed to read your application essay, unlike an essay in an anthology or magazine. If well written, the introduction to the essay itself should do the job. There is no need to draw in the reader with an interesting title.  You should, however, begin your essay with an interesting \"hook.\" This could be a challenging or surprising statement or fact, or perhaps an opening paragraph that employs in medias res. ",

            "answer_text": "Simple answer: No. Long answer: To be honest, as a procrastinator, I\u2019d find any reason to avoid doing the task at hand (writing). So, eliminate this distraction. This is not necessary and in fact, it can be tacky. If you are done writing your essay and you want to add a title, it will be something that comes to you, but it can be a little corny. Thinking back at my college essay, would my title have been: \u201cLittle Macedonian girl wants to help people\u201d or \u201cWhen doctors don\u2019t help you, you want to help others..\u201d or something along those lines. First, I don\u2019t want the admissions committee to get a different idea, and then be disappointed by a title that over-promises or over-simplifies my essay\u2026when it is superfluous to begin with. Back to the short answer: No. :) ",

It doesn\u2019t add much to the essay itself, and it\u2019s very likely it will be passed over rather quickly in the process. And as for the post that recommended an essay writing service \u2014 just don\u2019t. It\u2019s great to work with a coach to help write the essay more effectively, especially if it will help you learn to be a more effective writer. To outsource the entire process is a move loaded with missteps. Will the essay match up with your grades in English? Will it be consistent with the other parts of your application? The college application process should help you find a school where you can thrive and achieve your goals. Name recognition of the school you attend doesn\u2019t help at all if you end up having to transfer somewhere else after the first year because it wasn\u2019t the right fit. ",

In general, essays turned in for college classes do require a title unless the professor gives specific instructions that it\u2019s okay to omit it.
