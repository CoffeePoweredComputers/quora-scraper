            "answer_text": "This is just hearsay, but I have been told by someone that the Montessori method is best approach to teaching a specific type of student ( he says the Montessori method it was designed for people who traditionally do not do well in school, ie) mentally challenged. According to the person I reference, these people later turned into geniuses) from: Math Learning mathematical concepts in a Montessori classroom begins concretely and progresses towards the abstract. They are developed from simple to complex. Process is taught first and facts come later. Order, coordination, concentration, and independence are experienced by the child using these materials. The math activities are organized into five groups. Group one introduces sets of one through ten which prepares the child for counting and teaches the value of quantity. Children begin to associate numeral and quantity with number rods and number cards. A child will gain a growing understanding of sequence. Spindle boxes, cards and counters, the short bead stair, and other 1- 10 additional counting activities a teacher may add, reinforce the one through ten numeral concept. Group two involves the decimal system using the golden bead material. The child will become familiar with the names of the decimal categories; units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. A concrete experience with each category is represented by beads. Quantity will be followed by symbol and association. Group three deals with the operations using the golden bead material. The concept and process of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are presented. Children work with each other and benefit from these exercises using the bank game. Progression then continues using operations with the stamp game. Group four consists of linear counting. Quantity is presented using the teen and ten boards followed by symbol and association. The one-hundred board and bead chains develop number concepts and recognition of numbers one through one-hundred. The bead chains also introduce the child to skip counting; five, ten, fifteen, twenty, etc. Group five contains activities such as strip boards, snake game, and memorization of facts. Fractions are also a part of this group. Fraction skittles and insets serve this purpose. The activities in the Math area are not to be implemented at a set pace. Providing the child with the materials at precisely the right challenge level will enable the child to demonstrate his development to the teacher through his progress. A child that is able to grasp such math concepts as addition and subtraction demonstrates the successful use of the math materials. The materials are so beautifully designed and appropriate for each child during his sensitive periods of learning math. Mathematical apparatus provides the necessary stimulation for the child to learn math concepts more readily. ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend the following ways to teach math to your kids of age 6-14 Beginning with the basics, encourage your child to write and recognize the numbers 0-100, and the words for numbers from one to twenty. It would help if you accompanied them in writing, supporting them if they make any mistakes at that moment rather than correcting at last.Teach them concepts of addition and subtraction in a way they can grasp, for example, using the objects they use. Play toys are best for this purpose, keeping them engaged with an interest to know.Move to multiplication and division only once they master these concepts. Teach them how money works, starting with coins, let them understand the value of money. Let them know how a rupee note is divided into coins and how multiple notes can increase its value.Moving into the next level of concepts, you need to let your child use apps and e-learning sites which have a wide range of topics explained in simple and exciting ways by professional teachers. With video and audio recordings, these sites can provide classroom experience for them.For more details. You can also check 98thpercentile website. They offer Live, Online, K-12 Math, English (Reading & Writing), Coding programs that are geared to get your child a GRADE AHEAD in just 5 months, GUARANTEED. ",
