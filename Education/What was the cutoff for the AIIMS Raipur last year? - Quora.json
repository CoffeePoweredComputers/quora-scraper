            "answer_text": "Cutoffs of new aiims are not reliable as they are growing older. Last year AIIMS counselling did see drop in allotment rank which is even expected this year too. Talking of figures in 2017 only AIIMS Delhi went on to lower cutoff from previous years 34 to 52. Just because there was increment in mbbs seats from 72 to 107 and 2 of top 50 rankers ditched AIIMS Delhi for BHU internal PG seats. For AIIMS Raipur 2017 cutoff was 1536,2514,13741,13609 in decreasing order of category. But this year it is expected to be about 1200\u20131300 (cos hum bhi hai katar me) Its a premiere institute and will be counted on top in a few years. ",
