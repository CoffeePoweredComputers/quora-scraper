            "answer_text": "Almost all developed countries, including the US, have implemented some elements of socialism. The term \u201csocialism\u201d refers to societies where the government regulates or owns many of the functions (such as businesses and news media) and implements many programs that benefit society as a whole. In the US, for example, there is government regulation of many things: air traffic, many kinds of businesses, securities trading and investing, many aspects of the practice of medicine, use of certain controlled drugs, and on and on. There are also attempts to regulate womens\u2019 reproductive health, which is a decidedly socialistic practice. Social security is a socialist practice as, indeed, are the uniform traffic laws and signage rules for the interstate highway system. You might view the various degrees of socialism as being on a spectrum. At one extreme are societies like Russia and China and many smaller socialist countries where the government owns many of the factories and businesses and either owns or tightly controls the news media. Such foms of socialism have never been very successful economically because that degree of control tends to stifle innovation and limit citizens\u2019 knowledge of the truth. Less extreme are societies like the Scandanavian countries (Sweden, Norway, etc.) where there is universal, government supplied health care and a lot of regulation of businesses but no government ownership of businesses and no control of news media. These countries have been very successful. Great Britian is a bit less socialistic but also has universal health care. Canada is similar. The US has somewhat less in the way of socialistic programs and characteristic but is a lot more socialistic than what most conservatives and libertarians would like to see. In other words, if you are right-leaning in your politicial ideology, many countries seem to be too socialistic for your taste. But quite a fiew moderately socialistic countries have been successful. I don\u2019t know of a successful libertarian country in modern times. The term \u201csocialistic\u201d is often used as a perjorative, but there are too many kinds of socialism for it to be a legitimate basis for criticism. It\u2019s more of a political name calling term designed to paint one\u2019s opponents as being more extreme than they really are. ",

            "answer_text": "None, since there have been no genuine socialist states; here is why: There are in fact two basic forms of socialism: 1) 'Socialism from above', and 2) 'Socialism from below'. [Marxist socialism and communism parted company in the former USSR in the mid-1920s after Lenin died and the Stalinists took over.] The first form seeks to bring \u2018socialism\u2019 to the mass of the population, whether they want it or not. It is imposed from above, as its name suggests. This approach has been adopted by various political movements, including Stalinism, Maoism, Castroism, Chavezism (as we have seen recently in Venezuela) \u2014 in other words, all forms of communism since the mid-, to late-1920s \u2014, Social Democracy [SD], and conspiratorial Blanquism (see link below). Often, however, the population acquiesce to this form of socialism, and they might even welcome it at first, until they find it doesn't work. This brand of socialism leaves the mass of the population passive and unchanged (except where they are allowed, in some cases, to vote every now and then, or they are required to provide cannon fodder in defence of this new form of the state), and hence, as such, they remain a threat to the new ruling class that has been formed as a result (as indeed we saw in Russia, E Europe, China, and Cuba).  Blanquism - Wikipedia  That is because 'Socialism from above' either (i) leaves the class structure of society unchanged (as is the case with SD), or (ii) it introduces a new ruling elite (as was the case with Communism) -- but, in both cases, the mass of the population remains exploited and/or oppressed for their pains. [Many confuse this statist form of socialism \u2014 whereby the state owns the means of production (factories, mines, transport systems, services, etc.) \u2014 with Marxism. However, they will struggle to find anything in Marx\u2019s writings that supports such a gross distortion of his ideas.]  Every time this form of socialism has been tried it has failed, or is now failing, and that because (iii) in the case of SD, the rich and powerful will always fight it, try to strangle it to death, or manoeuvre/force it to compromise what few principles it espouses, so that it gradually becomes a pale reflection of those parties that genuinely and openly represent the interests of the ruling 1% \u2014 that is, until they resemble to some extent Conservative and Right-wing parties \u2014 as we have repeatedly seen in the USA, UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, S America, etc., etc. So, SD doesn't change society in any fundamental way, and leaves class division (and hence the rich and powerful) in place. [This is one of the reasons for the rise of populism in the US, the UK and across Europe, of late, as the mass of the population becomes disillusioned with the various forms of SD on offer.] (iv) On the other hand, Communist regimes leave the capitalist world largely intact, isolating themselves from the international division of labour, which in the long run renders their economies inefficient and totally incapable of competing with the rest of the world. In which case, they are doomed to fail. As Engels, Lenin and Trotsky argued, socialism can't be created in a sea of capitalism, and any attempt to do so will always fail.  The second form of socialism, 'Socialism from below', represents Marx, Lenin and Trotsky\u2019s view. It involves the great mass of the population creating a socialist society for themselves, not waiting for anyone, or any party, to do it for them. In such a society the means of production is collectively owned, not by the state, but by the workers themselves.  This variety of socialism has to spread, taking over the core economies of capitalism so that it can't be strangled in the above manner \u2014 as the proletariat of each country rebel. We aren't talking about invasion here; an invasion by an external socialist country won't change the working class of the country invaded in the required manner -- they have to change themselves in their own way, by their own revolution. Each strike, for example, is a mini-rehearsal for this (whether those taking part realise this or not), where workers have to organise in their own communities and share money, clothing, food, shelter, etc. In effect they have to run a mini-socialist society for a few weeks. This is a basic fact SD, Stalin, Mao, Castro and all the rest who advocate socialism from above, have failed to grasp, so determined were/are they to impose \u2018socialism\u2019 on other countries, or, indeed, on their own people. As noted earlier, because the mass of the population has to refashion society in their own interests and by their own efforts, they transform themselves as a result, learning to run society by and for themselves, thus ending class division, and hence the class war. If they succeed, humanity can advance; if they don't, humanity faces barbarism. This form of socialism hasn't yet been tried anywhere, and no one knows if it will work. But, there are good reasons to suppose it will.
