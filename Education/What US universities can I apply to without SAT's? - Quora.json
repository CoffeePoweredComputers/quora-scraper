            "answer_text": "I am not sure which grade you\u2019re in but over the past year, 100s of universities in the US, these include Ivy league universities and Tier 2 universities, all decided to become SAT optional for students who will be starting university in September 2021. This was mainly because test centres around the world were closed and most of the SAT tests post March 2020 were cancelled. I think this was really nice of universities to be flexible and gracious to students, however, the other components of the application are given greater importance. So for instance predicted grades, extra-curricular activities, letters of recommendation, college essay, all hold greater importance now and are looked at in a very thorough fashion. What my suggestion to you would be to do the SAT if you get a chance. What these universities have become are \u2018test optional\u2019 schools. The keyword here in \u2018optional\u2019. That means if you have a score, it is recommended that you submit it. Besides, you never know when they will stop being test optional. So no matter what grade you\u2019re in, please do try and prepare for the SAT so that you will have a score during the time of your college applications. This shows that despite the pandemic, you were able to prepare and do the test in order to submit it to the university of time! ",

            "answer_text": "There are some US universities that don't require SAT scores for international students. However, it's recommended to take SATs to improve your chances of getting in. Also, if you're applying for a scholarship they will almost always require SAT scores. When I applied to the US, they ask for me to take SATs. Only TOEFL or IELTS. But to apply for their scholarship, I had to take SATs. If you're applying for graduate schools, you will need GREs rather than SATs. I was planning on applying for University of Arizona or Arizona State University. One or the other. For US students, they asked for general GREs and recommended subject GREs. For international students they didn't ask for GRE scores but recommended that you at least take the general GREs. ",
