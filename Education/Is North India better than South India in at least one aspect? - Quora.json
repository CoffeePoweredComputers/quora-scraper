            "answer_text": "without being biased and rude, let me post a honest opinion from my experience. I have lived in UP, Maharastra, Rajasthan, Bangalore, Kerala, Pune, chennai and Delhi. It would be difficult to say North or South as some places in North are great and some in South are good. In North, Places like Pune, and Rajasthan are great. little bit show off for people in Pune as they like to flaunt what they have got. But in general very broad minded younger generation (not old Ones). But if you compare both sexes they would be open minded and give good opinions and generally make good friends. Most important - No One really bothers you or comment about you. Even Girls feel more comfortable in Mini skirts in Pune. Most North indian people I know are also open to marrying from different societies as well. Negative Part of North - Lack of development in infrastructure, Over population and difficulty in Jobs. Coming to South, Bangalore is awesome. It is very cosmopolitan and open. The kannidigas i have known dont really mind of anything. Only problems is bangalore is expensive. Chennai - Very religious. To make friends in chennai you need to know tamil else even working there is going to be difficult. Kerala - This by far is the worst place in India. I have worked here for 5 years. People are not really friendly. whether men or women, it is really difficult to make friends even if you learn and speak the language. In terms of food, it would be difficult for non keralities to get used to the food. The 5 years i had spend in kerala was like living in an isolated prison with greenery. For women, harassment happens yet no one complains. Kerala is good for a short visit, but to stay there for long, you will die of boredom as you would not have any social life. Society is class based. For example if you are affluent or having some exceptional skills that keeps you in demand then people will be behind you. If you are an average person, with a normal job, then even getting a smile would be difficult. In general people only care about themselves. People in kerala put fake english accents and try to pretend to be American. Not sure why they are not proud of Malayalam. While working here, i can notice that the English is so fake. Dont know why people do this. In North, people are proud to speak Hindi. On the plus side it has got beautiful greenery and Ayurveda Hospitals are good. To sum it up. North has more positives except for the safety which you can experience in Bangalore ",

            "answer_text": "The people living in NI will find it better , while those in SI will find it better. Some aspects which can be considered better in NI are (my personal opinion) - Food - That's a personal choice but I have few friends from chennai who also find Delhi food better than Chennai.Wedding - Although SIians will say that it is too much show off ,but NIians weddings are truly amazing with so much life in itPay of a doctor - Being a doctor ,I will never want to settle in SI ,they pay terribly to doctors specially Chennai. Pay in NI is around 2\u20133 times that in Chennai.Quality of medical education - Now that's controversial ,but many of my friends doing higher speciality medical education from NI are doing wonderful things while in Chennai ,the opportunities /infrastructure of a medical college specially in higher studies is very substandard.Night Life - There is nil night life in Chennai. Almost whole of Chennai sleeps by 10 pm it seems. While in many NI cities ,you can see even restaurants running 24x7.Friendly behaviour - I found people NI too be very friendly while SI to be very professional.Climate - I personally prefer the good winter season not the hot and humid climate.Cleanliness - Now ,that is debatable and many will say otherwise but I found Chennai very dirty with always overflowing dustbin placed at 1 side of the road with its contents covering half of the road sometimesand dead rats and sometimes dogs in the side of the road.Now ,some general things - Many NI cities can be compared to SI cities in many aspects like high literacy rate ,high standard of living ,high QOL like Delhi ,Shimla ,Dehradun ,Jaipur ,Indore ,etc.Indore is the cleanest city in India.Higher number of Army recruits from NI.4 small dhams in Uttarakhand.Per capital income is more in most of the NI states with top being Delhi.Income inequalities in more in SI states with kerala on top.The purpose of this answer is not to bash SI states ,rather to put some opinion of mine. SI states are also much better than NI states in many aspects. ",
