            "answer_text": "There are many reasons for this, but in my opinion it is mostly due to ignorance among the general population of the purposes and mission of community college. Historically CCs evolved from Junior Colleges in the days when they were only offering instruction and degrees which served students who intended to transfer and complete a four year degree. As the baby boomers began to reach college age and college going rates began to explode across our nation, the need arose for both Junior and Senior colleges to expand course offerings, degrees and classroom space. Colleges grew at an unprecedented rate. Junior colleges became Community Colleges with greatly expanded scope offering the traditional transfer curriculum, but more importantly many one and two year certificate programs and degrees. They also began offering adult and community education non-credit courses in just about anything one can imagine, even classes \u201con demand.\u201d Over the years, local employers began to understand the great educational resource represented by CCs. Many students began attending t simply take a course or two or three to enhance job prospects or self improvement. Today CCs serve all of these purposes and more. Some even offer four year degrees! To judge CCs in their graduation rates is to greatly misunderstand that the majority of attendees never intended to graduate. In addition there are no good means to calculate and track graduates given the stop in and stop out enrollment patterns for mostly part-time students who are also typically working. It would also be a miscalculation to state that CC students enroll because they have nowhere else to go. Many, many very bright high school grads choose CC for financial and other reasons. While it is true almost anyone can attend CC, it is not true that CC is a place for students to quickly develop core academic skills and move on into college level coursework and thrive. ",

            "answer_text": "It goes back decades. Young people were doing badly on standardized tests, and parents were asking why? Not to mention parents were concerned that their child might end up working as a janitor. So they had this \u2026 parent / teacher get together, to explain how junior colleges - or community colleges could fill the gap. Parents, in my day were delighted that it would be a second chance for their child. My parents were \u2026 concerned that it was a sticker on my folder - saying \u2026 failure in high school. hahaha However, community colleges became a big back door for those who don\u2019t test well and were determined to go to a state school. The deal is, that if you pass a community college with a 2.7 - you can just transfer to a major state run university. State schools and community colleges are much less expensive then any for profit school. Anyway, it was back when I was a young person - 40 years ago - that this stigma was attached to community colleges that they were a place for those who did badly in high school. They are just a second chance and provide for those issues from teacher failure in high school. Yes, stressed high school teachers can fail to do an efficient job of teaching their students. As a university professor, I would have students call me - all hours of the morning to discuss an assignment or a problem. Heck - they still contact me - in grad school. ",
