            "answer_text": "Now that you are NOT studying, #SitBackAndRelax and see if the following helps. Mozart met Kalidas over a dart game in a juice bar. The bartender was eagerly watching them giving trash talk to each other. Kalidas said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it is to be known as Shakespeare of the east even when you were born hundreds years before him.\u201d Mozart hits the dart board and says, \u201cOh really! I wish life was this simple. You don\u2019t know what it is to watch people getting crazy over your compositions after your death when while you were alive, nobody gave a heck to you.\u201d \u201cOk, you win,\u201d says Kalidas hitting the final dart in the center. Bartender exclaimed, \u201cKalidas wins.\u201d My friend, that\u2019s NOT called a win-win situation. The game was dart, not trash talk. Here is a strategy. If you fail this, there is no go. The strategy won\u2019t fail for sure. Transform the lifestyle. To start with, fix the sleeping, waking, eating, and leisure time according to nature. Night calls for sleeping without mobile phone in the vicinity.Add meditation and eat less oily, less spicy food. Make your study area conducive. It will aid to correcting your procrastination. (See a photograph of my room. The centerpiece is the knowledge I want and surrounding is the leisure. It also has a plant, you know, just to look environmentalist.)Study. As Khurshed Batliwala said, \u201cCome to reality or else you will fail.\u201d Failure is good only in one condition: When you have given your 100%. I tell you, after everything that you do (including food and SEX) ask yourself, \u201ccould I do it better?\u201d If the answer comes as YES, man you failed yourself and guilt will not let you sleep. you\u2019ll become an irritating popper who blames everyone and everything. Failure after 100% frees you from guilt and helps you bounce back with valor. Let me conclude here my mentioning what my centerpiece means. It says, \u201c\u0938 \u0924\u0941 \u0926\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0918\u0915\u093e\u0932 \u0928\u0948\u0930\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0947\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094b \u0926\u0943\u0922\u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f\u0903 Sa tu deerghkaal nairantarya satkaarsevito dridhbhoomih It means: Anything of value to culture and firmly establish requires constant practice, for a long time, without gaps, and with honor & respect. This is your scale. Measure your every action on these four parameters. Under no circumstances you will fail. And if you do, you didn\u2019t give your 100%. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "First I would like to give you a tip ,that will help you,and then tell why you aren't studying .But please read the whole thing to benefit from it. *TIP* Follow \u201cThe 5:5 Rule\u201d , that rule means that if what you are doing isn't going to benefit you in next 5 years you shouldn't spend more than 5mins on that thing! ..so if you are playing games or binge watching webseries rather than studying ask yourself will playing and binge watching webseries benefit me in the next 5 years? If no is the answer .. Studying is what you are supposed to do ,also study to increase your knowledge and not merely your marks. *Why you aren't studying when you need to?* The act you are doing is called Procrastination ,which means you delay what you need to do. Procrastination isn't completely bad , see there are 2 types of procrastination :- 1)Active Procrastination :- Active procrastination means you choose to delay working on a task because you like to work under pressure and that lets you perform better. So if you are an Active procrastinatior it might have benefits. 2) Passive Procrastination :- Passive procrastinators are often crippled by indecision and an inability to self-regulate \u2013 that gets in the way of completing a task. For traditional (passive) procrastinators, failing to begin work is further loaded by anxiety which causes additional stress and inaction. Passive Procrastination is No No! I myself am a Active procrastinator when it comes to college assignments supposedly if I have a test in 2 days and assignment to submit in 3 days,I actively procrastinate on assignments because I know I am most creative in the last few hours of deadline, but I don't delay the the test because it's more important than the assignment.
