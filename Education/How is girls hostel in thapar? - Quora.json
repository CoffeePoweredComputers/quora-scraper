            "answer_text": "I have lived in each GIRLS hostel during my 4 years of B.Tech.(Hostel-G,Hostel-E,Hostel-PG,Hostel-I) The facilties provided by the hostel are very good which include good food,TV room,gym in every hostel,friendly staff,sports room and ofcourse well mantained rooms. Although there is no provision of cooler or AC in the rooms bt now when i think of it,it is for the benifit of the students.Now we can any survive in any environment we are subjected to.  So yes all in all Thapar hostels are good to consider.  ",
