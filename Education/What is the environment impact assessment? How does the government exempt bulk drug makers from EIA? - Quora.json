            "answer_text": "Businesses whose activities may harm the environment are required to submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) either to the Environmental Protection Agency or the appropriate Department (or perhaps both). The Department of Interior probably receives the most Environmental Impact Statements because it covers public lands and rivers, lakes, etc. I do not know if or why \u201cbulk drug makers\u201d would be exempted from the EIS requirement but would speculate that Congress granted some of them an exemption or waiver in the law because it found that their activities did not normally harm the environment. Again, I would also speculate that there are industries or companies that receive exemptions because their products or services are deemed critical or vital to national security. ",
