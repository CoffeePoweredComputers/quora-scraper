            "answer_text": "This varies quite dramatically between Grand Lodges. Case in point being the American Weekend Mason's, or McMasons as referred to outside of the USA. The members of the Grand Lodges outside the USA frown on this practice and it has been a point of debate for a long while. It deviates from the traditional, by doing all the degrees in a weekend; from being a Candidate in the morning, all the way to Master Masons in the afternoon. The break for lunch in between really does not count for much in the way of furthering your Masonic education. In the rest of the world - a phrase I use in the broadest sense - the picture looks quite different, so let me start with the application for membership. Should someone be interested in Masonry, it is their duty to make contact, in order to ask to join. As part of this process you will first be invited to visit the Lodge, and meet the brethren. A formal interview may follow. Then you may formally petition for membership, for this you would be required to fill in an official application form in triplicate. Once the paperwork is done, your application will be read in open Lodge. This allows the other brethren to make due enquiry as to your character, and qualification. If all goes well, the date for initiation is set to that of the next convenient meeting and communicated in the agenda. As there might also be a host of candidates in the queue in front of you, patience is key. This might take anything from 2 weeks to 6 months. At that meeting you will be balloted for, and should it prove clear, you will be initiated and join our age old brotherhood. Congrats on becoming a Mason! Now to get you to Fellowcraft. This can take anything from 2 months to 1 year. This is not taking weekend Masonry into account. There are things required of candidates that normally fastrack this a bit, but that's outside the scope of the question. The same applies for the the progression to being raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. This can also take anything from 2 months to 1 year. Again, as a closing thought: be weary of those that do it faster, as there is nothing as horrible as a Master Mason that knows nothing. It is like standing around with a bunch of engineer friends and knowing full well, that one never went to study. You don't look down on him, you simply discard anything he says regarding engineering. Same with Masonry. I don't take anyone seriously that went from non-mason, to his 32\u2032 Scottish in less than a year in the Americanized style, unless he has been around for quite a while. In the AAR it takes 7 years between 30\u2032 and 31\u2032, never mind the 32\u2032. Thus, the same applies in blue lodges, and conference of degrees should always be based on merit and ability as noted in the 1st degree ceremony. Not in the hopes of luring in more Mason's with the promise of rapid progression through the degrees. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. The answer is anything between one day and several years. There are some jurisdictions out there that will confer all three degrees in one day effectively making the candidate a full Master Mason in one day. This is terrible and even if your jurisdiction offers it you should decline and take the long path, it is much more rewarding to you and the lodge you join. Most lodges will try to get all three degrees done within twelve months. So depending on how far ahead of the beginning of your class you applied that would be twelve to the twenty three months (if you happened to apply the month after a class had started and have to wait eleven more months for the next one to start) from application to Master Mason. And some bodies like Prince Hall and TO lodges may keep you at each degree for a year before moving you to the next one so it can take three years or more to complete the degrees. So unfortunately I can\u2019t give you a real answer except to ask the lodge you choose to petition how long they take to confer the degrees. In any case if you do choose to join the craft understand he journey through the degrees is part of being a Mason, not an obstacle to becoming a Mason. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "As mentioned, it is all about timing, and how quick you want to do it. I am a Master Mason in Tennessee. The longest time IMO, is the petition process to the first degree. I turned in my petition in September 2015, was initiated in the first degree on November 13, 2015, passed to the second degree on January 29, 2016, and raised to the sublime degree on April 1, 2016. It is really about how long you want to take. In Tennessee, as well as many other states, it is a requirement of 28 days between each degree. Some countries, it may take years to become a Master Mason, but in the U.S., Freemasonry has seen a steep decline in membership since the 1950s, but it is starting to see a comeback. I am not a fan of it, at all, but there are some states that you can obtain all 3 degrees in the same day. Bottom line, if you live in the states, and want to become a Master Mason in 6 months you can, or you can take longer if you need to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the Lodge you petition. Contact your Local lodge, visit it, get to know the members, and - if you like it - join the Lodge. If you don\u2019t like the Lodge, or don\u2019t feel comfortable with the members, go to another Lodge and repeat the process. Keep doing this until you\u2019re surrounded by people you\u2019d like to be associated with. Every Lodge has it\u2019s own personality and flavor. In my opinion, you should be the determining factor in how long it takes you to go through the three degrees. You should find the right Lodge, petition it, and then go through the degrees at your own pace - not the pace others want to determine for you; Freemasonry is a journey that begins with a single step, and lasts a lifetime. Savor each step, and move forward when you\u2019re ready. You are the only one on the path you choose. ",

A lifelong journey can scarcely be prepared and undertaken without proper preparation, reflection and improvement which time alone allows. Many Brethren are lost to the Order because of hasty progression without sufficient mentorship and stimulation. I encourage visitation to our and our sister constitutions because we are most fortunate to have opportunity to visit with English, Irish, Scottish and Netherlandic lodges and those that fall under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of South Africa, all of whom meet in the same locations on different days on a monthly basis. Adequate mentorship programs and lodges of instruction need to be in place to alleviate misconceptions and boredom and create a stimulating and welcoming environment for members be they new or longstanding in the lodge.

This has been done, but is so rare that really compelling reasons would be present.Normally, in the U.S., this is a determination of the local lodge in question. There are Lessons to be learned, ritual to understand, examinations to be conducted, votes to be taken. How long it takes to go through all the requirements is a factor in the total time, as well as the availability of a Mentor/Instructor, availability of the Hall, time of year, conflicts with planned activities, tradition, etc. The time can vary between one Degree each month for three months, up to one year (or even more) between each Degree.
