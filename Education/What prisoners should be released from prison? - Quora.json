            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat prisoners should be released from prison?\u201d The only way the corona virus is getting into prison is by staff and employees. Those individuals should be all tested and monitored before being allowed access to the facility. As for the prisoners, the prison should all be on a temporary lock down. In maximum security and the SHU this should be enough to prevent contamination. All visits should be suspended. There is no reason why anyone should be being released from prison because of the Corona virus pandemic. All outside personnel should be required to wear protective gear when interacting with prisoners and the prisoner\u2019s food and commissary. Jail\u2019s on the other hand should be fallowing a different protocol. There should be a higher standard for what kinds of charges warrant jail confinement. Unless someone has a charge that suggest that they are a direct threat to the safety and security of society then they should not qualify to be held in jail. That means only those charged with felony violent offences should be held in jail. Other than that major difference, the protocol should be similar to that of the prison protocols I mentioned above.

That should be the US policy at all times. The country would be better off just fining the pants of people who made a lot of money illegally (like they did to me - except I didn\u2019t really make my money illegally). And that\u2019s what a lot of prisoners are. Housing inmates is getting really expensive. And from what I saw (which was a diverse prison population), only a small percentage struck me as truly dangerous. The rest were just wise guys who sold drugs or committed some other crime without hurting anybody individually. ",
