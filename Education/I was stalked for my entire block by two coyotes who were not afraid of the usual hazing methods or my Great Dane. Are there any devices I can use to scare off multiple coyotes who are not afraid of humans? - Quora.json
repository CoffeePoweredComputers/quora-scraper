If you are out in \u201cDeplorables Country\u201d\u2026?? Check your State regulations. Here in Texas, Coyotes that are harassing humans or livestock may be hunted at any time, with any method, no limits, no license needed outside of the permission of the landowner. One long weekend, get some \u201cMust Sell Today!\u201d chicken at the grocery, put it in a 5 gallon bucket with a tight lid and drill a bunch of holes in it. Wire it to a fence post up off the ground to avoid attracting ants\u2026 Then spend a few mornings or evenings behind some hay bales with your coffee and a scoped .22 rifle\u2026  Dispose of the carcasses in a quiet pasture\u2026 Let the buzzards and ants clean up.
