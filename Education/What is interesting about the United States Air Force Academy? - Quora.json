            "answer_text": "During the time I was there was in the early 60\u2019s, most all of the building and everything else was new and looked realy sharp with mountains in the back ground. The air was fresh and clean all of the time and you was is a short driving distrance to do just about what ever you liked. I was only there for 3 weeks and wore a fight suit all of the timeso no one realy know my rank unless they were right in front of me, sure wish I could of been station there for a longer tour, it was just a outstanding place to be and I believe to live. After getting out of the service, my job took me to the Academy area quite a few time and into area that most people would never be aloud to see let along get close to without being question. ",
