            "answer_text": "I will answer this question in three ways: At its most obvious level, most subjects or disciplines have evolved from other disciplines, and build on theories and applications from other fields. For example, I teach very quantitative courses in Business Research and Analytical Methods. Students collect data on a business or some other topic of interest, and we do data analysis, one-sample and independent sample t-tests, Chi-Square tests, factor analysis, correlation and regression analyses, etc. So, I take the time to explain some of the underlying theories and methods that business and marketing have borrowed from fields such as psychology, sociology, economics, calculus, etc. In fact, I have one session on understanding confidence intervals and their use in political polls in which my closing slide jokes that in that one class session they have covered the gamut of a Liberal Arts education, because I have talked a little bit about political science, calculus, French, poetry, geometry, critical thinking, business, and marketing!Occasionally, we can benefit from bringing concepts from fields or disciplines that you normally would not consider as being related. For example, the title of my Ph.D. dissertation is A Control System Approach to Consumer Behavior. I used concepts and models of electrical engineering to build and test a theory that could use them to understand human behavior. I believe that this unique approach gave my dissertation a huge boost.Finally, different fields and disciplines use different \u201cways of knowing\u201d \u2014 ways in which we understand them. All of us in one field can gain so much from understanding how other fields think and build their theories.",

Each disciplinary genre of study enriches and enhances each other toward your acquiring your understood meaningful knowledge awareness. Reading, writing, speaking and listening are the leaning methods you use in cognitive order for you to acquire interdisciplinary (ecumenical encompassing) knowledge awareness as qualities of cognitive comprehension and understanding toward cognitive ability for you to think logically reasonable about Existence. Math, science, literature, language, history, geography, psychology, all disciplinary fields of study, lend enhanced, enriched acquisition of knowledge toward an ecumenical, all-encompassing knowledge awareness.
