            "answer_text": "I'm a native speaker of American Sign Language (ASL). My two sons are also Deaf and native speakers of ASL. Deaf children can be read to in ASL, and we learn to connect letters & words with ASL. Unlike hearing people, Deaf people learn best visually. That means we learn letters and words by visual memory and associating it with its corresponding ASL sign and/or image. Adjectives/intangible words are also taught the same way, albeit without using a corresponding image. It's picked up by context. Learning to read isn't difficult. The key to learning to read is to use American Sign Language (ASL) to teach the Deaf child letters, words, and concepts. Doing this ensures that the Deaf child will receive full visual access to language and reading and writing. If you try to use phonetics or any other sound-based teaching approach, it will slow things down and/or make learning extremely difficult. I do not recommend these approaches at all. I attended schools for the deaf in Maryland & DC, and learned ASL as a toddler. The teachers in my schools all were fluent in ASL and they used ASL to teach me and other Deaf students written English and reading English.  It wasn't labeled as such back then, but their approach was very similar to \"teaching English as a second language\" and/or \"bilingual method.\" Historically, hearing educators have stubbornly tried using phonetics/sounds to teach Deaf children to read/write, with uneven results, which is why bilingualism is so important in educating Deaf children. ASL is the key to full visual communication and educational access for Deaf children. My children are also learning to read and write under similar methodologies and it really does work. They attend a bilingual-bicultural school for the deaf. They are now 8 and 5 1/2. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few different ways that deaf children learn to read and write in English.  English as a Second LanguageChildren who are raised with American Sign Language (ASL) as their only language will begin learning English, basically as a second language, when they begin a hearing school.  Signed EnglishSome families and schools use signs in English grammar order, so the children are learning English from the beginning.  Here, the only difference from hearing children's English education is that hearing kids code in sound and symbols while deaf kids code in signs and symbols.Bilingual Environment  (Home)Some children may have one parent who signs more ASL, and another that signs more English.  Bilingual Environment (School)Most Schools for the Deaf teach both ASL and English.OrallyMany deaf children are raised orally with the use of extensive speech therapy, cochlear implants, hearing aids, lip-reading, etc, and will pick up English in large part from that exposure to others' English speech.Generally, one would have some hodge-podge of the above.

            "answer_text": "I think it's useful to keep in mind that a deaf child being taught to read and write might not have any knowledge of the language being taught. This would be like trying to learn to read a language without any idea about its meaning or grammar (I did this in Hebrew school as a child, by the way). Let's imagine a girl born deaf in the USA, whose parents use American Sign Language which becomes her native language. ASL is not a form of English rendered with gestures rather than sounds; it is in fact a completely different language with very different grammar. (Though it has borrowed some calqued expressions and other features from English.) Thus when this child encounters written English for the first time, she may also be encountering the English language in general for the first time. This would certainly lead to slower progress in reading comprehension, just as would be expected from an English-speaking 5-year-old plunked into a Spanish-speaking kindergarten class. There may be other difficulties commonly encountered by deaf children learning to read and write, beyond a lack of familiarity with the language; I don't have any knowledge about this but am interested to hear from others on this topic. While many languages' writing systems offer hearing users a nearly one-to-one mapping of phonemes to symbols (Spanish for example), other writing systems don't really represent words based on their sounds at all (logographic Chinese characters). Children can learn to read all these languages, so an inability to map between written symbols and sounds must not be a insurmountable barrier to learning to read and write. ",

            "answer_text": "My youngest child is not completely deaf, but is sufficiently deaf that it was only a couple of years ago she got a diagnosis, hearing aids and support to the level she needed, so she is language delayed and having to work to catch up. She\u2019s now at the reading level where her siblings were at a year or two younger, but beginning to accelerate. One quirk of her reading is that she doesn\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d phonics and blending. She is aware that certain letters make certain sounds, but hasn\u2019t made the connection that she can sound out the letters of a word to find out what it says. Instead, she has been learning words visually - memorising what it looks like and attaching the sound to that. One consequence of that is that she has ended up completely memorising several of her picture books, to the point where she can recite them without needing to open them. Interestingly, now she is getting to the point where she has a critical mass of vocabulary, she has just started breaking novel words into chunks that the recognises and sounding them out. She also gets very excited by films with subtitles that have words she knows. She loved Wes Anderson\u2019s Isle of Dogs anyway (billed as \u201cthe film with dogs and a friend looking for nother dog with Spots\u201d), but I think the subtitling of the Japanese dialogue of the human characters added some real excitement to her viewing experience. The other two can\u2019t stand subtitles. Basically, she is learning later than her hearing siblings and doing it more visually, but the differences are quite subtle. ",

If a child is deaf, there is no \"loss\", as you can't lose what you never had. So the human \"machine\" adapts and compensates by utilizing other means. Let me illustrate: Everybody has experienced in one way or another how \"handicapped\" one gets the moment the use of one or more fingers is restricted, or how clumsy one gets with band aids on the fingers.Now, take your right hand and place it -palm to palm- to somebodies left hand. Do you see the difference in the hands? How can you explain that the other person can use their hand in a non-clumsy way if it is so different from yours? Because their brain and nervous system has adapted to the given situation. Without a \"loss\" or a \"change\". It just is. To answer the second part of the question - how to teach language and reading. The same way, just without sound. How do you teach a child what a house is? Or what reading these letters mean? It's an association. It does not require to have the sound included. It is the same \"learning\" and the same \"teaching\" without the \"method\" sound. ",
