            "answer_text": "The entire organic chemistry and the chapters related to periodic table are crucial for class 12th and you need to prepare them thoroughly. A person with strong basics of organic chemistry in class 11th will have no problem in at least 4 chapters of class 12th chemistry. If you have good knowledge of periodic table related chapters of class 11th then you will easily understand two chapters in class 12th chemistry related to periodic table. Class 11th organic chemistry = haloalkanes and haloarenes + alcohols + aldehydes + amines in class 12th Class 11th periodic table related chapters = pblock elements+ d and f block elements of class 12th ",
