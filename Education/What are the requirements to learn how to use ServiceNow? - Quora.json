            "answer_text": "There aren\u2019t any hard and fast requirements, but there are a few things that will help you learn to use ServiceNow more quickly. You should understand the basics of relational database design and how tables within such databases can be related to each other. It also helps to understand the standard data types (e.g. strings, integer, boolean) used in databases.A working knowledge of Javascript is definitely helpful. Most of the scripts in ServiceNow use Javascript. A grounding in object-oriented programming is useful as well. Learning Angular JS is a good idea as well, since Angular underpins the Service Portal.You should know something about standard scripting languages that are used to render web pages (XML/HTML, CSS/SCSS).There are several other technologies that are helpful, but the items above should get you well on your way.
