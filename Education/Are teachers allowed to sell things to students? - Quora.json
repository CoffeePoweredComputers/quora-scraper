            "answer_text": "Well, I think it depends on the context. I would not and should not sell from my classroom or promote my business from my classroom. Now, would I mention that I work somewhere as a side gig? Well, probably only if I don\u2019t mind if they show up. It\u2019s ok if I accidentally end up delivering them a pizza or Chinese. If I\u2019m working the concession stand or a bookstore(are they still around? I worked at one in high school), yes I\u2019m totally ok with selling to them. If they contact me because they heard I sell Mary Kay or my bumper sticker for some other mlm tipped them off- I would sell but cautiously. My point is, I think it\u2019s unethical to market or do a hard sell on your kids(students). There\u2019s a certain amount of trust that you build that is already fragile because of what people think or emote upon teachers. One bad transaction could not only destroy that but also make you look like you\u2019re using a position of power to profit. I tutored a whole lot several years ago but I would not tutor my own students unless I did it for free. I did do the pro bono thing a few times because the kids needed a little extra push and I didn\u2019t want money to be a part of the equation. When I tutor students outside my sphere of students there is a charge and honestly I do my research to get the max going rate. ",

            "answer_text": "What you are allowed to do, and what is ethical are two different things. I have written a number of educational texts, and I made an agreement with my publisher that I will be given free copies for all my students because I don\u2019t believe in selling something I\u2019ve written to my students. I don\u2019t use my own name on my books, and most of the time, the students had no idea I had written the book. I prefer it that way. However, I know plenty of teachers who write books and use the same books in their class, and they sleep just fine at night. I think you need to look at the reasoning behind what you are doing. If you are selling something to make learning more convenient for the students, awesome. If you are selling something you believe in, fine. If you are selling something so you can make more money \u2026 not so much. ",

If it\u2019s to round off the change so it\u2019s easer then yes from 3cents to 5cents or to dollar and not charge the 3 cents. Otherwise no. Teachers are not to make business or personal gain during school hours. They have a job and that is to teach! ",

Parents might buy from trusted \u201cMr. Bob\u2019s Teacher\u201d when he came by after school. The conflict of interest in that became obvious and new rules in most school boards forbade the practice. ",
