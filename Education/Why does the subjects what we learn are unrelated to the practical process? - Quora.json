This question of yours has been bugging me since I have entered clg that I can understand that in schools not much can be done but in clg where you have n we ourself have taken a particular branch in order to do some practical stuffs so that we can actually do something in industry after graduation but no that not possible . A single student can\u2019t make a change come true unless each and every student of the country demands a reassessment of the whole education system so as that as far as we have been producing useless engineers that can come to an end. Thank you for asking a question which made me share my feelings with someone my own kind. ",

            "answer_text": "I am assuming you are asking about the technical subjects that we learn in college. The course subjects are meant to just make us familiar with the technology and to build strong foundation of basic concepts. So that even if the technology and its application evolves, a clear understanding of fundamentals will mean you can easily adapt to the changes. I won\u2019t say the subjects are completely unrelated to the practical processes. Most of the the teachers just don\u2019t teach about the correlation between theory and application. ",
