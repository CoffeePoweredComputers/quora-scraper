            "answer_text": "Do you think this is an unfair grade? You did not mention what grade you are in. First, I suggest you review the grading policy for your grade level. It might be a written policy you can find on line. Or, your teacher might have given you the grading policy for that class (at the beginning of the school year). Second, review all your grades: tests, class work, homework, class participation and behavior. If you find that these do not add up to an \u201cF\u201d, then I suggest you request a PRIVATE meeting with your teacher to discuss your concerns. If you are still not satisfied, have your parents get involved. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There must be a reason because tests and exams are designed to correspond with material taught in class and assignments handed in. All that stuff is traceable. For example, if an assignment was handed in, marked, and returned, there is a two-part record; it is recorded in a book and computer. If nothing is handed in, the result is a zero. On any test, the teacher cannot give a worthwhile answer zero because you are always late or talk too much. The mark must correspond to work submitted. Marks represent facts. Teachers keep notes as well on assignments not received. So think about this. There are reasons why work is not completed. One is a dislike for the teacher. Another is that the class moves too fast. Another is that the program you are in is at the wrong level for you. Another reason may be that you are feeling low or depressed and don't have the energy to do the work. Your nutrition level might not be good. Perhaps you don't get enough sleep. Conflict at home and at school makes some students reluctant to do their work too. So, please take some time to figure out what's happening at school for you and get some help. ",
