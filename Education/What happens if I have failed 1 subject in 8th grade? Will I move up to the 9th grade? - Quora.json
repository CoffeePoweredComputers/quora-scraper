            "answer_text": "That is something that will be pretty well established in your school system, so do your research. The bigger question is why are you failing a subject in 8th grade? I taught 8th grade in the New York City public schools and in two different small town school districts. I find it extremely unlikely that you are failing an 8th grade class and cannot get the help and support that you need to pass. Accepting a failing grade in 8th grade should not be an option\u2026 I do not get the sense from our posting that you fall into the category of students who really cannot pass. I have had just one of those, her parents would not accept the help that she needed, but we still got her through. I see her around sometimes and she is getting by, doing the jobs she can do. (The jobs she can do are one reason that I never shop online if I can help it, and I never use self-checkout lanes.) ",

            "answer_text": "Can't really answer this question with certainty as I don\u2019t know the requirements of your school in terms of promotion from ons grads to another. It depends on how important is subject that you failed, in the scheme of things, and whether at your school, you need to pass all subjects to enable you to move to the next grade. My guess is that at Grade school, there is no such requirements. Still, it is important for you to find out why you have failed and how you can make sure you wouldn't fail it again. Do some revisions and seek for some help too to improve on the subject. You would not want to fail any subjects at all. All the best in your studies! ",
