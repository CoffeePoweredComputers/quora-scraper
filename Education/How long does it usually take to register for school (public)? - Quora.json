            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re the only one in line, it should be a quick, pretty much painless process. You\u2019ll need proof of residency, your shots record, information about your previous school. Check your school district\u2019s website to see if there are any more requirements. Go to the school fully prepared. Someone will look over your paperwork. Then you\u2019ll make an appointment to see a counselor and pick your classes. You might be able to see a counselor right then, depending on how busy the counseling department is. If you are registering within the first two weeks of a new school year, expect the process to take a lot longer. There will be many students and parents who\u2019ve waited until school actually starts to get registered. The counseling staff will be overworked and cranky. Make it your goal to be the nicest person they deal with that day. Trust me, it will pay off later. Now it may take several days to get in to see a counselor, time you\u2019re getting behind in your classes. That\u2019s frustrating, I know. The moral of the story is: don\u2019t wait until school starts to register! ",

            "answer_text": "At most for me it was two days. The first day was fifteen minutes updating emergency and contact information. Online, Next there was the selection and registration for extracurricular activities, choosing and giving donations for various school projects and classrooms, etc. Parents can pre signup for the entire year of events. Day two, parents attend the school walkthrough where they deliver residency proof documents and pick up information about the assigned teacher and class. 15 minutes, tops. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not a lengthy process, as long as you have the documentation that is required. Our kiddos have to provide everything at certain points- starting pre-k, starting kindergarten, starting 6th grade and starting 9th grade. Those registrations require the most documentation and take the longest time. Many of our parents are registering online and then bringing in their sign in information to our registrar to complete the process, which saves even more time. ",

Forty-five minutes to an hour seems about right for a secondary school. It\u2019s a good idea to arrange for an early appointment as some classes do tend to fill up, quickly. ",
