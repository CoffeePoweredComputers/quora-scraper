Are you finally satisfied, placated, consoled, mollified? Are you experiencing closure on an issue that had been causing angst? Are you feeling happy and satisfied that justice had been done or a wrong redressed? Are you feeling relaxed after having found a solution? Literally: kaleja means liver and Thandak means chill/coolness So literally it is like asking : Are you feeling that your liver is now cool? Hope this helps. GV ",
