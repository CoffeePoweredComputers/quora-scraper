            "answer_text": "Quick Answer - In Mutual Funds through SIPs! Education is a major expense as school and college fees are skyrocketing. Gone are the days when you could manage your child\u2019s school and college fees with your monthly income. You need to be well prepared in advance to be able to pay for them. There are a number of child education plans that you can choose from, which not only helps you build up a corpus, but is also insured. Kid\u2019s education is an expense that needs to be planned well in advance. Setup a kid\u2019s education goal so that you can maximise the opportunity to make your money do your work for you. Start investing early to enjoy the benefits of compounding. I have built the following scenario for you, with the pre build goal of Kid\u2019s Education on Upwardly platform. Age : 30Gender : MaleMarital Status : Married + KidsAnnual Income : 15,00,000Spouse Employment : Not workingKid Age : 1 yearHere, I assumed that you are unaware of how much would it cost for an under graduation program (Engineering) in India. We have multiple other options with respect to education - under graduation (3 yr, 4yr or 5yr), post graduation, MBA - all in either India or Foreign countries. Following is a Balanced portfolio recommended for your child\u2019s education with a monthly investment of Rs 8,700.  Investment plan suiting the above criteria is as follows:  You can also find a comparison of your investment as opposed to the same amount deposited in FD. I recommend you take a look at various options available on the site, as the above example is made on assumptions and you would be better able to answer the questions yourself and choose the right education plan for your child. Hope this answers your question. Happy Investing! ",
