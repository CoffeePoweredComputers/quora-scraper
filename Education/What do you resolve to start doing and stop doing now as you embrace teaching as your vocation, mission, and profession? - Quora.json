They marginalize things of themselves to some extent and become the person they are to play on stage. Once they become this \u2018person\u2019 its easy to remember their lines and the director cues because of who they temporarily are. The same goes for teaching. One forgets for a while the person who wants to socialize and have fun with peers, and remembers that imparting knowledge is now what is important. Once one\u2019s mindset is fixed to succeed in educating others, you are the person embracing oneself as a teacher! Good luck to you and to those students you will teach.
