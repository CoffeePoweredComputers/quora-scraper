            "answer_text": "Definitely. All the CS programs have introductory courses in freshman year. You will be introduced to different programming languages, how to solve computational problems, algorithmic thinking, etc. If there is one co-requisite that I would suggest you to acquire along if you do not have enough experience in, is Mathematics. You would need Mathematics along with programming skills to solve computational problems and do real-world modeling. ",
