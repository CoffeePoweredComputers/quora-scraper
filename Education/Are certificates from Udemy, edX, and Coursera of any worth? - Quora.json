            "answer_text": "I have two perspectives to offer here: Perspective #1: Coursera is the reason I got my first job in tech. After college, my first career was in music performance and sound design. While I studied some computer science and psychology, music was my passion. However, at a certain point I realized that the business models in the music industry were completely broken, and reaching success as a performer is basically like winning the lottery\u2014even some of the most talented musicians alive are just scraping by. When I needed to make a career shift, I took a Coursera course in Social Network Analysis (taught by Lada Adamic at the University of Michigan). I attended a conference on Social Network Analysis and ended up in conversation with John Kelly\u2014the CEO of a social data startup (now called Graphika). He suggested we grab coffee, and a few weeks later I was hired. My liberal arts education at Sarah Lawrence College contributed greatly to my skills for the job\u2014a hybrid role that had me in sales, data analysis, and ultimately led me into product management. But it was my fluency with network analysis that really sealed the deal\u2014a skillset that I acquired entirely from taking that Coursera class. I\u2019ve now built a successful career in tech and lead a team at a major nonprofit. Which leads me to\u2026 Perspective #2: As a hiring manager, Coursera credentials wouldn\u2019t sway me. I will speak pretty candidly on this point. I don\u2019t give much weight to the credentials or certifications that someone puts on their resume outside of their formal education and work experience. Real-world industry experience is one of the most valuable things to me in bringing someone onto my team. There\u2019s just a different kind of problem-solving that you develop when working on real challenges with the most up-to-date technologies. They don\u2019t really teach that in online courses. Experience with multiple different frameworks is always best. Overspecialization basically only makes sense if you want to be a Salesforce developer (even then\u2014heaven help you whenever Salesforce finally collapses under its own weight). Second to industry experience, a candidate\u2019s formal education gives me a lot of information about them. Did they end up pursuing work in the degree they got? If not, does that degree inform their thinking in ways that might help them in their role? Taking a Coursera course: It depends on the person. Maybe you\u2019re like me and totally obsessed over the idea of interconnecting webs of human interaction. Maybe you were watching TV while you did the course. Maybe you binged it, got a certification, then promptly forgot everything. It gives me some information about who that person is, but I can\u2019t necessarily trust that they\u2019ve become an expert in that field unless it was a multi-year process of acquiring those credentials (like a job or time spent at an accredited university). tl;dr: You should take online courses in order to learn something new and/or gain a skill, not to add a line to your resume.

            "answer_text": "The worth of these certificates is a judgment call and will depend on the type of employer or the position you are applying for. All certificates from edX, Udemy and Coursera have their own potential and can be well worth it when used in the right context.  The Udemy \u2018certificate of completion\u2019 has the least amount of worth with less academic merit as anyone can be a course instructor.[1] Despite this, most online certificates can at least be used to show your activeness in a specific subject or field and to complement your CV. What are the best certificates for employment potential? If you want to have the best possible impact on your potential employer, you are most likely better off with either Coursera or edX. They provide some of the most highly accredited online courses that are available, from top university degrees to specialization certificates. Coursera is the largest with the most courses, student learners and partnering universities. So naturally it\u2019s a good place to start.[2] Coursera tip #1 You can \u2018use the method from this Coursera blog post\u2019 for free trial enrollment to the premium courses designed to master specific career skills. Although certificates are never free on Coursera, in my experience they are some of the lowest in cost and the best in worth for employers.  edX tip #1 Also edX provides an impressive collection of accredited courses, and some consider them more selective of partnering universities. You can see \u2018their promotion page\u2019 for discounts on certificates.  Most regular courses are provided free, with certificates as paid extra. They also have many high-end online degrees for the best career impact. Should you add your online certificates your CV? There are more reasons to showcase your online courses than not, older employers may tend to dismiss their worth but this is changing.[3] It can help you to stand out and invites conversation in a job interview.You can emphasis relevant skills of what you can actually do for the company, and guide the interview to the right direction.It can exhibit good character, demonstrating that you have a strong willingness to learn and mature intellectually. Are online graduate degrees worth it? Pursuing a graduate education is a profound decision and a big commitment in both time and cost. According to Georgetown University, graduate degree earnings average $80,000 a year, that\u2019s 30% more than a bachelor of arts degree.[4] Graduates pay $24,812 for their degree on average, while online learning platforms such as Coursera and edX are charging a fraction of that cost. This is proving out to be a game-changer for many students for whom online certification is well worth the lower cost. Online courses also provide more freedom with flexible schedules.  Which ever certificate or online course platform you choose to go with, Coursera, edX or Udemy, it is likely worth it. How much, is up to you. Happy studies and best of job opportunities!

            "answer_text": "Actually yes they are. I recently completed Strategic Management and Innovation from Coursera and I can tell you it does open many possibilities. For a country that doesn't require attested certificates/degrees, it amplifies the possibility of getting your desired employment opportunity. But keep in mind that having a certificate is one thing, proving that you have actually benefited from the course is also a necessity. I have had countless of interviews and my certificates are discussions I usually bring up to show that I have experience and completed courses in those specific fields. However (yes there is a but in this answer), you cannot use some certifications as a replacement due to the fact that its not credited for use with universities, unless they agree. But this doesn't mean its a complete waste. Here in the UAE for example, you require attested documents for specific VISA's in most regions. An attested document is a verified document from the issuing country to prove its legitimacy according to the current county you are employed at. This usually affects salaries, travel requirements and professions in my case. Some UAE governments have even partnered up with Coursera making courses compulsory for certain professions and designations. And from interviewing numerous job seekers in the past, those that present certificates from these brands are usually showing initiative that they are eager to learn on their own time. If you do have certificates from these institutes, make sure you actually know what you studied as many employers ask you how this could benefit your performance in their company. I have been asked and asked these questions multiple times, due to the main fact that there are people who rush through the courses and expect this will help them achieve a larger salary or higher position. If you have studied multiple certifications in a specific field, such as Management, over a course of a year or more, there is a possibility in some countries that this can be seen as a higher educational qualification, equivalent to a 1 year college diploma.

            "answer_text": "I. What are the \u201cCourses and Certificates\u201d.  The \u201cCourses\u201d are available online, when talking in terms of the various types of the websites, and on the completion of the courses, the \u201cCertificates\u201d are provided as the form of the token, or the entity, which ensures, that, the particular user has successfully completed the given set of \u201cCourse\u201d respectively. II. Are certificates from the \u201cUdemy, edX, and Coursera of any worth. Yes, definitely. In fact, every piece of content out there has some worth attached to it. Nothing in the universe comes and becomes freely available. There has to be some price, everything comes with the price. The time is passing, the clock is ticking, the age is increasing, day by day, so, even, if the user thinks, whether what is it's worth, so, remember, the user is already paying it's price, directly or indirectly, and, so, the content out there has its own worth. Now, practically speaking, from the job point of view, so, definitely, each and every course has its worth, because, the person who have made that course, has put their heart and soul in creating the content, and if, it is so, so, definitely, it is of importance. Always remember, one rule in life, \u201cThe more you learn , the more you earn\u201d. And it is quite true fact. The whole concept behind it is that, suppose talking in terms of the \u201cSoftware Industry\u201d, so what one normal person who is in that particular field needs. They need a good job with high paying salary, working in the corporate world. Am I right? Yes, of-course! Now, what is the role of the courses available on the internet. \u201cThe main aim of the courses available on the internet is to provide the user with the proper knowledge and guidance and skillset, in order to make them, suitable for the particular type of the job, or to provide and learn new and new things\u201dSo, their main purpose is to create job oriented people, who are able to work in their field of the interest. And now, it does not matter, on the larger scale, that which courses are to be done, either free or paid, because practically speaking, \u201cThe final goal of going through the online course is to learn something new and, in most, cases, to gain the knowledge, which required to crack the interview, in general\u201d respectively. There would be certain courses which could be in high demand, due to their great content as well. But, in general terms, any type of the knowledge, that is gained through the courses, it can be either any course, either paid course, or even the free course, is important, and it is the key factor in deciding, whether the \u201cCandidate is able to crack the interview or not\u201d respectively. So, at last, but not the least, do remember, these things in the life, that, \u201cKnowledge is Power\u201d, and hence, always, the person must be willing to learn and gain, new knowledge, and hence, gain experience, so that, they could improve themselves more and more, in terms of the life respectively. Until, than, STAY ACTIVE, POSITIVE, AND MOTIVATED. Thanks For Reading \u270d\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the question is not so easy. Let\u2019s dig a bit deeper into it. Different providers. Udemy - market which offers HUGE amount of courses of different topics. From \u201csewing\u201d to building an AI. Hard to say are all of them worth. The reason is, those courses provided by anyone who wants to teach. You, my dear reader, may create a course there as well. Now, let\u2019s think about how many of those courses created by professionals (and no - I do not mean people who just has some degree, but those who really understand the topic which they\u2019re going to teach). I have some strange feeling that it won\u2019t be 100% of the whole amount of courses. IF the course was created by a professional, could creator make a mistake? It might be the case. But regardless there are really good courses over there (I know it - I saw it). Answering the question - well for the money you pay (not to much for registered users) you will get benefit in case if the course is good. + Shows desire for self-development, knowledge - No worth for employer, \u201cnot verifiable\u201d ( \u201cwell it is and it even has a number\u201d(crowd shouting) - yes, but I guess employer won\u2019t be interesting in verification from \u201cBin&Gin co\u201d for \u201cAny programming language rubbish to super-hacker-mega-coder, ready for action guy 35 hours on demand video\u201d certificate). edX - provider who has verifiable certificates from different institutions and organizations. Also has a big variety of topics but not so big as in previous provider, due to not any mortal can create a course in there. From one point of view - it is good. In my opinion you can trust it more (BUT always double-check!!!). In addition you don\u2019t have to buy the course straight away. You can try it for free first and then decide to pay or not. Why its like that - well, because here you pay to get a \u201cpaper\u201d. You are free to get the knowledge for free, but if you want a verified certificate from some institution (check the list on the site), you\u2019ll have to pay, which is, I think, fair enough. + Verified certs, pay only to get them - Less courses To underline everything what was told. I am a user of both Udemy and edX (didn\u2019t use Coursera, so won\u2019t give any info on it). Both platforms has their advantages and disadvantages (ok \u201cless courses\u201d on edX is not so bad, but maybe you\u2019ll find some - yourself). In relation of the knowledge - both platforms may offer good content. In relation of the certification\u2026 well I would say edX is better to choose (from the value for employer point of view). But choose your destiny and try it yourself. Have a nice day ;) ",

But I actually found a clich\u00e9 throughout the internet, and I'd like to summarize it; mixing it with my own point of view :D Certificates prove that you're a life-long learner.Certificates show that you have the guts and the determination to start a project yourself triggered by your own motivation.Obviously, these certificates will enrich your CV (let's suppose they didn't, they wouldn't do any harm anyway).Since the courses are verified and offered by prestigious universities, they have already gained an academic value.Finally, wherever there's money, there's value (I guess nobody puts that this way :p).Either way monsieur, I recommend you to go for it, cause it's a good time investment. And don't worry about the 50$ -just consider you spared them by being stingy on a date, or you bought a simple polo shirt instead of a fancy Armani one (just imagining) :D ",

            "answer_text": "If I am reading a CV which mentions MOOC certificates for complementary / secondary skills, I would get the impression that the person takes an active interest in their personal development. This is a very positive sign. The certification isn't the key part here; I am interested that they are undertaking independent learning in new skills, and so just saying \u201cI have completed online courses in xyz\u2026\u201d would be just as good. I guess certificates would score a couple of bonus points as it shows a level of commitment and investment, though it wouldn't factor significantly in my decision. However, certificates in a core skill could make me question their experience. Say, for example, they claim to have X years experience in Python, and list a recent certificate for an online Python course. I would question why they took that training, as these courses generally cover the very basic fundamentals. I would also question whether they have any real world experience. This is not necessarily an instant cause to reject them, but it is a potential red flag. So, in summary: Online training in subjects which complement your core competencies are good.Paid certificates are not worth much; more important is a demonstration of continuing personal development.Certificates in a core skill required of the role don't count for anything.",

            "answer_text": "Believe it or not, the global e-learning market is growing significantly. Surveys predict that it is expected to reach $238 billion by 2024, with a growth rate of 8.5%. Not only individuals, but the corporate sector is also embracing e-learning. This proves that e-learning has a great scope in the future and training providers like Udemy, EdX, and Coursera would continue to be popular among learners. Now coming to the certifications from these organizations, any course certificate is valuable only when you are able to prove the skills you gained from them. Udemy, for instance, has loads of courses regarding every subject. But, many are not worth taking and you need to research thoroughly to get the most relevant course. If money isn\u2019t a concern, you can go for EdX, Coursera, or Simplilearn. Many renowned universities collaborate with them and you get the benefit of learning from highly experienced trainers. Now if you are expecting to get a job by highlighting these certifications, make sure that you have some experience in the related field. For freshers, it may be difficult to crack any job interview based on these certifications. But if you already have the experience, these certifications are really worthy in helping you stand out of the crowd and paving your way for your dream job. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are just paying for the certificate I would say definitely not worth the price. Prospective employers and anyone else will believe you when you say you have done the course and you can show a screenshot of the congratulations page when you finish the course if you need proof. I do think that in some cases paying for the certificate is worth it and that is because it also unlocks more features in the course. Some skills are hard to learn. When you pay for a certificate you also get access to more of the exams and you will have your assignments graded. This feedback is often invaluable to see if you are making progress or just following the videos. Another good way to decide if you want to invest the money is to think of how much your time is worth. Think of the money as an investment against your time, it will help you stay motivated through the harder parts of the learning curve. If the course is 48 hours over 12 weeks then $75 might be a good ideaIf you just want a quickie to gain a quick skill then take the free optionHopefully, that helps we have a break down of online certificates if you are interested. One of the great things about learning online is that it is low commitment buying one certificate is not the same as taking a degree you can change your mind and start again pretty easily. If you aren\u2019t sure about the certificate start with the free option then upgrade if you love the course or want some more feedback. Good luck with whichever route you choose! ",

I did not get a degree (so far), I just worked a lot in several jobs until I got fired. I do not have any money for Uni and it is not always easy to learn on the job. So I discovered Udemy and I am learning a lot! Thing is it is a bit of researching to be done, buying and try the courses out. Most of them are not worth a penny but some of them are amazing and some good. The great thing is that people on it, at least the one with good courses, give you what they learned and used throughout their experience, it is like sitting down with a colleague and learn. I\u2019m grateful to Udemy because learning is affordable. As per EDX, I loved it but also in there, just because courses are from university does not mean they\u2019ll be able to give you what you need. It depends. And as to if they are worth to get you a job..well\u2026I have not found a job yet\u2026already 7 months now\u2026but I keep trying and keep learning..So good luck with your life ;) ",

But the employer, IMO, should see the effort put in. A larger question is whether a traditional college or university degree is worthwhile. I\u2019ve seen some indication (on YouTube) that perhaps not, at least not as much as one would wish. Any kind of training or studies in a particular, marketable field should be worthwhile. Then, there is the situation in the real world where some might look at their managers or supervisors and wonder where they got their management degrees. Of course, they don\u2019t likely have one\u2026and it shows. Following-up: IMO any kind of college/university degree is likely to make one a more \u201cpolished\u201d person, which will usually show. ",

These certificates will only add value if you are willing to put the required time and effort to pursue the knowledge and skills that these certificates showcase. If you just want these certificates to make your C.V look more presentable, then these certificates will backfire on you. For example here are a couple of scenarios. Person A has an exceptional understanding of Machine Learning (let us say), but doesn\u2019t have a certificate to prove it, but he shows his knowledge by calmly answering all the required questions on his interview. Now would he still need a certificate? I guess not. Since person B has a certificate for Machine Learning, this will make the interviewer think that maybe Machine Learning is his strong suit. If he can answer all the questions with ease, then yes, his certificate will help. Otherwise\u2026 bye-bye. So, in short\u2026 \u201cCertificates will only add worth if you know how to defend them. Either they will boost your credentials or they will be your worst nightmare.\u201d  Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re looking for a new job they might have some value as others have pointed out. Most recruiters and HR staff just search for keywords and certificates are those keywords. I mean, you\u2019re paying for keywords in your CV or LinkedIn profile. Following that, they\u2019ll have no value, they can even backfire to you because the next interviews will test your knowledge. For instance, for my current job, I had to pass 2 interviews with HR and then another 2 technical interviews plus a sample project that I had to deliver. The technical interviewers didn\u2019t care at all about my academic degrees. However, I think that paid certificates are useful. It motivates you to study because you have paid for it and the quality of the course it\u2019s usually much higher than for free courses. Furthermore, learning by experience it\u2019s very important but you also need to learn the formalities that you learn from an official/professional course. These formalities include technical vocabulary, uncommon features (e.g. rare Unix commands), or reasoning behind some common practices. You usually don\u2019t learn these \u201con the street\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Edx and Coursera offer MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) i.e., Courses from prestigious universities in the world like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Imperial College London etc. Certificate of a particular course is offered either by Coursera or EDX and is endorsed by respective University. In some cases you can also transfer Credit of a course. On the other hand Udemy also offers certificate after completion of a course. First thing about Udemy is that the courses on the platform are not created by Udemy they are created by third party creators. Anybody can create a course there, including you and me. Now some courses are from experts while other are created by inexperienced people unlike Coursera and Edx. At the end of the course Udemy will provide you certificate anyway regardless of the quality of the course. I would also like to mention one thing here that , I don't say that all the courses on Udemy are below the mark. There are thousands of high-quality courses there. So, in conclusion Edx and Coursera have no comparison with Udemy. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely! Courses from Udemy, edX and Coursera are of great worth. When you mention on your CV or resume that you have completed certain courses from these websites, it goes to show a lot about you as a person- You are a motivated and hardworking person who does not like to sit idle.You have a keen interest in learning and expanding your knowledge.You are a dynamic person who wants to grow and enhance his/her skills in a particular field of interest.You wish to learn more than what is simply given in a textbook.Your potential employer will be immediately impressed by your keenness to learn more and grow. It is a good idea to opt for those courses which will provide you a certificate, even if they are charging some minimal amount for it.

If you want to use a single certificate as a proxy for a university degree, then they'll hardly be worth it since a 4-week marketing course can't rival a 4-year graduate program. BUT if you take several of those, engage in their communities, read their references and so on and so forth, you'll understand things better than many graduates out there and probably will be applying everything soon, meaning your experience will certify your papers instead of the other way around. It happened to me: I'm in my third self-made career and owe it all to edX and Coursera. Today I work in a multinational and many specialists there have lower expertise than I do. (Not saying I'm better than them; their experience probably brought them skills that would make a joke out of me.) ",

As an employer myself, I receive many CVs and resumes with thousands of certificates, but when it comes to a test or challenge, things look a lot different. Notwithstanding I am a lawyer by profession, I learned to program by using many of these new ways of learning, being the certificate the least important thing I cared about. In my case, I was looking to learn a new topic to achieve a greater objective: create a company. My first online course, for example, helped me create an App. If my goal was to look for a job, I would rather show THAT (App) to my future employer rather than a certificate. A paper, digital or not, will never replace the value a course gave you to achieve a greater goal or objective. ",

Before you spam the comments, let me tell you why You can get a Udemy Certificate by just paying the course fee, then click on mark as watched/read with in 15\u201330 min you will get your certificate. thats why it have no worth it. Udemy have tons of good Courses but they don't have standards for certificate distribution, they should atleast take some test. Mostly any Certificate is valuable, which require some work from the student. like Nptel Certificate, Oracle Certificate etc. It may be helpful for you to build up your CV/Resume but In the end Udemy Certificate is useless. I am not pessimist just showing you the truth. Thank you, ( \u2579\u25bd\u2579 ) ",

When I find the section of Certificates, the way I see it is \u201cThings that you have an interest in\u201d. I can\u2019t say you have knowledge of something just because you have a certificate, especially those that you can complete in a matter of week(s). At most, you can say that you scratched the surface and have a superficial knowledge. Learning involves study AND practicing, and the more you do it, the better you get. These courses give you little practice and when they do, you are in a controlled environment, with hints and the problem well defined. That is not the real world. The lack of experience when you have simply studied something is an important matter when hiring someone. I\u2019m not criticizing these courses, in fact, I myself have taken a lot of them and I\u2019m always learning something new (I like Coursera a lot), but I know the limitation they provide for learning. Practice! I didn\u2019t put the courses I\u2019ve taken in my CV, but the ones I did, was for curiosity, personal interest or just to remember some subjects I learned long ago. Here are some of them, in which I concluded: Social PsychologyMoralities of Everyday LifeDeveloping your musicianshipFinancial MarketsAs you can see, subjects of my own interest. ",

Before enrolling to a course please do check the content, rating and the scope of the subject, because many courses are paid so you must be particular to choose your course. For the one who actually needs to improve their skills these courses are worth, & if they are confident on that topic, surely they can add the certificate in their cv.For college students, they can submit these certificates in order to get activity points from their university.There are some people who will get coupon codes to specific paid courses, if they don't utilize it effectively (in the sense that if they skip the lectures) it might gonna be a bad impact for them in future.LinkedIn- you can add the certificates in LinkedIn certifications.For the people who are in search of job interviews, they can have these certificates if the authority agrees.",

A certificate on the CV signals that commitment to life long learning However, being a Udemy Instructor myself on a host of topics like Financial Modeling, Advanced MS Excel, Job Finance and Finance for Non Finance, I find that students are besotted more by the certification than the learning - this is a dangerous trend Knowledge will anyday rule supreme in the job interviews and not these certificates ( we all know that in some cases, it's just a matter of spending a 50$ - they are given to all and sundry and not just say a % of students enrolled - wouldn't a prospective employer be able to see through that ) For instance , even if you havent paid for the certificate , if you can prepare a financial model after undergoing an e-learning course, I would rate you higher than someone who has the certificate but starts fumbling the moment s/he is asked a couple of piercing questions ",

Formal Education \u2018might not\u2019 focus on skills. To fill that gap you need to self educate yourself. One of the easiest and affordable ways you can self educate is by doing courses online. Also, you get a certificate from them as acknowledgment. Formal Education and certificate courses both add to your profile. Cracking the interview is based on your profile (skills), presentation, communication, and persuasion skills. Formal Education alone will not help you as there are so many people with the same Educational background and you will have to stand out from them. Doing additional courses might show that you are a person who is aspiring to learn more, but today all are aware of these websites and everyone attempts to do additional courses. But what is more important is how well can you execute those skills at your workplace. It is not the \u2018certificate\u2019 that you should be focused on, rather on \u2018skills\u2019 and its \u2018execution\u2019. ",

I highly suggest learning Python and SQL because it will open so many doors for you. Many enterprises now whether it be marketing or business really like candidates with a background in SQL.

Let's understand their differences and similarities:- If you are a College student then having certificates from Coursera, Udemy or any other website other than NPTEL won't increase your credits in the semester because these all are non credit courses. While courses on NPTEL will give you credit points for the semester.If you are in school then neither of them going to increase your marks or percentage.If you want to gain knowledge then all these websites are great specifically Coursera.Getting certificates will boost your confidence and the employer's confidence in you.It makes your profile look more presentable and also can add to your LinkedIn.Coursera and NPTEL certificates have one advantage over Udemy and other websites that these are recognised by the universities and if you have to show your certifcation courses, you can use them.Thanks for reading, I hope it helps Do upvote if you found it useful \ud83d\ude42 ",

While not every institution or job prospect would recognize these certificates directly at face value, obtaining these certificates by holistically completing the associated courses is valuable in the long run, as you will obtain the skills necessary for many of the jobs you might apply to. Moreover, you might learn something you have never learned before, improving your work ethic as well as overall experience. ",
