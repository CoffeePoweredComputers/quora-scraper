            "answer_text": "Hi! I would suggest you revise the syllabus on your own but you should start solving previous years\u2019 question papers and sample papers of different competitive examinations. The more questions you'd solve, the more prepared you'd be for board examinations as well as for JEE Main or NEET.  You can get study materials for competitive examinations as well as sample papers for board examinations from different publications at MyPustak, free of cost.
