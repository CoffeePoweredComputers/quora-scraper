            "answer_text": "1.In high school: math. lots of math. Maybe basic physics if your teacher is reasonable. Calculus-based physics if you can. Did I mention math? Lots of it. Maybe learn to program too. It can\u2019t hurt. 2. In college: be a physics major. take the standard set of courses. Your university will basically tell you what that is. Get involved in research with a professor. If you have some electives, take something in physics you are interested in. 3. In graduate school: take the core courses. Get into a group that studies something you are interested in in quantum mechanics. 4. Do a postdoc or two with leaders in your chosen field. Throughout, go to as many seminars as you can. Do not neglect your breadth. A quantum physicist should know more than just quantum mechanics. ",

            "answer_text": "Focus on basic maths and classical physics. You need to love maths by heart. Maths is really important in quantum physics. Solve problems on maths daily. Create your own problems in maths and solve them. In this way, you will become better at maths. Just do not mug up steps to solve a particular problem. Just free your mind and solve with what all you can, without caring for the correct solution. Stay with the problem and understand it. In physics, you need to focus on classical physics. Solve problems. Solve problems and learn maths. If you get good at Classical Physics, it won't be hard for you to understand quantum physics but yes, when you will start with quantum physics, your common sense will bother you a lot. Quantum physics and common sense do not fit exactly with each other. Get ready to face troubles. So, work on maths and physics. Get good with basics. That's enough for high school. ",
