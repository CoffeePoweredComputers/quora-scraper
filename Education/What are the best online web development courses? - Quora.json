            "answer_text": "So first of all you should know that in order to do web development you're going to have to learn HTML, CSS, and some back-end language (most likely a web application framework like Ruby on Rails, Django, or Wordpress). That's because without the back-end, your application might look pretty but it won't actually do anything. I'm kind of controversial in my view that you should learn a web application framework first (and I personally believe that there are good reasons to start with Ruby on Rails 10 Reasons Beginners Should Learn Ruby on Rails). The reason for this is that it's important to start building something immediately in order to stay motivated to keep learning. The other answers here have listed a bunch of great resources. I'll tell you what worked for me: I started with the Ruby on Rails Essential training on Lynda (lynda.com Training | Ruby on Rails 4 Essential Training). It walks you through all the basics of creating your very first application \u2013 basically a simple blogging platform. You can probably finish it in about a week (there is 12 hours of video), and you'll feel a little overwhelmed. That's fine. Keep going and it will make more sense. Once you've finished the Lynda tutorial, I'd highly recommend the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl \u2013 which is available as a 15-hour set of videos for $159 here (Ruby on Rails Tutorial) or as a free ebook here (Ruby on Rails Tutorial). The book is kind of dense, so I wouldn't recommend starting with it, but if you've finished the Lynda tutorial then it's a perfect next step. And a lot of the concepts should come back to you and be easier to remember the second time around. By the time you've finished the Hartl tutorial, you'll basically have built Twitter from scratch, which is pretty cool. From that point on, you've got a solid foundation of Ruby on Rails itself. I'd recommend checking out some Railscasts (Ruby on Rails Screencasts) for tips on building out additional functionality in Rails. Two other options for learning Ruby on Rails are CodeSchool (Learn by Doing - Code School) and Treehouse (Learn Web Design, Web Development, and More). I like Code School but I've never used Treehouse. Then you probably should learn some more basic Ruby and maybe some front-end skills. As far as basic Ruby goes, I'd recommend the following: Codecademy has a great Ruby track (Ruby). RubyMonk also has a set of fun, interactive Ruby tutorials (RubyMonk - Interactive ruby tutorials to learn Ruby). For learning HTML and CSS, I'd recommend General Assembly's Dash (Dash), which is probably my favorite front-end tutorial. Code School and Treehouse also have front-end tutorials but I've never tried them. At that point you should have a really solid foundation of development. Check out those resources and let me know if you have any questions! ",
