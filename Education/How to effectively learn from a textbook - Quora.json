            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t read front to back I know it\u2019s counter-intuitive to not read a book front to back, but don\u2019t do it. Mystery novels stink when you read the back first, as do good thriller movies. If you read the last page of a Sherlock Holmes novel before you read the story, it\u2019ll be lame. If you know Bruce Willis is dead, don\u2019t watch the 6th Sense. Read for Big Ideas Textbooks are extremely thorough. You, while needing thoroughness, are not going to be able to absorb every tiny detail found in a chapter. You have to focus on what\u2019s most important. See our posts on filtering for more info on this.Textbooks are great because they explain those Big Ideas in context, but make sure you don\u2019t get lost in the minutiae. Read for the Big Ideas first and foremost and you\u2019ll be able to sift through the mountain of information available. In textbooks, Big Ideas are easy to spot because they are often in bold print or section headings. Look for the complete sentence thought that summarizes and drives each subdivision and you\u2019ll have identified the Big Ideas. Read for Key Details Big Ideas need support. Otherwise they\u2019re just opinions. After you identify each Big Idea, make note of the supporting details that fill out and help the Big Idea make sense. While this looks different in each subject, they should be relatively easy to pick out. Key people, places, and events often make up the key details in history books. Grammar rules are the important details frequently in grammar books. For languages, vocab are some of the most important key details of the chapter. Check your notes against the questions at the end of the chapter. If they reflect the same key details, you know you are barking up the right tree. Read the book once but your notes multiple times You should never have to read a chapter more than once (in theory). If you\u2019ve done your reading well and taken notes as you read, you have a record of the thoughts being communicated. Granted, it takes a while to adapt to this approach. Don\u2019t be upset if you have a time of adjustment before being able to read a chapter only once. ",

            "answer_text": "In my 6 years at university studying engineering and math, I skipped about 90% of my classes. I learned on my own from my textbooks, just as you ask. And, I achieved above-average marks. It was painful. But no more painful than going to class to have an instructor read my textbook to me. Thanks, but I already know how to read. In the few classes I did go to, I would watch my classmates frantically take notes of everything the instructor had said and written on the board -- the exact same info that is in the textbook that we all paid well over $100 for. This too did not make sense. To add to this madness, engineering is very difficult and there is so much lab work and homework that nearly every student was 2 weeks behind whatever the instructor was teaching in class at the time. With much of engineering building on previous concepts, being behind by 2 weeks meant you didn\u2019t really understand what the instructor was teaching anyway. So, I stopped wasting my time going to class and would just read my textbooks. Some textbooks were better than others in explaining concepts. Much of the learning was in following the examples and problem solving. That was pre-Internet days. Today, you can supplement your learning with all sorts of free online resources to help you understand concepts and practice for tests. In elective courses like psychology, reading the chapter summaries 1 hour before a test was often all that was needed to get a descent mark on standardized multiple-choice tests. Some of my instructors assumed I skipped classes because I was lazy or preoccupied. What they didn\u2019t realize is that I was treating university like a game. Figure out how the system works and the fastest/shortest path to a high score and you are good to go. Some people hate reading stories like this because it goes against their romantic view of higher education. But, I\u2019m willing to bet that my experience is very common. Although, my guess is that most students who skip class don\u2019t do as well because they may not be as disciplined as I was. I still put the work in, I just did it my own way. I suppose this experience also influenced my career choice, as I have been designing and selling training simulations to schools around the world so that they can give students a much more meaningful education than lectures and textbooks and multiple choice tests.

They don\u2019t have the time to recall what they read just before. Two problems arise because of this approach. Reading for the sake of completion is a complete waste of time. You forget most of the information you read without revision.If the chapter is extremely huge, we don\u2019t need to read everything. We can skim through many of the topics which are of no use further in our career. But how to decide which topics can be skimmed if you are reading the chapter for the first time?.If you want to concentrate more on the topic you are trying to read, understand and memorise \u2013 try this. Reverse reading: The step by step process to excel in reading by this technique is given as: After opening a new chapter, read the paragraph titled \u201d completing this chapter, if you will be able to understand-\u201cThis helps to outline the topics covered in the chapterThen directly go to the review questions. I know! You won\u2019t understand anything. But keep on reading anyhow.This helps us to know what are the important questions from this chapter which will be of greater importance in our career.Next, read the salient points at the end of the chapter.This helps to know the important formulae, definitions, and data to be remembered in the chapter.Then write the sub-headings of every topic from the chapter in a page (or online).This helps to keep track of how many topics have we covered. This keeps us motivated to complete further headingsYeah. Now you can start reading the chapter normally.Don\u2019t forget to answer review questions at the end of the chapter again.That\u2019s it!Some of you may doubt that it consumes a huge amount of time. Sorry guys. This technique is for those persons who want to invest half an hour extra without having the need to re- read the chapter again freshly. This is strictly NO for those who want to finish off the chapter quickly with no knowledge of whatever they have read so far. Believe me. Quick reading is not beneficial when you don\u2019t remember anything you have read. All this technique requires is half an hour extra of your time. But the benefits are numerous.

            "answer_text": "Systematically and diligently. You also need a creative approach. Studying from a textbook is not just memorizing the material, it is the creative assimilation of this material. What does it mean? Let's make a slight slip. When at the university you start to study a new discipline, the professor indicates which textbooks you need to do this (a list of textbooks is given). Therefore, you need to look through all the textbooks listed in the list, and choose the one that suits you best for studying. Keep in mind that when different authors write textbooks, they may specialize in different areas of the science. Therefore, each textbook will have a slightly different \"view\" of this science, other interesting facts, etc. Therefore, you should choose a textbook that reveals (or asks) questions that are interesting to you. You should like the style of presentation of the material in the textbook, the logic should be clear. If you carefully read the various textbooks, you can always choose the most suitable one for you. Only then can you begin to study. Learning from a specific textbook shouldn't be just memorizing information. You must understand this material, comprehend it creatively. Writing notes helps a lot in this. Your own personal notes, written with your own hand. When writing notes, you will summarize educational material, write reaction equations with your own hand, deduce mathematical formulas, etc. You will ask yourself questions that would never have arisen with a simple reading. Moreover, some of the questions will not be answered in this textbook. Therefore, from time to time, you will definitely use other textbooks (write down interesting facts, useful information, etc.). It is with this approach that you will creatively assimilate this science. Note that, after a while, you will learn to absorb more information from the textbook than the author originally put there. Incredible, isn't it? But that's a fact. The fact is that when you ask yourself questions, the textbook material will be your \"start\". How far you go will depend only on your interest in the subject, other textbooks, and your creativity. Thus, studying a specific textbook turns into a conversation with the author. Moreover, other authors and great scientists periodically join this conversation. But, the main character is you, your notes, and your questions :). This is quite an exciting experience, and you will not regret the time you spend on it, since your knowledge will be good, with a deep understanding of the material. For example, at the university I have never dealt with problem solving, although at school I did a lot of this... :). At the chemistry department, we constantly wrote various tests for solving problems (inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, physics, mathematics, etc.), there were naturally theoretical questions, but as a rule, teachers began with solving problems in exams :). It was obvious to me that time is better used for studying theoretical material, and tasks are simply using this material. And it always worked! Note that you should also use curriculum (\"programs\") that summarize what you need to know. As a rule, these are small booklets of 30 - 40 pages in small format. It is very convenient to work with them, and you can always see: what should I know? :). While studying the textbook, as well as working on your notes, you should always have such a \"program\" next to you, from which you clearly understand what you should study and what questions will be on the exam (and what you should outline :)). All success and good luck in the study of sciences!    ",

So for me, the easiest way to do well in school, learn from textbooks, etc, has always been to just read the material. I'm a huge nerd, and I actually really enjoy school, so often I just read through all my textbooks for fun, sometimes months ahead of the curriculum. Just by reading, I am usually able to retain 85\u201390% of the information, with homework and class time covering most of the rest. Studying just becomes reading it again to make sure all the info is fresh. It helps that I really enjoy reading and academics, but that's how I've done schoolwork my entire scholastic career, and it's allowed me to make straight A\u2019s or almost straight A\u2019s every single term. Just reading the textbook puts you at a massive advantage over most of your peers. ",

I make my own summary, than a summary of the summary, like a structure of ten words, then I see if, with one magic word, the whole thing will come down like a long scarf. I had a friend who had to change places. She remembered what she read in the bathroom, on the stairs, in the kitchen. So, you can try dancing on it. I am quite sure Einstein remembered everything as mental images. Many people associate what they read with one mental image. It is very effective, but it does not work for me. Some friends of mine composed songs, especially to remember math. My husband read aloud, he needed to hear it. What works best for you?There is large scientific evidence that the brain works best when you learn into three steps: for instance learn one day/rest one day/ repeat on day three. In other words, last minute can do the trick, but you will not remember the stuff for long. Cut every lesson into three steps (learn/stop/repeat).",

            "answer_text": "The best way to retain information is to keep the textbook. You can then look up what you need to know, providing you have some familiarity with the subject. To retain information in your mind will depend on what sort of information you wish to retain, how long you wish to retain it, and the nature of the subject. Some subjects (e.g. biology) tend to have a high visual component. Some (science, engineering) may require skill in using equations. At one extreme you can look at something you wish to memorize just before going into an exam room, and write it down immediately you are allowed to start, even before you have read the paper. (Either on spare paper, or on the answer book and cross it out as rough work.) At the other extreme, you may need to get some fairly deep understanding for a challenging project or exam later in the session. To do this you should think about this thing alone, and explain it to yourself at a basic level, then write this down and look at it frequently afterwards. To simply decide for yourself what your objectives are and then approach these directly will usually help. For example: memorization requires repetition, skill requires practice, understanding requires slow thinking, general comprehension may be managed with skimming. Do not confuse undirected reading with actual study. ",

My favorite authors on this topic are Tony Buzan, Harry Lorayne and Bill Adler, Jr. Textbooks are systematically laid out and easy to pick through for factual information. If you can make a list of everything, and learn several styles of pegged lists, all that is left to do is freely use your imagination. Mnemonic systems take a little practice. But they are worth much more than that little effort they take to learn. I always tell people to use them. Outside of that, I think one must have a genuine love and interest for the topic at hand. Outside of getting a good grade or finishing a class. If the information is important to you, then like a favorite song you will repeat it to yourself at leisure, and the effort and discipline will feel like doing something you love. ",

This will definitely help you at the time of revision and save time as well.Solve the problem questions that are given. Also look for extra practice questions from side books or other supplementary material.I would also advise not to look for more than 2 -3 books for a particular subject at a time, this will only distract you.

Going over the textbook more than once may be very helpful in remembering stuff, but if you want to read it once, then you need to do it well. The way I learnt was by reading a section in the textbook and taking notes on important points, definitions and processes I need to know. I then answered the questions provided to see how well I understood the information. Then I could review what I missed, and move on to the next topic another day. In order to keep what I learnt in my memory I tried not to save revision only for the end, near exam time, but to practice it throughout my study. I answered past exam papers occasionally (leaving out the parts I didn\u2019t know yet and couldn\u2019t answer) to refresh my memory of previous topics, or connected old topics to topics I was learning at the moment. If there are parts you are struggling to understand, you can ask a teacher for help or use the internet - there are lots of resources in the form of websites, videos and other books available to aid in learning. (Make sure you have a good foundation of knowledge for more complex topics, otherwise learning them will be more difficult.) Spend more time on the harder areas. Teach others what you have learned so it sticks in your head. ",

While writing notes, make as many bullet points as possible. Use acronyms and mnemonics. Make your notes as short but concise as possible. What I also like is using is attaching situations to words. So sometimes I would write one word on my notes but I would remember the situation and that helps me retain a lot more details. When you get to your final, you\u2019ll already have detailed synthesized notes and you wont even have to look at the textbook anymore. ",

You can quickly just overview the whole chapter or topic that you're about to read or learn. Then go to the objectives or milestones of the chapter either in the begining or at the end of the chapter (Usually tittled- what we are going to learn in this chapter) Then you'll pick up any topic or title that you want to learn . And the go to youtube and type the exact same title or topic. Find which video has the most amount of views and start watching it. If you like the video lesson then go to the channel and then go to the playlist tab. Then find your topic related playlist and then start watching one by one. Youtube will help you on most of the topics and it's way more easy and fun to learn then reading text book. But if you like reading textbook then find your topic or title and then start reading using pomodoro(25min task and 5 min break) technique. I hope this will help you to get your study done!

Read this first then go to the front of the chapter to look for \u201cobjectives\u201d or any \u201ckey concepts\u201d. If you understand the concepts from reading the chapter summary then quickly scan the bold print throughout the chapter. By now you should be getting a good picture of what the author is trying to say. Write down any BOLD print words you do not understand and look them up in the textbook glossary or a dictionary. If you understand the key concepts and all bold print then begin at the beginning and quickly scan the chapter. If the concepts are especially difficult, write your own questions, based on what you don't understand, then talk them over with a classmate or the instructor. ",

I rehearse myself now and then, while reading what the book tells. If possible, I explain the book to someone, to improve my memory of the stuff, or even better: include it in a text, I have to write anyway. ",

For instance if I were asked who was the thirty first president president of the United States, I would think of 31 flavors (an ice cream company) and sherbert is one of those flavors. So sherbert rhymes with herbert therefore the answer would be Herbert Hoover! ",
