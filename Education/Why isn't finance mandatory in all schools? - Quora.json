            "answer_text": "Greetings, Solid question! S.T.E.M. and English/Language-Arts take up the majority of today\u2019s high schooler\u2019s schedule. History and Civics are disappearing in the present landscape. Finance would have to compete with Foreign Language, Fitness, Art, Band, Choir, Drama, Vocational Education, and Literature for the last class or two in a student\u2019s day. As a class with limited demand, including Finance in a school\u2019s course offerings faces other daunting hurdles. Once proposed, a committee of teachers and administrators takes on the arduous curriculum adoption process. Expensive and time-consuming to conduct, the aforementioned committee is tasked with vetting instructional materials, reviewing textbook options, investigating on-line licenses, and making every effort to promote inclusive representations and avoid cultural biases in the documents students will use. After the Adoption Committee\u2019s work is completed, the district\u2019s School Board is called upon to review the proposal. School Boards often approve a new course, but delay its implementation over financial concerns. A final obstacle to bringing a new class into a curriculum involves attracting a pool of highly-qualified candidates to teach the course. In the case of Finance, it seems that between the crowded existing schedule and the lack of demand among students, a potentially valuable course will remain absent from high schools. Sincerely, AJG.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s because over the years, parents have demanded schools optimize their curriculum in order to game college entrance. Finance isn\u2019t part of that, so they\u2019re not wasting limited resources teaching it. This is also true of home economics, wood shop, auto repair, and driving school. There is also an assumption that anything not taught in school is supposed to be taught at home, but many parents are unable or unwilling to do so. ",
