            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A you two! :) The other answerers have made excellent points, but I will just add on. We prefer to save money or invest it wisely. For example, many people in our generation are considering options other than college because of the massive debt one could end up in. They are taking online classes and some are going straight into work after high school.We are more cautious with our personal lives. For example, we are less likely to engage in binge drinking and become pregnant during our teens.We are more likely to finish high school and volunteer within our communities.Alright, here is where I will probably differ from the other answerers. It is true that our generation is more fiscally conservative, and many states did have high school elections where Trump won. However, it is a bit of an overgeneralization to say that our whole generation leans conservative. The same article that says we are fiscally conservative also says we are \u201cliberal to moderate\u201d on social issues. If anything, I would consider ourselves more libertarian than conservative.Millennials had the loudest liberal voices and the quietest conservative voices, although quite a few did exist. Now flip that for Generation Z. We saw what happened with the presidential election and Doug Jones in Alabama. The election results went against what the media predicted.That is why I suspect why most left-leaning voices tend to be more quiet in our generation. That explains why college campuses, including Berkeley, have had fewer public protests in recent months.We are an accepting and diverse generation\u2014both in ethnicity and thought, which will probably lead to much more collaboration amongst people of different political leanings. This is certainly a thing that I look forward to\u2014take the best from both sides :).I hope that this answers your question! Let me know if you want me to clarify anything! ",

            "answer_text": "I think it has to do with how they were raised. Millennials were mostly raised by Baby Boomers, who taught their kids to have enormous amounts of self esteem and to not listen to anyone who says they can\u2019t follow their dreams. Millennials are very outspoken people with an optimistic view on life. Millennials were a bit older than Gen Z when 9/11 happened, and that made Millennials want to change the world for the better as a team. Team work is a huge part of the Millennial generation, and social media has been a big influence on them. However, that isn\u2019t exactly how Gen Z see\u2019s it, and it is important to understand this difference. Gen Z was raised mostly by Gen X and have a different point of view than Millennials. Gen X made sure to teach their kids to be more realistic about their future, but to still follow their dreams and reach them on their own. Gen Z will be more of an entrepreneur generation, utilizing the internet to make their dreams a reality. Gen Z typically has a bit less of an optimistic view on life after coming of age through 9/11, War on Terror, and the 2008 Recession, but they still are as outgoing and proud like Millennials. The main difference is that Gen Z has grown up in a time of uncertainty, and that has caused them to want to take control of their life on their own. Yes both generations have seen similar things as they grew up, and 9/11 was a defining moment for both generations, but the difference lies in how they were raised. And it is safe to say Baby Boomers did not raise their kids the same way Gen X did. I personally was born in 1996 so am on the line of both Millennial and Gen Z. I was raised by a Baby Boomer and a Gen X, and I can tell there will be some changes coming in the next 4\u20135 years. They will be some good changes though, because Gen Z has a lot to offer to this world. ",
