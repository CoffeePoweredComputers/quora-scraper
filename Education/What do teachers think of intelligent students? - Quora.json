            "answer_text": "They are great and make my job far more interesting. Often I stick to the script in terms of what I teach, however, the stronger the students, the more flexibility I have. If I'm teaching algebra-based kinematics, I teach graphing motion, then motion equations, and then motion in multiple dimensions. This sequence takes about 20 days when I include labs and tests. However, when I have a student (or students) with a strong command of calculus, the time to effectively communicate the material drops to around 3 days. This student can quickly become bored. If I do nothing with them, they might help out their peers, do work for other classes, or start causing trouble. But what a waste! (Well, helping other students is nice.) I actually love having these students because they are bored, and eager for a challenge. I'll give them tricky, ridiculous and fun problems to work on. What's the graph of a ball hitting a wall look like if you zoom into the collision? I don't know! How would I figure it out? Come up with an experiment to help figure out what kind of curve it will be. Or maybe I'll show them a full calculus treatment for a problem. I've had one student construct and program a device that levitates a permanent magnet using a magnetic field sensor, copper coil, power supply and chip that he programmed himself. When the sensor detected the magnet was falling it would increase the current through the coil to pull it up. It's fun to be a mentor, helping students troubleshoot their difficulties with labs. Smarter students get stumped by more interesting problems and talking them through can sometimes lead to me learning something new. I love it. ",
