            "answer_text": "You certainly have a lot of free courses available throughout the Internet these days available on any subject of your choice. In fact, it won\u2019t be wrong to say that YouTube has become a separate academy in itself. But then, free courses aren\u2019t always good. In my personal opinion, when you take up a free online course on the subject you desire to master, you can only get a free certification at the end of it. But when it comes to learning something worth your time there, and even becoming an expert there is a little difficult with free courses. One major problem that I feel with these free or even paid online courses is that they are prerecorded and therefore, you do not get to interact with your trainers and really ask all your doubts that you can come across while learning the subject on your own. There is much nitty-gritty involved while learning a subject of your choice, basically the one that you need to master. Also, it also depends upon what subject you want to choose to make a career in it. There is a very good reason people pursue degrees in subjects they wish to master and make a career in. Having said that, learning a subject like digital marketing, which is a rage these days on the Internet, with tons of free online courses being offered, it is a very practically oriented subject that would not require you to focus only on the theory of the subject. Also, the number of doubts you will have would be higher as compared to other courses and subjects, which are theoretically oriented. If you are seriously interested in learning something and mastering it to be able to make a career in it, you need a professional course on the subject, if not a degree that would help you get an easy entry into the field as well. Therefore, if you want to invest in only online courses, I would highly recommend you opt for the online instructor-led courses on any subject to help you gain the same level of knowledge and interactive sessions along with live projects to work on and 100% placement assistance as well. If you are interested in learning digital marketing, and becoming a master in it, I would highly recommend the best quality course being offered by the Digital Vidya Institute. ",

I mean whatever field you are seeking education you want to have your education accredited. That is sanctioned by an official source. If not your diploma or certificate is worthless and you have wasted your time. It is far better to research a reasonably priced Accredited school/college/university and barrow money and get your education. This way your Diploma is valuable. And it will be a life long asset. You will be able to use your education life long to grow through your career. And make a high enough wage to live and pay your loan off. But before you choose a course of education choose wisely. Make sure there are opportunities Where you want to live, And making the amount of money you need to sustain your lifestyle and pay your educational loan. Blessings on your journey. ",
