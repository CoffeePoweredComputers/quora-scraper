            "answer_text": "Strictly speaking, you don't need any kind of degree if you receive technical training that qualifies you for the position.  For example, the armed forces take high school graduate candidates with suitable aptitude (identified through testing) and train them up to be fine controllers.  Those individuals usually are picked up by the FAA with little difficulty, primarily because military ATC facilities by and large are considered part of the \"National Airspace System\" and their controllers might just as well be controlling airliners as fighters on any given day. Read over User-12024395187557884213's solid, quick-and-dirty synopsis of the current hiring climate.  It's spot-on.  However, if you specifically want to pursue a bachelor's degree that gives you a useful academic background that might give you an edge in the application process, there quite a few colleges around the country offering coursework in air traffic control or air traffic management, including:  Baylor University (TX)Daniel Webster College (NH)Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (FL)University of Alaska, AnchorageUniversity of North Dakota, Grand ForksYou can find a broader list at Web sites like Air Traffic Controller Degree Program Information and Air Traffic Controller Degree Programs and Schools, or by digging around the University Aviation Association's Home2 page.  Also, bear in mind that there are some two-year community colleges out there offering equally solid FAA-approved programs at a lot less cost.  You won't come out with the bachelor's, but you'll have the necessary technical knowledge when you're done. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "When I was interested in becoming an air traffic controller some 45 years ago this occupation had no requirements for college education at all.  It was the middle of the Vietnam war and I was enlisting in the USAF.  I was promised training and a job as an air traffic controller.  That did't happen since I was enlisted in the wrong group of career fields but military recruiter lies are a different subject from this question. While it takes a considerable amount of skill to do a good job as an air traffic controller it doesn't require much deep thought or knowledge such as the stuff taught in colleges.  I think virtually all air traffic controllers learn the skills they need from government training programs they must complete after being hired for this kind of work by the government.  There are some controllers who no longer work for the government but I believe all of them did before leaving government service (either military or civilian) and taking a private industry position to do the same work. Indeed there are many occupations that require a lot of skill but have no need for college education.  The notion that everyone should go to college after completing high school is a new one in American history.  I don't know why this notion has become prevalent but I suspect it has something to do with the degradation of public school education that suggests high school graduates just don't know enough to be gainfully employed in any but the lowest level jobs such as flipping hamburgers in a fast food store.

If you really want to get into the profession straight away, do an apprenticeship. An aviation degree might be what you need to get to build you\u2019re foundation and if you\u2019re under 18 consider joining you\u2019re local Air Cadet Squadron?

In general, studies have shown that there are no specific course topics or levels of education that determine whether a person will make a good ATC. The same goes for being a pilot or not. During my initial training a thousand years ago, the airline and commercial rating pilots failed whereas the private pilot succeeded very well. High school graduates did as well or better than degreed people. Artists did as well as engineers. ",

Or it was a standard test for all people looking to get into Government service, they were probably the same. So many tests, so long ago \u2026 but it was the 70's! And no one ever asked if I had a college degree. I thought that was going to get me extra 'points'. Only way back then to get points was prior military experience. After the test you waited for the letter with your score, hoped it would be enough for the cutoff for that year's Academy classes and go with that. And again, that was in the 1970's. Now there are whole undergraduate degrees built around an ATC major at schools like Embry Riddle and Univ of North Dakota. Much better development of this generation of ATC FPL's that back in my days. ",
