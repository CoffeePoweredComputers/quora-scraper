            "answer_text": "My degree was a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the College of Santa Fe (now the Santa Fe University of Art and Design). It included acting, set and lighting design, costume and makeup, dance, vocal training, philosophy, psychology, sociology and religion. I think it prepared me well.In my opinion - and there are many others - I would advise an aspiring actor to study, at the minimum: acting, some kind of movement, and some kind of vocal training. My reasoning is as follows: Acting - Most people think acting is simply the art of playing pretend. While that is superficially true, it is astonishing how many people can't do it, because they \"play at\" something, rather than playing the scene, itself. The beginner will often think \"How can I 'act' mad?\" or \"How can I 'act' sad?\" Acting classes will, at the least, teach you to focus on the circumstances of the scene rather than playing a state of mind. Before you can be believable to others, you must be believable to yourself.Movement - Depending on the type of performances you do, you may well have to dance. Even if you don't, you will need to move naturally and believably in artificial circumstances. Most stage performances will require you to \"turn out\" (face the audience) and \"find your light\" (find the brightest spot on stage to stand in while you deliver your lines), all while appearing to be perfectly natural. There are often stage combat requirements, as well, whether you are performing Shakespeare or Shepard. You will usually have a fight choreographer for these occasions, but not always.Vocal Training - As with movement, a basic knowledge of how to use your vocal instrument is essential. Of course, you may be asked to sing, but even if you aren't, you will almost always be using your voice in a conscious manner, either to achieve a character effect, or to \"hit the back row\" of the performance space,  or to interact with some type of microphone, etc.There are many, many other subjects one could study that would help an actor. Psychology is a wonderful tool. Religion and mythology both help understand the structure of story. History is something I've used many times. I've even found a basic understanding of physics useful. In short, the more you know, the better you will be at your job. I hope I've helped. ",

            "answer_text": "Becoming an actor doesn't require anything except being able to act and the perseverance to pursue it.That said, you can always help yourself in several ways. Join a theater group to get practice and make sure you actually enjoy acting. Do as many shows as you can. You can also form your own acting/improve group with some friends. Acting classes are an option too. Practice/Memorize Monologues. Watching yourself perform them and recording yourself, finding mistakes or areas that need improvement. Try all styles of acting and monologues. Do intense and serious ones. Do comedies. Do one with complex lines to memorize and then do one where you improve most of it. This will help build your range. One way I have found to get practice that many people may not think of is Tabletop Gaming (Dungeons and Dragons, Etc.). It is a roleplaying game that you can get as into character as you want. If you end up liking it I highly recommend you learn to run some games yourself, because then you don't just play your character, you play the entire world! You have to jump in and out of characters constantly with many different personalities and traits/voices. It also helps with your story telling. I really enjoy watching the behind the scenes footage of films and tv shows I really enjoy. You learn so much from the cast and crew on the process and can pick up some awesome acting tips as well as knowing what to expect from a film set. You can buy the special edition DVDs or look them up online. (The Lord of the Rings behind the scenes is hours upon hours of footage and its amazing my personal favorite.)On a side note, watch a lot of movies/tv shows and do a lot of reading! You can watch people act and learn technique as well as get an idea of what looks good in certain scenes. Have a favorite scene in a movie/show? Why is it your favorite? Find out if its the acting or tone of the scene and learn how the actors did it. Watch your favorite characters and study their process. There are courses you can take that help with acting without being directly related. Language arts can open up your vocabulary and give you cause to read books/stories that inspire your imagination with different characters for acting purposes. Public speaking is very important because it teaches you all the important techniques for getting the most out of your speaking voice. Choir/Band classes can help the singing voice also which is always nice to have for musicals and generally makes your voice more powerful. Also a sport of any kind is great to help keep you in top shape for acting since a lot of roles get cast based on body type. Those are what I do to practice. If you have a passion for it there is no end to the ways to pursue it so don't give up! ",
