I work with Microsoft Inc, as Program Manager; a worldwide renowned company to produce world\u2019s most elaborate desktop and mobile operating systems and cloud computing platforms.. My testimonies and experience in the MBA Institute is a turnaround point in my career pursuit and improvement strategy. The MBA degree in leadership really changed the way and manner I now relate with coworkers and subordinates in my work place. It helped me build an attitude of wanting to serve others as a way of moving to the top in my profession. I remembered the joy and spirit lift I received when I had the congratulatory email on my successful completion and award of the MBA degree in leadership. Furthermore, I lack the exact word to express my achievement after receiving my MBA degree, it was awesome. The progress it added to my work experience is enormous. To mention but a few; my department won the best performing department award for the year in my company and my input was so obvious. My attitude to job performance made me outstanding as I carried out my duties. I even earn a recommendation and appreciation by a third party contractor for fixing up their failed services which was down for over a week before I came into the scene. It was this attitude to serve others that propelled me to the top in the affairs in my profession. Nevertheless, my success story is not complete without due appreciation to the chief operations lead. I really thank the leadership of the MBA Institute for their selfless enough to help others to develop their career objective. Thank you very much for sharing your professional secret with others to help them grow in their chosen profession\u2026 I would have no hesitation to recommend MBA programs from International MBA Institute. They helped me a lot and I am 100% confident that they will help you a lot too. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi all, A nice discussion is going in here indeed. Thank you for all these good comments. I couldn\u2019t leave before I give my 5-cents on this. In simple words: The purpose of an MBA degree is to open up your horizon and increase the odds of having a better career. However, I always recommend to my younger colleagues to focus on knowhow and the value they create for others. Then the rest will come automatically. If you\u2019re curious about my own experience with an MBA degree: I am a midlevel manager in banking industry with a passion in marketing, human resources, finance and leadership especially influential leadership which rely on scientifically proven mechanics of influence. Recently, I was thinking of a way to have a proven and also internationally accredited MBA degree. I even considered the option to stop working for a year or so, and then continue my studies. And yet, International MBA Institute has offered me a very clever to get my MBA degree without paying a fortune and without interrupting my career. They offer very quick and friendly customer service and they put the interests of their student above and beyond anything else. I have been really impressed by their focus to make a smooth education experience for their students worldwide. It\u2019s this level of trust you should feel your education provider before you should make a decision for your MBA degree. International MBA Institute was one of my best investments for my career and the quality of service I received from them was worth for every penny I paid to them. Strongly recommended!.. Good luck! Markus. ",
