            "answer_text": "It depends on your interest in which field you want to pursue your career. There a number of areas in the science field. The courses mentioned in this list are non saturated or less saturated. It means that relatively less number of students opts for these courses. This means that competition in the job market is remarkably less. It also means that the demand and supply gap of qualified professionals is not filled up. As a result, graduates having completed these courses will get good jobs relatively easily. Another trait of this list is that you won\u2019t find already famous and much chosen B Sc courses. For example, I\u2019m not mentioning common B Sc courses like Computer Science, B Sc Nursing etc. Sure, they do have excellent job scope and all, upon pursuing from good colleges. But then everyone is aware of those courses. I\u2019m about to mention less known ones. B Sc Agriculture Related to all stuff agricultural! Aim of this course is to take to agriculture from a scientific point of view, learning more about agriculture systematically, so that productivity can be improved. B Sc Horticulture Horticulture deals with plant cultivation and its related aspects. This course is all about studying this field scientifically, aiming to use science to make the whole process much more productive. B Sc Biotechnology Upon completing this 3 years long B Sc and course and following it up with M Sc on the same subject, one can build a thriving career in Research and development field. Also, landing jobs in MNCs (Multi National Companies) becomes easy with the above mentioned qualification.\\ B Sc Biochemistry This field is related to the study of chemicals and processes, that are directly related to living organisms. Just like the previous entry, this course also promises a good job in the research sector, if a student goes on to successfully complete B Sc and M Sc in the said field. B Sc Microbiology If it is a research job that you are interested in, then this course can be helpful to you. B Sc followed by M Sc will certainly help you bag a research related job. You may also take up a teaching job (that of a Professor) after completing those two courses. B. Sc. (PCM) B. Sc. (Physics) B. Sc. (Chemistry) B. Sc. (Maths) B. Sc. (Zoology) B. Sc. (Statistics) B.
