            "answer_text": "It can be, but doesn't need to be.  It also depends on what you mean by \"harder;\" I'm going to assume you mean \"more complex topics.\" If you finish off high school with integral calculus (I think that's still the upper-level AP class) and then go into a non-STEM major in college, you're probably not going to see anything new. However, if you finish your high school career with a pre-calculus course and take an engineering major in college, it's extremely likely that you'll take at least differential calculus, integral calculus, multi-variate calculus, and differential equations.  If you're going into aerospace engineering, you have quite a bit more.  Computer security also has field theory and the like. And, obviously, a math major mostly takes math classes, digging deeper with every course. ",

            "answer_text": "\"College math\" is a very vague term. I had been teaching a lot of \"college algebra\" classes at several local universities as adjuncts, and those typically are not harder high school (or even easier than some high-caliber high school). It's sad but it's true. A lot of colleges have about 50% incoming freshmen taking remedial math (and writing) classes, which teaches how to solve linear one-variable equation.  On the other hand, if you are talking about \"college math\" as for a math major, such as abstract algebra (group, ring, field, etc), analysis (complex analysis is usually considered easier than real analysis and Lebesgue measure), maybe just calculus (multi-variable calculus, Greens/Stokes theorems), differential equations, algebraic topology, infinite dimensional vector space (Hilbert space)...  yeah, they are much harder.
