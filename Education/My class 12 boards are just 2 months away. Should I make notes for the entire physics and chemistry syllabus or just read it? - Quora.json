            "answer_text": "I would recommend you to make notes of key points, formula and equations. You can write and practice the derivations, work out problems in physics and the organic part of chemistry where you have equations, chemical formula, balancing and stuffs. I used to make booklets for exams having all important formula and stuffs which need to remembered. It is very useful for revision purpose. And for somethings which are difficult to remember, I find some mnemonics and memory aid and write them down in the booklet(very useful to remember). While studying, you can highlight the points in the book with highlighter or a pencil, and side by side make a note of some must remember points or hints. Write and practice the derivations and problems. Once you are done with preparation,you can solve question papers and correct them by yourself(I did this) and learn from the mistakes you do. This will help in improving your speed, help you learn , gives you an idea about your preparation and what you need to do to improve more. All the best! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Basically making notes would consume a lot of time and in the end you will realize that you don\u2019t remember a lot of things you noted down. Also you would stop referring to the textbook, which should not be done. I would suggest that you keep on reading the textbooks again and again untill you reach the stage where you have literally SCANNED all the textbook pages in your mind. Also all the NCERT questions should be thoroughly done (basically on your tips). 100% paper comes from NCERT in case of chemistry, while in case of Physics, except for 2\u20133 questions, the whole paper is from NCERT, So treat NCERT as your bible, and avoid utilize these 2 months very wisely and judiciously. PS- I scored 97 in both Physics and Chemistry. ",
