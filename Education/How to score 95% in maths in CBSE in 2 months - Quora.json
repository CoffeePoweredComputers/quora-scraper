            "answer_text": "Though I did not do the Maths CBSE exams, here's my generic step by step method that I used for the IGCSE Maths exam. I got an A* and an A for my two Maths papers respectively so I guess my method in the context of studying for maths, works. Get a copy of the syllabus to get a clear view of the exact topics and their components that you will be tested on. Make a little mark beside the topics you do not think you are very confident in.Get your textbook again and focus on those topics you are not too sure about. Do about 10-15 beginner/intermediate questions ensuring your foundation is there. Then move on to complete all the hard questions in that topic to ensure you can handle the tougher stuff. You will probably run into difficulties along the way and that is when you seek help from your teacher.Once you have finished the topics you are not confident in and have become comfortable with them, move onto all the other topics you feel neutral and confident in. Do about 5-7 of the beginner/intermediate questions in those topics just to make sure your foundation is still very much intact. Once again, move on to do all the 'hard' questions even if you think they are easy. This will ensure you are comfortable with those topics and can handle the harder questions there too. Do not be complacent and skip topics as that is where you will lose easy marks.Find and print out all the past year exam papers from all the different time zones along with their respective answer keys.Start work on the past year exam papers under timed conditions. Do all the questions that you know how to do. Leave out the questions you do not know how to do. Once the paper is done use the mark scheme to mark yourself and to fill in the questions that you did not know how to do and learn from and understand your mistakes. If unsure, seek the help of a teacher. Never move onto another paper without understanding every single question and every single method used in the previous paper. This part is very important as it gives you an idea of the types of questions the exam board likes to ask and also shows you how the questions have evolved over the years. The answer key shows you the answers and methods the markers like to see and also gives you an idea of how the answers required have evolved over the years. Knowledge of these will give you a big advantage on the day of the exam.Once all the papers are completed, go through each of the papers to review what you have done and to ensure you remember and understand why you have done what you have done for each question. Just make a little mark on the question if you do not understand why you did something and then seek help from a teacher. Only move onto the next question when you fully understand why you have done what you have done for the previous one.Spend the remaining time before the exam; relaxing and having a good time. Do no work at all. No more maths. No more school material. Behave like you are on holiday. Go out with friends, exercise, start a business, get a job, do whatever makes you happy. Most importantly, get tonnes of sleep as there is no better preparation for a Maths exam than to be well rested and have a clear, quick mind. This part is absolutely fine to do and actually good because you have spent the past time working hard and understanding everything, therefore if you were truly diligent about it, everything should make sense to you and there is no point going over stuff you have already completed hence, you are prepared for the exam.On the day of the exam, remain calm but focused and alert. Understand and have the confidence that you have put in the hard work and that the results you aimed for will follow as a result of that. After you finish the paper, check your answers thoroughly. There is nothing worse than coming to terms with the reality of careless mistakes undoing what you have spent the past time practicing.Try to enjoy the journey! Make sure you exercise and have a good time in between as well. I struggle with this immensely too, possibly because I do not see myself as an academic guy, but I try to find a source of enjoyment somewhere inside the world of exams and grades. Try to do the same, it definitely helps.Hope the answer has been helpful! P.S: It is great that you want to ask and find out how to do well in your exams but do bear in mind that there are tonnes of questions on doing well in Maths exams (especially ones on secondary levels) on Quora and I have answered and shared this method many times on highly similar questions. Do check out what the other questions have to offer first before asking a general question like this because I cannot believe that the way of studying and doing well for Maths in different exam boards would be that different. Cheers and all the best for your exam! :) ",

The rest of them are the advanced topics.So I suggest you spend more time practising those questions. Understand the simplest of details covered before you move on to the problems. Make a list of all the formulae so you can refer to them easily.Make sure you are thorough with the worked out examples and exercise questions in your text.After that you may refer to a math guide. I would suggest a book by R.D. Sharma.Solve plenty question papers and keep track of the time you take to solve them.Once you are confident, you are good to go! ",
