            "answer_text": "From my personal observations, impressive academic performance isn\u2019t a sure-fire predictor of a successful post-college (or post- high school) life. There\u2019s some positive correlation between the two, but it\u2019s far from perfect. (I\u2019m using the term \u201csuccessful\u201d with its usual connotations, as that\u2019s how I interpret the original question stated without any qualifiers. I realize that specific individuals may find certain alternate paths I\u2019ve alluded to in my bullet points below to be deeply meaningful.) Some reasons why a person with a dazzling academic record may not live up to their early promise: depressiononset of a physical illness that seriously interferes with their productivityserious substance abusecreativity thwarted by significant otherchild, family member, or partner requiring enormous amounts of carereligious/ spiritual questinvolvement in a fringe political groupanger management issues, extremely combative personality, debilitating paranoia; poor interpersonal skills in generalgetting stuck on an idea e.g. obsessively working on a math problem that has remained unsolved for centuries, the next Great American novel or play, to the detriment of everything elsedisillusionment with chosen field after putting in years of trainingunethical behavior with serious negative repercussions - losing professional license, and/ or reputationpolitical upheaval in country of residence forcing relocation in another locale to which the person does not adapt wellmaking a professional change of direction that does not work out as envisioned, and not being able to recuperateresting on their laurels, identity stuck in their glory days, not trying to keep working on their skillsbeing so used to the structured format of a formal educational setting that they end up not being skilled at innovative thinkinginability to look after oneself - feed, clothe, pay bills on time, medicate, maintain a place of residence/ vehicle while not appointing personal assistants to do the work. (This could be the fate of a suddenly orphaned only child, say, who focused only on academics while being looked after by his/her parents.)Some reasons why a person with an unremarkable academic record may have a successful life later on being a conscientious and diligent employee after goofing off (or being otherwise distracted) in school and collegeamazing interpersonal skills; an intuitive grasp of what makes people tick could be a tremendous advantage in professions like advertising, sales, marketing.good practical problem solving skills that aren\u2019t called upon much in academic settingsfinding their \u201cniche\u201d or calling - after floundering without much direction academically",

            "answer_text": "I was definitely a C+ or B- student in school, even though I tried hard. I didn't realize that I didn't know how to study, and nobody ever taught me.  I accepted my lot in life, however, and did what it took to graduate. I probably hated every day of school. I didn't like what I was learning and the teachers were boring, for the most part. Very few made me wake up in the morning and thirst for learning. I had to repeat two courses in law school, but managed to graduate on time. I've had difficulty passing bar exams, but have won almost every motion I have ever written for clients, and am a strategic thinker who has proven to outsmart even the wiliest legal minds.  I have lived a very enviable life, having traveled the world, experienced things few people get to experience. Due to my language skills, I've had conversations with people from around the world that have informed my own world view that make me a well-rounded person, I believe. I believe one must always identify what \"success\" means to him or her.  More often it is equated with earning money. Sure, I like money, as much as the next person, but, honestly, my freedom means more to me. Is success slaving over a desk for 18 hour days without time to see your family and friends? Is success buying a car that millions of other people have because they desire the same status? I consider that to be quite average.  I have learned more as an adult than I ever did as a student, and am grateful that I finished college because it gave me the tools with which to grow. Any education is better than none, even if one doesn't pursue academia as a career. So, my answer to your question is, if you believe an \"A\" report card is something desirable that gives you a competitive advantage, then you're going to go after that A. For me, however, the \"C\" I acquired gave me the incentive always to question whether I was researching enough, doing the due diligence to rise above my \"average-ness.\" I have been called brilliant by several people, which makes me laugh, but, maybe because of my average grades, I try harder? What I don't do is make a habit of comparing my success to that of others. There's always someone smarter, wealthier, prettier, better at playing squash than me---but I'll keep giving it that old college try. As a more seasoned adult. My college days are a distant memory now. And honestly, I like myself as a C-average student, with an A+ life experience. ",

            "answer_text": "If the \"A\" student is motivated in every task life presents, you can reliably expect excellent and above average results. However, for many people consistently in the top 5% academically, things are easy, and they can become complacent, even lazy. That's when the \"C\" students, who are persistent and want to succeed, can pass the \"A\" students, like the fabled Tortoise and the Hare story. Grades are subjective, in many ways. Some of us can figure out the internal logic of testing and approach it calmly and confidently. We don't question our ability. Others perform at a lower level, because they are nervous and full of doubt about themselves, or, perhaps, they did not receive the early childhood training and reinforcement that leads to academic excellence. For example, in my family, we learned the alphabet and reading, could count and do simple math and knew how to tie our shoelaces before Kindergarten. That's because Mom did not have to work and was home to teach us, and she valued education. Other children were not as fortunate, although they may have been our intellectual equals, in fact. Real life experiences will reveal true genius. Some of the most successful people I know were \"C\" students in school, but they applied themselves with determination to every problem and continued to learn and grow and succeed. ",

A students have a built in work ethic polished over a period of time which may tend to improvise over time, if not it takes a lot of time to die. However assuming one wants to always improve, and is willing to work hard, no matter how much effort it takes will eventually end up bearing the fruit for those efforts. I would not term them as exceptions but would rather attach them to qualities which define success. Those can be learnt, it would at this juncture suffice to say that these qualities are visible more in the A students during school. It may be developed by any individual willing to put in the effort. ",
