            "answer_text": "I think that if you can cut it, do it. I studied medicinal chemistry with a very heavy quantum theory and quantum chemistry load. Because I enjoyed it. I also did 4 courses in organic chemistry. Wasn't needed for my degree but I thought I'd take advantage of the possibility of doing something extra. 4 courses of organic chemistry is two more than needed. Just because I could. I didn't stop there. I noticed that the math in the physics department looked interesting. And since I was there, I shopped around there and did a few courses there. You know, because I'm mad. I wasn't about to stop and went to the liberal arts department and studied some philosophy. After my masters degree I did research for 6 years where I was into signal analysis of non-linear processes in rat locomotion and I studied a lot of statistics and I loved it. My advice is to follow your nose and do what makes you happy. I still think about all the things things I've done academically and it puts a smile on my face. I don't use any of it anymore except for the statistics but that is not important to me. A degree is mostly about skills and learning how to process large amounts of information. Unless you are going to do something specialized after your degree (like be a doctor or do specific research in your field of study), the content is not as important I think. If you want to study physics, chemistry and biology, do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean \u201ccan I take The basic high school courses of biology, chemistry and physics concurrently?\u201d Or do you mean \u201c\u201ccan I major in all 3 subjects in university?\u201d Very different questions. If high school, I recommend waiting to take chemistry and physics until you complete at least Algebra II. It\u2019s been a long time, but I don\u2019t recall any math in Biology, so take it first. Seems to me that Biology is mostly memorization of terms and theories. Chemistry is a lot of memorization, but also learning to test theories and solve problems using scientific method. Physics is problem solving using math theory. If you are very bright and don\u2019t have a social life or extra-curricular activities it is possible to take all 3 courses, but you probably won\u2019t enjoy the year. If you are that bright, you should probably take AP courses to earn college credit. Your school probably has a limit on the number of AP courses you are allowed at one time. See other answers about the wisdom or practicality of attempting triple major in all 3 subjects at university level. You might consider Biochemistry or Chemical engineering with a biology minor. ",
