            "answer_text": "I have been there for 2 long years. So what I had learned after those years is that whichever coaching you join after comparing their strategies, course material, tests,at the end of the day you should be satisfied by the selected  coaching otherwise you will spend a lot of time thinking that others could have been best. I would like tp draw out some points which you might find useful in choosing :-> 1) If you are hard working enough and you can toil that much hard which can place you in the top three batches, believe me Vibrant is the best coaching institute you can get in Kota. Because the coolness, studious, funny environment which the HODs create inside the classrooms is just awesome. No other institute can match that balanced mixture. You will get to know that in few months of the stay. 2) Don't ever give up on yourself. Don't ever fill your mind with negative thoughts if you get a lower batch in starting months. 3-4 months in a lower batch can't be detrimental to your preparation unless you stop working hard from your side. You can reach the top batch  in a few months if you pass ample amount of time in solving dpps and sheets and have confidence in yourself. 3) And last but not the least, whichever coaching you choose, never regret afterwards about your decision. All the top coachings are nearly same.And at the end of few months, you yourself will realise that it is all about your hardwork, the institutes can only provide you an impetus to achieve your goal. After that you have to drive your boat to the shore all by your own. And choose a P.G. to live in. Hostel environment can subside your preparation. And make very few friends,  you can make them once you step your foot in college.And don't fall in love during the preparation, Work hard and be done with it. P.S.  Feel free to ping me if you find any problem there during the stay.All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "This is perhaps my opinion , there may be ones who are against my views but I can't help regarding that.Vibrant can be said as a mixed institute neither too bad nor too good.The following points you need to consider.  1- If you are going for Vibrant just for the sake of directors let me tell you the bitter truth that the directors don't teach much of 13 batch they are busy in teaching the first and second and third batch of 12.2- Doubt classes are horrible you don't get much of help over-there , if you go to that room its just wastage of your precious time. 3- Coming to Materials provided it's obsolete  and much of Kota uses the same except- Resonance  4- Teachers : Organic Chemistry - The best you can find anywhere in Kota  Inorganic : Its also quite good.  Physical :Neither too bad nor to good Physics  : Clearly a lack of efficient teachers over there , In my tenure of 2 yeras over there the only impressive teacher I found was NKS(Neel Kamal Sehtia sir), the director Maths : The most painful truth lies here really very poor teachers in Maths ,the question paper you get to solve and the questions discussed in the class are entirely different. So, as I said it was a mixed experience now its all I can tell you but if you need to clarify any doubt feel free to pm me or reach me at khandelwal.saransh001@gmail.com ",
