            "answer_text": "It all depends on how you look at it. One perspective can be you are almost done with high school. You\u2019ve completed the first and second years. You have gone over the hump. Now you are going down the other side of the mountain. In that case, 10th grade would be the middle. Two more years and you are done with school. Second perspective: you are preparing to go to college. Then, 10th grade WON\u2019T be the middle. 11th grade will be. That is a KEY year. Colleges in America generally look at your 11th grade and 12th-grade scores and attendance. 12th grade you can sort of relax. Take a breath and then prepare yourself for college. In conclusion, it all depends on what your short- or long-term goals are. Remember, going to college is optional. However, the downside is there are not a lot of jobs out there that just allow a high school diploma. Most jobs out in the US require Masters degree. So that means you NEED to go to college for at least 6 years (Bachelors (4) + Masters (2)). ",

            "answer_text": "I would suppose end of sophomore year would be the middle of high school since junior and senior year are basically harder than previous years. Junior year is when you start preparing for college. You make a list of colleges, get more serious about academics, take leadership roles in extracurriculars and do your standardized tests. Senior year iswhen you finalize applications and are almost done with high school. Freshman and sophomore years are just you getting used to high school. But the answer really depends on what you consider the \u201cmiddle\u201d. ",
