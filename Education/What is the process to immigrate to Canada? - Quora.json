            "answer_text": "Here is the site that tells you everything. Immigration and citizenship Canada uses a constantly updated points system to analyze immigration applications. You get points for education, work experience, and the ability to manage in either of our official languages which are English and French. All information, documents, degrees, and experience are independently confirmed. People who fraudulently manufacture credentials are denied. You lose points if you are becoming too old. Canada wants young, educated, ambitious people who will educate their children. Currently, 54% of the workforce in Canada has a four-year degree from a university. Canada is the most educated country in the world. We live longer too. Qualified immigrants are welcome here. There are millions of guns in Canada, but no gun culture. We do not refer to people or groups by skin colour and we do not hyphenate ethnicity (example: there are no African-Canadians or Swiss-Canadians or Tibetan-Canadians. They are Canadians.). We have official multiculturalism instead of the melting pot for immigrants. Your profile says you are a life-long republican. You should know that our right wing political parties are much more like your Democrats. There is a lot that our liberals and conservatives agree upon. One thing is that Canada does not have, nor do we want, are any laws on abortion. Maternity/paternity leave is one year paid (it is the law), and the new mother must be given her old job, or one of equal value, after that year. In Canada, taking about any aspect of religion is considered rude and socially incompetent unless the speaker knows that everyone present welcomes such remarks. There is no Bible Belt here and most people shun organized religion. A lot of republicans would be uncomfortable with elements of our culture that enhance the lives of all Canadians. Research these things, or ask about this here on Quora, before applying. ",

            "answer_text": "I lived and worked in Canada for more than a year which probably qualifies me to answer your question. I assume to settle down, you mean getting a permanent residence status. Canada recently changed its immigration laws which makes difficult to get PR for those also who are already in Canada and also studied there. Express entry is a point based system. Draw happens every month usually. This draw is simply minimum point requirement for invitation to apply. Your points depends on lot of things. You can find many express entry point calculators which will give you idea what your score is. Score depends on a lot of factors like your education, work experience, age, marital status and more. If you can secure a job in Canada and get LMIA (labour market impact assessment), it makes your chances of getting an invite from CIC much bright for PR. LMIA will add 600 points to your profile where the current draw is doing rounds nearly about 450. But first and foremost, you need to give language test. Getting a good score in language test helps you score more points. If your education is not from Canada, you are required to verify your credentials. You can do that with WES. Once you do these things, you can create your express entry profile on CIC website. I am not very sure but if you are not in Canada then you cannot apply under provincial nominee (I shall update you on it). Once you meet the required points criteria in express entry draw, you'll get the invitation from CIC to apply for PR. You will be required to submit a lot of documents which CIC will verify during its process. You will also need to submit security clearance certificate which you need to get from your embassy. You need to make sure your documents doesn't contain any mistakes. If there is any mistake from your part, it'll delay your processing time. If everything goes well, you will hear from CIC within 6 months. If you are granted permanent residency, you will be asked to submit your passport to CIC and they will return you the passport within 2-3 weeks with Canadian visa (if you require). You'll receive then PR approval letter and instruction on how to get your PR card. P.S. You will be required to pay the fees for application ;) Next: Congratulations on getting a PR !! :) Hope this helps Edit 1: One important thing is, you are required to create a job bank account on cic job bank. If you fail do to so, your express entry profile will not be activated. You need to keep your job bank account active to keep your cic profile active. You also need to take Police Clearance Certificate from all the countries where you have lived more than 6 months (except Canada). This process can take a while (approx a month). You better start doing it early if you are planning to apply for Canadian PR. There are couple of answers already on quora for that (How do I get a police clearance certificate in order to apply for Canada PR?) You\u2019ll also be required to take a medical test at CIC approved medical center. Find out nearest one to you. Only go for medical examination if you receive an invite from CIC for PR. It is important to note, if you are approved a PR in Canada, CIC will grant you Canadian Visa for a year from the date you took your medical examination. The whole process for Canadian PR will cost you around 2 Lac for 2 person family (This is only if you do everything on your own and no consultancy involvement). ",
