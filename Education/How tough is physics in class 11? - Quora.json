            "answer_text": "The answer to that depends on a lot of factors: How good are your math skills? You should be able to solve algebra problems fluently.Do you have trouble solving for x?Do you have trouble reading information out of word problems?Are you easily frustrated? (Not a good thing)Are you a memorizer? (NOT a good skill for physics students)Are you a methodical problem solver (a good skill). If you tend to \u201cOh I just multiply to get the answer\u201d then you are probably not very methodical.Can you see the meaning behind the equations?How closely do you pay attention in class? Physics is a process, so missing pay of the process can leave you lost.What level Physics are you taking? Regular, Honors, AP, IB?Sadly, the teacher \u2026 talk to other students who have had your teacher.I taught Physics to freshmen (grade 9). It was a little less math intensive, but they still had to solve the basic types of physics problems and more importantly, they had to understand the concepts behind them. You might struggle in your first couple of chapters of the Physics class because it takes a little while to get into what I call \u201cPhysics mode\u201d where you really start to think about what you are doing. The bottom line is that some students find Physics easy to do and some find it almost impossible. It depends on so many factors, probably more than I have listed above. Think about who you are, the skills you have, the resources you have access to. Physics is do-able by all. A lot of the time, you just need to believe in yourself and get help when necessary. ",

            "answer_text": "I was passed 11th this year so I know that yup!! . that's true that the Syllabus of 11th physics is comparatively much more and harder then 12th physics... And may be I want to say that 11th sciences is totally different than the science we learned earlier..in 9 or 8 th.. . So from my experience you should take science not by get in the influence of your friend or family or just in the excitement that u get good markes in 10th... But \u2018\u2019 first think by yourself that u are really disurve to be a science student or any type of interest in it \u2018\u2019\u2019??? .. Well the chapter of 11th and 12th are different too... And 12th physice is much easier to understand... But not in chemistry at all because chemistry of 11th is the basic for 12th ( inorganic and organic of11th which helped u in 12th importantely ) but maybe yes you get a little bit difficulty in 12th physics numericals if you can't do 11th physics numericals properly becaues \u2018\u2019 Practice make a man \\ women perfect\u201d.... And first of all.... Nothing is hard if your try your best and...if you have a ability so take this subject, don't think much you have a whole year to do your study by the way!!! \u201c. . DONT THINK 11TH is a RESTING PERIOD AT ALL IF U TAKE SCIECE \u201c\u2019DONT COME IN THE influence OF OTHERS \u2018\u2019 Upvote my answer if u really satisfied EDIT \u2014thanks for keep upvoting my answer from 2018 to upto now\u2026DONT THINK \u2014 that the answer was wrote in 2018 and you want fresh !!!\u2026.I will keep updating my answers with better opponion. Don't worry if by any reason you haven't study in 11th property\u2026 Inorganic ( CHEMISTRY ) \u2014- Molar concepts are most important they are tough to understand for a first time but after understanding there trick to solve \u2026they are easy to solve\u2026!!!
