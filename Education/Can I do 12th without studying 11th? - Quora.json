            "answer_text": "Well as far as I know you won\u2019t be able to do all the chapters without having the slightest knowledge of what all was there in the 11th standard. In reality, you actually start the in depth study of all the subjects from 11th standard only. Before that, all you study are the bare minimum things that you must be knowing of several subjects. Most of the chapters of 11th form the the basics of that particular subject and hence should not be missed. It is okayish even you are not able to devote proper time to them and hence you just go through them and have a gist of them so as to understand the concepts. Going through them will not only develop a deeper understanding about the topics but also it is going to help you grasp the things at a faster rate. In this case, in order to save the time you can skip out the time required for practice of questions as they are not going to directly help you in the exams of 12th. If on the other hand you just want to score 50\u201360% in the boards and you don\u2019t want to sit for any competitive examination then its not a difficult task at all you achieve that without even touching the 11th\u2019s portion. Although your learning would be slower in the initial phases. ",

But I think you want to know if you can skip 11th class studies and manage to be fine in 12th. Now many people there, especially state board say 11th is not important. But don't forget its a base. If you study properly in 11th your 12th won't be that much difficult. Besides, this is the turning point of life. Its teenage, If you skip 11th, bunk classes, beware this is the point where a person's decision either makes the life or destroys it. So I would advise you to study well, take it seriously and of course have lots fun. All work and no play makes person dumb or whatever that saying is. You got the point. ",

For eg:in maths you need to be good with permutations,differentiation,integration,trignometry. In physics,your vector concept has to be very very clear. In chemistry,mole concept and entire organic portion is important. A bit of structure of atom is also important. In case you need to know about any other subject you can ask me. But i must mention you can just MANAGE with this. To do well,all concepts must be crystal clear. ",

But let me assure you. Only a few sincere students take 11th standard seriously, which is close to 20% ( although i haven\u2019t conducted any surveys on this topic,it\u2019s just an approximation :P ) and only the few among these particular 20% students reach the top premiere institutes like the IIT\u2019s and the NIT\u2019s. Thus, if at all you\u2019re ambitious,take your 11th standard very very seriously. MIND IT. ",

If it is a regular school or junior college coming under board of cbse or intermediate education of any state GOVERNMENT , you can't get admission in 12th without registration in 11th.
