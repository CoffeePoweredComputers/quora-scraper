            "answer_text": "Someone once described it perfectly and I can\u2019t remember their name but I\u2019ll expand upon it. When you enter Law school, you are prepared for the difficulties. You\u2019ve read stories online, read the curriculum and skimmed various resources to understand what is to be expected of you. You then begin taking classes; You start with a jar. You go to Tort Law lectures and learn about vicarious liability, duty of care, psychiatric injury and damages. Easy, you put 4 red balls in the jar. You go to English Legal Skills workshops and learn about statutory interpretation, judicial precedent, delegated legislation and parliamentary procedure. Easy, you put 4 yellow balls in the jar. You go to Contract Law lectures and learn about invitations to treat, offers, the postal rule and the doctrine of privity. Easy, you put 4 blue balls in the jar. You go to Legal Theory workshops and learn about honour killings, natural law theory, legal positivism and domestic abuse. Easy, you put 4 pink balls in the jar. Now, it\u2019s exam season and what do you have? A jar filled with a bunch of random coloured balls with no correlation to each other. This is your brain in Law school, at least in the beginning. Learning the Law isn\u2019t the hard part. It\u2019s putting all the components together, separating them and applying them. But in Law school, the assignments are easy, I\u2019ve achieved Firsts in all of mine; the hard part is the exams. During assignments, you have 4 weeks to research, learn, understand, put together and apply. This is made extra easy with all the online resources and textbooks. But during exams, you need to do all of which is stated above in about an hour and a half with no help. In exams you need to organize that jar of coloured balls, take out the ones you need for that subject and put them on paper, very quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "It is very, very procedural based. You are training to be a solicitor (one of our two types of lawyers - barristers go to bar school). You do one year of law school after your three year law degree (two years at law school if your degree isn\u2019t in law). I studied Law at Oxford (jurisprudence) and there was much more philosophical, academic content in it. When I got to Law School it was all \u201cwhat form do you need?\u201d and \u201chow long do you have to file it?\u201d The course (early eighties) was basically designed to produce provincial solicitors who did wills, conveyancing, divorce and a bit of criminal. Not long after I left some of the big City firms said that the courses offered by the UK\u2019s three big Colleges of Law (London, Guildford and Chester) was insufficient for their purposes (lack of commercial law) and set up alternatives.
