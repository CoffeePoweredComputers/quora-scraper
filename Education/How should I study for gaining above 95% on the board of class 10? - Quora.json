            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking the question\u2026 I think I m eligible to answer this. I scored 95.6% in CBSE Class X 2017\u201318. Now With very minimal amount to study, it depends on your previous preparations too, that how much you are familiar with your concepts of textbooks.Now I am assuming that you are through with your whole syllabus of all subjects at least once, then you need to focus on good revision and to check not even a single word and a single question is missed from all your NCERT books. Each and every question should be practiced and especially for science you need to focus on each and every line. A subject-wise plan for you assuming you are having subjects English, 2nd language subject, Maths, Science and Social Science 1.English Read each and every literature chapter with full focus on important lines because there is the base of extract-based questions. Practice the questions of writing section at least 3 questions per type and the most scoring part is the reading section doesn\u2019t need any more practice.Now if you have completed this, purchase or get a book of sample papers and solve it properly and practice the time management and the reading comprehension.Now marks in this subject depend on your vocabulary too \u2026 2. 2nd LanguageStudy thoroughly from your textbook prescribed. I don't think it is difficult to score in this part. Rest it also depends on your practice and retaining power 3. MathsThe most important subject and my favorite subject of all time.As always NCERT questions must be on your tips. Get the previous year's question paper and solve it like a real test. I also got to know from this year there are two levels of mathematics paper - standard and basic with the varying difficulty levels. Get a book like U-like or Xam idea and start solving. If you like maths then it will be a fun task to prepare for this exam. Learn all the formulas properly and start tackling the nervousness because \u201cTu Phod Kar Aaega\u201d *Translation - You Will crack the exam* 4. ScienceNCERT is the bible for this subject, it must have occupied your heart till now.Practice the most important questions because science paper has a lot of repeating questions. Solve your pre-board papers and the again get a book like Xam idea, I 'll prefer this because it has chapter wise questions too and start solving it and solve 5\u20136 sample papers you are good to go. 5. Social ScienceA horrific subject for me but scored 97 in it. Honestly, I didn\u2019t touch NCERT but I ll recommend you do this. I prepared for this subject from Arihant All in One which was a complete study package and it was my soul helper in the subject. Focus more on answer presentation like write 5\u20136 points apt to questions in 5 marks questions and 3\u20134 points in 3 marks question. It also depends on your ability to retain the facts and dates, interpretation of concepts learned from the book which requires higher-order thinking.Practice the sample paper for this too. It will help you a lot. Also, don\u2019t forget to download the official CBSE sample papers and solve it properly. Choose a time to study which suits you the best. I use to study from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM as it is the time with maximum peace but don\u2019t copy this as it can vary from person to person, depends on your biological clock. You are getting good 5\u20136 days for preparing each subject, so if you are dedicated enough then you can follow the tips above. Practice more and more and extract time to chill out too as 10th exams are the easiest exams. Good Luck For Your Exams.. #tuphodega Please Upvote my 3rd answer, it will really motivate me Thanks \u2026.. ",
