            "answer_text": "If you opt PCM then you should study Physics, Chemistry,Maths,English and one optional in 12 class. Choices of optional at my time is Physical Education,Biology,Hindi,Urdu. Noe choices may be different.You have to select one subject out of these four subjects, and total marks in intermediate is 500 If you opt PCB,then in 12 standard you have to study Physics, Chemistry,Zoology,Botany,English and may be optional or not. (i am not sure about it because i studied pcm there). There is very less chance of optional in pcb. Apart from those above subjects,In 11 class you should have to study urdu and HMC(History of modern civilization). Hmc was offered along with one optional subject also and you select one out of them and must pass in urdu and Hmc both. If you don\u2019t qualify in 11 class then you have to take as overload in 12 class.Without qualifying urdu and hmc you should not be awarded 12 marksheet and have to complete in it in one extra year. Better to clear in 11 class as to avoid pressure in 12 class and afterwards. ",
