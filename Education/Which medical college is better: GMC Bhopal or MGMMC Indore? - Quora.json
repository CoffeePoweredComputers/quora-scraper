            "answer_text": "It looks like choosing between a sandwich and a burger, it all depends on your needs and mood. So I\u2019m comparing both the colleges on some major fronts:- Location: MGMMC is based in a busy urban position in the heart of the city of Indore while GMC is blessed with a serene background of the majestic upper lake to its south and a busy suburb to its north. G.M.C, Bhopal as from it\u2019s North entrance (Aerial View)  MGMMC, Indore as from it\u2019s front entrance Associated Hospitals: Both the colleges are undergoing a major overhaul to undertake the massive development around the medical world to be incorporated in the present scenario. MGMMC currently hosts the largest hospital in terms of bed size but GMC hosts the highest OPD attendance. They both have their own pros and cons. Former entrance to the Hamidia Hospital  Entrance to the Maharaja Yashwantrao Hospital, Indore Residential Facilities: While I\u2019m not sure about MGMMC, the accommodation facilities in GMC are far more than adequate, with the new hostel blocks coming up, you can soon expect a lot more than what a normal govt college has to offer. Overall, under the current scenario, GMC has adequate accommodating potential for its upcoming students.Student life: It\u2019s the only thing that binds us on the same thread. Both the colleges offer a simple life of any ordinary student and a dynamic hectic schedule of a medico. (No House MD feelings though, sorry to let you down!) Welcome to the 6 circles of Hell!!XD Academia: Both are excellent colleges when it comes to academics. Academically, both the colleges have their pros and cons much like the rest of the colleges in this country. No more words required XD!!! Even these books are less than what it takes to clear the internal exams\u2026 Outside College life: Yes! This can be a quite distinctive point. Wanna live in a place of hustle and bustle? Can deal with the concrete jungle? Wanna have a bustling backdrop of metro city? Welcome to MGMMC, Indore but if you prefer a naturally blessed, picturesque morning everyday and a calm notion without the commercial city tag; Welcome to GMC, Bhopal. A late evening view of the Upper lake, Bhopal.  The upcoming commercial hub of Vijay Nagar, Indore. P.S: I completely respect both the institutions. I\u2019ve been in contact with both of them, but if you think that I\u2019m biased towards one of them, please present your errands in the comment section below and further edits and facts are always welcome.
