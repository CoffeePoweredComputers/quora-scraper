            "answer_text": "Honestly, there isn't a ton of job security after graduation unless you go into music education and are willing to move to a job at a school or university or you are a good enough entrepreneur to develop a successful studio program. If you decide on a performance career, you also need to be a great self-salesperson or willing to move to a job (unless you get lucky!) That doesn't mean that many musicians don't have very successful careers; it just takes work, flexibility and creativity. Otherwise, a music education specifically has no disadvantages. It's actually one of the most well-rounded subjects, including math, physics, history, social studies, creativity, literature, psychology, research and physical education. I have also heard that music majors are more likely on average to make it into law and medical graduate school programs on average, though I have never seen this study and it is just something a professor told me once. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Anything ART OR HISTORY have slim job prospects after graduating unless you actually can land as an instructor/teacher in those. This issue has been at the very core of the purpose of higher education forever and this is because COLLEGE IS NOT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION = it is for VOCATIONAL EDUCATION If you simply want to really know art you should be able to just study that for your own knowledge sake as well as for a posterity of knowledge. The same for music. You can study music by taking music lessons and learn how to perform and/or play instruments. You can go to art school and learn about art. Neither of these is vocationally connected. Everything else at college is. ",
