            "answer_text": "It depends on what you want to study. For example consider math's as a subject which you don't understand then you need some to make you understand that part or subject at such a time coaching study will help you out but it is just temporary untill and unless you don't go and revise it by yourself or study it by yourself it won't be permanently fix in your mind. So at the end coaching study will help you but self study will enhance your power of study and understanding. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey! I have given my 12th ISC board exam this year. I strongly feel that self study is the better of the two. In my 14 years of school life, I had taken only chemistry tuition in class 10 for the last 5 months from my school teacher who suddenly retired. Otherwise, I've never taken tutions and secured 95.8% in ICSE. I took up Science in class 12 and did pretty well without any tutions. Coaching gives you extra help but takes away a LOT of time! Thank you! ",
