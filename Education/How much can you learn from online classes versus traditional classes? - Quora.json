            "answer_text": "Hey, I think it all comes down to your attitude. When you sit in class but you are not focused and you don't ask questions you won't benefit. On the other hand, if you are highly motivated to learn you can benefit from an online class a lot. Just make sure to learn how to learn first. Check out my free learning cheat sheet (link in my bio) for more details. Cheers Marco ",
