            "answer_text": "You can use your SAT scores to apply to a European University, but every university has their own set of requirements. If you are attending an IB school \u2013 that\u2019s international baccalaureate school \u2013 this will make your life considerably easier. But if you are not attending such a school, do not despair. More and more Americans are attending European universities, so European schools are learning how to work with American transcripts. Some schools, such as Oxford and Cambridge, require one on one interviews, and these play a major role in whether you will be accepted or not. That is because their structure of college study is radically different from the study programs in America. The process is far more self-directed, and a student must be able to work more independently, meeting with their tutors to discuss the material that they are reading on their own. This can be a tremendously rewarding experience, but if the student is not mature enough to handle this, things can quickly go awry. The interview process is designed to uncover whether or not the student understands fully what the process will involve.There are expensive preparation programs that a prospective student can use to prepare for these rigorous interviews. I cannot tell you if they are useful or not. My daughter successfully completed a four year program at the University of Edinburgh, and she got a great deal out of it. There were no traditional dorms as there are in the United States, and has had both positive and negative aspects to it. There are no fraternities and sororities. There are certainly parties, however, and there was certainly a lively student life. Am I allowed to brag that she earned a first and was accepted to Cambridge for a master\u2019s? Well, it\u2019s true, though Cambridge was stingy so she\u2019s going to Royal Hollowell for her MA. I\u2019m writing this in the airport, returning from her graduation. If you are really serious, do your research and visit the campus for a tour before you decide to apply. Ask yourself why you want to go there as compared to a local school. My daughter was studying music, which more studied more comprehensively in European schools than it generally is in the states. She was also more able to create connections in Europe and research at other universities in other countries more easily. Classical music is that rare field that is more highly valued in other countries than in the US. Good luck- Amy ",

            "answer_text": "SAT scores are always beneficial because it shows your aptitude in Math and English and it compliments the academic transcript that you submit during your time of application. Having said this, it would be worth your while to decide where in Europe you want to apply. The curriculum you are following currently will also impact if an SAT score is required or not. For instance, if you are currently doing the IB Diploma, they don\u2019t require an SAT score along with it. However, if you are in the American school system then an SAT score is required. To start off with, it is important to decide on your course. Once you are sure of what you want to study, then start to look for colleges that are offering it and then the country. Most European universities are very lucid about their requirements regardless of the curricula. So take some time to do a little bit of research. If you are an average student but you have a pretty good SAT score, then go ahead and submit it even if it\u2019s not required. Anything that will make you look like a good fit to the university you are applying to is always beneficial to highlight as part of your application! Good luck! ",
