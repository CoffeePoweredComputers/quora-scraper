            "answer_text": "Here are 10 unique things you can do to find a job in Canada, that other new immigrants to Canada do not do, because there is nobody out there that teaches this stuff: #1 Record an elevator pitch video on your mobile phone As a new immigrant, employers will have an unconscious bias against your communication skills, which is a soft skill you\u2019d find as a requirement in almost every job description. If you have a video elevator pitch, your communication skills and vocabulary will be exposed, and squash any negative biases or assumptions the employer or recruiter may have made about you. If you have trouble memorizing words then use a teleprompter app like Video Teleprompter Premium. Create a great 30\u201345 second elevator pitch, load it up on YouTube, and add it to your LinkedIn profile. Link to it from your emails to hiring managers and recruiters as well. Research how to do good elevator pitches. Don\u2019t assume you know how. #2 Anglicize/Shorten your name This is a sensitive topic, but worth mentioning as well. The University of Toronto and Ryerson University did a study that found job seekers with non-anglicized names received 20\u201340 percent less callbacks, compared to their Anglo-named counterparts with the exact same qualifications. This is less of a problem in large corporate organizations in Canada where diversity and inclusion is more actively practiced. If you have an ethnic name that is really long and you believe will be challenging for a Canadian to pronounce, consider shortening it for your resum\u00e9 and LinkedIn profile. #3 Grow you network to 25 As a new immigrant you don\u2019t have a large network. And that\u2019s a problem. Because according to Business Council of Canada that surveyed 90 large sector Canadian employers, 90% of them source candidates from referrals. According to author Orville Pierson in his book \u201cHighly Effective Job Search\u201d it takes, on average, 25 network connections to get the job you want. These 25 people are not recruiters. They are people who have the power and authority to hire you. So make a list of 10\u201315 companies you want to target in Canada, and used a LinkedIn filtered search by company and job title, and the premium account to InMail these people directly. Don\u2019t ask for jobs. Just stay in touch and offer value to them. If they accept your connection request you don\u2019t need to sacrifice an InMail credit. If they respond to your InMail, you get your credit back. Think of the popular marketing concept of \u201cThe Rule of 7\u201d. Someone needs to see an ad 7 times before they consider buying your brand. If you must measure the progress of your job search, let it not be the the number of jobs you apply for online everyday. Let it be about sending 175 (25x7) outreach messages to your network during a sensible course of time. \u201cHellos\u201d and \u201cHope you are doing well\u201d messages don\u2019t count. It must be something that is of value to the recipient. #4 Write cover letters the right way Recruiters and managers will tell you they ignore reading cover letters. That\u2019s because everyone usually sucks at writing cover letters. According to Job Search expert Liz Ryan from Human Workplace, a cover letter should read like a business pain letter. The focus should be about what business pain you believe your future manager is feeling right now, and how you\u2019ve solved that pain in the past. Every job exists because there is a pain or problem that needs fixing. Research about the best way to write cover letters instead of assuming you know how. #5 Post your resum\u00e9 and cover letter directly to hiring managers The postal service is alive and well in Canada, and often underestimated. The benefit of using it is, unlike email, your letters will never be ignored. Head to Shopper\u2019s Drug Mart, and invest in stamps, envelopes. Then those 25 contacts you discovered? Post them your resum\u00e9 and cover letter. That\u2019s the easy part. If you want to make good impressions, you have to take the trouble to research about the company and person, and create a customized cover letter to each of them. I know it takes a lot of effort. Well, how badly do you want that first job in Canada? #6 Read this book \u201c20 Minute Networking Meeting\u201d by Nathan Perez Many immigrants don\u2019t have a network in Canada. But they make so many mistakes when trying to build that network, even though they\u2019ve been network building their whole lives in their home country. And the reason is because they have never networked with a purpose. This short book gives you the details on how to network with purpose and achieve the ultimate goal of meeting with professional Canadians in person. #7 Search YouTube for Dr. Lionel Laroche You need to understand how Canadian work culture is different from your home country. Communication, leadership, feedback, meetings, punctuality are just some of the areas in which Canada is different to the rest of the world, especially when compared to Asia and the middle east. Dr. Lionel Laroche specializes in Canadian Work culture and how it relates to immigrants. Watch his videos and reflect on how it relates back to how you present yourself in the interview. His talks are both enlightening and entertaining. #8 Gain Canadian Experience the RIGHT way Many will tell you to volunteer your time. That\u2019s the wrong advice! If you\u2019re looking for a job in accounting, hiring managers are not going to care that you\u2019ve gotten \u201cvolunteer experience\u201d packaging food with meals on wheels or greeting visitor and handing out fliers at some random organization. If you want to volunteer to give back to the community, good for you. Give your time generously anywhere. But if your agenda is to get a full-time job, that\u2019s different story altogether. You\u2019re better off volunteering your time at events where you are surrounded by people who have the power and authority to hire you. Join an association in your field in Canada and contact the board of directors directly and make yourself available to them for volunteer work. Yes it\u2019s an investment to join an association. But if it ends your job search sooner, or gets you a job that pay you $10K more per year, it\u2019s well worth the investment #9 Read as many job descriptions for your target job title as you can By default, every new immigrant that I\u2019ve worked with makes the mistake of brain dumping their past experiences on to their resum\u00e9. Remember it\u2019s not about what you did in the past. It\u2019s about what your future employer needs and how you translate your past experience to those needs. Read job descriptions for your target job title. As many as you can. And when you\u2019re done, read some more. Notice trends in requirements and qualifications, industry language in Canadian terms and any gaps you find. Make sure your resum\u00e9 speaks to those trends. Fill those gaps if you have them. And after doing this research, then decide if you need more education. Don\u2019t waste your time and money pursuing more education just because you want to keep yourself busy and feel productive. Education is not valued in North America as much as it is in Asia. If the job description does not mention a Master\u2019s degree or a certification for your target job title, don\u2019t bother getting one if your sole purpose of pursuing it is to improve your chances of getting your first job. #10 Make sure your resum\u00e9 has these words in it According to a study done by Career Builder, these are the most popular words to use on a resum\u00e9. Make sure you use them in your experience section: AchievedImprovedTrained/MentoredManagedCreatedResolvedVolunteeredInfluencedIncreased/DecreasedIdeasClick here to download a high-converting Canadian resum\u00e9 template Good luck and welcome to Canada!

            "answer_text": "My answer is geared towards Toronto, but I'm guessing most of it would be valid for other major cities. I don't know about the best way, but here is some advice which might help you along the way. The first one might be self-evident, but let me bring it up anyway - it would be good to have a smart phone or tablet when you land. If you cannot get a data plan right away, you can download maps and check other stuff when you are in a local Starbucks or other such venue. Apps exist for local transportation (e.g. NextBus), which would help you a lot if you need to commute that way. And commute a lot you will - distances here are very large. Sometimes you might go downtown, sometimes you will be going far out to the suburbs. Following ways to find potential employers come to mind: Google search - type in your area of work, \"Toronto\" and keywords like \"job\" and see what comes up. I found one startup like this, and met with them during my first week in Toronto.Meetup dot com - depending on your area of work, this might be a great way to meet with fellow professionals in person and start networking. If you don't have an account yet, I suggest you open it now and browse for meetups which deal with your desired area of work - you might be surprised by the number of people which are doing networking like this. And then, someone will know some company... you get the picture. Another good thing about this is that it gives you a good reason to start moving about the city even before you are actually going to interviews - this will help you get a better sense of the distances, what is where, and how much time it takes to get from A to B.Recruiters - you should be able to get in touch with them pretty easily via Twitter and LinkedIn. Be wary, as they tend to sound very optimistic regardless of whether they actually have a viable opportunity for you or not.And finally, LinkedIn, which proved to be the best way to find work for me. It's important to set your geographical location on your profile as soon as you land to benefit from their excellent matching engine (at least it worked wonders for IT, but YMMV). It goes without saying - all other info like work history, skills and hopefully some recommendations should already be there.I was recommended to use Monster dot com, but either I didn't put enough effort into it, or they are not a good way to go for software developers - either way, that didn't amount to anything. A word of warning about job postings on LinkedIn and other online locations: there are phony or fraudulent postings designed to steal your data. I encountered this once - a company called Cybercoders had a job posting for a software developer, and they requested more information than normal companies do, like postal code. I went ahead and applied, and immediately they informed me that they actually already hired someone, but would go ahead and post my resume on their website. I started receiving spam messages from them, and they even phoned me once. Stay clear of Cybercoders, and be wary about anyone requesting information which seems unrelated to an actual job which is being advertised. It's important to be active and contact as many companies as you can. State upfront that you are a landed immigrant - some companies for example require regular trips to US, and it's painful for them to arrange this unless you have a Canadian passport, so it will save both your and their time if this fact is known from the start. Some will not even respond, but don't let that discourage you - there are companies here which are well aware that talented and hard working people can be found among immigrants, no matter how fresh from the boat (or plane, rather), and are willing to employ from that pool.  When you are contacting companies, look at their website and think how you could fit in and contribute. When you write your introductory emails to them, make sure you mention that to get their attention. Also, this will help you consider whether that company would be a good fit for you. Finally, just thinking about this will make your brain readier for a potential interview. Any interview will be a good opportunity to ask some questions. Make people aware that you are new in the market, and kindly ask for all the information you need like possible compensation ranges, vacation days, health plan options, etc. This will help you piece together a good picture about what's out there. Before you begin your search, think of a good information organization scheme. A notebook or again and app will do (I used Evernote). Use technology to your benefit. Good luck! ",
