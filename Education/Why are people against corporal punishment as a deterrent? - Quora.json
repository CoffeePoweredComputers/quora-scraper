            "answer_text": "Because there are side effects to corporal punishment that adults are either oblivious to or don\u2019t care about. From an adult\u2019s view, spanking appears to work. Many children won\u2019t repeat the behavior because they don\u2019t want to be spanked again. Does it matter why children don\u2019t do it again? Yes, because they\u2019re deciding based on how their actions affect them, not on how their actions affect others. If they avoid \u201cbad\u201d choices to avoid being spanked, then there\u2019s little reason not to do something \u201cbad\u201d if they believe they can\u2019t be caught. It\u2019s why fundamentalist Christians ask what prevents an atheist from doing bad things. If an atheist doesn\u2019t have a god watching, ready to punish them for eternity, what stops an atheist from doing whatever they want? Their own thoughts stop them. They don\u2019t want to live in a society where people mistreat each other so they treat people the way they want to be treated. They thoughtfully consider how their actions affect others. People whose decisions are based on avoiding punishment have a harder time grasping that. Additionally, what adults don\u2019t see are the spanked children who learn to hide their behavior. Being spanked lets the child know the spanker didn\u2019t like their choice. But it doesn\u2019t help the child make a better choice actually work. The \u201cbad\u201d ways work for what they want. So they learn to be sneaky. They may know not to hit their annoying little brother but they don\u2019t know what to do instead. They can learn to pinch surreptitiously, bump them \u201caccidentally\u201d, whisper threats. As long as their parents can\u2019t see it, they\u2019ll get away with it. If they get caught and punished more severely it just increases their determination to be sneakier. The better they are at hiding their activities, the more oblivious adults are to the fact that spanking is not only not working, it\u2019s making the situation worse. Some kids see spanking as part of the deal. They\u2019ll weigh their actions against the expected punishment and likelihood of getting caught. If it seems worth it, they\u2019ll go through with it and accept the later punishment. Anyone who believes spanking works isn\u2019t seeing beyond the surface. They may believe kids who aren\u2019t spanked will push boundaries as far as they can. They may be certain they would have done all sorts of bad things if they didn\u2019t fear their parents\u2019 punishment. They\u2019re right. Once parents depend on punishment to correct behavior, their children think differently about right and wrong. Wrong is getting caught and punished. Right is whatever they can get away with. If a parent stops spanking, children will push to determine how far the new boundary that triggers spanking is. That\u2019s because their morality isn\u2019t based on how their actions affect others. It\u2019s based on how it affects them. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm gonna give a bit of a different answer.  Besides the usual things, it's how you people act also. Because you believe your so \u201cFixed\" by corporal punishment, you end up doing and saying questionable things. It's called affirmation of consequent, because A is true B is true. I was spanked for being disrespectful therefore I'm not disrespectful. It sorta puts you in this reality where you believe you can say anything you want, it's like saying I've been baptized so Im already going to heaven no matter what. (Im a atheist and even i know that's not how that works), but that's literally how y'all act. So you can tell me your sob story avout how you cussed out your mother, and then turn right back around and insult everyone else especially when your online, or shit I see this irl quite often. Y'all treat being spanked as a \u201cGet out of jail free card\" from the thing you where spanked for, or it carries in to other jone related things, I.e. I was spanked for stealing and I \u201cTurned out fine\" shit someone ya'll even admit some pretty fucked up thibfs and can't tell hummmm hummm maybe just maybe this isn't right maybe I shouldn't be thinking this way hummmm. So yeah that's 1 huge issue.  Its how \u201cMature\" and \u201cgrown\" and \u201cnormal\" ya'll try and sound. Like I swear like a fucking sailor, I love showing off my powers and myself and I still managed to kill every argument for hitting kids why? Because A. It's predictable it's like youyoursy reading from a script \u201cI only spank as a last resrot\" \u201cwith a open hand\" \u201cI feel so bad afterwards\u201d \u201cWhen all else fails\" you sound honestly pathetic, which btw comes from a psychological aspect from being spanked as a kid of your mind putting you in that same helpess weak position but making you feel \u201cPowerful\" hence why a lot of you use ad homians, words like troll, Bigot, kid, liberal, millennial (those last 2 aren't even fucking insults). Your being spanked all over again, I nevew spawn in awngew Awww and I don't givr a damn. And thats when your mind tries to fight for itself. So about the whole why does my way work and yours doesn't shit? Well 1 it's obvious. 2. It's the compensation effect your trying to defend something that's really really fucking horrendous, saying shit like \u201cOnly for certain situations\u201d \u201dalway in your tool box\" blah blah blah it seems like nothing more then what the fuck your suppose to say.  You act more like brainless zombies tbh, the ones that are \u201cWoke\" are usually the biggest slaves. It's easily to read also, because you believe in hitting kids the exacy opposite of what a actual grown adult would do, you see yourself as the biggest person in the room x10. (Now if anyones wondering how a psycho like me was able to take out so many \u201cMature and loving\" arguments for corporal punishment there's your answer I can see straight pass that shit, not only that but I know the origin, thought process, and flaws). The way you people so \u201cCalmly\" and \u201ccutely\" talk about abusing kids\u2026\u2026\u2026 Is a fucking turn off. Which brings me to, how y'all fucking completely think y'all did nothing wrong to cause a bad situation. Oh I \u201cTried everything\" I had to spank him. I tried grounding, time-outs, no deserts\u2026\u2026.. and how pathetic and helpless y'all try and sound on top of it all. Bitch first of all \u201cTrying everything\" isn't a good strategy, your child isn't subway mother fucker you can't have it your way once you do 1 thing you have to stick to it even if it seems like it's not \u201cWorking\" where going by the childs time not yours. You do things not only do you do them so fucking wrong, you do them with the sense that your absolutely right.  Your like that annoying fucking girl who your showing how to use a new app, I like so totally did everything right on this new step tracker app and it's just like not working, ummmm hello you forgot to allow storage privileges so it can save your progress. That's literally how we all see you, Omg I like tried the shit people who don't hit there kids do and it doesn't work. (Not calling children dogs this is just a metaphor), there's a difference between a person whos watched a few cheaply made videos on youtube, and a actual fucking dog trainer. I've seen and heard how you people use these \u201cPunishments\u201d bad, just bad here's the thing these other methods don't give you the \u201cFeeling\u201d corporal punishment does (there not menat to) so because that happens guess whos the mfa who runs back to grab there safty blanket? Thats right you? The most annoying part about all of you, and this shit even if you clearly prove you don't need spanking like *Insery every places that has this abuse banned here* you still say cute fucking shit like \u201cKeep it in your tool box\u201d thats how fucking hard this shit is to get rid of, even when you don't need it you fucking need it, ajd you create situations unknowingly where you do need it in your own mind, and because there's already \u201cNothing wrong with a little spanking\" See where I'm going with this? You tie your logic back to believing in this abuse, which also add onto the fact you don't want to call it abuse. But if you don't need it it's abuse but if you do need it it's not abuse simply just having it as a \u201cOption\" messes with your brain which is annoying.  (If your wondering why none of my arguments or thoughts are generic like it simply \u201cDoesn't work\"Ibe studied this abuse for years it's really REALLY REALLY hard to get past me). Let's say your child is running into the street, literally you people never do anything beforehand shit I even thought of the idea of just putting a child in a basket before you go in there literally right there outside and there's not a big giant sign thay says \u201cPlease do not take our own fucking baskets back inside our own damn store\" even some other idea like telling a child beforehand, keeping there attention, letting them show \u201cYou\"how to cross the street, practicing at home. It's like your to busy crying like a bitch to actually think, about how big and scary the road is and how you \u201cHad\" to spank your child and how frightened you where when you lost there grip and they \u201cDashed\" into the street. You don't even know it's your fault because you yourself where probably hit as a kid and didn't actually learn how to solve said situation, yeah you can \u201cCross\" the street as a adult (as you look at your phone on facebook but you never actually learned how to teach someone the actual way, besides just saying \u201cLittle Johnny hold my hand\" your actually pretty damn pathetic ngl. Also because you yourself where hit as a kid, being \u201cAt fault\" isn't particularly somethinf your mind is intrested in. But but but you try having a kid laugh at you as they almost get hit by a truck, the fact that your focusing on them laughing\u2026.. literally just pisses me off. You also just gave your mind permission to take every ounce of blame away from yourself.  Let's end this off, then it becomes a choice between saving the child from the big bad car or making them a slave to corporal punishment. That's how it gets you, convincing you there's \u201cno other way\" you do need the most \u201cQuick and effective punishment\u2019 correct? You do everything else so badly, that you believe it \u201cDoesn't work\" or you do the exact wrong thing in the wrong situation but your mind won't let you admit it, so you get shit like \u201cLast resort\" admitting your own faults is the same as deserving a spanking, and the curse starts over again. Inconsistencies, backwards logic, emotional manipulation throught fear, greedy, selfish, clueless, prideful, pathetic, and sad. You want to have your cake and eat it to, in reference to what I said earlier, you can stop your child from climbing on the table with something like \u201cJust a spanking\"but that doesn't mean no reprocessions will come from that, no matter how \u201cObvious\" just being spanked \u201cCorrectly\u201d helped you. If you didn't have both parts of the puzzle you all honestly fall apart, and the logic of corproal punishment itself loops in on itself. The way you trap yourselves in your own logic is tragic.  I honestly wouldn't wish that kind of hellish thinking on my worst enemies, but I think the worst part is how y'all honestly don't fucking believe your doing anything wrong. Just like the same children you hit for not knowing they've done anything wrong, and as a result they believe they have to know everything all the correct response even just \u201cTrying there best\" that innocence that you don't even give to children shouldn't be given to you, but it's only natural to crave what you never freaking got. Gathering theres millions of reasons to be against this abuse called \u201cSpanking\" and \u201ccorporal punishment\u201d this just happens to be one of mine. Seeing how freaking innocently y'all say shit like \u201cSpanking isn't hitting\" as if it makes so much sense, how you fucking defend it, how \u201chuman\" you try and act, even a murder can use big words to defend his actions and thoughts. Like it's so \u201cObvious\" Seeing shit like that.  Honestly just makes my fucking blood boil\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 You rely so much on how your saying something instead of what exactly your saying. It reminds me of corporal punishment actually relying on a word like \u201cSpanking\" because it seems so silly and childish as a word. Humm\u2026\u2026 I'll have to look more into that later. ",
