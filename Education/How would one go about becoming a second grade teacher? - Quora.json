            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll add a word of caution. You can easily find out online what the requirements are for the certification you\u2019re looking for in the state(s) where you want to teach. Google TEACHER CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS IN [NAME OF STATE]. In many states you can earn a certificate that allows you to teach K-5. The likelihood that you\u2019ll always be assigned to a second grade class is slim. The principal may need a fourth grade teacher, and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll go. The following year it may be second grade, and two years later it\u2019s third grade. Superintendents and principals like flexibility. If you want a job, you won\u2019t say that you\u2019re limited to one grade. In my state, subject matter teachers are licensed K-12 in their subject, and are sometimes a little surprised to learn that after ten years in the high school, they\u2019re really needed in the elementary school. They adapt. ",

            "answer_text": "As I have a Bachelors in Education and a Master\u2019s in Psychology/therapy, I would go for credentialing for elementary school. Find a college near you that offers the required classes. If you have not yet been to or graduated from a college or university find one close to you that offers courses in teacher education, specializing in early elementary education. You should have at least a Bachelor\u2019s level degree to work with/ become an elementary teacher. This is a rewarding and often fun age to teach as they are still young enough to be excited about learning and old enough to do fun projects in class. Hope you explore this. ",
