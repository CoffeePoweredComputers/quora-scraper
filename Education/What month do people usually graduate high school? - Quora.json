            "answer_text": "Well, coming from an Australian, people usually graduate from primary school and high school usually graduate in December (10 - 20). Depending what year and school. You see, the school year starts late January or early February (Summer). Students who already attended the school previously and are still at the school start a day later than the people who are new to the school. Then in December (Summer) school begins to end. People would have been practising their graduation. Then after the school year has finished, we get six-seven weeks off for holidays. We get around 42 days of Summer holidays. ",

            "answer_text": "In the US, more specifically California, the graduation ceremony usually takes place in the first week of June (at least when I was there). The senior students usually finish with their finals at the end of May and have a week off to get ready for graduation. I think this can vary from state to state and school to school though. But more or less, it is around that time. ",
