            "answer_text": " The art of effective communication takes time to hone. That said, it\u2019s not optional as communication represents the expression of your ideas, hopes and desires. It also represents how you advocate for change or persuade others to act. No matter your job, you probably have to communicate with a boss, manager and colleagues using email, instant messaging and in team meetings. And you will have to persuade somebody to hire you, promote you, date you, or listen to you at some point. I know my strengths and weaknesses. Years ago, I used to have a stutter but I fixed that through speech and drama. These days, I find verbal communication more challenging than written communication. Unlike many people, I find it easier to listen than to interject and push my opinions across. I ask a lot of of questions and sometimes this can feel like an interrogation. On the other hand, some people find it all but impossible to listen to another person without interruption or trying to fix what that person is going to say. Whatever your strengths, weakness or communication style, it\u2019s relatively easy to improve your communication skills. You could, for example, join Toastmasters and get better at speaking in public. Or you could start journaling and improve your written communication skills. Using speech to text software can help too. It also helps to learn the basics of active listening whereby you focus on and reflect on what a person says rather than try to fix their problems or explain what\u2019s on your mind. Starting a podcast is a good way of improving your skills too as it will force you to listen to another person and eliminate verbal ticks like saying \u201cum\u201d or \u201ceh\u201d a lot. Trump, whatever you think of his politics, has boiled down the art of communication to short soundbites that sound good on Twitter or in a news clip even if they don\u2019t make a lot of sense when you listen to to the entire speech.
