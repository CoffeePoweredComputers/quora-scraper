            "answer_text": "Yes. There is no escaping it, for the first 4 semesters (first 2 years) atleast. But trust me, it is taught in a most interactive, interesting and easy manner. Most core bio courses would start very elementary and slowly scale up. The faculty are nice (almost always nicer than PCM profs.) The coursework would be light, as most of the studying would involve reading slides and a bit of memorising. The biology practicals would be a treat: interesting and insightful. Most students coming from non bio streams are likely to face no problems, a lot of them do take bio as a major later on. You would encounter a lot of subjects you have never dealt with before (shoutout to HSS@IISERM) but thats the fun of it, not knowing what's in store for you. Rest Chill, you shall sail through. ",

            "answer_text": "As per my knowledge, most of the IISER has mandated to study Biology for initial few semesters. Although you don't need to study the same after you choose your Major and minor other than Biology. And coming from IISER-TVM campus, I can say it's mandatory to study biology for first four semesters along with Biology practicals. And in addition to that you may come across one course in Biochemistry as the Interdisciplinary course in period of your initial two years. Anyways all those courses are very basics and you wouldn't have to struggle to clear them until you study in class atleast. And trust me it's not bad, I have seen my friends coming from IIT-JEE exams chosen Biology as thier major and are pursuing research in the same. So don't presume anything, explore every subject if you are flexible and not decided what to choose for your research career. Have a good day. ",
