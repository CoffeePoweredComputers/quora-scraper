            "answer_text": "To the extent I know it is not possible as well as permissible as per the UGC regulations which are by and large followed by all State, Central and Deemed Universities. The reason is to get admission in a course you are supposed to submit basic educational qualification certificate. It is mandatory that you submit Transfer Certificate. This certificate is isssued by the institution where you last studied. Without this certificate admission to pursue degree programme is not possible. So technically no one can have two Transfer Certificates. Hence not possible to do two programme simultaneously. ",
