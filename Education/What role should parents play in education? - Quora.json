            "answer_text": "You are your child's advocate in today's world. You make sure he is on the right track, whether he is in the right level of classes, such as regular, Special Ed., or an honors class. In high school, you make sure whether he is going to be ready to graduate, to go to a technical school, a job or higher learning. If there are any disciplinary problems you need to work this out between you and your child and the principal. Get to know your child's teachers and principal and some of his classmates. It will be up to you to safeguard your child and make sure they are ready for life. You need to set up a study schedule with your child, they need to keep track of what the teacher says and what is assigned. Don't listen if your child keeps telling you there is no homework. Most classes will have homework from one to three or more times a week. You need to monitor the homework and make sure it is done satisfactorily , on time, and neatly. Most likely, the school will provide a computer but if not, you need to provide a computer by the time the child is in middle school. I was a substitute teacher after I retired from my Psych. job. My granddaughter has excellent study habits and she sits down right after supper and does her homework every night. This was not easy to accomplish and in the third grade, she resisted learning math but she is an all A student now from about 12\u201316. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah! That is a book! My qualification for answering is practical. When I was 5 when I went to an army school. I could read far better than the rest of the class (apparently I was interested in letters in my pram). I learnt a lot of NEW WORDS . My Mum didn\u2019t approve of my new vocabulary and decided to teach me herself. I finally went to school when I was 8/9. By that time I was a fluent reader and if the teacher was busy she got me to read stories to the class: I liked making different voices for the characters. I found that it was not easy to play outside school: I knew more about adults than children. My childhood was not easy. I read all the Sherlock Holmes in the library (I had read all the children\u2019s books). Things are a lot better now. I taught my first child (F) to read and found it difficult so I didn\u2019t teach my second daughter. My first daughter was so outraged that she taught her. I watched from the sidelines . . . it was working! A few years later they both tried to teach my son to read and got very cross that he didn\u2019t want to play. The local school was a bit sad as the teachers had let my two girls hear other children in their class reading. However when he realised that reading was important he let the two older children teach him. WHY THIS STORY! I didn\u2019t want\u2019t to force my last child to read, but my other children managed: it was part of growing up to them. I believe that parents should play as big a role as they can, but they shouldn\u2019t force all the time. Force sometimes one does with everything, especially \u2018manners\u2019, so make sure that home teaching is rewarding. He did let me teach him music: (the girls approved of that!). He is a composer now. DON\u2019T TEACH IF THE CHILD REALLY DISLIKES YOU BEING THE TEACHER FOR THAT SUBJECT: HE/SHE MAY CHANGE THEIR MIND LATER. It is worth involving your partner. Use a softly softly approach and be interested. What ever you do, DO be interested in what a child says . . . . . unfortunately children seem to feel that school and home are different worlds. Sometimes that helps and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. There is no one answer . . ALL THE BEST! ",
