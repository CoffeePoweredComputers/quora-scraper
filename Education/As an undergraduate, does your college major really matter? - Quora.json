            "answer_text": "The pragmatic side of me there is an increasing bias towards STEM majors and it does matter to a certain extent. You can't be an software engineer without a good training in computer science, but a computer science major could very well do marketing. Some majors will give you more optionality than others, but through all the people I've met I've been most impressed with people whom have dynamic range - an ability to be inquisitive but also adaptable enough that you can drop them into any situation and they'll thrive. That ability isn't major specific, its honed through your upbringing, your environment and your aspirations. Personally I'd much rather work with someone whom displayed that dynamic range, versus someone whom just ticked boxes on paper. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. User-11208442300916626658 has already answered this question, but I would like to address the details of your question: Are employers more concerned with your college major, previous work experience, or technical skills? I evaluate applicants (actually the professors who are experts in the field evaluate them) based on technical skills, on previously work experiences, and rarely on their undergraduate majors. I work in an academia and an area of industry that required advanced degrees, usually a doctorate, that show the ability to do research. The undergraduate major is a stepping stone to graduate school and industrial jobs. Bottom line: The only time an undergraduate degree matters is getting into graduate school or getting your first job. After that, it is what you accomplished that is reflected in your work experience. ",
