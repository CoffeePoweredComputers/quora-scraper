            "answer_text": "This probably the most toughest question I have ever faced in Quora. Not a single person in this world won't be able to write the answer which one is better.Anyway am trying to answer this question from another view.I hope you'll find it interesting. English has been described as \u201cthe language of opportunity\u201d, and by the time you get to the end of this answer, I'm pretty sure you\u2019ll agree. 1. English is one of the most widely spoken languagesAlthough it comes second to Mandarin in the total number of speakers, English is the language you\u2019ll be able to use most widely, as it\u2019s spoken in more countries than any other language. That means that English is the language that will give you the best return for your efforts; after all, intellectual challenge aside, there\u2019s little point putting a huge amount of time and effort into learning a language that you\u2019ll hardly ever have the opportunity to use.As well as the UK, a whopping 60 of the world\u2019s 196 countries have English as their official language:  the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, to name but a few. It\u2019s the language of diplomacy and the official language of the European Union, the United Nations, NATO and the European Free Trade Association, not to mention many Commonwealth countries. What\u2019s more, English is the commonly adopted second language of people in a great many more countries, including Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Holland. In total, around 1.5 billion people speak English worldwide \u2013 and another billion are in the process of learning it. Will you make this number even bigger by learning it yourself? 2. English will open up more opportunities for youBeing able to speak English allows you to communicate effectively in numerous countries, and this opens up lots of possibilities for you in terms of the countries you could choose to seek work in one day \u2013 not to mention travel to as a tourist. You won\u2019t have to worry about getting lost when you travel to an English-speaking country, as you\u2019ll easily be able to ask for directions, and taking guided tours, ordering food and chatting to the locals will no longer be a source of stress.What\u2019s more, careers that involve lots of travel or international exposure, such as the airline, tourism and film industries, use English as their official language, and many employers in these sectors are likely to require evidence of a certain level of proficiency in English before they will consider employing you. This means that if you can speak English, you\u2019ll find that you have a greater number of possible careers to choose from after you finish at university. 3. English will make you more desirable to employersBeing fluent in a second language clearly demonstrates a powerful brain and reflects someone who has put in the huge amount of time, resources and commitment needed to master another language. But while being bilingual is impressive full stop, no matter what combination of languages you speak, adding English to your CV will be particularly useful. Not only is it an especially complex language to get to grips with, a fact that reflects well on you for having mastered it, but as we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s also an incredibly useful language to learn because so many countries speak it. You\u2019ll be in a much stronger position to apply for jobs overseas if you\u2019ve reached a good level of fluency in English.English has been referred to as \u201cthe language of business\u201d, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. If you have ambitions to become an international businessperson, it\u2019s essential that you\u2019re able to speak English fluently; business conducted internationally is done in English more often than not. Even if you\u2019re not thinking of living and working abroad, that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t find English a helpful language to put on your CV. There may well be plenty of English-speaking multinational corporations with offices in your home country. What\u2019s more, English skills are just as desirable to employers in your own country and language as they are to employers in English-speaking countries. Here are just three examples to give you an idea of the kind of situations in which English may come in useful in your own country: Business meetings \u2013 being able to speak English puts you in a position to be able to attend or hold international business meetings. Where several languages are represented, the chances are that the meeting will be conducted in English \u2013 and if you\u2019re the only one in your team who can speak English, you may find yourself being put forward to attend important meetings, advancing yourself up the career ladder in the process.Customer service and sales \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to help with any English-speaking customers your employer may have \u2013 and sell to them. This gives you the chance to build relationships with overseas customers, and the ability to build relationships is an important business skill that puts you at an advantage over non-English speaking fellow employees and makes you more valuable to the company you work for.Marketing and communications \u2013 if the company you end up working for markets its products or services to English-speaking countries, or releases other sorts of communications such as press releases to these countries, your knowledge of English may come in handy for translating marketing materials or communications with customers or sales prospects. The cultural knowledge you\u2019ll acquire through learning English may also come in handy in knowing how to pitch products and ideas to English-speaking nations. 4. English gives you access to some of the world\u2019s best universities- English is widely regarded as the language of higher education. Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and MIT are just a few of the famous universities that occupy the lofty heights of the top of the world education league tables, and you\u2019ll need to speak English fluently for access to any of these, as they\u2019re all English-speaking. It goes without saying that if you are able to study at one of these institutions, you\u2019ll start your career with an illustrious name on your CV \u2013 and the benefits of that speak for themselves. If English isn\u2019t your native language, you\u2019ll need to take an English test during the admissions process to prove that your level of English is up to scratch for the demands of the academic environment. If you have your sights set on a top university, the effort you put in to study English as early as possible in your school years will be rewarded when it comes to the choice of universities to which you can apply. 5. English is the language of some of the world\u2019s greatest literature If you learn English, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy works by some of the world\u2019s most famous writers, in the language in which they were intended to be read or heard. The works of Shakespeare will take on a new meaning when you\u2019re able to speak English, and you can look forward to enjoying such influential classics as Emily Bronte\u2019s Wuthering Heights and her sister\u2019s Jane Eyre, George Orwell\u2019s 1984 and Animal Farm, Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice and many, many more. Translation rarely does a writer true justice, so the only way to appreciate a classic literary work properly is to read it in its original language. Even better, through doing so, you\u2019ll deepen your knowledge of English by enriching it with new words and sentence structures. 6. English allows you to get more from popular cultureThe world\u2019s highest-grossing movies are made in Hollywood, and needless to say, they are made in English. How many times have you been to see an American blockbuster and been frustrated by having to keep up with fast-paced subtitles? And how many times have you hummed a favourite pop song, but not been able to sing along because it\u2019s in English and you don\u2019t know the words? There\u2019s a solution\u2026 Kiss those annoying cinema subtitles goodbye and get more out of the music you enjoy by learning English. 7. English allows you to attend international conferences and eventsMajor sporting events such as the Olympics are held in English, and so are international conferences, so competitors and delegates will need to be able to speak English to be able to get the most out of taking part. You may find yourself needing to attend conferences as part of your chosen career, so learning English now will be of enormous benefit to you in years to come. Not only will you be able to understand the talks, but you\u2019ll get a lot more out of the networking opportunities that come with such events if you can talk effectively in English. You never know \u2013 there may be a new employer or client among the crowds of fellow delegates, so make sure you can communicate with them!8. English has a simple alphabet and everyone\u2019s equal- The English alphabet is straightforward, making it easier to master than the symbols or pictures that make up some languages. If you\u2019ve struggled to learn more complex alphabets, you may find you make more progress with English, which shares an alphabet with many other languages.There are no complicated symbols and characters to get to grips with in English, either; even in French, which essentially uses the same alphabet, there are several accents used on certain letters that alter the pronunciation. Not so in English. Furthermore, not matter how important they are, everyone is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d \u2013 there are no polite and informal variants to agonise over (as there are in French with \u201ctu\u201d and \u201cvous\u201d, for instance), so you won\u2019t need to worry about inadvertently creating social awkwardness by being overly familiar. And unlike many European languages, there are no masculine and feminine words to remember \u2013 it\u2019s \u201ca dog\u201d, not \u201cle chien\u201d.9. English gives you wider access to knowledgeDid you know that 55% of the world\u2019s webpages are written in English? This absolutely dwarfs that of any other language, with the next most widely used language on the internet being Russian (which constitutes just 6% of pages). Knowledge of English therefore allows you to tap into far more of the world\u2019s intellectual resources.English is also the language of science. If you learn English, you won\u2019t just have access to a greater proportion of the vast amount of knowledge available on the web; you\u2019ll be able to educate yourself still further by being able to read scientific books and papers. English is, of course, essential if you intend to pursue a scientific career. Within the Science Citation Index, compiled by the Institute for Scientific Information, an estimated 95% of articles are written in English despite only around half being from English-speaking countries. According to the Open University, \u201cAt Oxford University two thirds of post-graduate students come from outside the UK. The students in the university\u2019s chemistry research lab admit that working in English is a key attraction.\u201d10. English is a fantastic intellectual challenge!-English is undoubtedly one of the harder languages to learn. Full of nuances, unexpected pronunciations, odd rules and infuriating exceptions to rules, it takes dedication and perseverance to reach a good level of fluency. If you\u2019re on the lookout for a new challenge, learning English may be just what you\u2019re after. Not only that, but because it\u2019s so widely spoken, it opens you up to a huge number of new cultural experiences, which will help you develop life skills, meet new people and grow your confidence in handling new situations.Have we convinced you yet? If you\u2019ve been inspired to learn English, consider enrolling on one of our English as a Foreign Language (EFL) courses (for students aged 13-15 or 16-18) and develop your English skills in the company of like-minded students in the beautiful city of Oxford. ----------------- Why learn math?When are we ever going to use this? I\u2019m sure other teachers hear this but it seems to be especially prevalent in math classes.This question is frustrating for two reasons.  1) There is an implied \u201cif you can\u2019t answer then I don\u2019t have to learn it.\u201d   2) I could come up with an infinite number of answers and they, probably, would not be adequate.  Students invariably say yeah yeah, but I don\u2019t planning on doing that.But it is a fair question.  I\u2019ve created this blog, in part, to hone my answers.  Here are my current top ten reasons.  (They are not in any particular order except, perhaps, #1 and 10.)Learning math can help you\u2026.10.  Prepare for a career.In my humble opinion, this is the least important reason to learn math\u2026.9.  Develop problem solving skills.You can only develop problem solving skills by \u2026wait for it\u2026 solving problems.  I don\u2019t mean problems where the teacher shows you an example and you do 20 problems just like it.  I am referring to problems you\u2019ve never seen before.  Math gives you practice in organizing what you know, rearranging information, testing hypotheses, etc.  These are the same skills you can use in everyday life.  Unfortunately, most teachers (including myself\u2026  There\u2019s that stupid test each year) take the problem solving element out of math class.8.  Increase your capacity to think analyticallyWithout props, without manipulatives\u2026.  Just with your brain\u20267.  Be able to learn science6.  Argue better5.  Be less gullibleAstrology is completely bogus.  This can be demonstrated.  If you don\u2019t understand or believe the reasons (or can\u2019t sit through an explanation), you\u2019re missing some of the skills mentioned above and your math teachers should be fired, (except for the fact that learning is, ultimately, the students\u2019 responsibility.)4.  Distinguish us from animals What makes humans different?  Build tools?  Nope, certain apes do it, even ants. Develop language? Nope, dolphins, birds, and primates beat us to it.  Use money?  Nope.  One reason is our ability to think and communicate abstract ideas.  One language for doing so is mathematics.  (To be fair there are many others: art, music, literature, etc.)3.  Better appreciate the history of our civilizationWait, what?The industrial revolution was made possible because of thermodynamics which require an understanding of differential equations which is the main sequel to Newton\u2019s calculus.  The exploration of the world happened because the Egyptians knew the earth was round. etc.2.  So you don\u2019t look like an idiotAnd to show off at parties\u20261.  If you understand math\u2026.  And can read,  you can teach yourself anything\u2026. So when I ask you, \u201cwhy is math important.\u201d if you say, \u201cto count my money.\u201d I will start banging my head against the wall. So,both are integral part to learn. As to get a good degree also ,you need to learn in parallel .Of course it depends on one's interest.Am leaving here for you to choose which one's better. ",

            "answer_text": "If it is your mother tongue, English is not just a subject to study; it\u2019s a medium for processing and acquiring information about other fields of study including Math. If it is your second language, you are most likely to be exposed to it at university/ college since no science can nowadays do without English, it being the language of the world\u2019s scientific community. If it is a foreign language, still you will have to learn it in order to build a successful career whether scientific one or not. As for Math, you will have to study it because it is the cornerstone of all sciences including linguistics. Do you see my point? There is no such thing as a more important or a less important school subject. You may need some of them in life, or you may need all of them, or only a few of them but who can tell you which ones, when and where? I hated physics and biology ( especially genetics) when I was at high school; ironically, most of the texts that I have translated and am still translating are concerned with physics, biology ( genetics!!!) and medicine (chemistry and biology again!); there was a time when I earned my living solely as a translator/ interpreter. Funny thing: all those hateful formulae, laws and names popped up to my mind from some depths of subconsciousness. So, back to your question. Both Math and English are equally important as well as geography, biology, chemistry, physics, etc., etc., etc. ",
