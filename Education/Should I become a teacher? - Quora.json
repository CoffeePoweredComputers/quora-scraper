            "answer_text": "You should become a teacher because teaching is one of the most rewarding professions. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find another job in which you can make such a difference to people\u2019s lives and get to see and be appreciated for the difference you make. If you\u2019re not sure you want a career in industry because you\u2019re worried you\u2019ll get stuck in a box day after day, teaching might be right for you. It has the benefit of providing really unique experiences day after day within a highly structured environment. When I taught, I had tons of fun everyday, and no day was the same as another, but there was a tremendous amount of routine, which was attractive to me. Teaching is really challenging, and requires a lot of creative problem solving, thoughtfulness, and grit. I loved that about teaching. I worked in healthcare consulting before I became a teacher, and teaching is the hardest thing I've ever done. It differs from problems in computer science though, because the problems in teaching are messier and illformed. So in short, the benefits are: The relationships you build, the lives you touch, the variation and life in day-to-day teaching, and the challenge. (And obviously, summers off, winter break, fall break, spring break, etc) Things that make it tough: the pay, the hours (I averaged 12\u201314 hour days and 8\u201312 hours on weekends), the lack of respect from students, parents, society, the constant social interaction (I'm an introvert), and the stress. It\u2019s a really stressful job. It doesn't have to be, but if you\u2019re giving yourself over to it enough to do it well, it\u2019s stressful. You have the chance/capacity/responsibility to shape a small or a large part of the lives of hundreds of students. Some of these students experience a remarkable amount of pain and suffering in their lives and they bring it into the classroom. Depending on your state testing policies, your class may literally be what stops a student from graduating high school (high stakes testing - that was the case for me). It's a job that you give too much of yourself to. You get a lot back in return, but being a teacher is tough. Really draining. My suggestion: go for it. Go be a teacher for a few years. It\u2019ll make you a better person. You\u2019ll help the world out. See if you like it. Move on to something else if not. The skills of a teacher are hugely transferable, especially to management positions. ",

            "answer_text": "Quora moved this from \u201cWhy should I become a teacher?\u201d Because you Must. If there is no Must in you your chances of making it more than 3 years without being miserable and hating every day are small. If there is a Must in you then you are teaching now. Do you find yourself helping others understand on a regular basis?(not lecturing\u2014 helping understand). Volunteer to tutor someone or help out at a local school. Some people want to explain stuff and then realize they don\u2019t like being in a room with 25\u201340 kids. IMO there are three qualifications for being a teacher. Love the subject you are teachingLove the kids you are teachingBeing able to own the roomAll the other skills can be acquired through practice and research.Some parts of owning the room are able to be learned, but there has to be part of you that can settle them down with a confident look. Again there must be a Must in you. once i found that there was nothing that could stop me from being a teacher only delay the inevitable. it is truly a calling. When I pull into my parking space I am excited almost everyday to get out and TEACH. I walk in my classroom and am glad to see the young people whose lives I have an opportunity to influence and enhance.I\u2019m human about one day out of 20 I\u2019m worn out and need a break. Good thing being a teacher there are plenty of days off to recharge. ",
