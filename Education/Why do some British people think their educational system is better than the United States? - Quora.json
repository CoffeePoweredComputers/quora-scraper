            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as a British Education System and never has been. There is a Scottish Education System, an England and Wales Education system, and a Northern Irish Education system. They are all distinct from each other, particularly the Scottish system which developed earlier with statutes going back to the fifteenth century and a provision for universal primary education dating from 1695. The Scottish system is more of a mid-point in breadth and depth between the US and English systems (although in outward form and nomenclature it more closely mirrors the rest of the UK than the US, but has lots of Continental European influences). As a product of the Scottish system from Primary School through to a Postgraduate degree who works in Massachusetts public secondary sector education (considered an educational leader within the US) there are clear differences in approach. Scottish Education is much more formal at all levels although there is an emphasis on greater specialization at an earlier age than in the States, but is not as narrowly focused as in the English and Welsh system. American Education is in my experience better at inculcating cooperative learning and instilling confidence. Scottish education is more academically rigorous at a formal individual level, in as much as students are expected to produce quality work on time and are marked more stringently on written work. American education has (in my experience) a greater emphasis on quantity and breadth over deeper specialist knowledge. Scottish Education particularly in the Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Law requires less written production but greater quality and depth with wider, deeper and more self-directed reading and research. Obviously and especially at the level of Higher Ed. there are differences between disciplines and there may be some where the transatlantic differences are less marked than others. I am not knowledgeable enough to speak in more than general terms about English, Welsh, and Northern Irish Education, which while different to each other are more alike than the Scottish system. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are a number of international studies that back this up but anecdotal evidence is often the most striking. There is a story of this genteleman who although functionally illiterate graduated from high school, graduated from University and went on to become a high school teacher but did not learn to read until he had already spent 17 years teaching high school students. \u2018I was a teacher for 17 years - but I couldn\u2019t read\u2019 Recent stories about how students parents bought their places at University do not help. There is also the secretary of education of the USA who during her confirmation hearing appeared confused, unaable to grasp mathematical concepts and unable to understand the difference between measuring a students performance and their improvement in performance. The perception that political and religious interference in school curricula as well as corruption and mismanagement particularly when it comes to text book choices also seems rife. How Texas Inflicts Bad Textbooks on Us Then there is the case at University of Central Florida where students were able to buy the question bank (with answers) which the professor was using to set exam questions and yet no one questioned either the stupidity of the professor of using published questions and answsers for his tests or the fact that he was plagiarising someone elses work and passing it off as his own. Or the case at Texas A&M University professor who failed his entire Strategic Management class because none of them knew any of the material from the pre-requisite classes which they had supposedly passed. This is all despite the US spending 50% more per pupil at school. ",
