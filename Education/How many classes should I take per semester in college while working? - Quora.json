            "answer_text": "It depends upon how many hours you\u2019re working and your other commitments. If you\u2019re working full time, have a family, etc., it will be very difficult to be a full time student. You\u2019re at work all day, and maybe have to stay late to finish projects. If you have a family, you need to spend time with them. There are only so many hours in the day, and something has to give, which means school gives. A good rule of thumb is to plan to spend 3 hours of class prep/study time per credit hour. If each course you take is 3 credits, that means you should spend 9 hours of class prep/study time OUTSIDE the time your class meets per week. If you take two courses, plan to spend 18 hours of class prep/study time per week. Do you have a spare 18 hours for homework, writing papers, doing research, etc.? If not, take one course. Yes, it will take you longer to finish, but so be it. If you\u2019re working part time and are single, then you could go to school full time. A full time schedule is typically 4 or 5 courses taken per semester. Some colleges\u2019 courses are 3 credits, so if you take 5 courses per semester, that\u2019s 15 credits (unless you\u2019re taking lab courses, which usually means you get an addition credit for the lab component, and this applies to both science lab courses and introductory foreign language courses). Other colleges\u2019 courses are 4 credits, and their students take 4 courses per semester, which is 16 credits. The courses tend to be both broader and more in depth, so there\u2019s more work, but it is okay. And it also depends upon what you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re working and you\u2019re in a demanding major, you might find that a full time schedule is too much, not if you want to and have to truly master the material. If you\u2019re able to, you can scale back and you can always try to pick up electives during the summer so you don\u2019t get too far behind. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your choice. When I started my education at the university, I took 2 additional courses over what the university allowed (5) per semester (I had to get special permission), as well as raise two children ( I was going through a divorce) and worked two part time jobs to meet ends. I maintained a 4.0 GPA for two years straight, then took a semester off which dropped my GPA to 3.8 for another 3 years (I was classified a professional student on the third year). Oh, why 5 years instead of 4 years? Social studies (history) teacher positions are notorious for ossified teachers who stay in setting for years. So its essential that new social studies teachers have alternative bases to apply for a teaching position. ",

Are you leaving enough time for yourself? What support do you have, say doing laundry and getting meals or do you need to add time for those things into your mix. Remember that you have to study, at least one hour out of class for every hour in. Then there\u2019s time for writing essays, etc. Finally, there is human nature. I don\u2019t think people should try to schedule themselves for more than 60 hours a week including all those have to do things. ",

If you take a full-load, you should be able to work on-campus for 10 to 14 hours per week in a relatively flexible scheduled on-campus job. If you are trying to work Full time, off-campus and take courses, then you should take only two courses per semester and then take one to two courses in the college\u2019s summer session. You need to check with the college to see what classes are offered over the summer. That will allow you to work full time and graduate within 8 years. ",

If you are working full-time, then I would recommend keeping your course load at no more than six hours. ",
