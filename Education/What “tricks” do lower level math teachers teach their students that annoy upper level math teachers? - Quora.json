            "answer_text": "Taking the discussion way down to elementary school. I taught the advanced math group in upper elementary\u2014fourth and fifth, mostly fifth. But I taught remedial math after school to third, fourth, and fifth graders. Here are some ot the things I begged lower grade teachers not to do: Do not say subtract the little number from the big number. This works fine when the child is solving 5 - 3, but when the child is older and solving 13\u20135, it results in 12 for an answer.Do not say, \u201cGoes into,\u201d for division. For example 12 \u00f7 3 read as \u201cThree goes into 12 how many times?\u201d Often pronounced \u201cGuzzinta.\u201d It means nothing. If it did mean something, it would likely be addition. Instead, say, \u201cHow many groups of 3 can be made from a group of 12.\u201dDo not read a fraction as \u201cOne over two,\u201d or \u201cFive over 12.\u201d Instead, call the fraction by its name, \u201cOne half,\u201d or \u201cFive twelfths.\u201d You could also say \u201cOne divided by two,\u201d or \u201cfive divided by 12.\u201d That would help us in the upper grades.I don\u2019t mind if a child counts on his/her fingers, but please teach them to do it right. Have them say the first addend, then count up to the sum. For instance, 17 + 5. Say 17, then count 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. If you let them start counting with 17, they will say, \u201c17, 18, 19, 20, 21,\u201d end up with the incorrect answer. Same thing with counting down for subtraction.Never say, \u201cCarry,\u201d or \u201cBorrow.\u201d If solving 213 - 5, say, \u201cMove the one ten to the ones column where it becomes ten ones. Add that to the three ones you already have, and then do 13 - 5. Your answer is 208.\u201d Use manipulatives until they understand what they are doing relates to something in te real world, not just a trick with numbers.Also, please don\u2019t say, when regrouping, \u201cCross out the zero and make it a 9.\u201d Teach the child to understand what he/she is doing, again using manipulatives. If you don\u2019t when a child is solving 4008 - 9, they cross out the zeroes, make them nines, and solve 4998 - 9.EDIT: Thanks, Elijah Liu, for your suggested edit, but 13 - 5 is the problem I want. When the confused child takes the little number (3), from the big number (5), he gets 2. Then he \u201cbrings down\u201d the \u201c1,\u201d getting 12. If he had learned to recroup, he would have correctly gotten \u201c8\u201d for the answer. I\u2019ve thought of one more pet peeve. 7. When reading a number, say 305 or 3,072, please do not say, \u201cOne hundred and two,\u201d or \u201cThree thousand and seventy two.\u201d This is because, in the upper grades, we want the word \u201cand\u201d to be used where the decimal point goes, or to divide the whole number part from the fraction part of a number. For instance, \u201c795.05\u201d is read \u201cSeven hundred ninety five and five hundredths,\u201d and \u201c27 2/3\u201d is read \u201cTwenty-seven and two thirds.\u201d That\u2019s enough for now.

            "answer_text": "Really, almost any shortcut that sidesteps understanding to grant more immediate success is a real frustration. This is why vertical alignment is really important. I\u2019m okay with teaching the Pythagorean Theorem or Quadratic Formula without proof (these are pieces that can be picked up later), but most things are best presented in a way that makes mathematical sense. The knowledge will stick better, and teachers up the chain won\u2019t have to reteach (AND UNTEACH) as much later. Here\u2019s a concrete example:  When you\u2019re trying to draw the inequality x > 4 on a number line you should shade the part of the number line that contains all of the numbers greater than 4.  Not terribly difficult. But\u2026 some teachers teach it like this: \u201cIf the arrow is pointing right, shade right. If it\u2019s pointing left shade left.\u201d What. The. #$&% ???  First off, this completely defeats the purpose. We\u2019re trying to get them to visualize what \u201cgreater than 4\u201d looks like. Not have them draw a random picture. Secondly, foiling this is very easy. Graph 4 < x? Oops\u2026 Then the next fun part is when we graph two-dimensional inequalities. How do you graph y > x + 5? \u201cDo we shade to the right?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with y, so it\u2019s not left or right, it\u2019s up or down. Which direction indicates more than for y?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means\u2026\u201d [in my head] \u201cOf course you don\u2019t, because your teacher punted the ball.\u201d  But \u201cupper-level\u201d teachers are guilty of this as well. (I\u2019m guilty of this as well.) And honestly, if students are near the end of the line in their math education, application is more important than understanding, though in most cases understanding makes application easier. ",
