            "answer_text": "I learned humility, possibly the most valuable lesson of my life thus far (its only competition being forgiveness), from a stranger with the worst speech impediment I have ever encountered. This man was brave enough to approach me in an online dating forum. He was attractive, intelligent and charismatic. I liked him. I invited him for coffee. He was late. Very very late. Yet he kept texting insisting he would be there soon. I suffer from often crippling anxiety and panic attacks. I knew there was something similar happening to this guy and he was really fighting to show up. So I waited. Finally he arrived. He was shaking with trepidation. His cheeks were crimson and his ears were burning hot. I smiled, a genuine and concerned smile, and spoke first. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I have anxiety that is really debilitating at times. Is that what\u2019s happened to you too?\u201d Then immediately I understood. As his words failed him, time and time again, and I watched the anguish in his eyes while he fought a war within\u2026.just\u2026to\u2026.speak\u2026.I was honoured. I was proud. I was amazed and overwhelmed and so very very humbled. He fought that battle for me. He didn\u2019t even know me. I take my words for granted. When I cannot show up, I can communicate exactly why, every emotion with grace and nuance and poise. My words are my most effective and dangerous weapon. They are my salvation. And a man who could not speak his truth spoke it ever so clearly to me that day. How brave. How brilliant and honest and brutal and brave. I am humbled to know you. I strive to be more like you. You have inspired me to do and be and try. Thank you. We all have battles to fight and mountains to climb. We all have the opportunity to be humble and kind. ",
