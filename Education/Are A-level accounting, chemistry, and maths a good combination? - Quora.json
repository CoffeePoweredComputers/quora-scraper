            "answer_text": "Maths and chemistry certainly go very well together. Accounting doesn't really fit with the other two (the maths required for accounting is very basic - it's mostly just addition, the challenge being knowing which numbers to add and what to do with the answer), but that's ok - it can be good to have a bit of diversity. It is worth noting that accounting is considered a \u201cnon-preferred subject\u201d by some universities. That shouldn't be a problem, though - they usually only ask for two of your three A-levels to be in preferred subjects (which maths and chemistry both are). You may also want to consider whether further maths would be useful for whatever you want to do next. ",

            "answer_text": "They sound to have possibilities to me. Are you doing a 4th as an AS? It is always useful to have an idea of what you want to do after A levels and perhaps try and research the best subjects. My biased view is that maths and sciences are always good, sound subjects mainly because it is hard to do extremely well without some natural talent, and as such they can impress above some of the rote learning subjects. My stepdaughter, who now has a P Hd, did chemistry and maths and is involved in drugs trials and I imagine your combination could equip you for similar. If you did do a 4th subject for AS, then possibly another science or even psychology might sit well. At one stage I would have liked to become an architect and I could see all those subjects would help in that area. ",
