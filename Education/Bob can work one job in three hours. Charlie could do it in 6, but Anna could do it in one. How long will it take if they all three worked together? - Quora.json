            "answer_text": "Bob can work one job in three hours. Charlie could do it in 6, but Anna could do it in one. How long will it take if they all three worked together? This answer is a math answer it does not take real world variables into account like: \u201cCan all three really work efficiently on the project at the same time?\u201d\u201cWill any worker just goof off now, because it is a \u2018group\u2019 project?\u201d.This is a work rate problem, it relies on using reciprocals as the rates different people work at. Bob takes 3 hours, his work rate is 1/3, because in a single hour he accomplishes 1/3 of the task at hand. Charlie takes 6 hours, his work rate is 1/6, because in a single hour he accomplishes 1/6 of the task at hand. Anna takes 1 hour, her work rate is 1/1, because in a single hour she accomplishes the entire task at hand. The task at hand is completed by all three workers working together in an unknown amount of time, cal it x. This makes the combined work rate 1/x. Equation 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/1 = 1/x : Get rid of all fractions by multiplying each term by the common denominator 6x. (6x)(1/3) + (6x)(1/6) + (6x)(1/1) = (6x)(1/x) : Simplify 2x + x + 6x = 6 : simplify by adding like terms 9x = 6 : Isolate x by dividing both sides by 9 x = 6/9 : Reduce x = 2/3 of an hour. In 2/3 of an hour Bob will accomplish (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 of the task In 2/3 of an hour Charlie will accomplish (2/3)(1/6) = 1/9 of the task In 2/3 of an hour Anna will accomplish (2/3)(1/1) = 2/3 or 6/9 of the task. 2/9 + 1/9 + 6/9 = 9/9 or 1 ",

            "answer_text": "Best way to look at this is the rate of work. Let's say we have 6 units of work to complete. Bob works at 2 units per hour Charlie works at 1 unit per hour Anna works at 6 units per hour Total work rate for all three is 2+1+6 = 9 If all three work together 6 units will be completed in 6/9 = 2/3 hour = 40mins. Ans = 40 mins. Mal. ",
