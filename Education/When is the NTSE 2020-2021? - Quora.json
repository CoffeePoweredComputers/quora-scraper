You can start preparing MAT and have a good grip over it. Stage 1 exam is generally held in the month of November but it might be changed this year due to COVID 19 pandemic. Even I have qualified for NTSE Stage 2 2019-20 but there is a lot of uncertainty about when the exam will be conducted and in my opinion it doesn\u2019t seem conducive for the stage 2 exams also to take place till September - October. All the best and do upvote if my answer helped you! ",
