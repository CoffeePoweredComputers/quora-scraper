            "answer_text": "This is a difficult question to answer becomes it involves so many factors. Keep in mind that the US is very large and there are many variations between the education systems in different cities and states.  Things to think about before somebody could tell you \"what your school will be like\" would be if it is private or public, what city and state it is in, and what the area is like. In Illinois where I went to high school, a lot of school funding is based on property taxes. This means that more affluent areas have schools with better resources, newer equipment, higher paid teachers, etc. So, it is important to know what area you will be in to properly answer your question. The same could be said to understand how social dynamics work in a school. If it is a small city where everybody knows everybody and there are only 20 or 50 or even 100 students in each grade it will be very different than a large school with 500+ students in each grade.  Without being able to tell you what your school will be like, I can tell you my experience with foreign students who came to our high school. We had several students from various different countries come to study for between 6 months and 2 academic years. From what I saw, all of them were able to make friends quickly, had good relationships with their teachers and were well accepted by the student body.  American students on the whole know very little about other cultures and about people from other countries. They are, however, very curious when they get the opportunity handed to them right in front of their faces. They will ask questions, make assumptions, make jokes, show off to try to be cool, etc. Be prepared for questions that are based on stereotypes, like \"Is it true that everybody from your country does _____?\" At my high school a lot of people wanted to be friends with the international students. They sometimes ended up being referred to as \"the Swedish kid\" or \"the German guy\" - it wasn't in a malicious way at all, simply a way of recognizing and appreciating that they were unique and different.  At my high school, teachers were very aware of the international students, and were lenient with them in terms of assignments and grades if language or cultural differences were the reason.  In general, be open-minded and kind. Don't be judgmental or too critical of others without first knowing if it is a cultural difference. People will want to know about what things are like in your country, the differences, and may sometimes say how much better things are in the United States. Many times they will be completely incorrect - but just take it as them being proud of where they are from and that now they can share it with you rather than thinking it is a better place.  As far as the \"clicks\" -- or different groups that you see in many films -- yes, they exist. They may not exist to the extent that you see in \"Mean Girls\", but depending on which school you are at, you will probably see separate groups of smart kids, music kids, theatre kids, jocks/athletes, etc. In my experience this was always quite exaggerated in films and many people find themselves having friends in multiple groups and going from group to group without any kind of exclusivity or stigma towards others. As a foreigner, you will have the opportunity to merge into most any group that you want and easily float between many. Try to avoid becoming too friendly with \"the cool kids\" or the \"most popular kids\" as they are typically the ones who are most judgmental, have false characters and have the most enemies in the school. Hope that helps you a little bit. Of course my whole answer is just based on my experience in school and doesn't exactly \"answer your question\", but might give you some things to think about. Be respectful and keep an open mind and I'm sure you will have a great experience and find that, although children can be mean, you will be accepted, find great friends and support and create lifelong relationships along the way.

            "answer_text": "You'll be fine.I'm a sophomore from California. On the subject of cliques, there's a whole clique for K-pop lovers who have D.O. (still don't get it) on everything that they own, or probably an anime group at least, depending on where your school is, and quite a few people have parents who are immigrants from Asia, not great-great-great-great grandparents like me (from Europe). The people with other languages as their first language find English hard, especially, but math to be easy because numbers are in one language. Everyone will want to ask you questions, but depending on the size of your school it might take you a bit for people to notice that you're new. That thing that you see in the movies with the teacher introducing you to the class, has never happened to anyone in my classes. I don't think that you'll be transferring in the middle of the year, though, so that shouldn't be important anyways. Most homework is just about half an hour of math every night, unless you take AP classes (college classes in high school), which have a lot more homework. You'll probably be good at some parts of history, like the Vietnam War (we just learned about that), but if you take US history, you probably won't know very much, while the rest of the class took US history in 8th grade too. English will probably be difficult, because of the emphasis on proper grammar, but you could probably ask your new friends or the teacher to review essays before you turn them in to check for errors, and for reading, maybe you could buy the book in your native language online, or read the English version at your own pace, which will probably build your vocabulary and you'll know the book better than the rest of the class. Some teachers are a bit annoying by not spending very much time on trying to teach you, but learning to be responsible for your education is probably a good tool for college (wouldn't know, haven't gone yet). There's stereotypes, yes, but the Asian stereotype is that you're smart. There's not very much bullying, as far as I know, at least of nerds, geeks, and dorks, although there are pranks by other nerds, but only if they think that you won't be mad. It's like your school, just supposedly with less homework. ",
