Such as Hindustan university which is somewhat based on donation As you had maths therefore it will not be a problem No doubt you can do CA (chartered accountancy ) regarding whatever score you have made in 12th as you have passed 12th exam therefore it should not be a problem.

Only you can work with some of the best directors in the country.
