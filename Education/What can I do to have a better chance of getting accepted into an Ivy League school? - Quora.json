            "answer_text": "Not a whole lot. Your best bet to increase your chance of getting in is to apply to all of them. Then you have a small chance of getting into each, as opposed to a small chance of getting into one. The main thing to think about when looking at very selective schools is that there is a really low chance of getting in, just given the numbers. A number of years ago, I was working with the admissions office of a very selective university. While this may not be representative of every elite university\u2019s process, it provides a window into their thinking. Here\u2019s how their VP described the process. They receive over 20,000 applications every year for 1,000 seats in the freshman class. (Note that I changed the numbers somewhat so the exact school can\u2019t be identified)Their standards are published and well-known, so probably 80% of those applicants meet all the academic and extra curricular standards, with the rest applying as a \u2018stretch\u2019, though they may excel in one area, which may still make them a viable candidate (e.g. they are a superb musician, though they have merely above average grades). Assume all the qualified applicants also wrote good essays, have good references, etc. That maybe weeds out 15% of the applicants, so we still have a pool of 17,000.They then consider legacy (children of alumni) applicants, and admit those who qualify. There might be a few dozen of those each year. Let\u2019s say 100 make it in. That leaves 900 open seats, and 16,900 applicants.Now they\u2019ll fill openings they have in various campus activities, such as sports teams (this school was Div 3, so they weren\u2019t admitting athletes through a separate process), music, etc. This might bring in another 200. So now there are 700 open seats, and 16,700 remaining applicants. This is also where they\u2019d consider unique talents - for example a published author or acclaimed musician/artist, or someone who wrote a particularly excellent admissions essay.They then segment the remaining applicants into various groups, looking at their home geography, languages spoken, race/ethnicity, public vs. private high school, etc., with the intent of creating a diverse class. They have a formula they use to determine about how many students they want from each of these areas, and in theory, belonging to more than one group might raise your probability of acceptance by meeting multiple \u2018quotas\u2019 in one student. For example, they may say that they want 20% of the incoming class to be international students, or no more than 30% from within 200 miles of campus.At this point, they have to decide who to admit out of each of these groups. In some cases, there may be fewer applicants than the target, making it a high probability those applicants will be picked. For example, this school was in the northeast, so if you were from the Pacific Northwest, you might have a higher chance of getting in than if you were from Connecticut. However, in a lot of cases, there will still be a lot more applicants than spots. At that point, the VP said the staff basically orders pizza and picks names out of a hat till each group is filled. He said that was more fair, since everyone left was more or less equally qualified, than having the admissions staff try and micro-filter the applicants at that point, since their own personal biases would be more likely to surface at that point.So basically, in terms of factors you can control, there\u2019s little you can do, especially last minute. If you were asking this when you are 10, you might have the chance to develop into an elite athlete, artist, musician, writer, etc., but that\u2019s not something you can just choose to do when you\u2019re 16 and thinking about applying to college. Likewise, you can\u2019t control where you live, who your parents are, what race you belong to, etc. What you might be able to do, and again, not when you\u2019re applying to college but well before, is to work on a unique \u2018angle\u2019. What is going to make you stand out from the crowd of other qualified applicants? I\u2019m not an expert on what that would be, but if it would get you noticed as part of #4, above, it would increase your chances of individual consideration rather than being essentially a lottery pick later. In terms of a real-world view of this working (of course with the caveat of an n of 1), here\u2019s my own experience. I was an excellent student through high school, had top SAT scores, was a National Merit Scholarship recipient, etc. I was involved in many extra-curricular activities both through and outside of school. I was a musician, won state-level awards for public speaking, spoke two foreign languages, and worked several jobs too. I applied to 10 schools, including three Ivies, 3 top tier non-Ivies, 3 2nd tier \u2018safety schools\u2019, and the flagship state university where I lived. I was admitted to all 7 of the non-Ivies I applied to. I was admitted to one Ivy, which was in a location I wasn\u2019t thrilled with, waitlisted at my top choice but not ultimately accepted, and not accepted at the third. I certainly had the grades and background to be accepted to an Ivy, and I was accepted at one and considered at another, but in the end, I was only accepted by one of the three I applied to. I ended up going to one of the top-tier non-Ivies and have been very happy with that decision. ",

            "answer_text": "EVERYONE applying to colleges should read the link Shenandoah provided; 9 Key Components of Holistic Review. As someone who interviewed for many years for both Harvard and MIT, I cannot emphasize strongly enough how much that will help you, especially if you read it early in the process! To add my two cents: To get into one of the most selective / most prestigious schools (i.e. Ivies, MIT, Caltech, Stanford) you need a hook; something special about you that grabs the attention of the people reviewing your application. Remember that the reviewer is reading thousands of applications from valedictorians, people with perfect scores on the SAT or ACT, great letters of reference, 10+ AP classes, and spent two weeks on a summer program teaching English at an orphanage in Africa (and wrote their essay about that life-changing experience). So you need to have something different and something unique. Personally, my hooks for college admissions was that I had commercialized patents, was the lead author of two publications in international peer-reviewed medical journals, had served as an expert witness for the FAA in federal court, and had set a school record by going on 102 field trips in one school year. For Princeton, I had the additional hook of not fulfilling their admission requirements, but writing my essay about why I chose not to take a foreign language in high school and why they should ignore the fact that I didn\u2019t fulfill their admission requirements (yes, it worked). For medical school, my hook was that I was that I had found a loophole (since closed) in their policies and would not have a college degree by the time I started, and I refused to take the MCAT, and ignored their assigned essay topic and instead wrote about my experiences coaching little league baseball, and had D\u2019s in a couple of pre-med subjects (i.e. organic chemistry and biochem). OTOH, by that time I had more patents and more publications and references from some of their own professors. When I went in for the interview, the interviewer told me that they just had to meet someone with such an unusual application, and that they all were sure that there must be some connection between my essay on little league baseball and the assigned topic, but they just couldn\u2019t figure out the connection (there wasn\u2019t any connection; I was completing the application at 4am on the day it was due and just recycled an essay I had that had gotten an A+ from a tough grading English teacher)! Obviously, the hook doesn\u2019t need to be something as extreme and off-the-wall as my hooks, but it needs to be something tangible that demonstrates your passion and initiative. Examples from my years of interviewing students include the student with very high test scores but mediocre grades, who was working 40+ hours a week in the family business because of an injury to his father and still took the time to play football, the student who started a charity and without parental involvement, found corporate sponsors and successfully ran a fundraiser that raised over $20K in one night, someone who wrote an entire musical and directed it in summer community theatre, someone who started a business importing handcrafted goods made by women in rural communities in South America, with the profits returned to the women in these communities, etc. etc. Of course not everyone will have a \u2018hook\u2019 as dramatic as these, but the key is finding something unique about YOU that distinguishes you from everyone else!
