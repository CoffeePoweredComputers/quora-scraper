Even a small child who has been in school for a week would be able to recognize and speak to the roles of both parties. Your instructor has provided an embarrassingly simple question for you to answer. I expect your instructors are looking for original work, and not work plagiarized from the Quora community. Plagiarized work is particularly disgraceful when done by an educator. If you cannot do something as easy as answering this question yourself, the classroom environment is not for you. ",
