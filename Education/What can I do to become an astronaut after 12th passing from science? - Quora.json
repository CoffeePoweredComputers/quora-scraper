            "answer_text": "Astronaut Requirements Go through the stuff on the above link , its informative . I don't know much myself but I always dreamed of becoming an astronaut . So you have complete 12th standard .I suggest you do a professional degree like engineering ,science ,etc . Gain experience in the field or go do master's degree , doctorate . If you want to become a pilot , you need flying experience of more than 1000 hours on a jet plane . After this I don't know much but I think we have to apply to the space agency and they will conduct tests and physical examinations . Ask your parents ,google stuff ,talk with people and gather information .Work hard towards your goal . All the best. ",
