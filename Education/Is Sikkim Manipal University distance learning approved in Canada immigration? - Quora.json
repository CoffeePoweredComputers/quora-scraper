            "answer_text": "No.. Why because I have gone through a counseling session with few PR Visa consultants and the answer which I got from them has surprised me a bit. Sikkim Manipal University is actually Black Listed in Canada or you can say its not in WES list of Canada, specially when you are going for PR Visa eligibility. doesn\u2019t matter Distance Learning or Regular Classroom Course. The whole SMU is not in WES list. These answer might confirm you - Sikkim Manipal University + WES But still you can confirm from any Immigration Consultant for your surety or reference. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. SMU degrees are accepted for Canada Immigration. Many candidates prefer WES for ECA reports as the process is faster and cheaper. Instead of WES, you can try getting ECA report from other agencies who can accept this university. We have seen many positive results from our clients who are graduated from SMU.
