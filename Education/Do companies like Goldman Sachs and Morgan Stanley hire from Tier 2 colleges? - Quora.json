            "answer_text": "Yes they do. Obviously it depends on what tire-2 colleges mean. At the end of the day, I imagine you are referring to Goldman\u2019s and Morgan Stanley\u2019s investment banking division, not wealth management and other services. The key is to have strong grades in courses that matter, such as economics, finances and math. However, if you are an engineering major and have A+\u2019s in numerous classes in that subject, I am sure that will make you a very attractive candidate. In other words, you are a pro in excel and know how to analyze data and do modeling. Finally it does not hurt if you have gotten a medal at the Olympics either. Obviously I am exaggerating a little bit here but you get the point. With Goldman (which is the top, top investment bank), you really need any help to make your application stand out. By the way, I did get an interview for a Goldman summer internship between my junior and senior year of college. I was studying abroad in England at Oxford at the time so I had to fly back to New York for an interview. However, I did not get the internship. I was going to go into medicine anyway so the rejection did not hurt me too much. It is hard to get an internship at Goldman. ",

If you are not coming from a top school, you need to grab the bank\u2019s attention with your resume and your ability to network beyond comfortable standards. You want to make me - recruiter - want to sit down with you for an interview. Make me feel like I need to see if you are the guy that cannot get away. Remember, your resume will be given 8 seconds, tops, so how you portrait key aspects of your equity story (your brand, why I should hire you) in that piece of paper is key. Are you a stellar student? Have you done any competitive sport? Any entrepreneurship experience? Be smart about how you position yourself. Then, use any second and third degree contacts to network. I got into the interview process at GS because I decided to cold call the MD in charge of the process on a 24th December. I performed my elevator pitch to him on the phone and he found it funny and brave. Sometimes you just need to go the extra mile. ",
