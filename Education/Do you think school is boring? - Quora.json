            "answer_text": "I am a public secondary education teacher here in the Philippines and yes there is a tendency for public schools to be boring. Though i cannot set a scenario for the private or other forms, i would try to list the factors i have observed firsthandedly in my own local settings... A. Books produced by Deped are subpar to western standards. Quality was sacrificed for price which is ghastly. Students wouldn't carry nor read uninteresting material which is monochromatic and unifonted publications. Forgive my words but compare it to a K12 State of Texas public material book... Not even close.  B. Math and Science NAT scores usually lag behind, in spite being the most interesting subjects of all. The Department responds to the problem by undergoing lengthy time-sacrificing costly seminars to M&S teachers but to no avail. NAT results still drop. Why? Because that is not an answer. If the money spent was provided for Classroom and Facilities e.g. Visual Aids and Projectors to the least... should have been worth it. It's a manner of attacking the problem with a real situation and spending a lot of time with the real teachers not those who look at the numbers and preach seminars. C. Schools are even becoming soresights. Like mushrooms, new buildings sprout with prolific budgets. But did these buildings add to tasty architecture? Seldom. Just connect it there or here, sacrifice the playground for another 2-story hall or just close the gap and leave no room for air. Anyway, rooms have small fans fit for 50-60 students. The teacher provides... D. Teacher-factor. No... Sometimes... Or maybe never. It's quite the overkill. Out of the A to C representations I have made, the teacher now is faced the humongous task of making herself interesting to her students albeit the lack of the materials and situation. I have a child of mine also in a public school and thank goodness his teacher is one interesting woman to all her pupils' delight. Thank goodness indeed. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course school is boring.  Like any other activity we undertake hoping to meet an important goal, education is boring.  We would almost always rather do anything else than the boring tasks required to achieve our overarching goals. Note:  I have been teaching for 20 years and I can assure you that school is never, ever, ever going to be as entertaining as any activity you would prefer to do.  It wouldn't matter if it involved playing iPad games and watching live juggling shows every day-- you would still find it boring.  Just like your future adult job at least sometimes. That's life. ",

But when I recalled things which were most interesting and most memorable, I found the only thing I could clearly remember happened in school, where my classmates copied my homework and the teacher was always dull. It's intriguing, isn't it? We feel school is boring, but at the same time we get entertainment form school. Going outside with friends or playing computer games at home can also bring pleasure to us, but it's the entertainment from school that we can never forget.  ",

The skill you develop to tackle the boredom, manage to pass somehow - or even perhaps you succeed! - is the most important thing a school can give - not merely the subjects. I'm old, and have seen people who don't get used to educate themselves, falter and lost. They break easily under life's hardships. Seeing that now (at my age), your opinion becomes mundane. ",

You know about your field of interest. You have you first crush in your school. You get to know a part of you in your school. You experience the part independence when you start going to school by your own during the school time etc. In short my school life was far more than awesome especially my 10th and 10+2. This is my perception that school life is the awesome life you have. It can't be boring. ",

I can say school life is best because there will no mental stress. School life helps us to learn everything in all aspects which helps to cope-up with next parts of life. This is my view.
