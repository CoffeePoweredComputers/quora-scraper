            "answer_text": "That depends on how you learn. If you learn well by simply reading, you might go for a textbook or websites. If you search \u201cQuantum Physics Textbook\u201d online, you'll have no trouble finding one on Amazon.com or a similar site. You can even find PDF files of entire physics textbooks online for free. Here are a few: https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/JamesBinney/qb.pdfhttp://simons.hec.utah.edu/NewUndergradBook/Chapter1.pdfhttp://www.mie.uth.gr/ekp_yliko/QM_Engineers.pdfNow if you're more of a visual learner like me, you'll probably want video explanations. edX is a great resource for this. You can find free online courses on there for many different subjects, not just limited to physics. If you struggle with any specific concepts, just search for them on YouTube or a similar site. Jumping from geometry to quantum physics is quite a stretch. Quantum physics \u2014 and all of physics \u2014 involves a lot of math. I know I reccomended some pretty hefty PDFs and textbooks, but quantum physics is not just something you can skim through and understand. Quantum Physics does not come easy to most people as it is not at all intuitive, but I encourage you to keep trying and you will get it eventually. I will end with this: \"If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.\" -Richard Feynman ",
