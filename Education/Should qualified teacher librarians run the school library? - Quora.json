            "answer_text": "In the school district where I taught for 40 years\u2026.I have not seen a librarian for almost 10 years. A library tech runs the room. Our books are being replaced by computers. !5 years ago I went from half time to full time to cover for our librarian who was out on medical leave. I spent countless hours bringing myself up to speed\u2026learned how to order books relevant to our students. I professionally corresponded with others who lived, and breathed their area of expertise. They were eased out of the library and back into the classroom because their skills\u2026.although valued\u2026..could not get past the cost cutting hatchets. For the last 10 years, I have seen what underfunding education has done in one of the best provinces (I live in Canada) for valuing a good education. As my generation retires\u2026\u2026I see people who try mightily hard\u2026.but when you are given beer\u2026you cannot offer champagne. The young teachers are getting burnt out quickly\u2026.if they want to last in the profession\u2026.they will have to lower their expectations. I just read today that our organization is taking a poll regarding class size in our schools. Not only have the number of students per class increased, but their learning needs are so complex and the support in the classroom so lacking\u2026that teachers are reporting classroom conditions to be very poor. And this with a government who is generally supportive of teachers and education. Things are going to get very tough out there\u2026.Alberta cannot be an island unto itself. What we are going through must be happening in other school divisions across the land. Honestly, my children are grown, I have no grandchildren yet, but if I had young children I would be very worried for their education. I do not think that two working parents will be able to provide the support that classroom teachers are going to need if they want to keep a worldwide education system going. I hope I am not overreacting\u2026.but I see a dark age coming\u2026.and there are not too many voices sounding the alarm. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the circumstances. Is the school willing to budget for modern and effective electronic and print resources, or is it going to use the library as a dumping ground for obsolete materials? Are the faculty and administration going to treat the librarian seriously as a qualified information professional? In other words , for example, are they going to send him or her students for help in researching and documenting research papers and other projects? Are they going to consult with him or her regarding the needs of learning difference or second language learners? If not , than the status quo is perfectly adequate. ",
