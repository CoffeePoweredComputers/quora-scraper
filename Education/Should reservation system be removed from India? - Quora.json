            "answer_text": "NEVER! (I'm purely an OC.) About 2/3rds of Indians are the SCs,OBCs and STs. Many think that people belonging to these categories are the luckiest but they don't know the truth. Each and every employer is an OC. An SC or ST man can easily get a seat among the top colleges. But ultimately what one wants is not the seat but the job!! If it's a private job, in case you don't know, such SCs and STs are discriminated to a very large extent. When they attend for an interview for a private job, the interviewers simply reject the candidate if he/she is an SC or ST person without even asking questions. My mom knows all the pain. While she was studying at Andhra University (Visakhapatnam), teachers used to sarcastically discourage such SC or ST students. They get the private jobs only if they excel at academics. And if you talk about government jobs, well such SC or ST students are blessed enough by the reservation to get them. But I have seen many comments such `Even if an SC or ST student writes nothing in the paper, he/she gets selected\u00b4, really?! And in case you are of the open category, don't forget that since time immemorial till the 20th century, such SCs\u2019 and STs\u2019 forefathers had suffered mercilessly in our forefathers\u2019 hands without any fault. But the forefathers of your fellow SC or ST candidates didn't rebel against the injustice. While they were able to bear such an endless pain for so many centuries, we OCs are not able to bear it even for a century?! Our pain is nothing in front of their's. Also, they are the SCs who are the farmers. Are we so selfish that we don't care even if they have to continue to suffer till the Universe ends but we must be prosperous and egoistic at all times? I know that there are some SC and ST people who are rich but still have support from the reservation system, but they are negligible in number when compared to the rest of their people who are extremely poor. Let even such people know the essence of wealth. If some OC person became very poor (say and is also very rare and negligible when compared to the OC's population) due to some carelessness (although one must not let this happen to oneself), the OCs will get to face the bitter conditions of poverty for the first time. The SCs and STs are extremely poor when compared to us. Also, it is a general opinion in the country that if one studies in an IIT, NIT, IIIT, AIIMS or other topmost colleges, one can assure oneself of having a high- earning job in the future. So, with this hope, the parents of the SC and STs students take the burden of heavy loans and join their children in the extremely high-fees taking coaching institutes. Suppose, one among us couldn't get a seat in a top college. We can still have hope of studying abroad and join normal colleges; not worrying about the expenditure of crores of money. But what about those, whose all properties are given as collateral for the loans of paying the coaching institutes. They have no property to sell, nor any jewelry. I guess such people even sell the mangalsutr for paying the coaching fees! So if they don't get the seat in a top college, they have no other hope of living and perhaps even suicide! How pitiful! Hence, the government pities on them. What about us? Also, since the SCs, OBCs, and STs have been under both extreme physical and mental torture since millenniums, they may not be able to compete in today\u2019s world. Hence, they need support. This point also beats the argument that reservation should be based on financial status and not on caste. If one among us is poor, then we may borrow money from our relatives or friends to provide the basic financial support. That\u2019s it! We have brains or muscles fit for competing, and then everything goes well for us. But for them, their whole generation itself is poor, then how will they manage to get money? If you argue that they have many modern ways to get money, don\u2019t ignore the fact that the fees of the coaching institutes is in many lakhs of rupees and not few thousand rupees. Please accept what I have wrote with an open heart and begin loving everyone. May Sri Ram bless you! P.S.: None have any problem for the reservation of female candidates, do they? ",

            "answer_text": "No. (Please read the whole answer with patience before you comment). First and foremost, I was against the reservation system till I got to know about it deeply. Even after it, I'm not completely against it and not completely for it (I do not \u2018completely\u2019 support it). So to understand whether or not it should be \u2018removed\u2019, let\u2019s get to the root of the issue. \u201cWhat were the reservations for?\u201d is the basic question that needs to be answered! So particularly it is for the upliftment of the backward classes (A very standard answer), but do you know why were the reservations allowed in the first place? Poona Pact - Wikipedia This pact was the starting. The founding fathers of our country were faced with the dilemma of reservation and separate electorates ( Not the only dilemma ofcourse). They'd to choose one of them. They chose reservations. Why was there a demand for reservation? Let me suggest you a very wonderful book:  The book has 5-6 experiences about Dr B.R. Ambedkar sir's life. I'll share an experience in brief, He'd returned to India after studying abroad (Let me tell you he's the first person from Asia to obtain a Doctorate Degree in Economics and he was a well respected person abroad). Now comes the shocking part, he was denied to stay in a hotel (A parsi hotel) because of his caste (Mahar). He\u2019d to take up a false name to stay but as soon as the Parsi community realised that he was not a Parsi and an untouchable, he was given a death threat and was asked to vacate ASAP. There he came to realise that an untouchable for one community is an untouchable for all. Imagine the same thing with you, you\u2019ve earned double degrees in economics from London School of Economics and Columbia University. You've earned a name in the international circle. Back home, you are not allowed something because of your caste. Wow! Describe your feelings.  Dr Ambedkar Sir in London. Hence, he had to raise the demand for reservations. This is to all of the people who criticise Ambedkar Sir's decision for reservations. (That too for 10 yrs, our Constitution is amended to extend the reservation by 10 yrs, everytime)  It is very simple to make a meme and write bad about him while you sit in a comfortable room. (You don't even have the right to write bad about him, he was the one whose experience came into play while framing the constitution. Because him we are the largest democracy) The reservation system in India is attributed to accomodate the diverse population of India. You've to agree with me on the fact that the cultural diversity of India is large. You might say that U.S. has no reservation and hence it is a super power but that is bullshit! If you've read about the American History, you might know America has expanded since the late 19th century and had benefitted greatly due to the instability in Europe (early 20th century) while India was under the British rule. World War I - Wikipedia World War II - Wikipedia So don't try to compare our nation with other countries. (Even with Bangladesh) You might conclude, \u201cOh! These things are of the past, India is modern now. People don't care much about it\" Dalit Boys Beaten, Paraded Nude For Swimming In Well In Maharashtra Mob Burns Homes Of 2 Dalit Politicians In Rajasthan, Day After Bharat Bandh https://deccanchronicle.com/videos/dalit-farmer-set-ablaze-over-land-dispute-in-bhopal.html Wow! But but, let me complete the whole thing. But is the present reservation system justified? NO! It is not. Reservations should be for the Socially and Economically Backward Classes and the cutoffs should be moderated. For ex- if the Gen Category cutoff is 90, then the cutoff for SEBC should be around 70-75. The main idea of reservation was to compensate for the fact that they couldn't have access to water or proper study material and other basic ammenities. By bringing reservation, the government just ensures that they too get a chance to study in best of the institutes and get best of the jobs. But the main drawback here is, we do nothing for their mental development. The sad part is some politicians have used this to their benefit i.e. Vote Bank Politics. You may ask what if I don't get a seat in a desired exam due to the reservation policy and some other reserved category guy gets it. Well I'll say \u2018been there, felt that\u2019 (I am a General Category Student). But honestly, a person shouldn't concentrate much on what the other guy gets (reserved category), his/her aim is to get 1 seat out of a 100 (Assume 100 seats) You might've observed that some guys from reserved category too top the Common Rank List (CRL). Do they focus much on the reservation policy? Even general category students top the CRL, do you think they rant about reservations (during their preparation period)? No right? Then why should you? EDIT: Guys, \u201cunderstand\u201d the answer. We cannot remove reservations from India. It might seem theoretically appealing but in practical life, I don\u2019t think it will happen. But yes, we can think of taking it out in phases which again is based on our lawmakers. I do not think any honourable Member of Parliament would think of it. ",
