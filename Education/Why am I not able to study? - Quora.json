            "answer_text": "You know what your problem is? You overthinking about your excellence in past. You comparing your performance from past one. And, that making you feel crazy and scared for the performance. You failed in a test miserably and you thinking what if I\u2019ll fail again in next test. How people will judge you? Infact, how you\u2019ll digest your failure? So, you over thinking! Stop it. Just think about you were an average student in past but now you are a bright student. You getting good grades. Now, will you compare yourself with the past version\u2019s performance? Nah! You won\u2019t. You\u2019ll give credits of your good performance to your improved efforts and hardwork. You\u2019ll say that you became more focused and retention ability improved. You\u2019ll say that you actually studied hard to get such grades. So, you not mentioning your past anywhere. So, why you bothering about past now? Probably, you just need to be bit more focused and put little more efforts in understanding things. It\u2019s not fair to say that \u201cI used to read a page in 2 minutes but can\u2019t read 5 pages in two minutes.\u201d Understand the size of your goal increased and so you need to expand your focus and efforts as well. It should be proportionately. What if you didn\u2019t failed in past. Success is never guranteed. At times you fail. But those failures shouldn\u2019t scare you. It should improve your abilities. So, its okay if you failed. Make an improved try next time. Remember a test is never to score marks. It is just to let you know what actually learned. So, focus on learning and grades will improve itself. ",

            "answer_text": "It happens when your mind is engaged in different other issues. Well, it happens to all of us. So you need not to worry about. You need to put your attention on study more time. Once the reason is identified, let us discuss how to narrow down your mind to study. If you try to forget, then you will not be successful. Because,by putting effort to forget ,you are getting more entangled with it. Let the thoughts go away by itself. It will happen ,if you practice meditation on a regular basis. You may do it by sitting position or lying down on bed, preferably after evening. You need not concentrate at any point. Rather allow the mind to go anywhere. Let it stay at one point. Then watch it . Let the mind move another point .Just watch it . Please do not analyse why mind flies away. Just follow it wherever it goes, without any analysis. As you continue, you will find the calmness in your mind. Then you will be able to put your attention on study. ",
