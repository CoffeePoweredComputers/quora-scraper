            "answer_text": "There are two reasons. First, it costs less. It\u2019s much cheaper, easier and faster to build a mobile network than to dig a fixed one in the ground. Digging costs $50/ foot in the US when you add everything in. If you have to dig 100 feet/ customer on average, it\u2019s $5000/ customer. Building a 4G network might cost you $100/ head of population to buy spectrum and build the network on the other hand. Second reason is competition. Fixed network is usually just the telco incumbent and maybe a cable company. Mobile will have three or four competing operators. Obviously this pushes down prices. ",
