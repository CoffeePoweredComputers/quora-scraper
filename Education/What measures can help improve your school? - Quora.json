            "answer_text": "The best way to improve a school is by hiring outstanding teachers. And when you have great teachers, and take care of those teachers, you can count on the fact that they will take care of the students. But this is a long term proposition, so what can you do to help improve a school, now? I would start by assessing what\u2019s going on at the school. I would ask questions to students, teachers, parents, and administrators. What do they like about the school? What do they not like about the school? What would they change if they could? In addition, I would recommend coming up with some school-wide initiatives that help set an overall culture for the school. Determine 5 core values for the school and post those far and wide. Come up with daily quotes and word of the days to help enrich students. Another great way to improve a school is bring students on board. When students are involved in the process, you\u2019d be amazed at the ideas they will come up with. They have the best perspective and providing them with some ownership will enable you to tap into this. Good luck with your worthy endeavor. ",
