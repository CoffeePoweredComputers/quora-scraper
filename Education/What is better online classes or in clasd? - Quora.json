            "answer_text": "Personally, I feel like online classes are only good for subjects that I\u2019d find easy enough to take on my own. It all really depends on how you learn and what you find best for you. Advantages to sitting in a class vs something online is you\u2019re physically there and hearing the information being given to you. Also, you get to help/interact with your peers and if you\u2019re a hands-on kind of learner, it\u2019s best if you go to school for this rather than online classes. I know online classes sound great because they\u2019re online and not at school, they don\u2019t seem as worthy of the \u2018hype\u2019 I see kids my age giving them. ",
