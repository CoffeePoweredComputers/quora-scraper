            "answer_text": "I want simply to note this is a more complicated question than it might seem. Traditionally, teachers did not consider how learners develop and learn, except in a commonsense way. They were given a book and a pedagogy. Developmental questions are done by professors and psychiatric experts at a much higher level. Teachers should not be put in the position of doing all these other jobs. Don't teachers have enough to do? All right, put them in charge of complicated instructional subtleties. Yes, that's the answer! You see here signs of the rot that runs through K-12. Here's the dirty, not-so-little secret. Schools are full of dysfunctional, really stupid theories and methods (sight-words, Common Core math, constructivism, cooperative learning, no memorization, and many more). Because of all that, students do not learn very quickly. Instead of getting rid of the garbage and making the students learn quickly, somehow the blame is slowly shifted to the teachers. The ideological schemers at the top don't get any credit for the damage they do. No, teachers get all the credit. Isn't that clever? (Learning styles and Individualized Education Plans are not mentioned but that's the underlying basis for this question. There seems to be always this effort to fragment a class, to divide the students up into little groups, to create multiple courses in each classroom. But almost everybody learns the same way. That is, the differences are small compared to the similarities.) Now, notice how the question casually assumes that teachers are supposed to be doing this great array of things that they never did 50 years ago. Schools constantly evaluate, using tools that are probably chosen at the state level. There are psychologists on duty. Assessment and evaluation is big business, and probably a great waste of money. But that's not bad enough. The educrats want to suggest that the teachers are not doing enough. Humbug. They are already spread too thin. That's why there's so much turnover. Now consider the implications of asking teachers to do too much. They will have less time to master their fields. I suspect that's what educrats are really after. They like schools to be semi-successful. ",

            "answer_text": "First, teachers are taught how to teach using the three common learning modalities: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic tactile. If a student does not do well in a normal classroom, that student is assessed, and if appropriate, placed in special education classes where additional teaching methods are employed. Studying how students learn is a key reason future teachers must take education classes. ",
