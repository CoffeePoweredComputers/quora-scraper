            "answer_text": "Here's a new perspective for you. Not just with Goldman. In fact in ANY transaction in life. Think first about what you can do for the other person. What do you have to offer? Are you a hard worker? Diligent? Are you able to understand quickly what they need, and then figure out the best way to get there? What makes you valuable to them? Only then are you ready to ask, what is that really worth to them? Lots of people will work hard. Not so many can learn quickly what's needed. Even fewer can go the next step and figure out the best way to get that done, to innovate, do things in new and better ways. After that, once you are clear on how you add value, it's easy to decide what you can ask in return. Knowing what you have to offer is also the best way to get the confidence to get what you are worth in return. Make sense?! ",

            "answer_text": "I would not worry about that right now. Do the very best you can while you are in school. Upon graduation get 3 - 5 years of work experience as an investment banker and then see if they will hire you, if that is still what you want to do. That is probably the easiest way to go for you, although you may not want to make the move if your career is going well where you are currently employed as an investment banker. ",
