            "answer_text": "Answered: How do you learn math well? There are many ways to \u201clearn math\u201d. For some people, learning math is just about memorizing some formulas and learning to apply them. I will explain what I think is a good way to learn math properly and well. Think, don\u2019t memorize. Be skeptical. Try to understand so well that you can explain it to yourself and to others. Think deeply of simple things. Find a good teacher/mentor if possible. Think, don\u2019t memorize: If someone like a teacher repeats a phrase like \u201cd=rt, distance = rate times time\u201d, don\u2019t just passively listen and believe it. Think about it logically each time, and rederive this each time you need it. I\u2019ve never liked teachers who constantly repeat an acronym for a formula in the hopes you will remember it, when you should seek to understand the underlying idea, and \u201crederive\u201d (re-come up with) the formula each time. Be skeptical: Don\u2019t blindly trust any formula. Always wonder: Is it true? If it seems true after some testing, then: why is it true? Maybe the formula is true for all the integers from 1 to 12. Be skeptical. Maybe it breaks down later. If you\u2019re ever given a formula sheet, try to understand why each formula is true. Formulas aren\u2019t things to memorize. They are things to understand. They were developed by someone very very human. Humans make mistakes, sometimes even in the copy-writing stage. Perhaps someone mistranscribed an otherwise correct formula. Perhaps everyone else in the world who checked the formula was wrong. Don\u2019t blindly trust the work of previous mathematicians, if you want to learn math well. I was on math team in middle and high school, and sometimes we were given formulas without them being explained to us. This-the lack of understanding of a formula, or deep understanding of a formula, always bugged me. If I didn\u2019t understand why the formula was true, or if I understood, but not well enough to the point where I could explain it to someone else who doesn\u2019t understand it in a way they can understand it, as well as convince them it is indeed true/correct, then I am not satisfied that I understand it on a deep enough level, and I will struggle to understand it better. Even if it is a \u201csimple\u201d fact like why (\u22122)\u00d7(\u22122)=4 (why two negatives multiplied together make a positive, and why is that positive number exactly 2\u00d72?) (this ties into \u201cthink deeply of simple things\u201d) Once you understand something, practice explaining to others or yourself (or your imaginary younger self who still does not understand), if you can\u2019t do it, then, while you may understand completely yourself, you can still improve your understanding to a level where you can in fact help someone else understand too. For instance, if someone learning math uses reasoning of spoken words to understand math, can you help this type of learner understand using only English words? This is a challenge, converting math conceptual understanding to people who want to gain math conceptual understanding from trying to understand in English words instead of, let\u2019s say, symbolically, for algebra. This process of trying to understand, understanding, trying to understand better, convincing yourself of the correctness of some mathematical fact, explain to your imaginary younger self, helping others understand, is a constant struggle. I would go so far as to say, be skeptical of everything you are told in math class. If you are not, and you fall into the trap of blindly believing and accepting a bunch of formulas, algorithms, theorems, that some math teacher told you, you miss the whole point of mathematics, which is to think, understand, and help others understand. Find a good teacher/mentor: This can be tremendously helpful if you are struggling to understand at any point in your math-learning career. It can be helpful even if you can do well at some local math tournaments but don\u2019t understand so well that you can communicate to and help others understand. It\u2019s hard to find a good mentor, but if you do, don\u2019t miss your opportunity to learn from them! Learning to learn from others is also an important skill to develop (and is one that often isn\u2019t exercised in a standard U.S. math class) At some point, you have to go past struggling to understand K-12 maths and struggle to understand other people\u2019s work in mathematics, if you want to become a mathematics professor. Once you can go through the process of learning and explaining that I described above, you can tackle the challenge of learning to solve problems you haven\u2019t seen before and learning to write proofs. (I\u2019ll skip mentioning this phase too much) Once you\u2019ve learned to write a variety of proofs, you can finally get past the rigorous stage of your math-learning career and hand-waive some things that you know you can go back and prove later if you are doing a long argument for a proof. The most important piece of advice I listed above is to Be Skeptical. A healthy skepticism is good for a mathematician, and it is good in real life too, when listening to facts discovered in science and stories people tell. Mathematics is a very social endeavor, and I believe learning math should be a very social endeavor too. It\u2019s not easy to learn math properly, and I\u2019m not sure the extensive process I described above is for everyone. Good luck and have fun in understanding math to your personal level of satisfaction! ",

            "answer_text": "Further below, I will answer your question, but first some background: Five decades ago, I aced Advanced Math in high school, and eventually got a BS and an MS in the 70\u2019s. At ages 64\u201366, I took all these (university-accredited) courses again at Central Carolina Technical College. My overall average Math average was 99.77% after five courses: 100%, College Algebra; 100.4%, Calculus One; 98.5%, Calculus Two; 100%, Probability and Statistics; 100.25%, College Trigonometry. How did I get almost 100% in Advanced Math courses: I had an unfair advantage. I spent MORE time on homework than I ever did in high school or while getting my BS and MS degrees.The more time you spend on homework, the better you will do in class.I always read the chapter and/or did at least some of the relevant Study Plan questions in MyMathLab BEFORE the lecture.In this way, I had a better idea of what the professor was going to talk about, so that I could ask questions about things that looked confusing.Whenever I wasn\u2019t sure about how to solve a problem, I looked for similar problems in MyMathLab\u2019s \u201cStudy Plan\u201d section, and used the \u201cHelp Me Solve This\u201d option to see the problem solved step-by-step. Sometimes, I saved my questions for after class.After doing several similar problems, I\u2019d go back to the homework part of the software and do the homework problem.If I felt I was weak with any type of problem, I\u2019d keep clicking SIMILAR PROBLEM until I got better.I was always early to class, and I was never in a hurry to leave afterward. It was amazing how quickly everyone else left.When a doctor\u2019s appointment was at the same time as my class, I asked the doctor\u2019s secretary to move my appointment to a more convenient time (if it was not life threatening).I did the homework as soon as possible after class. If I missed any problem, even one little part, I kept doing the problem until I got it completely correct, and when allowed, did each problem several more times.I never allowed myself to get less than 100% on the homework, which was possible because each problem allowed unlimited tries.I did not bite off more than I could chew. I knew that I had other obligations in my daily life, so I planned enough time during my day to actually do my studying.The mistake I made at Indiana University (\u201869\u2013\u201975) was over-extending myself. I took too many classes and had too many hours at work, so there was never enough time for homework.I did my best to go back to the Study Plan section and do additional problems, even in the sections that the homework did not cover, so that I could learn things that were not going to be on the test. I believe that this actually helped me understand the easier material better.For example, I mastered 37 out of 52 Study Plan quizzes that were available in chapter 10, and got 100% on all the quizzes in four sections of the chapter (as shown by the hats). I did not get class credit for doing this, but it certainly helped me get better grades on tests and quizzes. (We did not cover sections 10.4 or 10.6 in class, so I did not try to get 100% in those sections though I did look at some of that material (it was HARD compared to the rest of the semester).Because this was the last chapter we covered during the semester (Trig covered chapters 5, 6, 7 and 10), I spent lots of time reviewing for the final, explaining those zeroes. So these 37 perfect (optional) quizzes might represent two-to-four weeks of study.If I had been taking MORE courses at the same time, I would have restricted the amount of TV or music that I allowed myself to enjoy. (I actually built that into my schedule, but required myself to study while watching TV). BUT when quizzes were approaching, I studied with the TV turned OFF.Before the Midterm and before the Final Exam, I made sure to solve every sample question on the sample questions handout. For example, for the Trig Final, we had a sheet of 104 questions, out of which 40 similar questions might be on the final.The night before major exams and quizzes, I made sure to get plenty of sleep, and ate a good meal each test morning.Finally, during quizzes and tests, I did not STOP after I finished the test.I went back and double-checked my work, usually solving the problems with a different method than I had used the first time.I learned NOT to just look at my scratch paper to verify that I did it right, because THAT cost me points on one quiz.If I made a mistake on my scratch paper, I learned to cross it out just in case I had a teacher who took off points for intermediate mistakes. (I lost one point on a Calc One quiz because of this). Otherwise, I would have had 100.5% that semester.Sometimes, I worked backward from the answer to the question to see that it matched. This trick alone brought my overall average up by about five percentage points, as there were some quizzes or tests that doing it a second time helped me find an error the first time.When a question was multiple-choice, I would sometimes graph all four answer equations to double-check which equation was the correct answer, but usually I had already figured out the answer.I hope these strategies give you some ideas for the future. P.S. Here was my grade BEFORE the Final Exam (after the teacher deducted my two lowest quiz grades (94 and 100) and my lowest homework grade (100).  The final exam brought my grade down to 100.25%, darn it. ",

            "answer_text": "You could hire a competent tutor. There are a lot of commercial businesses set up to help. I know that a Sylvan Learning Center, and other companies like them, have very good diagnostic tests to find what part of math is the problem for you and then they can help you with that. Unfortunately, it is not cheap. I saw a person I knew on facebook who has a PhD in math and teaches at a local community college. He was highlighted for being a teacher who the students said was very well liked because he was willing to help struggling students. You have to network (like everything else) and find yourself some help. You can run an ad in the paper, Go to a college math department and see if a graduate assistant could tutor you for a little cash, there is the Kahn academy which is free and online. I looked at the presentation on geometry (which is how it got started, the guy was helping a nephew who was struggling. If you don\u2019t know the story, Bill Gates thought the idea of free education anywhere in the world online was a great idea, flew him to his HQ, discussed the situation and wound up giving Kahn some considerable financial backing and a staff of four paid assistants.) Many school districts have lists of substitute teachers they call on to fill in. You might ask a school if they know a sub for math they could give your phone number to if they were interested. You can post your contact info on bulletin boards anywhere simply explaining you need help in x-level math and maybe how much an hour you can afford to pay or barter. I do not know what your particular difficulty is but if it is conceptual, there was a company that sold kits to teach math concepts with colored sticks and blocks. You have plenty of options. You have to go out there and get some help if you can\u2019t do it yourself. Math is like many things such as magic: it\u2019s easy when you know the trick. ",

            "answer_text": "Getting good grades in Maths is quite simple. If you are aspiring for better grades, you have to commit yourself to some actions.At first you need to sharpen basic calculation tools in Maths . These basic tools are addition subtraction, multiplication and division. Though they appear simple to do, but they are not. More over, there are ways to get mastery over them. Learn them.Apart from this , you must learn multiplication table, square table and prime numbers. Be good at LCM ,HCF, fraction and decimal.After sharpening basic tools in Maths, you need to take help of an expert. He or she will help you understand the concepts of Maths easily.Don't try to learn everything yourself. Trial and error is not the best way. You will take too much time to learn it.Again, there is a sequence of learning anything. That sequence must be maintened. For example one must learn addition and then subtraction.Having to much knowledge and getting good grades in Maths are two different things. In order to score high grades , you have to focus on important questions. Important questions are based on the main theme of a lesson.Important questions are not necessarily the difficult ones.After understanding of the concepts, one should do sufficient practice to enhance the speed.While practising you have to strike the right balance between speed and accuracy.First go for accuracy and then for speed .Make numbers your friends. Play with them . You will feel comfortable while using them.Identify your weak areas in Maths, take time and work on them .Learning is a gradual process, you may take time. Have patience.Everyday you need to challenge yourself. Doing difficult sums means accepting the challenge. Enjoy the challenge.Learn the art of simplification in Maths. Maths is not about making anything complex, it is all about simplifying the things.Good luck Maths enthusiasts. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics can be a nightmare to some students whereas fun for some others. It is basically because of the same reason. You either get it completely right or entirely wrong. It\u2019s not like a language subject wherein there can be a maybe. And that is also the reason that it is definitely possible to score 100/100 marks in maths.How can you score 100/100 marks in maths: People say that only the students with a rational bent of mind understand mathematics. But it is not so. Mathematics is subject which helps in developing a rational thinking and a logical approach in students. A student cannot be made to fall in love with mathematics overnight but following are some tips to improve your score in maths and even help you achieve full marks in maths. During Exam Preparations: Make a separate register for theorems, formulae and methodologies: Maths is all about theorems, concepts and formulae, and it\u2019s always wise to keep them handy. You can read and brush them up even when you are on the move and this practice also comes to rescue when you are having a last minute revision.Solve Problems yourself: Whereas it is good to go through and understand different types of problems, it is very important to solve them yourself. Knowing theories and concept is necessary but to learn their application is inescapable if you want to score full marks in maths. You have to solve each by yourself, minimum 3-4 times over the course of time.Understand your syllabus: Understanding your portions and the weightage attached to different sections helps you in deciding how much time to dedicate to each section. For example, if you know that there will be just a 5 marks question from a particular section, you do not have to dedicate a week practicing those sums.Practice Papers: Practice papers are a good way to mentally prepare yourself for what you are going to get in the exams. The more you solve these, more confidence you will gain towards your achievement of scoring the highest score. Also, it is important to understand that you need not wait for your syllabus to finish before you start solving these. As you go on finishing different sections, you can find the respective questions from the sample papers and solve them side by side.Address your problem areas outright: There may be times when you are solving a sample paper and you come across some questions which you cannot solve. While it is convenient to keep them aside to clear later, but over a period of time these accumulate and become a burden for you.Time Management: It is not easy to be a maths champion. You must take out some time every day to solve mathematical problems in order to score 100/100 marks in maths, even when you have dedicated a particular day to some other subject. This can range from a quick half an hour of going through your register of formulae and methodologies, or dedicating couple of hours to solve sample papers.During Examination: Clean Paper and margin: The cleaner, the better. You should keep in mind that the examiner needs to understand each and every step how you have arrived at an answer and unfortunately he does not have much time to dedicate on a single problem. Keep your paper free from cutting and overwriting, and draw clean margins to do the rough work. A clean paper also reflects an uncluttered mind.Marks are in the steps: whenever you go through a solution and understand its rationale, pay special focus on how the different steps progress. You cannot cram answers and achieve full marks in maths, so just paying heed to the figures in the examples is a waste of your time. Instead you must learn the various steps involved. Remember that even if you attempt and write some steps, you will definitely secure some marks for each step, irrespective of whether your answer is correct or incorrect.Figures and Graphs: Figures and graphs can fetch you easy marks if made with a little concentration. For this, keep a ruler which has sharp and smooth side and a pencil which is well sharpened. These, if you have practised well, constitute the simplest parts of the exam and you can aim to finish this as soon as you get your paper.Finish familiar questions first: Read the question paper thoroughly before you start solving the questions. While it is natural to be stuck on the questions which you find unfamiliar but you must remember that you have to finish your examination in a stipulated time. In order to achieve 100/100 marks in maths, you much strategize to first finish the questions you know and then move on to the unfamiliar questions.Revise, revise, and revise: Once you are through with writing the paper, take a deep breath and revise it thoroughly. In the first revision check whether you have attempted all questions or not. This is important because you might not have solved the questions in a given order. In the second revision check the steps and the rest. If time still remains, go through the sheet once again!Thank you!!",

            "answer_text": "1. Be active \u2022 Take responsibility for your own learning \u2022 Process the material by doing summaries, or paraphrasing or even explaining in a simpler language (in contrast to just copying the class) \u2022 Read 20 minutes of class, then try to give its main points out of memory, with your course closed \u2022 Make challenges out of boring classes (e.g. how fast can you do one chapter? Can you find inaccuracies in the text? ) \u2022 Use a highlighter (still quite a passive practice though, it\u2019s better to write) \u2022 Teach others \u2022 Take notes as you read \u2022 If you are not having difficulties, then you are learning inefficiently. Increase the cognitive strain. 2. Study regularly \u2022 Memory works best when the material is repeatedly studied, over increasingly distant periods of time. \u2022 Ideally, a single piece of information should be repeated over the following intervals: After 20 minutes, a day, a week, a month, two months \u2022 Study at least six days a week \u2022 It's better to study 10 times one hour, than 10 hours straight. 3. Go to class \u2022 Take notes, constantly \u2022 Write continuously to stay focused, as well as to learn to write fast for tests \u2022 Pledge to make your notes public so they have to be of high quality. Do the same for your summaries, and announce them before you do them, so you have peer pressure to set yourself at work \u2022 Start focusing 5 minutes before the class begins, by trying to summarize the last class in your head, or better still, to the guy sitting beside you \u2022 Don't read class notes before class (otherwise you will be bored, get passive and waste your time) 4. Work hard, rest hard \u2022 Predefine your work and rest periods \u2022 Break down your work into two-hour blocs with large breaks (about half an hour) in between. \u2022 Each bloc should be divided into 25 minutes of work, with 5-minute rest periods \u2022 Use a (physical) timer to limit your pauses \u2022 On a break, go outside, open the windows, socialize, clean up - don't go on your phone and avoid watching videos \u2022 Allow for some quality 'me-time' in advance, and write it down ahead, so you work with it in mind \u2022 Pay attention to having a stable and restful sleep, from 22h to 6h, every single day \u2022 Work in the morning with a two-hour block before classes start \u2022 Keep a positive mindset towards the class \u2022 Plan your day according to your typical energy levels (e.g. high in the morning, low at 14h,...) \u2022Separate between work that requires focus or not 5. Use memory techniques (if required - I never had to) \u2022 If you don't want to study, it's not going to work - you need to have an interest and motivation \u2022 Make sense of the material \u2022 Make visual associations in your mind \u2022 If you have lots of by heart material to study, learn from advanced memory techniques books - it's the best time investment possible if you study medical school or biology for instance 6. Plan your study \u2022 Plan each day the night before, limiting yourself to six objectives (Ivy Lee) \u2022 Don't plan hour by hour unless you're at an advanced level - if you don't keep up with your schedules, then they are pointless \u2022 Take yesterday's 6 objectives, and start with the first one up until completion, and don't touch the others. Go to the next one. Repeat. \u2022 Study what you like first, then what's hard, then what's easy, then what's boring 7. Set up a clinical work environment \u2022 Set aside part of a room, or even a full room, dedicated for study \u2022 Make it agreeable and personal with posters and photographs \u2022 Everything should be clean \u2022 Your desktop should be totally empty, except for a lamp and the current material in use \u2022 Hide your computer and phone in another room. Put your phone on silent. If possible, give them to someone while you study. \u2022 Lighting should be intense, and fairly cold (5000K or more) during the day. It should be dimmed hours prior to sleep. \u2022 Eliminate any other distraction such as music, noise, pets, people. Known lyric-less music can be used to cover up noise. 8. Study from general to particular \u2022 Scan the class a handful of times, each time slower, so you know what we talk about and what matters before you study. (It helps to avoid getting stalled). \u2022 Look at the objectives of each section: what are they trying to do/answer? (It helps in being proactive). \u2022 Method SQ3R (if needed): Survey (what is the text about?)Question (what is this section answering?)Read (and answer the previous questions)Recite (the answer to the previous questions)Review\u2022 Method THIEVES (if needed): TitleHeadingsIntroductionFirst sentence of every paragraphVisuals (graphs, tables)End of chapter questions (problems, exercises)Summarize9. Eat healthily \u2022 Eat five times a day \u2022 Do have breakfast \u2022 Eat a low-carb, high-protein diet (carbs will crash out your focus and make you hungry all the time) \u2022 Cook by yourself \u2022 Discard anything that your great grandmother wouldn\u2019t recognize as food \u2022 Drink alcohol only for parties, even if in small amounts (no casual beers) 10. Prepare for tests Be deliberate about learningObtain previous tests questions at all cost, and plan your study according to themStudy everything at least once, even if superficially, rather than focusing on one chapter that you study in depth (hoping the exam questions are about this one)If convenient, study by teaching others. (It requires having relatively little material, such as in high school)Do all the exercises, without first looking at the answers.It's better to fail while studying than on the test. If you fail while being active, you'll recall much better than if you just read the exercises' solutions. Don't be afraid of failing: it means you are learning.Do harder problems than askedCheckout other textbooks and their problems (which are likely sources of your exam questions)11. Enforce good behaviours Sit in the very front of the class, so you have to be focusedPledge to make summaries in front of the whole class for a given datePledge to teach whoever is interested, at a given dateDon't take notes on a computer, it makes distractions too close for comfortIgnore fancy colouring strategies for your notes: stick to content and clarityBreak down large tasks into smaller bits to avoid procrastinationWork towards resolving anxiety issues (go to professionals rather earlier than later - you'll thank me)",

            "answer_text": "Maths is hard. I don't mean difficult (although it can be); I mean as opposed to soft.  Hard subjects have a definite answer. You can either solve a mathematical problem, or you can't. Maths, as a subject, is a collection of these problems. If you got a C, you must be able to solve some maths problems. That's great. You can use that in a way soft subjects wouldn't allow. The C compares you to other students, or an expectation of where you should be now. It's not terribly useful at measuring progress, because it's not very granular, and the boundaries keep changing. It would be better to compare yourself before and after practicing. Even a couple of hours would normally yield measurable improvement. Open up your maths text book. Let's start with a topic. Pick something on your syllabus you wish to improve on. Don't pick something you're already good at, because that would be a waste. Equally, don't pick anything your not going to be able to nail the first few questions on. Find something you can get someway into, but not yet complete. You're about to get better at it (just a tiny bit). You textbook is likely to be laid out such that it introduces a topic, then sets you questions to complete. Perhaps the questions are interspersed with more information. Perhaps you get your questions from elsewhere. It doesn't matter. Start at question 1, complete it, check it's correct, move on. When you get stuck, take note. If you're 15 questions in 50 questions available, you're able to get 30 percent through. How good do you need to be at that topic? You may as well shoot for 100%. It's only another 35 questions. You're probably going to find one in every few questions tricky from this point in, but you just need to tackle them individually. Now your problem is just one question. How can you learn to solve one question? There are loads of ways. Ask someone - a parent, a friend, a teacher (more on this below), google, quora. When you've done it, you're now 16 questions in. That's 32%, and that's progress. Your maths teacher is the ultimate get-out. They will know the answer. They just might not be able to help you straight away. Probably pretty quickly in class, but it's unlikely they're around during your homework. If you're stuck, work on another topic. You can have two or three on the go at once. It doesn't matter if you're stuck on all of them. That's actually a good place to get on an evening, then solve them when you speak to your teacher the next day. Just make sure you can explain why or how you're stuck. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone learns differently so something that works for one student won\u2019t necessarily work for another but a few suggestions (BTW, you don\u2019t say how old the children in question are or what grade level so it\u2019s harder to give generic advice) Maths is very much a \u201ccumulative subject\u201d. That is, everything a student does builds on what they already know so if they don\u2019t have a good understanding of the material they were supposed to learn last year they\u2019re going to struggle this year. Practice - that means doing problems. And a lot of them. In particular, work on the sort of problem that the teacher likes to give on tests and exams. Drill - if the students in question are young and they\u2019re learning things like the multiplication tables drill them on them. I know when I was learning them every day my mother used to make me repeat one table before I was allowed to go outside and play. At random she\u2019d say \u201ctell me the six times table\u201d (or whatever one she chose at random). End result was that by the end of the summer I could recite the tables without even thinking about it. Speak to the teacher - if the student is having problems with a concept they should ask the teacher to explain it in different words. That\u2019s what they\u2019re there for. And if the school has some sort of \u201cdrop in center\u201d the student should take advantage of that - I know my son\u2019s school had something called \u201cacademic assistance\u201d which was simply a few hours a week when different teachers were available to explain things. Sometimes having a different teacher explain something in a slightly different manner is all it takes. [The university I attended had much the same setup - a room staffed with math grads to help undergrads with problems they were having.] Depending on age, there are also Cliffs Notes for high school level math. And, if you\u2019re talking about senior students there is a series of books called \u201cSchaum\u2019s Outlines\u201d which cover more advance topics - the ones on my bookshelf all focus on university level subjects but they may be suitable for someone doing AP level calculus or whatever. But it just boils down to hard work. Of course there will always be those individuals who are just naturally gifted in the subject and who won\u2019t have to work but they\u2019re a breed apart and don\u2019t need any guidance. ",

            "answer_text": "There are mainly two type of peoples 1.who loves maths\u2026.. These type of persons are very enthusiastic and curious about see the different type of maths problem and try to solve it no metter how challenging it is!!! Thus all who are very familiar with maths and their basic concepts and fundamental are clear once they have to try to find out that from where these concept came from ,why it is exist and how it's been proven and it's application. Now you are ready with perfect background of principle,theorem and formulas etc. Using all of these start working on as much problems as you can which is in your syllabus.Remember one thing that maths is never improve hand in your poket.Make a habit of writing problems in not books with perfection. sometimes you get a answer with a different techniques not down these techniques\u2026.its useful in MCQ type question! In paper always doing calculation based on marks.Math is subject where you have to maintain speed and accuracy both.Give full attention to problem and not down carefully what is given in exam,what is asked? Now by these method if your exam will be of 100 marks then you are work hard and by heart you damn sure get 95 to 97 marks Now you want perfect 100 here is your tips you have to predict that your paper examiner are one who don't know everything in maths.Because maths is subject where we can get a answer in many ways sometime which is not understand by every one.Actually during practice we have bed habit to skip some steps and directly get the answer. Never doing it during practice if you want perfect 100 you have write a single step which is needed to prove your answer correct.During exam we are so busy that our whole focus on getting answer. So when we are writing answers we don't look at How are we writing? Maths having a very big integration,series,derivatives etc. So try to writer maximum 3 terms in line next term in next line .These way you can also easily get answer and able to find out anything goes wrong easily.If ther is series in which sin,Sinh ..cos,cosh term will be there one line having only 2 term so when you have to cancle something it's easier.All symbols use properly like +,~,%,=,{,}[,] ,- etc.Your answer key should be neat and clean.Advantag of these tips is sometimes your are doing mistake and still somehow you get a right answer in that case examiner can only see you are answer and perfection you got a full marks.These way when somebody see your answer key it's look like everything nice clean and perfect . 2. Who hate maths\u2026. I think these type of students are bored when they have to calculate somethings or they have a fear of maths.Basic maths not clear thought they practice maths problems they are very confuse what to do next because and after a long half hour they don't even solve a one easy problems. Without basics you can't doing anything.thus they have to start from the bottom. And then when you think you have little bit intrested then you gradually like maths afterwards you have to follow 1.who loves maths ",

Successful people today also faced problems then which made them feel depressed but they never gave up. Albert Einstein once said \"do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics i can assure mine were greater\". If a genius could utter such statement, then that shows you are not the only one going through it. I will list few points which I think can help you. =>Study mathematics from the scratch. You have to know and understand some basic principles of mathematics before you can begin to solve real mathematics questions. This explains why you were thought the 26 alphabets before you can spell and pronounce words. In mathematics, you need to understand addition , subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. Without knowing all this, you can't perform well because they are the foundation of mathematics. =>Self Development. In mathematics, there are some certain things you must learn and know for yourself because your school teacher can't teach you all. You will need to go extra miles by watching online mathematics videos,learn through tutorial, learn from your friends, buy good and explanatory mathematics textbooks and study for your own self. =>Motivation. Be motivated to study mathematics. Motivation is your inner power which leads to your passion of succeeding. You will fail some test, accept that but don't let that make you feel depressed. Remember all successful people failed. Just get motivated, stay focused and determined. =>Love Mathematics. Steeve Jobs once said \"I am where I am today because I love what I am doing\". You have to love mathematics, when you love mathematics it makes you practice mathematics, when you practice mathematics it makes you improve your mathematical skills for your self, when this happens you tend to solve any mathematical problems and discover mathematical problems. Also you must love your mathematics teacher because you can't pass mathematics when you hate your mathematics teacher. =>Teach others the little you know. When you teach others mathematics, you know it more. =>Obey instructions, think, analyze and solve mathematical problems. ",

            "answer_text": "It's time consuming, but anyone can do it.   First and foremost, stay ahead of the class.  Your class will go over chapter 3 section 2 tomorrow.  You have already read it, done a few problems on it and even looked at some videos on it online (you tube is one of the greatest tools to improve your math skills as many teachers upload videos on practically any topic).   What is the impact?  When you go to class, you know what you will learn and you are simply reviewing things and rather then wasting time on trivial stuff you immediately focus on things that you have real issues with and ask it immediately. The next important thing:  DO LOTS OF PROBLEMS and LOOK FORWARD TO MISTAKES because when you make mistakes, it is an opportunity to learn something new.  Mistakes are your way of making little distinctions in problem solving that will put you ahead of other kids on your math skills.  So they are something to be excited about. See your teacher before every test.  Go in the morning early just before a test or after school the day before a test.  Many teachers give you little clues during this time about the test that could mean you score one letter score higher.   Once you develop this mindset of staying ahead of class, finding resources outside your teacher (youtube, your engineer uncle, etc), doing lots of problems, looking forward to identifying and learning from mistakes and talking with your teacher before a test...you will have gone a long way to becoming a better math student.

            "answer_text": "1 Take careful, dedicated notes and listen carefully. When learning a certain concept, try to compile a list of steps to review later. Write down key points and important things to avoid. When your teacher writes examples on the board, copy them down as well as how to solve them for future reference. 2 Participate in the lesson. While you cannot learn math by watching it being done, you usually need to see it done at least once. Then you need to do it. The key to understanding mathematics is to be an active participant. By being active you engage both sides of the brain. Listen to the problems your teacher gives you and complete them. Raise your hand to explain what you did, or listen carefully to what the other students did and their answers to make sure you got the same. 3 Do your homework. Finish all of your homework and do extra questions to help lock in the material. Make it a habit to do your homework well, as if you were taking a test. It's like rehearsal for a test. Refer to your notes and your textbook while doing your homework. Ask your teacher, a friend, tutor, or smart student for assistance if you're having trouble. 4 Always ask your teacher if you have any questions. Otherwise you will move on to the next subject without knowing the first one. This is a potential grade downer as for not knowing your material. Always check in with your teacher if you have been checking your answers and suddenly realize you have gotten 5/7 wrong. Do not go to a friend! A teacher is always your best bet for help. 5 Look for patterns & connections. After you have done math for a while, you will begin to see patterns and connections that you cannot experience as an observer. By getting involved in the problem, you get to see and feel how problems are solved. The answer to all problems, be it math or otherwise lies within the problem itself. Finally, after you have learned a skill, it is extremely effective to pass it on. When you teach, you verbalize the connections you made while practicing. By teaching you have to understand the problem so that you can correctly explain it and work through it in order to arrive at the correct answer. ",

            "answer_text": "First it is useful to like maths: you have to enjoy discovering new abstract objects and seeing how they all fit together in a beautiful and intricate map. Once you get accustomed to these new tools then you will use them as easily as if they are a part of you such as with language: once you're fluent it's no big deal writting an interesting essay for you, it's even fun to do so. That being said, if you are talking about higher maths then don't disregard the proofs in your lesson: of course you can survive without them but they are what will give you a deeper core understanding of the subfield your studying and once your subconscious mind soaks them in you will have a lot more intuitions in daily problem solving. Time is a another big factor, maths is that one subject where you need to devote quite \u00e0 big amount of work and time. And for that you will also need to keep your mental clarity and remain stable as you'll be overiding the thinking process quite alot so timed breaks will help now and then. in class always stay alert and mindful and try to create a link with your teacher and his way of doing maths. Be willing to prepare some classes in advance so you can then go a the blackboard and explain it to everyone, that's always a very good training. Be curious and go further than your lessons by reading books and surfing the web. Try to link the different main subfields together: Core Set theory and Logic, Algebra, Analysis, Geometry and Probability, you aim is to get a broader picture before specializing in one of thoses fields, especially algebra and topology as these happen to be found nearly everywhere once you get to a certain level. Also try to develop a geometric intuition, indeed Geometry is said to be complete and ind\u00e9pendant way of thinking in itself. As plato said: \u201cLet no man ignorant of geometry enter here.\" Sometimes drawing things (even for the most abstract problems) can be a gamechanger. Fun fact: most finite groups can be drawn thanks to their cycle graph, and for some norms you can draw balls where each of it point is a function. Give yourself the time it takes to handle maths in your own way, there no rush really. ",

If you are studying maths in high school ( 11th or 12th ) then these tips will help you to get full marks. Learn the basics - First of all, before solving the questions it is highly recommended to read the concepts and theory part, thoroughly so that you can hold a grip about topic and know about what is the reason of solving this problem. (This will also help you to understand that why some questions are exceptions)Learn the formulas - You should always learn the formulas before moving to solving questions. This is the reason why many questions go wrong while solving in exam. And you should spend time on learning formulas as you spend is solving questions.Learn through examples - Watching out examples, helps you to understand how the question is solved. And gives you the method by which you have to solve in exam .Solve basic questions - Before moving to tought questions you should solve basic questions to brush up your concepts and holding a grip on easy questions will help you to understand and solve high level questions easily.Solve extra questions - Now, after you have solved some easy questions slowly move towards questions that are a bit complicated and difficult, And during solving each question take your time to understand why this question is complicated.Practice, Practice and more Practice - Now practice questions by doing them by yourself and clear your doubts by asking your teacher (if you don't have a teacher searh about that internet) Try to solve all the questions in back excersice.Solve sample papers and previous years question papers - Now this is the most important part , if you are not familiar with the way in which questions come in exam, then there is a chance that all of your hard work may go into vain. This is the part where most students don't care . So solve questions with speed and accuracy. In the end what matters are the efforts that you put in ",

Not that I couldn\u2019t do it, just that it wasn\u2019t my easiest subject, and a few of my teachers weren\u2019t so great at relating to actual people (news flash, that can happen with a few math teachers, and they don\u2019t do it on purpose) First thing: If you DO have problems, go ahead and be honest with your teachers. TELL them you want a higher grade, and ask if they have any time to help you one to one when you\u2019re frustrated. This will mean giving up some of your free time. I would go to youtube and look up Khan Academy videos for the exact math subjects you need help with. Khan academy tends to put things in clear, easy to follow, way broken down steps. Again, this means giving up some of your free time. Find a classmate who does well, and ask if they can help you with homework. Meet at lunch, after school, or when you can, and just ask if they can work by your side. DO NOT copy their answers, but compare results, and if you find a difference, ask them to show you the steps. Math is the one language that is the same all over the world, and the one discipline in which the answers are not subjective. I WISH I had been as honest as you are in asking this 25 years ago. As a kid, I let the frustration stop me from working as hard as I could have. Looking back, I realized I could have done way better, grade wise. I learned more TEACHING it than I ever did TAKING it.

            "answer_text": "Well, I am a math and science lover! Coming to the point: In science, there is a theoretical as well as practical concept to understand. If you don\u2019t understand the main concept then you may get difficulties in the tough or vast concepts. Well, Maths is different! In case of maths, you have to practice more to be perfect. Here I\u2019ll give you my own special tips. I hope it will help. Maths is that subject in which if you are wrong at some point than the entire sum will be wrong. Even \u201cPlus-minus\u201d signs are must to keep right in the right section. #1. For performing best in the maths, I recommend you to \u201cpractice\u201d more. I highlighted here \u201cpractice\u201d, bcoz as we know, in maths you have not to give the time to understand the concept (as in science). Unlike science, you have to practice more for solving the sums in mathematics. You\u2019ll probably think there is nothing new! Remember\u2026 \u201cPractice makes a man perfect.\u201d I personally experimented this method and I really improved in maths. It doesn\u2019t matter you are below average, average or brilliant student. If you want to score well and \u201cBEST\u201d for yourself then you must give more time to mathematics. Do more practice and challenge yourself for being expert in the maths. Whenever I stuck somewhere in the sum, I usually challenge myself \u201cI\u2019ll definitely solve this sum\u201d. #2. Work on your weakness. Check out your weaknesses! Try to find where do you stuck more often. Try to improve that. #3. Have a strong grip at Formulas Yes! If you have formaulas at your fingertips then 50% of the sum is already solved. Hope it helps! I'll add more tips soon! ~Karan :) *Edits are always welcome!* ",

But being an average student i can assure you that scoring good in maths is not an easy task it requires full concentration and very good amount of interest. This is one subject which not only improves computation skills but also develops your thinking and reasoning skills.There are no tips for students who deliberately resort to last-minute study. Only 'good luck' will save you! For others, who due to genuine reasons where compelled to start late, concentrate on those topics and chapters with which you are already comfortable with, and spend more time practising previous year questions.keeping the company of some studious friends will help! Additionally, you must inculcate the habit of finishing the papers in the stipulated time. Read your paper, carefully!Start your exam with a question you are most comfortable with. Solve problems in a stepwise methodAttempt all questions -- even if partially. You do get points for attempting them and for every correct step . Write a clean paperDon't scribble and scrap, unnecessarily. If need be, just strike it once and start writing in a new line Keep tabsThis is with respect to formulae, rules and theorems. Also, stick to proper methodology. Formatting, a mustDraw margins, underline the important steps and leave space after answering each question. Perfect graphs = full marks!Convert, if required, all the quantities to appropriate SI units.Choose a correct scale, which helps to draw the graph accurately and of good size.Join all the points of the graph so that it gives a proper line or a smooth curve.Also, read correctly the values if required to be obtained from the graphs.All these tips will surely helps you to score good marks in Mathematics.

Say in Algebra, you need to understand the concept say combining like terms, which terms should be paired up with, the laws involve (associative, commutative, distributive properties) and understanding the existence of additive/multiplicative inverse or identity. Like what others said understand the basics first. And try to practice it. When you somewhat understand it test it for yourself. And take it slow, one step at a time. In geometry, well in here you really need to familiarize formula, the definitions and axioms. Once you understand what is needed or what is need to be done then you could proceed. Math isn\u2019t always about arithmetic or calculating numbers. It\u2019s also about logic, patterns, decision theory, game theory and stuff. Say you could use math in real life situations say buying stuff you want, you need to know how to budget. Estimating how much time you need to take a bath so that you wouldn\u2019t be late in class. How many times do you need to look into someone so that she/he will notice you, jk haha. Well I dunno, for me I really had a hard time understanding calculus so I try to look into its application and somewhat it inspired me. So little by little I try to understand the concepts. Also you need to like what you are doing and not hating the subject itself. Be positive!~ ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you are looking for some skills to help you do better in math classes. 1) READ. I know for a fact that many of my students, including those that don\u2019t pass, admit to me afterwards that they rarely if ever read the textbook. I also know that textbooks are better at graphics than me and a whiteboard or chalkboard, show nicer graphs, and most basic math books also shows each algebraic step with annotations/ More importantly, textbooks can be read and re-read and move only as quickly as you want them to. If you expect me to both introduce each topic but also explain it in a fixed time-slot good for all 30 kids in a class, it won\u2019t happen. I may do one less example that may be more helpful, I may spend 10 minutes describing what is happening when it may take you 13 or 14 minutes to get it. The book moves at your pace. 2) On that same topic, a decent instructor should be able to tell you which sections/lessons/topics are coming up. Even if it\u2019s during lunch before lecture or during commercial breaks when you\u2019re watching TV at night, spend 5\u201310 minutes to read on topics before the class, see a basic example or so on so that when you go to class maybe you will already have questions. 3) Bad at algebra? Hate Fractions? Buy a small composition book and everytime you make an algebraic error on a test or quiz or assignment, write it down. Go through the book of your mistakes at least once before each test to remind yourself of what not to do. 4) Not everyone learns the same way. Some learn well by taking copious notes and sitting in a lecture. Others need to see lots of examples. Some learn better by focusing on what you say, others respond better to pictures of everything and colors, etc. 5) Find alternate texts. For just about any single undergraduate or high school topic such as discrete mathematics, pre-Calc, Calculus 1\u20132, Algebra, Trigonometry, and so on. Go to a library and check out up to 2 other textbooks.They may cover things in a different order or change of focus that work better for you. Maybe a topic like Arc Length is about 3 pages in your Calculus text. They derive the formula and then do two examples. Another book may do 5 examples, for instance, and different functions than your book. ",

            "answer_text": "First, analyze what your SPECIFIC PROBLEMS or ISSUES are in math. Math is a big subject with many subskills, and you are at the age where moving beyond arithmetic to more conceptual ideas (problem solving, theory, etc.) is becoming emphasized. Are you having trouble with basic arithmetic?  Adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing?  If so, there is NO substitute for revisiting these skills which are largely addressed through MEMORIZATION, except for division. You just need to get your table memorized thoroughly, especially for addition and multiplication. Note that division is somewhat different.  There is actually an algorythm (recipe, procedure) for \"long division\" which is based on GUESSING (or estimating), multiplying the guess, subtracting, and then either making a NEW guess or repeating the process to find the answer. This is one of the first things to learn in \"math\" that requires such a PROCEDURE or ALGORYTHM rather than pure memorization of the tables. If you issue is \"problem solving\", i.e., taking \"word problems\" requiring simple arithmetic and turning those into equations where you can DO that simple arithmetic, this needs to be addressed differently than basic arithmetic issues (e.g., memorization or division procedures). You need to find a REALLY GOOD teacher or BOOK which explains how to TRANSLATE the word problem into an equation or arithmetic problem. There is a REAL SKILL here but also some fairly simple tricks which many teachers either don't know EXPLICITLY or for other reasons never fully explain. If your teacher or book can make this SIMPLE then find another source. Treat such word problems as an issue in TRANSLATION -- you must translate the word problem (in ordinary language) into an ARITHMETIC problem just as someone might translate English into French. Simple problems have simple and well-defined tricks, while more complex problems may require a lot more practice and more advanced tricks. ",

This is true in all disciplines but you have to exercise the math muscles to get yourself thinking like a mathematician.In a classroom/university setting, always ask questions if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t count the number of times a proof or theorem was being demonstrated at university and I completely failed to comprehend the entire lesson just because I didn\u2019t speak up. If you are learning independently, really make sure you understand, for example, a solution to a problem before you attempt it. Reading a solution is one thing, but if you can\u2019t get through an attempt at a solution without referencing something a lot, you may not know the material as well as you think.Understand the fundamentals of logic. Math isn\u2019t magic. Everything that happens in problem-solving or proof writing stems from principles of logical reasoning.If you don\u2019t like math, find a reason. Perhaps not necessary, but it will make your \u201cget good\u201d pursuit much more manageable. Maybe you\u2019re an engineer that needs math skills, or if you\u2019re just genuinely curious on why we study math at all, look into the topic of Philosophy of Mathematics. That\u2019s where a lot of the interesting questions are asked. A great book that motivated me to study higher maths in high school was Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth by Apostolos Doxiadis.",

Some steps you need to follow: Practice, Practice & More Practice - It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems. The more you practice answering maths problems, the better. Each problem has its own characteristics and it\u2019s important to have solved it in numerous ways before tackling the exam. There is no escaping this reality, to do well in a Maths exam you need to have solved a lot of mathematical problems beforehand. Mugging up is of no help - I see many students \u2018mugging up\u2019 maths problems\u2019 solutions. I\u2019ve also bee guilty of following this wrong idea. Mathematics is all about \u2018understanding\u2019, not mugging up. Have mastery over formulas - In maths, while facing a question, it is a formula that comes to your rescue. While solving a problem, if you can find the right formula that has to be applied, half of the problem is solved. Mastery over formulas comes only when your basics and fundamentals are clear. Also, constant revision is also required. Solve previous years\u2019 question papers - This process will help you have your revision, boost confidence and go through the general blueprint of the paper. It will help you take on the main examination with increased confidence. Give importance to \u2018weighty\u2019 chapters - In maths paper, certain chapters carry more weight, in terms of marks. So, naturally, more time and effort has to be allotted towards the preparation and revision of those sections. Manage time well during the examination - Many students find it difficult to attempt all questions within the amount of time allotted. This problem can be tackled by solving mock question papers. Also, don\u2019t indulge in time-wasting tactics during the paper. Solve doubts immediately - While indulging in preparations, it is quite natural that you may come across a number of doubts and difficulties. Make it a point to clear doubts as soon as possible.  Hope this helps you! All the best! ",

Mathematicians thinks that solving equations to find a solution is the way to solve a mathematical problem. Take real mathematical equations even simple like the one describing the classic gravitationnal interaction of 3 bodies. It cannot be solved. Or in they simplistic beauty the Maxwell equation describing electromagnetism. You can be the best you can at math, there is no solutions. However, if you do physics you\u2019ll learn how to solve problems stated as mathematical equations One of the trick in solving an equation without doing calculus is given by Marie Curie: symmetries in the causes reflects in the solutions. Real world problems have what we call degrees of liberties. These degrees of liberties are also called dimensions. They generate topopgraphies of solutions. The more degrees of liberties the harder the equation is. Try to visualize an 11 dimensions problems and your brain will just stop give up. But, with each symmetries you can find you can reduce the equation of 1 degree of liberty. Science basic rules is : try to get the closest you can to the simplest equations that any students, workers could use to be useful. The less degrees of liberties, the simpler the equation, then the most useful. One of the beauty of symmetries is that in physics you can often observe them. Even the one from quantum physics (even if they kind of split the brain in 4 in the process by being hard to accept). The more you do physics, the more you learn how to trick the maths to have the results. Most mathematicians call physicist cheaters because the use mathematics in a creative unorthodox disruptive way that they disregard as non academic. And it is really fun to anger mathematicians. They are so funny when they must admit you have a solution by a method they dislike. Remember mathematicians used to be leaders of sects (like Pythagore), or anti-scientific philosoph opposed to experimentation (Aristote) and you can have an idea of why if you want to use math in a real world application, you should try to avoid mathematicians teaching of maths and come to the right side of the Force. Cheating math does involves an awful lot of knowledge of math still. But it is funnier this way. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are truly interested in mathematics, you should start by becoming exceptionally good at the fundamentals (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, etc.). Something I tell my students all the time is to work things (exercises, problems, applications) out in detail. I make an analogy to a hiker who is unfamiliar with the territory he or she is traveling through. If a map with details and explanations is given, the hiker will most likely have success in finding his or her destination with minor difficulty. Perhaps some clarifications will need to be made here and there, but they\u2019ll stay out of harms way. If instead the hiker decides to deviate and find an alternative course which is totally unfamiliar to him or the guides, he or she may run into obstacles or pit-falls that will endanger them; not just physically, but emotionally as well. Shortcuts are not always the quickest or safest options between departure and arrival. Which kind of student would you prefer to be, the one that wants to do things the right way and stay moderately safe in their progress of understanding mathematics? Or would you prefer to be the student who tries every shortcut available only to ruin your chances of truly understanding the process of mathematics and ruining your shaky foundations? To be \u201cbetter\u201d in mathematics often amounts to merely being more disciplined, studious, and diligent. These characteristics will help you far more than any trick or shortcut I could ever suggest; not that I ever would. ",

            "answer_text": "You practice. Practice questions, practice techniques, practice writing formal and coherent proofs\u2026 just practice anything you possibly can. Granted, it sort of depends on what level you\u2019re aiming to be. If you\u2019re just looking to pass an exam, and you don\u2019t care about higher level maths, then just practice the types of questions that you\u2019ll expect to see come up. Most exams at low levels contain very straightforward problems; as long as you revise the techniques and formulas there\u2019s no reason why you should get stuck. If you still find you get stuck even though you know the material, you need to refine your problem solving capacity. That\u2019s easier said than done but its perfectly doable nonetheless. Just keep going over problems. From my purely anecdotal experience, you want to do problems with which you have about a 60% success rate in order to make a significant improvement. If you can do much more than that then the questions are too easy and you\u2019re wasting your time. Conversely, if you can hardly answer anything then clearly you\u2019re aiming a bit too high a bit too quickly. I\u2019ve found 60% to be the sweet-spot, but you may find your own. Try not to get discouraged if you can\u2019t do something \u2014 see it as a learning experience. But most importantly, don\u2019t just shove it under the rug. You\u2019ll have to confront that type of problem at some point; it\u2019s better to fail in revision sessions than in the exam.  If you\u2019re aiming to do higher-level maths, the critical thinking and ability to recognise/write proof is arguably more important than the techniques themselves, and certainly more important than memorising formulas. You\u2019ll need to learn the art of patience and resilience. Problems in low level maths only take a few minutes, if that. Problems in the highest levels of maths can take hours, days, or weeks. Research in maths can take years! The point is, you can\u2019t give up. When you\u2019re stuck, you need to be able to unstick yourself. This is where practice comes in. The more problems you\u2019ve done, the more likely you are to have an approach ready for the task at hand. You\u2019ll find you gain a greater intuition for problem solving, and you\u2019ll speed up enormously. ",

            "answer_text": "You can always get better at Mathematics since there is always scope for improvement. Here are two golden rules which I will present and further elaborate : Never Give up : Its like fighting a battle. If you are unable to solve a problem go to the basics and start afresh. Don\u2019t just write the steps as you solve instead work with them in your mind. Enjoy the heat of the battle between you and your intellect mounting up, its good for both. The \u2018Thinking Time\u2019 is the time when you seriously think about the problem. It is a few seconds for an average human to years for scientists. The more you increase it the better you become at Mathematics.Start appreciating the unseen : Mathematics is more than just dry numbers. For example look at calculus, when you start learning calculus and see all those analytical and abstract proofs did you foresee what a great magic it was about to become for you afterwards. Its about going behind the scenes and understanding the magic and when you come to know that the whole magic hinges on one completely obvious postulate you are amazed. Appreciate the beauty which not all develop the eyes to see and you will start loving Mathematics.One last point which comes up is which step to follow first. It would be better if you keep them in mind and start working your way out. They complement each other. You also need to have sound concepts. Always work through with a paper and a pencil while reading the theory and believe in it to help you in your battle. All the great book reading and about the life of great mathematicians comes automatically when you find your love. Lastly remember those who have helped you whether it be people, proofs or the dead.

In a way, consider pieces on a chess board to be similar. Each piece has a purpose. Each piece interacts in some way with the others and the use of all pieces is governed by the rules which make chess the game it is. Chess is a system. The board and pieces exist, the rules give it meaning but how it is used and manipulated depends on the user. If you distill math to finding an answer or using formulas, you have achieved the ability of a lifeless computer and the computer will always do it faster and more accurately than you. What the computer can not do is reason like a human. Mathematics is about exactly that- reasoning. Using the chess pieces and manipulating them within the context of the game. Mathematical statements represent relationships and express these relations in a way that the ambiguity of other languages does not allow. You want to be good at math? Study logic, study set theory, study the construction of number systems, and be able to explain what a mathematical statement is saying. Learn to read math, not just do math. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly copied my answer from a different question, as the topic is similar- First, go ask your teacher for help. They might be able to help you pinpint exactly what you're struggling with, and then you guys can come up with a plan together of how to continue forward. Also, most teachers would be willing to help you work through some of your homework, etc. so that you could see some of their thought processes. Other suggestions- When you get your homework/tests back and you've gotten a poor grade, look through it. See where you lost points and figure out how you could have done better. This way you learn from your mistakes and can fix them next time. Practice \u201cactive learning\u201d study habits. This means that, instead of just copying what your teacher wrote onto notecards or something like that, try studying in ways that make you actively engaged with the subject. My favorite active learning study tool is making a concept web, because it helps you really put together how all of the ideas from the unit relate. If you Google active studying, lots more ideas will come up. Active learning is something that teachers are taught to use, as it is known to be more effective than passive learning. If you can afford it, get a tutor. Tutors can do many of the things that I mentioned that your teacher can do, and you can choose how much time you work with them (whereas your teacher may have more limited time). Find a classmate or two to study with. This can be hugely helpful. As a grad student, I don't know if I could have passed some of my classes last semester without my friend who is in my classes. Working with a peer can help you quickly see your errors and catch them, so you don't learn the wrong thing. Just make sure that you understand their corrections! You don't have to do all of these, but I would suggest trying each of them and seeing what works best for you. Hope that helps! ",

Now,if you think it is really hard for you to be consistent in your studies the you can hire a maths tuition teacher BUT Considering the time of the year you are asking this question,you probably have an exam very soon as final exams are going on.So,my advice if you are less on time: Do the questions which you find the most difficultThis way you will have a lot of doubts before the exam which is a good thing because you can clear your doubts before the exam. 2. If you study from NCERT book always do the examples from each and every chapter  I am telling this to you on experience.I have changed schools 3 times and what I have noticed is that there is a great chance that the same examples which are given in the NCERT book are used in the exam question paper.

I am pretty sure if you follow the following things you will be able to score good marks in maths 1. You need to learn the formula. Learning formulas is the most basic step you can do to master maths. 2. Take the help of informative videos available on the internet to understand maths problems like varus theorems etc. If you get a good idea about where you can easily put your formula then you will develop a mindset for problem-solving. 3. Go through the last 5 years question papers so that you will get an idea on which topics are asked quite frequently and develop your learning criteria based on it. 4. During the time of examination, you need to implement a good time table so that you can attempt and solve all the questions which you have answers too. First, try to solve the questions which you are confident about and carry more marks. Attempt all questions and set proper time allocation for each section. If you are feeling stuck in a question and you have invested a lot of time into it then move on to the next question and attempt it later. 5. You need to practice every day and do proper revisions if you want to score good marks. 6. Try to write in good handwriting and make a separate column for doing rough work. ",

I have had to give the answer to your question to countless parents and students. The answer is: practice. The only way to do better at math is to practice. You should ask your math teacher for more problems to solve. I know you don\u00b4t want to do that, but that is the way to get better. It would be great if your math teacher could give you a book or some exercises that have the answers in the back. Of course, don\u00b4t look at the answers until you finish doing the problems.   It also helps take the pressure off of you and helps you to do better if you are solving math problems that are not for a grade. It will feel more like you are solving a puzzle than doing school work.     you have to practice solving math problems. You have to practice a lot.   ",

AND DO NOT CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY OF WRITING THE PAPER AT THE END MOMENT.First, finish off matrices & determinants from NCERT. Then solve tricky questions for the same from Together-With.Second, start Inverse trigonometric functions directly from RD Sharma and finish off its solved examples(all of them). After that you\u2019ll solve NCERT orally. Keep revising the miscellaneous exercise from NCERT.Third, most important part is CalculusStart continuity & differentiability from NCERT and finish all the questions.Solve only those questions from RD Sharma on which board has been marked.Keep revising the important questions from NCERT.Follow the above process for AOD(application of derivatives)For indefinite integrals, it would be better to directly start from RD Sharma and solve all the questions from that chapter. But if you find that hectic or scary then solve NCERT first and then solve all the questions from Together-With as well. Do the same for definite integrals and AOI(application of integrals). Keep revising integrals daily as its very important and more complex than derivatives.Fourth, start differential equation from NCERT and solve alongside Together-With. If you have your basics strong for derivatives & integrals then this chapter is just a cakewalk.Fifth, get hold on relation & functions & follow the same process like differential equation. Keep revising the miscellaneous exercise for this chapter.Sixth, comes the second most easy chapter that's vectors. Just do NCERT thoroughly alongside either EXEMPLAR or Together-With.Seventh, you cannot leave 3D geometry. Follow the same process like differential equation.Eighth, proceed with probability with a lot of patience because this\u2019 that one chapter that you will find easy but mistakes tend to happen the most. Be careful and thoroughly just follow NCERT.Ninth, shootdown Linear programming directly from NCERT with proper practice(use graphs, scale, sharpened pencil) because one slight mistake in plotting the graph can lose you all the 6 marks. The \u2018transport\u2019 part is not in CBSE but its included in JEE/NDA/BITSAT. In the end start solving last 10 years question papers followed by 4\u20135 sample papers. Just do nothing but relax and listen to songs(no videos) on one night before the exam. ",

The importance of math for students has never been more prominent. Following are some tips to help you achieve full marks in maths. Practice, Practice & More Practice:It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems. The more you practice answering math problems, the better you get. Review Errors:When you\u2019re practicing with difficult problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. Don\u2019t skip difficult Question:Sometimes you can get stuck trying to solve part of a maths problem and find it difficult to move on to the next stage. It\u2019s common for many students to skip this question and continue on to the next. You should avoid doing this and instead spend time trying to understand the process of solving the problem. Make Short Notes:As you study a chapter, list out the various formulas.Mathematics has specific terminology with a lot of vocabulary. I suggest you create Notes with all the concepts, terminology and definitions you need to know. You should include their meanings, some key points so you can consult them at any time and recap. Keep Up with the SyllabusUnderstanding your portions and the weightage attached to different sections. this will help you in deciding how much time to dedicate to each section. For example, if you know that there will be just a 5 marks question from a particular section, you do not have to dedicate a week practicing those sums. Review previous Test papers:Use your old tests and class work to create a personal study guide for your upcoming exam. Look at the way your teacher frames questions \u2013 this is probably how they will appear on your test. Solve maximum sample papers before the examSample papers provide us with an idea of the type of questions and the pattern of the exam which you are actually going to write in the next few days. It helps you practice and learn time management skills. 10% \u2013 20% are comes from sample paper each year so that you have to solve sample paper. If you have any doubts or questions then feel free to message me on Quora.I am always happy to help students succeed in their career. Do Upvote if you find it helpful and follow me for more queries.

            "answer_text": "The first thing I would say regarding Math is practice, practice & practice. Practice makes a man perfect. But I'm sure you've heard this a lot. I think you should focus more on getting better at math rather than achieving higher marks. If you get better at it, you will automatically get higher marks. I think the main problem most people have with Math is their attitude towards it. Most people have a mental block with Math. They hate math and think that they can never enjoy it. I think this is mostly because most of us have had a bad teacher and have struggled with Math sometime or the other. But don't let this hamper you. If you struggle with something, have a positive mindset and take it up as a challenge. If you change your attitude towards math, you'll slowly start to see a change in your interaction with Math. Attitude is everything. Once you've changed your attitude, try other things like practicing a lot of problems. If you have a good and helpful teacher, try to take his/ her help to figure out your weakness. Are you weak at a particular field of Math? Are your basis weak? Or is it that you just don't understand the problem? If you don't have a good helpful teacher, hey it's not the end of the world! Try websites like Khan Academy,etc.. Take diagnostic tests to figure out your weakness. Once you figure out your weakness, work towards strengthening it. Practice using books and the Internet. Most people tend to struggle with math because they are weak at some of the basics. Some people struggle with fractions while some struggle with variables. These are basic skills present in every branch, be it Algebra or PreCalculus. ",

The entire premise of the DVD series is to \"learn by example\" and it is quite simply the easiest way to learn Math.  After watching the section on the DVD and reading the section in your textbook, begin working examples from the end of the chapter. Make sure to work the problems that have answers in the back of the book, and check every one. Always begin with the easiest problem in your book, even if you think it will be too \"easy\" to solve. It is very very important to build your confidence. This is why the DVD lessons begin with easier problems that no one will have any issue understanding. Gradually work harder and harder problems from your book and check your answer for each one. After working a dozen or more problems from the section (two dozen is best), you are ready to move on to the next section. Many students want to plow though a lesson just to make it to the next one.   You cannot just read a section in a Math book and become an expert on that section.  You must work problems. If you can't work problems then you are not ready to move on. The good news is that working problems will build your confidence, and confidence is 100% the name of the game in Math. ",

You have to follow three basic steps: Understand your conceptsGive enough time to understand your concepts by reading them and teaching them to others. There are several online videos available for free which can help you build your fundamentals. 2. Practice I cannot focus more on this point. You have to practice a variety of questions that cover maximum concepts and practice a good number of questions that you find difficult or carry maximum marks in the exams. Buy good books which carry this variety and you know you can solve them. Some people think buying huge books will help them become a topper, but that\u2019s just a myth. Instead, buy your course books and RS Aggarwal is a must. If you can, solve RD Sharma and then shift to other books. NCERT is not enough for most of the students because less number of questions are present in it. 3. Ask Questions Once you start practicing questions, you\u2019ll get some doubts. You should circle them and ask your teachers about them. If not try apps which can help you solve your doubts. There are apps like Doubtnut which helps in providing video solutions to students immediately and you can even ask your questions through WhatsApp to them. By these methods, I am sure you can fetch very good marks in your examination. Keep practicing. ",

Those who think they can do it and those who think they cant. They are both right.\u201d ~Henry Ford What this is saying is if you keep telling yourself you cant do something, in this case it is math, then you wont do it. You put yourself down saying you cant do something so that is what makes you have the outcome of not being able to be good at math. To be come better at math you need to put in the extra time and effort and keep that positive mindset and telling yourself that you can do it. If you struggle than that is when you should ask someone for some extra help. If you aren\u2019t strong and passionate about math, that is when you need to tell yourself do take more math classes or do daily math work to become stronger and more efficient in the subject.

            "answer_text": "How to get good grades is a common question asked by the students at any level of education. The reason is everyone wants to score good grades in their examinations. It just not provide mental happiness to the students but also play a crucial role in the success of the students. Get higher grades in school can be a lot easier than getting high grades in college. Getting good grades is also helpful in winning competitive scholarships. Today I am going to share with you the best and most effective tips on how to get good grades in exams. Just studying is not enough for getting good grades. You need to have a solid strategy and plan that will help you to regain your focus and help you to achieve good grades. Tips on how to get good grades 1. Motivate yourself Self-motivation is the key to success for every student. It is pretty often that the students lose their confidence when they don\u2019t get good grades. But you should not make the same mistakes as other students do. You may not get satisfied with your grades sometimes, but at that moment, you should maintain your self-confidence to be in the game of getting good grades. You should believe in yourself to stay focused on your work. The best way to motivate yourself is to create some milestones for yourself. You can create a series of milestones. When you start working to achieve those milestones than in every achievement, you will boost your self-confidence. And this confidence will lead you to get good grades in your exams. 2. Listen and participate in the class A student who does participate in the class always gets more grades than the students who don\u2019t. But listen and participate in the class is not easy for any students, especially for the shy one. But it showcases the teacher that you care about the topic and you want to score high grades. The teacher gives the grades based on various factors. Apart from that if you participate in the class, then you may get more awareness about the topic. Along with that if you listen to your mentor or teacher carefully, then you can learn a lot more than the self-study. It will help you to prepare for the exams more effectively. Thus it helps you to get good grades in your exams. Besides, if you\u2019re a weak student, then you can sit closer to the teacher so that the teacher can know more about you and find your weakness. Apart from that, you can also write down some questions before the class and then ask them to the teacher to clear your doubts. 3. Take thorough notes during a class Notes are quite helpful in getting high grades. You should make notes during the class. Notes help you to cover the important information about the topic. You can create the notes by listening to your teacher. Apart from that, you can also create the notes of the important topic with the help of some reference book of your topic. It will help you to prepare for the exams more efficiently. Sometimes the students just need to have a look at the notes, and then they prepare for the exams within a few hours. Apart from that, these notes are also helpful just before the last few minutes of the exams. 4. Do not hesitate to ask for help Majority of students does this mistake. I don\u2019t why they always have hesitation while asking the help from the teacher. The students need to take help from the teacher. Even intelligent students also look for help from the teacher. Because the students can\u2019t cover everything about the topic without taking help from the teacher. It is quite common for tough subjects. You should ask for help from your teachers and your peers in the class. It helps you to learn more about the topic and clear your doubts without much effort. Apart from that, you can also ask your parents for help if they can help you with the topic. Along with that, you can also ask them for the private tutor, who will help you to learn more about the topic. 5. Stay focused during your homework Focus is the key factor in how to get good grades. Lack of focus will not help you to good core grades; You need to be well focused during your homework. Did you know homework plays a crucial role in your academic scores? Homework helps you to get ready for the exams and learn more deeply about the topic. That\u2019s why you need to stay focused during your homework. Now the question is, how we can do that? The best answer to this question is to find a quiet place to do your homework. Remember that the place should be located in a distraction-free environment. There are some other factors too that create the distraction during your homework writing. Mobile devices are a major distraction for that. You should put your mobile phone aside. You can also put it into the silent or mute mode. Moreover, You can also use some apps that will lock your phone for a certain period. You can also do your homework with the help of some experts. Suppose that you need to have the statistics homework help. Then you can take the statistics homework help from the experts. They will help you to clear all your doubts more effectively. 6. Reward Yourself by taking the short breaks Majority of students don\u2019t give the importance to the breaks between the study. But remember that breaks work as an amplifier for your brain. If you do continuous study, then you may not get the good grades. Because continue study usually tied up the brain. That\u2019s why taking the short break always help you to refresh your body and brain. You should take a break within every 45 minutes during your study. The break should be as long as 15 minutes. During your break, you can walk around your house to get some fresh air. You should also drink some water to regain energy. Apart from that, you can also eat some snacks to fuel your body. It works as a reward for yourself and makes you more productive by doing something that you enjoy. 7. Prefer group study (If Possible) Sometimes group study works better than the self-study. The reason is in group study the members of the group help each other to motivate themselves and make them more productive. It also helps you to clear the doubts of each other if you find any trouble within the topic. Moreover, you can be sure that how much you have prepared for the exams. Because most of the time we assume that we study enough and get ready for the exams. But in reality, we may not be ready for the exams. On the other hand, in the self-study, there may not be any motivation for you. You need to motivate yourself. If the group study style suits you, then you should organize such groups. You can also do group study after class or on weekends. 8. Organize your study space In most of the cases, the students don\u2019t organize their study space. It is a common thing that perfect planning leads you to perfect achievement. You should organize your study space efficiently. You can do this manage all your books and stationery in one place. Don\u2019t you ever try to do not let your desk become cluttered with papers and stationery? Apart from that, you should also make separate notebooks for the separate subjects. Don\u2019t you ever try to make the notes on the same notebook for every topic? Because during the exam sessions, it will be overwhelming for you to study from that notebook. Also, remember that when you prepare for the exams. You should always have your notes and your books along with you at the same time. In this topic, I also talked about planning. You should plan your entire day and divided into small parts. Along with that, you can also write down the important dates for tests. 9. Develop a study schedule Scheduling your study is crucial to get good grades in your exams. Whenever you decide to study. Then you should divide your time into small chunks. Small chunks help you to prepare for the topic more effectively. Suppose that if you\u2019re preparing for the test, then you should divide your time into small chunks and put the small topic into these chunks. You should also manage the time as per the topic hardness. If the topic is hard enough, then you should give it more time, if the topic is easy enough then you should give it a little time. Majority of students were waiting for the last night to get prepared for the exams, but it is the worst strategy. Because no one can get good grades with a one-night study. 10. Take Care of Your health and stay fit Health is wealth for everyone, whether it is a student or a professional. Health is a crucial factor behind how to get good grades. You should take care of your health during the study. Don\u2019t you ever try to avoid food during the study? Because your mind and body need nutrients for study. Therefore you need to make sure that your meals are nutritious, balanced, and varied. Because It works as a fuel for your brain and makes it more productive. Never miss breakfast before school because breakfast provides you the necessary nutrients for study longer. 11. Sleep well It is often that the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep while studying for their exams. It is proven that sleep plays a crucial role in the performance of students. If the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep, then they may not be able to keep their focus during the class study and self-study. Our brain needs proper rest. Therefore sleep helps the brain to relax for a couple of hours. Moreover, it also recharges our body and makes it ready for the study. It has been proven that the students should take at least 8 hours of sleep each night. It also helps them to stay fit and active during their study. 12. Utilize Your Textbook Textbooks are quite helpful in getting good grades. Professors and teachers assign textbooks based on some reasons. The crucial reason behind this is, textbooks works as a supplement to the lectures and discussions of the class. You should buy all your textbooks to study about the topic.Read all the material of the assignment topic it will help you to get deep knowledge of the topic. You should read everything about the topic from opening vignettes to the case studies. Also, try to figure out which topic is most critical. Also, try to highlight the most important materials in the text. It will help you to prepare for the exams. Conclusion Getting good grades in exams is not an easy task. There are some other ways too that will help you to get good grades in your exams. If you will follow these tips on how to get good grades in exams. You should not only follow these tips to get good grades. But you should also try your best to get good grades. All these tips provided by the academics help experts. There are some other ways too to get good grades without studying. One of the major ways is to attend your class on a regular basis. Because if you attend your class regularly, then you may be aware of the topic more deeply. And you can also prepare for the exams during your classes.

To score better in maths, there are few steps which you need to follow as per my understanding or opinion:- Read the concept of any topic carefully and sincerely, never try for memorizing it. Make your concept very clear.Always make notes of important formulas related to that particular related topic or chapter.Never practice for the same type of question again and again. Always pick different varieties of questions from that topic or chapter.Sometimes it takes a bit of time to solve any problem. So, never give up and try until you resolve it.Never skip any chapter. Before starting any exercise, see the examples given before exercise and try to understand (not to memorize).I\u2019ve always followed these steps in mathematics till my engineering and trust me I\u2019ve always scored good marks without paying tuition.

Well am going to tell you aboutmy earlier class - maths result, when i was in class 8 I got 71 marks out of 100 in maths. I know such types of marks are not good but atleast when i got this types of marks then also am not satisfied, may be that's the reason due to which in class ix i got 76 marks out of 80..(if you don't believe me than its fine am going to show you my class 8 result here it is)..

            "answer_text": "Math proficiency, like most topics, requires repetition and familiarity. When I need to help apprentices with various levels of mathematical aptitude as it applies to electrical work, I do my best to help them to see the pattern, giving it context. If all you see in a math problem is a bunch of strange symbols and formulas, without context, it\u2019s very hard to get a grasp on it. Believe me, I know, when I went back to school in my late 30\u2019s to learn calculus and other math classes, it was hard for me because I couldn\u2019t visualize the trig identities (this was before graphing calculators/programs), but once I could see the patterns of the identities it made it easier. But you need to do the repetitions so that you can begin to \u201csee\u201d the patterns, and that is nothing more than doing it over and over again. For example, on the job, we use Pythagorean\u2019s principle constantly for bending conduit, so I\u2019ll show the principle behind, then give the apprentice a bunch of different opportunities to use it as we are running the conduit. so he then needs to apply the math over and over again. The same thing needs to happen for your math classes, take one of the lessons and do a series of problems of that type over and over again, if there is not enough problems in your text book, go online and download more, but do them over and over again until you can easily recognize the pattern and context. Also, it helps to stick to one type of problem at a time, don\u2019t jump around too much, it\u2019ll just make it take longer to learn the different topics. And don\u2019t forget to get up occasionally and move around, it\u2019ll help the brain to rest and reset to hit it again. Good luck. \u201cmath is the language of the universe\u201d ",

Recall that many problems you have another way to prove that your answer is correct.  what the math problems help you learn to do is how to solve many different kinds of problems. of course, we all ask where am i going to use this??  i answered that over time; i.e. once i was helping my dad out with putting up a front door light. this was on a double A frame house.  we needed to know the angle to cut in order to make sure that the light was shining perpendicular to the ground.  i had no calculator, but i remembered my trig. tables and ratios!  best of luck Ron Harding Automation Test Development Engineer  Hewlett Packard Boise, ID ",

Solve the problems as much as you can it will make your calculation fast and accurate. The more important thing is to know where you stand i told this because you should know which question you should do and which one not. Practising the same type of ques is not very good so try to solve various kind of problems. By doing this you can save your time and give it to other subjects.

You have to understand the concepts in order to learn them and after this, you should also possess the analytical ability to solve. Both of them can be achieved easily through Hard-Work. What i want you to do is to just open your book, mark those chapters/units you understand and can solve easily. Now, take a paper and write those things which you find difficult. Trace them backwards. For example, if you are not able to understand trigonometry of 11th class then you should go back to 10th where it is introduced and should learn that first. If your younger brother/sister is not able to understand equations in two variables, then i would advice them to go back to linear equations in one variable and solve those questions first. For every lost concept now, there was a concept in your past which you didn\u2019t studied in your previous class. Just trace them back, learn your concepts and you will fall in love with mathematics for sure.Hard work is required. Suffer a little now in order to make your future easier my friend. And at-last, after clearing your basics, practice. practice as much as possible. Bcoz this is the only key to master mathematics. You\u2019ll surely feel the difference afterwards. Hope it helps.

When I was in 5th standard I dont have any interest in mathematics.But my father always give a homework to do addition,substraction etc problems in a specific copy.Due to scare from my father I had to solve those questions. When I moved in class 6th, I again got poor marks in mathematics. After this I was punished by my father and he took me in a tution for this. I went there and try to understant the things which were taught by them. I found that there was a competition between everyone. I tried my best. Again I change my tution due to some reason. Now that time I visited another coaching where I found a children who study in 5 come and asked me a 9th standard question of maths, i got shocked and that time I realised my mistakes. From that time My maths become a favourite subject and always play with it.From this I only want to say that nobody have power to teach and give any idea about it. You have to develope ur own interest and realised ur mistakes which u done always then u get success in mathematics. Hope u get the point.All the best ",

            "answer_text": "Make a separate register for theorems, formulae and methodologies: Maths is all about theorems, concepts and formulae, and it\u2019s always wise to keep them handy. You can read and brush them up even when you are on the move and this practice also comes to rescue when you are having a last minute revision.Solve Problems yourself: Whereas it is good to go through and understand different types of problems, it is very important to solve them yourself. Knowing theories and concept is necessary but to learn their application is inescapable if you want to score full marks in maths. You have to solve each by yourself, minimum 3-4 times over the course of time.Understand your syllabus: Understanding your portions and the weightage attached to different sections helps you in deciding how much time to dedicate to each section. For example, if you know that there will be just a 5 marks question from a particular section, you do not have to dedicate a week practicing those sums.Clean Paper and margin: The cleaner, the better. You should keep in mind that the examiner needs to understand each and every step how you have arrived at an answer and unfortunately he does not have much time to dedicate on a single problem. Keep your paper free from cutting and overwriting, and draw clean margins to do the rough work. A clean paper also reflects an uncluttered mind.Marks are in the steps: whenever you go through a solution and understand its rationale, pay special focus on how the different steps progress. You cannot cram answers and achieve full marks in maths, so just paying heed to the figures in the examples is a waste of your time. Instead you must learn the various steps involved. Remember that even if you attempt and write some steps, you will definitely secure some marks for each step, irrespective of whether your answer is correct or incorrect.Figures and Graphs: Figures and graphs can fetch you easy marks if made with a little concentration. For this, keep a ruler which has sharp and smooth side and a pencil which is well sharpened. These, if you have practised well, constitute the simplest parts of the exam and you can aim to finish this as soon as you get your paper.Finish familiar questions first: Read the question paper thoroughly before you start solving the questions. While it is natural to be stuck on the questions which you find unfamiliar but you must remember that you have to finish your examination in a stipulated time. In order to achieve 100/100 marks in maths, you much strategize to first finish the questions you know and then move on to the unfamiliar questions.",

If you believe me, try it! It really helps. For start it's enough to write (at school, everywhere ...) by smaller and smaller writing. It's easy and become natural after 2 weeks. Then try to write not with left or right tendency, but absolutely vertically. First, your writing will become a little rounded and wider, but again after about 2 weeks you'll write exactly as you wish by small, clear, vertical writing. Really, try it or ask nevermore.

(Start playing sudoku, master it.) Now if you really want that treasure you need a map, in our case it would be all the topics in your syllabus. Start with the topic which require least prerequisite knowledge, go on youtube search about the topic understand the theory behind the topic by watching youtube videos after this open your textbook check if you missed any sub-topic, if you did search for it on youtube understand it and when you are done with it start with the textbook exercise try to solve all the questions on your own don\u2019t look up the solutions immediately, try solving it on your own, take your time cause learning needs time, when you are done with solving try thinking of any other ways of solving the same questions , there always is a better way, when you are done with the textbook exercise search for advanced question on google try solving them repeat similar procedure for every topic that you have, you will soon see you are getting good at it, the learning process take time and i can\u2019t tell if you would be good at it within a week or a month but i can definetely promise you one thing it would be worth your while and if you are consistent, honest and loyal towards it, it will swing that magic wand for you and you will gain a connection to the ultimate source.

Now, how to get good grades\u2026 Firstly you got to stop thinking about good grades and marks, only then you can clear your mind and focus. Secondly when you are done with the theory -> go for the exercise, you might be thinking that I would say that do as many questions as possible and stuff like that but no, my teacher during my school days used to told us that QUALITY matters rather than QUANTITY .

But I would also highly recommend that you spend some time trying to make sure you fully understand the topic. Math is a tricky subject. It is easy to understand the topics at a high level but when you look at things more carefully, things get more confusing.  I would recommend you to go over the material very carefully before you attempt to do practice problems. But once you feel confident with the material, keep doing practice problems. That is the best way to improve your scores. ",

I can only say without any iota of doubt that practice is the only key to fetch good marks in mathematics. First, clear all your basics and concepts then just do the problems based on that chapters as much as possible. You can also set a target of at least 100 questions of a particular chapter and when you are confident, \u2019yes I can solve any problem from this topic\u2019 then move on to the next chapter and likewise do with other topics too. If you have any problem in understanding the gist of any lesson then these days everything is available on you tube and google. Type your problem on internet either on you tube or google and your problem will be resolved. But don\u2019t skip doing practice on a daily basis and do it by all your heart.Once you start to do so even you will not get to know when you are able to get good marks in a very less time. Ps-It\u2019s ok, just do only one chapter but that should be in a way that you will never forget the concept of that, ever in your life and you can solve any problem based on that particular topic whether your teacher give a question from any of the book. Do less but learn more. Thank You. ",

Math is also difficult due to the fact that numbers are in another language and your horizons on this language are constantly expanding. You have the knowledge of Techniques, Methods, and Formulae. Whereas it is good to go through and understand different types of problems, it is very important to solve them yourself. Understanding your syllabus of different sections helps you in deciding how much time to dedicate to each section. Practise, Practise, and more Practise help you to get a high score in Math. If you think math study in school not enough then you should take extra classes like home tuition for getting a good score in Math.

For scoring full marks in mathematics no need of good hand writing. It's all about presentation with accuracy. Follow these steps. In Every question must write what is given and what to find.If you are using any property or law specify first. ( Ex-by law of closure, law of commutative)If you are going for any new operation specify first. ( ex - from multiplication, after integration)Give each equation a suitable no. Like 1,2,3.After solving the problem write answer very specifically in good presentable way.Never do calculations before writing formula.Avoid mistakes and specify a space for rough work.If possible, draw diagram.I hope u find your answer.

You should understand the underlying concepts behind what you are doing. If the concepts are not clear in your mind, it is not easy to solve problems successfully. Practice problems: Study your textbooks and pay attention to the definitions. Then work on any practice problems. Solve extra problems: Practice makes perfect. This applies to math as well. If you have difficulty in solving a problem on a topic, you can improve by reading the definitions again, understanding the concepts, and solving additional problems on the same topic. Apply math to real life: Think of real-world examples where you can apply math and consider what math concepts you would need to use in these conditions. A simple real life example is grocery shopping. You need to see the price, figure percentage discount, and calculate the final price. Love what you do: If you love math, you spend extra time and effort to learn more and enjoy more. ",

And it can be only achieved when you practise it hard. In maths you don't have to apply your brain the simple trick is that to solve more number of question. I'm sure you'll definitely get good marks . So it's all about practise . In my 10th standard I met a boy who was normal in maths but his positive side was that he used to solve all kinds of question of every book either RD sharma ,NCERT, model papers etc.And in his exams he secured88/90!!!!!!So let me tell you it's all about practise. Good luck hope you'll secure good marks. Just believe on yourself and look at your positive side. Eveything will change!!!!!!!!!!! ",

You can do that withing milliseconds tooJust take the first no. 4 multiply by next in counting after 4 ,5 will come . So 4*5 is 20 that makes the first part of our answer and for the later part just square the 5 which is 25.

Be 100% sure about that. Try not to make silly mistakes in those questions which you can solve.. For that preview the ans 2 time before proceeding towards the next one 3)do not expect a very heavy marks in maths no matter how good you have done in ur last exam\u2026always think that - \u201cI couldn't solve 100 marks out of 100 its all right.. But If I can solve 80 out of 100 then I have to get 80 marks which I have solved\u201d 4)sing ur feavrate song in your mind while solving a problem that keeps you calm.. And stable ..

Tackling past exam series is one way to go, and to get better at it, preferably under simulated exam conditions At  its core, Math entails and necessitates a thorough understanding of  each and every   variable, and their inter-relationship, in the formulas  and equations. You also need to spend an inordinate amount of time to understand and work on the proofs, in most instances. In     class, you simply need to pay attention to all the worked examples   as    shown by your lecturer or professor on the white board, or from    your   textbook, and then you put your acquired knowledge into  your   solution   working, covering a myriad variety of new problems given in  class by  your lecturer professor,  or taken out from your textbook, all  on your  own.

But, I sat down one day and started cranking out math problems. Granted, I was in elementary school, so this math was very basic and easy to teach yourself. But the best advice I can give you is practice. Eventually, you will start to see the patterns of math and it will become almost swcond nature. It's just like practicing for a sport or a play. You can practice your plays or your lines, and eventually they will make sense and you will have them memorized. Keep with it and practice. ",

You must take note of all the theorems, methodologies and formulas involved in each subject. As we all know that math is all about the concepts, theorems & formulae so, it is always wise if you keep them practical. You must go through & understand different model question problems. It is important to solve all the problems by yourself. If you have to score full marks in math, you should know to apply the applications. You have to solve these problems by yourself, for at least 3-4 times. You have to understand the syllabus & the marks think about attached to the different sections and then you must decide on how much time you must prepare for each portions. When you are solving these math problem papers, you may come to the position which you cannot solve them. Then you ask your friends or teachers for the help.

If you are willing to truly understand any topic you have to know the roots (for math would be philosophical thinking, the existence of logic and the concept of number), the core (number systems, set theory, arithmetics), then the branches like geometry, trigonometry, algebra, calculus and so on.

            "answer_text": "Hi. My comment would seem a bit vague but try understand. Give it a shot. I loved mathematics and still I am a follower of this subject. \u201cFeel mathematics\u201d. I did that and I will explain it. Try to relate it with the real world. See all around. Everything is a function of mathematics or statistics. If you are good in languages then translate the concepts into different languages. This helps a lot. For example - While learning probability, understand it as \u201c\u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e\u201d. The meaning of probability is Sambhavana. This means through this concept you try to find the sambhavana of anything whether it will be there or not. Differentiation - \u201c\u0905\u0932\u0917 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e\u201d. That is why this concept differentiate everything into smaller segments. Integration - \u201c\u091c\u094b\u095c\u0928\u093e\u201d. That is why this concept integrates everything into a comparatively large value. Limits - \u201c\u0938\u0940\u092e\u093e\u201d. This is the reason this concept results into the answers within a boundary. I always try to relate the concepts to things around and it has always worked for me. I was never a student who could mug up everything without understanding. So, I started feeling the subject to understand it. And regular practice will train your mind to remember the method and the relation you have established for a longer period of time. All the best. ",

Rest is all application. Knowing where to apply what, when and how. People with good numerical ability are always found good in maths. So keep your free times with play of numbers in mind. Random calculation, multiplication, subtraction and division in mind during your free times can improve your love towards numbers and better speed while actually doing some numerical problems. Next thing is to think logically. For this, practice will help a lot. Logical thinking will develop only when one performs many tasks which needs logical thinking. Wire your brain in the way which it thinks, analyse with logics. Finally know about application of the formulas. While learning every formulas, think about where all you could use them in real life. Relate these formulas with random aspect of daily life and link them to any of the purpose in daily life. Almost all mathematical formulas have either one or the other real life application. It is us to find out where and how we can use them. And the golden rule to score better is practice as much as you can. Maths is such a subject where one cannot excel or increase the speed without practice. One cannot be expected to be super quick in solving a problem unless he had used the formula to solve the same before. And be one who won\u2019t give up easily on a numerical problem in first chance. Think, think, try once again till you get a clue how to solve this. The brain will gradually develop in competitive mode where it won\u2019t give up on any tasks given to it unless it reaches an answer. ",

Afterthat,do as much extra sums as u can from any sample paper or u can go for previous year question papers. By doing this,u will learn the technique of how to solve the sums. When u will put extra efforts to solve extra sums(not from ur textbook) ur brain will be able to think some more techniques about how can u solve a sum in different ways. The basic purpose of textbook is just to make u familiar with basics and concepts\u2026.now thinking a little beyond this,can make u score higher.what u have to do is just make the use of concepts wisely and practice as much u can. I\u2019m not perfect in english. So,sorry for grammatical mistakes\u2026.i did my best to guide u on right path. THANKS\u2026\u2026 :) ",

If you read the classical texts of \u201cEuclid's Elements\u201d and \u201cPhilosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\u201d by Isaac Newton you will understand maths from the legends who laid done the stepping stone of mathematics. We were taught maths by just taking few portions from these books and taught like very boring subject. If you read once these books, you will start to think like how those legends thought before centuries and discovered those magical Euclidian geometry as well as differential calculus. Start from the beginning of mathematics, why it came into existence. Start from numbers, its manipulation, then geometry, calculus etc. I am sure that not only maths became easy but also you start to love maths. If you simply want to excel in maths, ask any maths teacher, they will tell you to practice, practice, practice\u2026\u2026.. There is no short cut here, focus and practice. Hope it helps a ",

Solving umpteen problems in Mathematics will somehow land you in a kingdom where you will fall in love with the subject. But prior to practise, comprehensive understanding of the concepts is mandatory. Working hard is essential but what is more essential is working hard in the right direction and appropriate quantity.

The reason you love math is because there is no definitions, theory construction nothing to remember as sentences. Math comes well for you when you understand it. So take the second step towards achieving high marks by understanding math. Whatever you are going to solve, first understand the problems. With my experience high marks in math comes only because of high amount of practice. Practice!Practice!Practice! Take all the help you need but keep practising it until you thoroughly understand the concept. After that, solve many question papers and check your answers by yourself. Award yourself marks for the right answers. So every time you write you know if you are improving or staying at the same level or if your prepartion isn\u2019t sufficient. I hope this helps! ;) All the best!! ",

First, understand the concept, DO NOT PROCEED FURTHER until and unless you don't have full grip over the topic. 2. Second, practice thoroughly, once you have a good grip over the concept all you need is practice. You will forget everything if you don't practice plus you will understand every topic nicely. 3. NEVER EVER STUDY MATHS JUST BECAUSE ITS A SUBJECT, Maths is life, enjoy every moment of maths. Let it be you god. Respect it and then you will surely become a master. 4. Please do make every single question of the N.C.E.R.T book. R.S Agarwal and other side book have good questions plus the quantity is also good. They are good for practice but if you want quality questions then go for N.C.E.R.T books.  I hope that this will help you.... ",

            "answer_text": "First of all do realise that u need to study maths not just for grades but as an exercise and nutrition for brain. Dont take it as a forced job but as a requirement. Keep in mind its a very easy subject as it is logical and you have the best brain to solve a problem. Start with basics and read and comprehend and let the essense and logic behind every rule and problem seep in your brain. No need to cram each and every formula but only the basic ones . Try to link every concept to its roots. This way your brain will have enough ease to process a problem without having to think \u2018what was that formula'. In the initial stage refer to books which explain the topics in depth IN EASY WAY for you to understand by yourself. Follow up with illustrative examples. There is no compulsion that you have to solve each and every question by yourself. Try out each problem by yourself and then go through the solution by YOURSELF. There is NO issue like SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOURSELF. The main purpose is to grasp the purpose and way of approaching a problem. For classes 6\u201312,RS Agarwal and RD SHARMA are really good and complete. DO GIVE EMPHASIS on books like SK Goyal(the one which contains theory too and not just questions) in case you want to go an extra mile for competetive exams and for acquiring really good skills. Hope this is helpful. Advice and Suggestions appreciated. ",

First, understand the concept, DO NOT PROCEED FURTHER until and unless you don't have full grip over the topic. 2. Second, practice thoroughly, once you have a good grip over the concept all you need is practice. You will forget everything if you don't practice plus you will understand every topic nicely. 3. NEVER EVER STUDY MATHS JUST BECAUSE ITS A SUBJECT, Maths is life, enjoy every moment of maths. Let it be you god. Respect it and then you will surely become a master. 4. Please do make every single question of the N.C.E.R.T book. R.S Agarwal and other side book have good questions plus the quantity is also good. They are good for practice but if you want quality questions then go for N.C.E.R.T books. I hope that this will help you.... ",

Until I got moved up to advanced math, and that's when I started saying, 'Hate', next to math. It's true, it makes no sense AT FIRST, but most have an answer, or may not. I was struggling with math this year, till it was close to final exams so I knew I had to do SOMETHING! quick! What I did was.... 1.) Study on your own a few hours a day, squeezing it anytime you can. Review all your notes, look through your textbook, research online, etc. Just so you could actually understand what you are learning. 2.) Ask a friend/family member to help you study. Better yet, find someone you trust that does very well in that course. That way, they can easily teach you what you are not getting. 3.) What helped me the most was get help from your teacher. Luckily, my teacher gave me and people opportunities to see her in the morning (before school), lunch, or even after school. Just ask a bunch of questions you don't get, and they will surely help you. I suggest if you are THAT desperate and none of these are helping you, get a tutor. But what helped me the most was the third one, get help from a teacher. Hope that helps! :] ",

But since being told that there is that possibility I have been working even harder. Corbett Maths is a great website where they literally explain every topic in maths with videos. By trying exam questions it really does consolidate your learning. So just practice, practice and practice! That\u2019s what truly helped me and since then I have really improved in maths.

If you don't understand basics perfectly you will land in difficulties. First try to solve your textbook problems. I know you may feel difficulty in solve.If you feel difficulty, try to solve your previous year textbook problems. Even if you feel difficulty try 2 two years. If same happens try 3 years back books.You may feel this won't work. but this idea worked for me . This seems lengthy process but you will get fruitful results. I just takes some months of time but you don't feel difficulty in solving maths problems anymore. Practice the problems until you get perfection. ",

Books like RD Sharma focus on the same type of problems which require the use of the same formulas, try to broaden your scope.3.)Develop and analytical thinking process, don\u2019t try to answer questions by remembering formulas, instead, look at the question and try to create the formula required to solve the question.4.)Practice at least 10 maths problems everyday. This is surely going to improve your arithmetic skills, boost your self-confidence and reduce the chances of getting a wrong answer. ",

Do word problems, basic problems, past exam papers for your class and so when you see it on your exam/test you\u2019ll have already done it. With math they cannot add so much variation to the question because its very basic conceptual stuff. You must practice all types of problems so that when you get one you\u2019ll know exactly what to do. You were not very specific with your problem but also know that you can\u2019t simply memorise in maths you have to actually understand whats going on and why. This will make you more interested as well as when you are faced with more challenging problems youll know which part of your math learning to apply since you get it . ",

This comes through practice.Learning from mistakes. As with any subject, it is vital to revise the mistakes made so that you do not make the same mistake again.Memorise. Maths formulaes are the cornerstone of all math questions. You have to know them like the back of your hand so that you will be able to know what formulas to use and apply for different questions.With that said, best of luck in studying! ",

In that case I'll consult YouTube and go on Khan Academy or PatrickJMT's website for all of your math basics from SAT math to Calculus III.  If you decide to take a Numerical Analysis course, I would definitely advise you to learn Python a programming language before delving in the material since Numerical techniques are better appreciated if you got your hands dirty and programmed some the root finding techniques such as the Bisection method. Lastly don't burn yourself out, not only its bad for your ego but also burned out brains is bad for business. ",

Simultaneously, do it for each topics and chapter.once u complete all chapters u feel easy.Then start learning other chapters that you feel tough.Do the same process.If u feel hard to learn by yourself ,use online resources like Google,youtube videos,Bijus etc to learn, so that you can learn very easily.

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are some tips for scoring high in math?\u201d Know that math is the pursuit of truth, often through the elimination of falsehoods. And that sets the rules of the math game for achieving the highest possible score in all sorts of situations. For example with a multiple choice test you do NOT start out trying to figure out the right answer. The first step mathematically is to quickly eliminate the wrong answers. In that way narrowing down the list of possibly correct answers. Often times what starts out as the 5 given answers quickly gets narrowed down to only 2 possibles. So even tossing a coin at that point gets you a decent grade. With the use of just a bit of knowledge your grade then moves up to the high B range with very little effort. We mathematicians work by the process of efficient elimination of the false, like Sherlock Holmes does in his investigations. So come at the math problems you\u2019re being scored on as mysteries where the teachers or whoever are trying to fool you with their included falsehoods. You\u2019ll know your doing it right when you spot errors even the teacher missed. Something that raises questions about the question itself or the supposedly correct answer. ",

First of all you must need a really good teacher who have depth knowledge and full command over subject because if your teacher isn't perfect how would you be. Then your good teacher will suggest you some extra material for practice after you complete the NCERTs(MUST). Believe me in 12th board not even a single question comes out of ncert so practice complete ncert books with atleast two times revision. After that, if you have completed your ncert then you can go for some extra questions for just security purpose and for boost your own confidence.

According to me . teaching is the final step for study . or practice of knowledge . today most of the reading in the form of practice we go to school for practice the knowledge . one of the best step to practice knowledge is teaching . teach whatever you have read or understand to others . then that knowledge turn as skill you have gain by practice . but for invention . you do not need any practice . invention needs to creative mind . for creative mind we need much time and tolarance to invent new . this part it for special persons like scientist .

If you already do the assigned homeworks, I suggest adding problems. Head over the khanacademy to get some practice with more foundational subjects if you are having trouble applying them to your current subject.

It\u2019s completely common to make mistakes on these subjects, since the level of complexity is higher than the others.If you can, you should dedicate a little more time in maths. You learn that, you can learn anything with much more ease.Thats it, hope I\u2019ve helped! And sorry for some mistakes the text might have, English is not my first language. See ya! ",

Eventually unknowingly u will fall love in maths and solve minimum 80% of the problem withput seeing note book. The skipped problems you can ask it with your friends, parents ,teachers and even with me. I too help you if I know about that problem. Sharing knowledge is life !!",

Best way to do that is to learn vedic maths. One of the few books best prefered would be Arihant. Half-part done. Other half. 2. Any topic you encounter, try your level best to practice as much as variations of the questions as possible. Prefered books, R.S.Agarwal However it is an absolute necessity to comprehend any concept newly learned completely. Never leave a concept half-learned or pertained with a doubt. If somehow you're not available with external help then every or any book that you study always has its concepts described in the text of the begining of the chapter, refer them and learn complete concepts. It might be time taking but it is necessary to keep your concepts crystal clear. P.S : A trick proposed is to attempt a question at most 4 times but never less, till you get the answer. It doesn't matter if you do not reach to conclusion even by the fourth attempt. If so, thereafter, mark the question as a doubt to be cleared further later. However each attempt should be tried with honest dedication. Practice is the key. ",

Solve as many questions on that concept as you possibly can, as you solve, keep thinking of the basic concept and how it relates to the particular question you're solving. This will make it stick!

Dont let alot of time pass minus going through the covered topics because you will always start unnderstanding it from the start and you have forgotten all that you had mastered before. And from this continued practise, your speed in the exam will be better since the questions will not require so much time to think about. Math has more chances of being passed if you attain the confidence from continued practice. ",

I used to write half an hour before solving and these helps you to remember the formulas as well as you can solve problems without much difficulty. When you don't know formulas or basics you get frustrated while solving. Thus, first try to clear basics and learn the formulas. And never study maths when you are bored. Start when you are in fresh mood. Drink lot of water while studying. Eat chocolates. All the best buddy. Hope these helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "This might not be exactly the answer you want to hear, and I'm not insulting you, since I don't think it's your fault. I think a big part of the problem with people who \"just don't get math\" is that they were introduced to too much, too fast, before their maturity level matched the subject matter. They struggle, they don't get it, they struggle some more, they don't get it, until they reach the point where they throw up their hands and say, \"I'm just not a math person.\" I've seen lots of students struggle with subjects one year and then step back, try the next year, and excel. I think this is where high school (at least in the US) has disadvantages with respect to college. In college you can drop and retry next semester or next year if you like, but in high school you really can't. You might want to have a chat with your guidance counselor or a trusted teacher to see if there's some way you can hold off a bit. ",

Make sure you can solve basic sums of all the chapters and then progress on to the harder ones. ",
