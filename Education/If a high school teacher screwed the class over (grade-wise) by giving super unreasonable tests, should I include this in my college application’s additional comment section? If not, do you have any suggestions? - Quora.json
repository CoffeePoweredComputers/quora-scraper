            "answer_text": "If you have a particularly low grade in one class, and all the rest of your grades are high (say a D among a field of As), you should comment on it. You should NOT, under any circumstances, blame a teacher for your bad grade. You should acknowledge that the class was really challenging for you, and that you worked hard to try to get a good grade but came up short. This taught you about the importance of time management, preparedness, developing good study habits, whatever. Basically, take this negative and spin it into a positive. You\u2019ve experienced a failure despite trying your best. What did you learn? How will you take that forward in your studies? Don\u2019t play the blame game though. Ultimately your grade is your responsibility, and doing poorly is no one\u2019s fault but yours (as far as anyone reviewing applications is concerned, at least). The only case where this might not be true is if there is a documented case against this teacher where the grades were assigned unfairly based on gender or race or some other type of discrimination and you were victim to this behavior. In this case the teacher was probably fired for cause and/or there is some type of documentation with the school regarding this. It would then be appropriate to ask an administrator of the school, perhaps your counselor or a principal, to include a letter with your application explaining the circumstances of the bad grade (though I would expect that the grade would not have been allowed to stand in such circumstances).

Before you consider accusing one of your teachers of administering unreasonably difficult tests on your college application, you should ask yourself the following questions: Will the college admissions officers who are reviewing my application naturally tend to side more with (a) students, or (b) teachers?Will the college admissions officers who are reviewing my application be more inclined to (a) credit my assessment that the tests were unreasonable, or (b) believe that I\u2019m exaggerating the difficulty level in order to justify a bad grade?In other words \u2026 Even if your assessment of this teacher is accurate, there\u2019s not a chance in the universe the admissions officers will believe you. Nothing good can come from complaining about your former teacher on a college application. You will draw attention to your failures, rather than your successes. You will come across as being a negative person. You will come across as being a person who shifts blame to other people instead of accepting responsibility. Don\u2019t do it. (2) \u201cIf not, do you have any suggestions?\u201d Focus on your successes, not your failures. If there\u2019s something in your transcript that requires explanation, the only kind of explanation that will have any impact on the admissions committee will have to be based on verifiable facts, not your own unsupported opinion.
