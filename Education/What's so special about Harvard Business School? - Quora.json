            "answer_text": "There is so much that no one could list it all on Quora. The beauty of a globally ranked school like Harvard is its diversity and culture. You meet people from all walks of life. People who inspire you to be better and do better. At a school like this you will never starve as there will always be food for thought. Harvard alumni are proud people, and rightfully so. The extremely exclusive school only has a 4.59% acceptance rate and boasts of 36 million in scholarships just for the business school in 2017.  Image source; Poets & Quants Here are just a few of those benefits of attending Harvard. Scholarships: According to Harvard\u2019s official website: \u2018International students receive exactly the same financial aid as Americans. In fact, approximately 70 percent of our students receive some form of aid, and more than 50 percent receive need\u2013based scholarships and pay an average of $12,000 per year. Twenty percent of parents pay nothing. No loans required.\u2019 This means that getting into Harvard would mean some form of scholarship for you. However, when it comes to a full-ride, Harvard has many options available for you to try and work out a plan. The business school could also offer you employment to help you find your tuition for Harvard and living expenses during the course. Infrastructure: 33 separate buildings on 40 acres of property along the Charles River makes Harvard Business School a self -sustained community in itself. Okay maybe that was a bit extra but the college has most things that a university would offer you. HBS has its own state-of-the-art fitness center, a massive library, and a chapel. Just to give you an example of how over-the-top Harvard\u2019s infrastructure is, it has 17 million volumes and 55 miles of shelving. No one\u2019s ever going to need all of them, but they are there. All-expense paid vacations: So maybe Harvard doesn\u2019t really give its students all-expense paid vacations to foreign countries. But it gives something so close. 70% of Harvard students end up studying abroad or doing an internship in a different country on Harvard\u2019s dime, and time. Honorable mentions: Harvard is in Boston. Close to Boston. Either way, the college has close proximity to one of the most diverse cities in America. Boston has historical importance and is a very young city too. The average age in Boston drops 10 years every move-in day in the fall. Almost all of Harvard\u2019s students live on campus. The culture is truly as amazing as your imagination is telling you. With the whole college living on campus, something is always going on in the area, be it parties or protests. Last but not least, the weather is bomb. It\u2019s always changing, keeps you on your toes. The statewide weather motto is: If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes. ",

            "answer_text": "We have to begin by recognizing that not all people consider HBS the best graduate business school. So let\u2019s not launch a lot of contentious comments about how Harvard is actually inferior to Wharton, Chicago, Stanford, Carnegie-Mellon, MIT Sloan, or any other leading B school. Independent and unbiased groups evaluate B schools annually, and publish reports of the rankings they compute. Typically, HBS ranks #1 on most or all of the surveys. So it is legitimate to ask why. First and foremost is the faculty. Very, very selective to get a teaching job at HBS, and the faculty are ruthless in deciding who gets advanced to associate prof., asst prof., and certainly full professor. They are brilliant, deeply knowledgeable, very quick thinkers, experts at drawing out opinions and ideas, superb at spotting flaws or inadequacies or foolishness in students arguments and ideas and suggestions. In a gentle and subtle way, they force students to become creative and critical thinkers, and to prepare themselves daily with extensive new knowledge and well-thought-out ideas. Hard to rank what is second, because a number of factors are equally important in establishing Harvard\u2019s apparent superiority. The curriculum. Rebuilt and enlarged every year, by the largest research and case writing faculty anywhere. I doubt that anyone has ever counted the number of case studies HBS has on file, but it is certainly up in the seven figures. And none of them has a \u201cright answer\u201d or a \u201cschool solution\u201d. Each case has multiple issues and problems that the students must discover, and myriad factors which the company should consider or which limit what the company could do. And the recommendations needed range from individual actions to broad and enduring policies.The alumni. Alumni achievements, and positions held, are far more abundant and far higher for Harvard, than for any other B school. That is in part because Harvard has more alumni, living and dead, than any other graduate B school. But even looking at individual by individual, HBS produces way more CEOs, business founders, builders of gigantic fortunes, people who change industries, political leaders, and everything else of prominence, than any other B school. Maybe all the others combined. No other B school has produced, for example, a US President (Bush II) or a self-made muti-billionaire Mayor of NYC (Bloomberg).The student body. Tremendous diversity, all people of very high accomplishment prior to returning to grad school, top academic records and intelligence scores, every background and career path and nationality one can imagine. Energetic, inquisitive, creative, competitive, and smart as hell. Only the faculty are smarter.The facilities. Baker Library is world-famous for its collections and unpublished material. The classrooms and study areas are phenomenal. Student residences are right on campus, next door to classroom buildings. Everything on campus is classy and elegant, and highly functional.And there is more, but I hope you get the idea. There is very good reason for the intense competition to be admitted to HBS, and the alumni have every right to feel distinctive and proud of the education they achieved there. ",
