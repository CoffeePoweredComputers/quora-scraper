            "answer_text": "It depends somewhat on the reason for it. Is this a sports physical? Yearly physical? Is it being done by a doctor/nurse the school brings in? Your private pediatrician/gp? That will impact what exactly is looked at. In general, some basics are eyes, ears, nose, etc. Listen to your heart and lungs. Check your reflexes and joints. Palpate around your abdomen and soft tissue. As boys get ready to enter puberty, and once it\u2019s started, it\u2019s fairly common for some sort of genital exam and hernia check to be done. The hernia check is pretty simple. The doctor places a finger beside your scrotum and asks you to turn and cough. The genital exam could be fairly brief or fairly thorough. Again this depends on the physician, and the setting. In general they\u2019re going to visually look over your private parts to asses your tanner stage (how developed you are). They\u2019ll check your penis briefly. If you have a foreskin they\u2019ll retract it back and forth a few times. They\u2019ll also check your testicles for lumps since testicular cancer is most common in boys/men from puberty to 35. If they have concerns about your development, or they want to get a very precise tanner stage measurement, they could use an orchidometer to measure the size of your testicles. But that would be fairly infrequent, but not unheard of. ",

            "answer_text": "I recently witnessed my 14yo son physical examination. The doctor told him to strip to his underwear. The doc then checked eyes, ears, mouth, arms and legs. Then doc pulled my son\u2019s underwear down to his ankles and told him to step out of them. He then checked each ball individually for lumps. Then doc held my sons penis and pulled the foreskin back to check it retracts ok. Doc said his foreskin was a little tight and called me over to take a look. Doc then told me to pull the foreskin back so i was aware of the situation. He told son to pull it back a couple of times a week for 6 weeks and if no looser to return and he will cut it. ",
