            "answer_text": "Hi, I am an educational consultant at Global Medical Foundation who has helped 350+ students get admission for MBBS in abroad. I have already written a blog post on this on the website of Global Medical Foundation. When you think about Europe, countries like Spain, Italy, Germany comes to mind. But let\u2019s check which countries in Europe do Indian students actually go to study MBBS -   As you can see, only 2 countries stand out - Russia and Ukraine. In my opinion, doing MBBS from Ukraine is best and most cost effective among all the countries in Europe. The Universities offer 6 year MD course which is equivalent to MBBS in India. There are many MCI Approved universities in Ukraine which have very good MCI Passing Percentage. MBBS in Ukraine is a great option. The Universities in Ukraine are either at State level or at National level, meaning that these are Government universities. Moreover, these universities are very old, some being more than 200 years old. Since you are getting admission in universities with such great stature, you are provided with a better opportunity in Ukraine. Here are some reviews of students doing their MBBS from Ukraine:  The best university in my opinion is Vinnitsa National Medical University in Ukraine. The university had a FMGE passing percentage of approx. 23% between 2012\u201318 which is one of the highest. Also, there are other very good universities like Bukovinian State Medical Univeristy, V.N.Karazin National Medical University, Ternopil National Medical University, Kharkiv National Medical University. There is no easy way to success. You need to study hard and work harder than you have to achieve success in the field of medicine. The education quality is Ukraine is of a very high standard given that you will get admission in Government medical universities which are about 100\u2013200 years old. At the end of the day, remember, its your hard work that will get you across the line. ",
