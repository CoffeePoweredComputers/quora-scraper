            "answer_text": "Definitely. Not only there is the thrice-goddamned communication range of 30 points, making any meaningful interaction with the normies impossible. There is an eponymous French saying (whose actual name escapes my mind) that if the IQ of two persons differ more than 20 points, after half an hour of discussion both are convinced the other guy is an idiot. But also certain personality traits which contribute the preference of solitude. This is a shameless snippet of Bruno Campello de Souza\u2019s excellent answer. This is a graph of the Big Five personality traits as function of IQ.  The asset of the Big Five is that the traits selected are known to be heavily genetically determined. But another asset is that they have a strong correlation on MBTI - which is a much better known typification in everyday psychology. The graph demonstrates that extraversion and agreeableness are inversely related to IQ, while openness is positively related, and conscientiousness makes a \u2018V\u2019 curve. In the MBTI extraversion correlates to the E-I axis and the agreeableness on F-T axis. People scoring high on B5 \u2018E\u2019 are likely to be extroverts in the MBTI, and those scoring high on \u2018a\u2019 tend to be feelers in the MBTI. Openness correlates to the N-S axis on MBTI, and high score on Openness indicates intuition on MBTI. This would predict that INTJ and INTP would be over-represented among the highly intelligent. And that is exactly the case. Low score on agreeableness (being Thinker) also indicates lower scores on empathy and altruism. [Ayn Rand would love this discovery]. Having a low score on agreeableness is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it enables independent thinking and prevents herd-mindedness. On the other hand it makes you a bad schmoozer and bad on fitting in. And I myself noticed this herd-mindedness and its correlation on being part of a group and socializing - and how the most intelligent of my classmates tended to be unpopular like me - already as a kid. I also noted if you have low score on Openness (being S in MBTI), you are likely to be a bully. If you have a high score on Openness (being N in MBTI) you are likely to be a weirdo or a freak in the eyes of the other people. My childhood and youth were extremely lonely. I was an inch-treaded nut among metric bolts. Only sports - swimming - brought me friends and decent human relationships. But there is one sad fallacy, We think people are the same, and we tend to think everyone are similar as we are. My mom said me when I complained I was so different from the others \u201cHoney, you are just similar as the other kids. Now be pretty and go playing with them.\u201d I never figured out if she was clueless, stupid or just mean. Since intelligence usually means high scores on Openness and low scores on Extroversion and Agreeableness, it means highly intelligent people tend to think everyone is alike to them: tolerant, nice, kind, accepting of others, open-minded, liberal, magnanimous and smart. They aren\u2019t. You very soon learn kids are mean, intolerant, cruel, petty, stupid, vindictive and frivolous. If you are lucky, you are left alone and experience the awful loneliness. If you are unlucky, you are singled out and bullied. The kids are small psychopaths and they eagerly tear you into pieces. You quickly realize that you are predestined to be alone. It isn\u2019t your assumed lack of social skills. It is because of you being different. If you are lucky, you can find a group of kids or youth who are within your communication range and be likely to think like you, have interest in similar things like you, have hobbies like you, and understand your patterns of thinking. Lika barn leka b\u00e4st. For me, it was the swimming community. Swimmers - and other individual athletes - tend to be bright and smart, in contrast to team athletes. If an athlete is a bully, he is without an exception an ice hockey, football or some other team sport player. Did anyone say Dunning-Kruger effect? It is again another reason for the communication range issues. Because you are more intelligent than the others and you are simply different, it is YOU who is seen as the idiot, the stupid, the incompetent, the dullard. You are aware of your potential, but the other guys aren\u2019t aware of theirs. And because they sorely lack talent, they are likely to overestimate theirs and underestimate yours. The situation is flipped over in a sick manner. If you are lucky, you are simply ousted off their companionship. If you are not, you get harassed and bullied. I have often been asked \u201cwhy don\u2019t I use my talent for the common good of the humankind\u201d and \u201cwhy don\u2019t you help people with your gifts but you selfishly make your own life cosy and comfortable\u201d. The reason is simple. Why would I aid my enemies? I know exactly what it is to be a subject of social exclusion. Why should I care a fsck of those people now? I rather live hedonistically and do things which are fun and insane in the same way, and rather socialize with my own two tribes than even try socializing with the normies. I have been told many enough times by the normies that I do not belong in. The life is simply too short to be spent on unsatistying or toxic relationships and companionships. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally feel lonely and alienated 99 percent of the time. Whether this is due to high intellect, your guess is better than mine. Most of my days are spent placating to the needs and wants of neurotypicals who look down on me. This is evident in my place of employment, and sometimes even in my personal life. It's easy to characterize a person as stupid from having limited exposure to them, yet it's not easy to see the person behind the shell. I've never felt like I truly belong in neurotypical society, and I attribute this to the fact that most of what we know as truth and acceptable (from a societal perspective) is dictated to us through the media, through our upbringings, and our respective communities. We are force fed our values and told that there is no other way of thinking, organized religion does this with an iron fist. When true and false become binary that's usually when I question things. Uniformity is a given in order to establish solidarity between peoples and communities, but when something deviates from the conventional \"norm\" that's when it threatens the fragile framework of that societal structure. Most people I meet on a daily basis think quite linearly, never posing questions, never questioning biases, never thinking objectively. When two individuals who have opposing perspectives meet I've noticed one of two things: 1. Both parties agree to disagree, and never bring said differences up again in conversation. 2. Both parties react with animosity towards each other and find it hard to reach common ground. However, there is a third approach, when discourse is done properly each party examines the fallacies and gaps in their ideologies and only then can they spot similarities with the other person and solidarity can form. But alas, on this age of egotism and anti intellectualism being \"right\" is more important than being empirical. I digress To answer your question, high intellect is something that is a double edged sword. The more curious you are the more you want to learn about the world, when you learn more about the world you shift your paradigms while others (quite often those around you) stay stagnant and fall to cognitive dissonance. This will leave the person who is learning and growing isolated and feeling alien. ",

            "answer_text": "Given evidence from some data of mine, I\u2019d say \u201cyes\u201d. In a study with 1,383 adults from Pernambuco, Brazil, IQ was negatively associated to both Extraversion and Agreeableness.  However, the self-evaluation of social skills as a function of IQ for a similar group of 1,777 individuals showed the following pattern:  So, it would appear that, indeed, high Intelligence is associated to being alone more as preference than due to a perceived lack of social skills. One can speculate that the following mechanisms and processes might be at play: With a higher IQ, there is a tendency for a higher level of working memory and also long-term recall, as well as speed of processing, which grants the ability to generate more and better mental imagery, thereby creating an incentive for \u201cdaydreaming\u201d or \u201czoning out\u201d (think of having your own personal \u201cmental holodeck\u201d);IQ is, by definition, the capacity to deal with abstract thinking, making the intellectually gifted more prone to detach from concrete experiences;The things that many of the Gifted are most interested in are not the things that attract the vast majority of people, the same happening with their life and work experiences, so that the highly intelligent may not find much in common with the majority of people and vice-versa;Being a minority by definition, a relevant portion of the Gifted might be the object of prejudice, making them more prone to withdrawing from social interactions and/or being less inclined to be less empathetic or altruistic;The differences in the size and breadth of vocabulary between the Gifted and most people might make communication more difficult or cumbersome;The Gifted can, at times, become frustrated, impatient or irritated with the slower and/or more limited intelligence of normal individuals, something which can come from elitism, self-importance, sense of superiority and even Narcissism, but can also arise from honest exhaustion from continuously having to wait for, explain to, correct, and accept errors from most of the people one interacts with.A combination of the above things is possible, as well as other elements I have not considered. Remember that we do not even know how much the findings from Pernambuco, Brazil, can be extrapolated or not to other parts of the World. Like a lot of things in Human and Social Sciences: its complicated. ",

            "answer_text": "We have had experiences that others haven\u2019t, and people don\u2019t necessarily imagine the consequences of that. Often, we are put on a pedestal, which has some benefits, but is certainly lonely and puts us under pressure that we can\u2019t escape no matter what we do later. Staying up there is difficult and lonely. Falling from grace is painful, earns us humiliation, and is usually still lonely, because you aren\u2019t just welcomed back to the crowd. You\u2019re still \u201cthat kid.\u201d It\u2019s great to be accomplished in school, unless you can feel the resentment around you, unless it makes you a target for expressions of resentment (bullying, teasing, intimidation, jokes, anger, sadness). It\u2019s hard to laugh off even the mildest jabs when there\u2019s this entire atmosphere of resentment hanging around you all day, every day. Other people tend to look at specific incidents and say, \u201chey, don\u2019t worry, that wasn\u2019t so bad!\u201d How do you explain how hard it is to anticipate that people are gonna tease you or jokingly/not jokingly hate on you as soon as you get that latest test back, and the next test, and the next\u2026 How do you explain the pressure of knowing that your friend can get anywhere from a 70% to a 90% and not attract attention, but for you, anything less than 90% means ridicule from your classmates, and anything above that means resentment? My friend tried to tell me recently that I didn\u2019t need to care, that I could have teased people back and no one would have hated me. For me to have believed that at the time I was in school, I would have needed to be a completely different person. Not everyone would have felt the same in my shoes, that much is true. Not every intelligent person even stands out in the first place! That doesn\u2019t make my experience false, or my fault. The fact that I could have reacted differently doesn\u2019t change the truth that I could and did sense resentment, that I did become a target, that I didn\u2019t understand social rules well enough to figure out that I could tease people back, that the attention was painful even though I was proud of myself, because I never really knew when I would have to defend myself and/or comfort someone who didn\u2019t do as well, because I personally hated to be the cause or prompting event for suffering. But even though I know my truth, I don\u2019t know very many people who can relate. Without someone to say, \u201cAw, yeah, I totally know what you mean. When that happened to me, I \u2014,\u201d it\u2018s just difficult to validate myself, and that is what\u2019s lonely about being intelligent. It\u2019s what happens to intelligent people that makes (some of) them lonely, and also the scarcity of people who understand us. Hope that helps! Katie\u2764\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. As long as we acknowledge that there exists a huge difference between being alone and being lonely and that even the definition of the term, being alone, may not be so obvious, especially here in the 21st century, then I would say that for a number of reasons, intelligent people are more likely to be alone. Intelligent people certainly have a much more difficult time finding people with whom they are intellectually compatible. Intelligent people also tend to be somewhat eccentric. They worry very little about conforming their behavior in order to meet the standards which typically define what is normal nor are they very much inclined to satisfy the expectations of those around them. So even when they find people with whom they may be intellectually compatible, they still need to be able to withstand each other's eccentricities. And then even if they found these other smart people whose eccentricities they could tolerate or even enjoy, intelligent people are rarely, if ever, bored enough to feel any great need to socialize, as the term is conventionally defined. As long as they have a good book with them or some easy access to the internet, intelligent people are very happy in the company of the endless number of writers with whom, in their own way, they regularly converse. And always having a cell phone in your pocket has made defining what it means to be alone much more difficult. The solitude one would experience inside a cave 50,000 years ago if you overslept and members of your clan went hunting and left you behind is not the same solitude as sleeping late on a Saturday morning say 30 years ago in an empty house with a telephone and television set, nor are these scenarios remotely similar to the so-called solitude one experiences today as long as that cell phone is in your pocket. So in the 21st century, if you want to obtain the attention of an intelligent person who appears to be alone, you may find yourself competing with Aristotle, the author of a classic novel, a challenging logical paradox, the news of the latest scientific discovery, the details of a relatively obscure battle fought during the Hundred Years\u2019 War, or some story about living conditions in some remote part of Africa. But intelligent people can also be very curious about the so-called real world away from their books, where flesh-and-blood people dwell. And in their own way, intelligent people probably do enjoy socializing as much as most other people as long as they can talk about their own ideas or the ideas of other smart people. Intelligent people don\u2019t much care about exchanging mundane biographical information, listening to gossip, or spending too much time evaluating the menu or decor of the newest restaurant in town. Because intelligent people tend to find nearly everything so utterly fascinating and so worthy of contemplation and discussion, intelligent people tend to prefer thoughtful and stimulating conversations about subjects that mean little or nothing to most other people, and in their less intense, less uptight moments, intelligent people probably do enjoy a little bit of small talk \u2026 as long as it\u2019s not too small.

The ride is going to be a bit longer than usual because you\u2019ll need to perceive a few unique ideas & concepts which might change you forever. But, just bear with me at every step along the way, I can understand you inside and out. And I warn you! This might be the only answer you ever needed.  Alrighty then!  Here we go\u2026 So, assuming your definition of intelligence is what I suppose you think it is, and that you are really intelligent, here are some possible negative outcomes that I know: Note: It\u2019s not possible for 1 person to have all of these. And some of these might be yet to unfold in your life. You have difficulties in maintaining a relationship with the opposite sex. Or, you are not interested at all.You might have a perfectionism trait and you use up too much resources in finishing a task, so you end up often procrastinating.You can discern the most negligible of differences and detect the slightest of details.You\u2019re more of a night owl than a morning lark, but you try not to be.You seem to have a longer circadian rhythm, i.e. an extended body clock. So you have a hard time managing your time, struggle in arranging and fitting your schedule inside 1 Earth day, i.e. 24 hours. And most likely it affects your sleep pattern.You can actively think in your dream, and use some of those ideas in reality.Your imagination is like the craziest monkey of all, it just wanders off and you can\u2019t control, you visualize some of the most bizarre, disturbing thoughts imaginable, which I don\u2019t even want to mention here. And it pisses you off.Like this one\u2026  Can make light work of what others terms as difficult. e.g. random challenges, assignments, puzzles, games etc.You can learn almost everything in no time, and you get bored soon.You have a very unique taste in music, more emotional or instrumental, sometimes vintage emotional fiery songs.It\u2019s hard for you to differentiate between thought and emotion.You were born with some rare unique physical feature. e.g. a simian line.Ahh!! that continuous unwanted chattering voice inside your head all night, ruminating, regretting those terrible events in the past, keeping you awake.You once had so much belief and faith in God, but now, you point your finger at the sky and start craughing* when no one sees you (*crying & laughing at the same time, let me know if there\u2019s a proper word). You start believing that the universe is against you, it\u2019s always there everywhere to ruin your plans. The ultimate party-pooper.Becoming harder to socialize with the common herd.You suffered some sort of bullying during your younger days.More chances of being an introvert, e.g. what did I do wrong?, what the other person would have felt?, gee, why am I so stupid? etc., not realizing that the other person didn\u2019t cared much about you as much as you thought.While the correlation still isn\u2019t clear, it is known that psychological and anxiety disorders like severe depression, OCD, Panic Attacks, Social Anxiety Disorder are fairly common.Sometimes you were delusional in the past, e.g. you really thought your Dad was the king of the world and he was just testing you all along, and all of them were watching you closely. Also, you really believed that one day the walls in your house is going to flip inside out and turn into a royal apartment with lots of cool gadgets stuck in it. And someday you\u2019re going to activate the superpowers you were once entrusted with. Just Brilliant!! :)The one to get so disgusted when you suddenly imagine something in the dinner table, and your Mom asks \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong sweety?\u201d, you put a smile and answer \u201cNothing Mom, it\u2019s nothing\u201d, you take that glass of water and use it hide your queasy face. You have certain unusual obsessions and you just can\u2019t let go of it. And it\u2019s seriously hurting your life.You can\u2019t move on in life, you want to change some events in your past so badly. So badly, that you become delusional and wish you could build a time machine.At some stage, you realize that unlike your friends, you can\u2019t be motivated by money or matter, the only thing that drives you is your passion and where your heart takes you.Sometimes you think, \u201cWhy am I always the one to have a different opinion among my friends?\u201d.You might lose friends but you keep thinking that you don\u2019t care about it.You\u2019re getting bored of life\u2019s simplest pleasures.Fellas, kindly stop smoking and drinking, if you do.You\u2019re afraid of being left out and be alone but you\u2019re still annoyed by companionship.Use gaming, movies, TV series, or online shopping to the extreme as a relief or a distraction.You can see through manipulative plots in advertisements which others can\u2019t see and you hate it so much. Suddenly, the dream you once treasured is becoming pointless. You feel you belong to something else and your soul wants to drift into the unknown realm and you feel insecure.Lost interest in the things you once loved.Becoming demotivated to work hard anymore.You prefer solitude, a company of one instead of many.You feel the need to hear from a mentor but then you realize no one is good enough to be your mentor. And you wish, you had someone much smarter than you by your side.You want to keep a low profile.Social networks are becoming rubbish.The least interested person in the house when it comes to voting.Much more likely to be a pessimist than an optimist.You can see all the possible negative outcomes or plots in a given situation where others fail to see. So you end up being a psychic or a coward to them.You seem to have a sixth sense.Difficulty in trusting people, not your doctor for sure.You don\u2019t believe in teamwork.You are loving less and less people.Sometimes you feel you should be loving animals more than humans. You are very sensitive and your worldview is extreme.Sometimes your curiosity drives you insane and your friends and families are aware of it. Let\u2019s take a small break!! It\u2019s going to get a bit complicated but more interesting.  As you start maturing, you find out that nothing interests you, nothing amuses you, nothing excites you.. not even money, your once dream car, any matter or flesh, even your once ambitious dream.. you despise them because you know it\u2019s all inanimate objects or fantasies glorified by your inferior ones to drive all of us.As your life continues, you realize that you are different and start feeling a sense of isolating yourself from the rest of the society. Common people can\u2019t see your higher ideas, concepts, philosophies properly so you get frustrated and eventually you get rejected.You can see through their minds like water and you know how their mind is working, and from where their response is coming but they have no idea of how yours is working and what you mean. So, most likely it becomes an altercation between you and the majority. Which is what happened with quite a few of the greatest minds of our history. Geniuses like Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, and the theories and the proposals that they came up were at first ridiculed by the majority, because the normal minds just couldn\u2019t grasp their advanced concepts at their time. But now we know how amazing and true they were. You understand how every man made system, organisation works inside out, you can see through every plot, every attempt of manipulation. So, you turn up against the half-blind common herd who supports all these, and even the government. Ignorance is bliss (If you don\u2019t know about something, you don\u2019t hate it or worry about it).There\u2019s also a chance that if you are emotionally intelligent, spiritual, philosophical and are a very righteous person, and worship morality and equality, and are loaded with wisdom of how terrible we have been, you might end up becoming a misanthrope, one who resents humanity and everything it owns. If you intelligently become a misanthrope, you\u2019ll realize that no matter how we look at it, the perfect world that you dream is just not possible with us humans around. That this was what we were meant to be by design. We are incorrigible!You\u2019ll admire the popular expression \u201cLife is beautiful\u201d because you\u2019re spiritual, but then again you worship neutrality. So, you\u2019d despise the pecking order and rather opt for nothingness above a world without equality and justice. Which is fair enough!Alright! Enough rambling. Now, these were just some of the drawbacks. Or glimpses, should I say? Some of these are very bizarre and unusual, few of them might also relate to other mental illnesses other than depression. But still, I\u2019m sure, some of you can relate perfectly to most of these. PHEWW!! That was an exciting ride. Even I\u2019m wondering how did I came to know all these. But at least I know that I know you well. Just let me know in the comments if you have a query with one of these. I\u2019ll be more than happy to help you out. Cuz you see, I\u2019m a pet detective. Remember?   Now that we\u2019ve gone through our list\u2026 Let\u2019s get ready for the anticlimax. HERE COMES THE ALL IMPORTANT CONCEPTS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND. YOU MUST!! It\u2019s true that, Ignorance is bliss, meaning, if you lack the intellect or the intuition needed to comprehend something, you can\u2019t worry about it and hence, less reasons to get depressed. If I ask you to close your eyes and think about the happiest moments of your life, most likely, some of the memories of your childhood will flash right before you, like playing an album called \u201cMy Happy Slideshow Collection\u201d. Those days when you cherished feeling the breeze in the warmth of the sun and nothing in life bothered you (not politics for sure), you just merried along with life with a smile. That was your simple formula.  But what happened now?? Really!! I wanna go back to those days, I knew nothing and I was so stupid and happy.  And if we take a look deep down within ourselves and ask, \u201cWhat is it that we desire the most in life?\u201d. The answer is not so different after all, for all of us.. it\u2019s HAPPINESS!! And quite interestingly if we search, we\u2019ll find that some of the happiest people on Earth are among the ones who owns the least & knows the least.  Wow!! You guys are having a great time. Wish I could join you. Keep it up!!  Isn\u2019t she lovely?? Her smile warms my heart.  \u201cAs with nature, the more a living thing deviates from the norm, the more a survival disadvantage it becomes\u201d. Which is sort of a slight variation of the Darwinian version of evolution theory a.k.a. \u201cNatural Selection\u201d. And if exceptional intelligence is still an abnormal trait, unfortunately it is also a deviation.  Shhh!! Wanna see more of nature\u2019s fraudulent scheme?? Here are some of the greatest minds who dedicated their lives and changed our world. The true celebrities we are supposed to be worshiping today. Despite their achievements, some of them has also been known to have lived the most unsatisfying and miserable of lives. Let\u2019s see what do these extraordinarily gifted people all have in common. Leonardo da VinciSir Isaac NewtonLudwig Van BeethovenNikola TeslaAlan TuringJane AustenPlatoFriedrich NietzscheFlorence NightingaleVoltaireDr. Homi J. BhabhaDr. A. P. J. Abdul KalamBlaise PascalRobert BunsenAntonio Vivaldijust to name a few\u2026 and many more\u2026 Sure, a cynic or a skeptic, can also come up with a list of smart people who got married. But what\u2019s the point?? Wouldn\u2019t that defeat our purpose?? But, just take a look at the names above!! Aren\u2019t these enough?? Yes, the list is incomplete as I couldn\u2019t recall the others. So, let me know in the comments if I missed out someone, I will edit this article then include your suggestion, I will also thank you. So what\u2019s common?? Is it, that, none of the above bothered about marriage?? It is striking, indeed!! But how come?? Where does the correlation with celibacy, come from?? Either they were too busy driven by their passion to change our world or they were sexually disoriented or maybe both. And after all the great things they have offered us, some of these gifted men were taunted as mad, crazy, maniacal, lunatic, psychic, sociopaths by the common herd.  Marty McFly: Hey Doc!! You sure it\u2019s gonna work?? Dr. Emmett Brown: If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit. But why is it that these extraordinary individuals didn\u2019t have the same desire to reproduce and inherit their smart genes like the rest?? And why most of them led a depressive life?? Hmm! So let us try and break the code. Somewhat!! The Memory, our ability to encode, store, retain and subsequently recall information and past experiences in the human brain. It is considered one of the facets of Intelligence. And no wonder why there is a link between depression and the ability to recall long gone events precisely down to the last detail, but interestingly, depression is also sometimes linked with a bad memory, and not surprisingly some of the anti-depressant drugs that are known to be effective also has been reported with the side effects of memory loss. So, do you still desire a phenomenal memory?? Imagination, the faculty or action of forming new ideas, or images or concepts of external objects not present to the senses. No wonder the human brain named itself! Now, let\u2019s imagine a highly imaginative mind, and as imagination is completely independent and autonomous by nature, it can also be a problem because as we know imaginative thought (conscious or sub-conscious) is involuntary and unrestrainable, and with exquisite sublime imagination, you can only imagine but you can\u2019t filter out the horrible ones, it can fascinate you but it can also bring nothing but terror in the end. Can we try and imagine that??  And as Creativity comes from Imagination. It is so easy to get blinded by your own brilliance, drown in your own sorrow, and terrorized by your own imagination. We can only take a look at the most creatively brilliant minds in our history and sympathize what happened to them. Can we now reassure ourselves \u201cEverything good comes with a price tag\u201d? But there is something more to it on \u201cwhy?\u201d. So now, let us switch our vantage point to the evolutionary perspective. And let\u2019s continue.  Rather than complicating the answer, it\u2019s best to simply accept that nature does something to them to not want them to reproduce, because nature doesn\u2019t want them to inherit their traits, because our world will stop ticking, it just wouldn\u2019t work with too many geniuses. Will it??  Ironically, in other words, these geniuses are like the rarely mutated abomination to the eyes of nature, they have so much potential that they\u2019re a threat to the entire working system and nature despises them for they are constantly beeping in red, right in the center of \u201cnature\u2019s dreadful radar\u201d, so nature always finds a way to get rid of them.. I mean\u2026always!! So, can you now relate \u201cwhy depression or other mental illnesses?\u201d?? Then relate those illnesses with mortality or suicide or impotency, and now, what happens to the all important will to survive and inherit??? BANG!! You lose it all by yourself!  Is it now safe to say that this vicious method of selective elimination and termination of certain traits has been happening for thousands of years?? But at least, we know that the blood that runs through all of our veins has been hybridized selectively with our ancestor\u2019s own, thousands of times. No wonder why we don\u2019t see geniuses around everyday. But still, once in a while, an odd one pops out somewhere, only to fall victim to the trend. I know what some of you are thinking. Don\u2019t you find some of these concepts strange?? If yes?? It\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re just super studious. If not?? You\u2019re great, you\u2019re something else!! Honestly, I would\u2019ve been the first one to disagree with myself 10 years back. Well, let\u2019s just say that I got bored of my textbook and the monotonous, telescopic way of looking at evolution once, so I found a new way of looking at everything, I found a binocular, like the one below.  And the view is just breathtaking. Perhaps you should try it too. Believe me, once you\u2019ve mastered this art, you\u2019ll discover more answers within your mind itself. We call it \u201cLai-gi Door-bin\u201d in \u201cTakhellambam Leikai\u201d the place where I come from. Philosophy has influenced Science for thousands of years and still continues to learn from each other. Those who are already with me, please ignore the following segment\u2026 While similar, I know that some of these theories diverge from what we were taught in our Biology classes back in high school. That feeling of weirdness when we take our first step outside the box is our first breath in attaining pure wisdom. Mankind has barely managed to scratch the surface. So, should we stop scratching now?? And whether you are convinced with it, whether you agree or disagree for now, the choice is up to you. However if someone is not already convinced today, a 1000 evidences may not be enough. But what if these were true, and it\u2019s almost impossible to prove, but we can only analyze the indications for now?? Would you still ignore the obvious possibility?? Would you shut the door??  And even if these were covertly accepted by the omniscient few, what are the prospects of it ever reaching a general syllabus?? I would say nil. Because it will open up the pandora\u2019s box and derange some of the existing theories we are now being forced to learn. Nothing in theory can be proven if you already contradict. Unlike Mathematics, Science is not immutable. It is not set in stone. Every theory and hypothesis is meant to be tested over and over again. The scientific method is not meant to prove something true, but rather, false. And that includes Darwin\u2019s own \u201cNatural Selection\u201d, which you once learnt in a textbook. It hasn\u2019t been proven yet, but I still accept it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I adore and embrace the physical form of nature; the Wind, the Ocean, the Earth, trees that grow, birds that soar, stuffs that supports life and everything that is life. I am..fascinated by its beauty.  But what I\u2019m referring here is the abstract form of nature, which is invisible, yet the most powerful, the eternal force that govern all the other physical forms, the momentum that drives our evolution, the reason why we are here, the reason we act in a certain manner. I just wish, if only, it had a moral compass (a human construct) to guide it. And if depression doesn\u2019t manage to get the job done by itself, then a bullet, whizzing out of a sniper just might. Shall we argue that nature is the real assassin?? Just asking! We\u2019ve already witnessed throughout history, that some of the most extraordinarily selfless individuals who fought fearlessly for peace, righteousness, and justice, who were born with such exceptional emotional intelligence, didn\u2019t fare well. The odds were heavily stacked up against them, but they still refused to stand down. And whether it be a chronic disease, a long term mental illness, an accident, themselves or someone\u2019s bullet, there was always something to take them down unnaturally in the end:(. But thankfully, few of them succeeded and fulfilled their destiny before they went. :)  O, Father\u2026We have your message and we will remember you forever!! So we ask, \u201cIs this how they are rewarded for being an exceptionally good human being? How can they deserve such a horrible trial? It\u2019s the greatest injustice of all.\u201d Nature answers, \u201cThis is the price you pay for deviating from the norm and bending my rules.\u201d And Nature warns, \u201cI didn\u2019t bring you here to evangelize the good from the bad, or adjudicate what is right or wrong, you are not the moderator nor the peacemaker, just follow the pattern, stick to the norms just like the rest and you\u2019ll be fine, or else\u2026.PAY THE PRICE!!\u201d. The question is\u2026 DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS POLICY OF NATURE?? Let me know.  Is it too difficult for us to comprehend that nature wants all of us to behave like foolish ignorant slaves, ruled by a group of elite?? And it\u2019s going to do whatever it takes to get rid of anyone who comes forth to ruin nature\u2019s cruel plan. So, let us detach our humanoid brains for a while and just Think!! Think!! Spiritually from a divine perspective. Why is there politics?? Why is there so much competition?? Why is there a social norm?? And who regulates it?? And who dictates our actions?? Why do we idolize good looking people and what defines attractiveness, does the definition comes inbuilt inside all of us?? Why do today\u2019s celebrities wear outfits resembling antiquated royalty and why do some of us worship them like kings & queens?? If fashion, makeup and implants are a deception, why are we so obsessed with it?? Why do we succumb to the temptation of following others?? Why are social networks such a big hit?? Why do we spend more time adding strangers as friends on Facebook and less time making real friends in life?? Are all these nothing but taking unfair advantage of our evolutionary weaknesses for a few to profit in the name of ethic?? Why is it that when some animals kills to survive, we call it wild and barbarous, but when we kill to taste in a massive scale, we call it a tradition, and we embrace it?? Why is it that tradition is to be embraced for all and the few who questions tradition are declared as mentally unstable?? Are we the perfectly manufactured product of a perfectly sculpted environment?? and so on\u2026 Questions like these can make us shit our pants a little, and sure we can come up with a more technical answer to all these\u2026 But quite simply, in a philosophical way, I dare say that all of us has been blessed with the \u201cgenes of slavery\u201d. To save us slaves from chaos, all of us. This is what evolution has done to us. Our world would\u2019ve been even more chaotic and worse if this wasn\u2019t the case.  I doubt that it\u2019s a link, but rather a process, a cycle! Some of you might be able to connect well if you are already familiar with \u201cNihilism\u201d and the philosophies of \u201cFriedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche\u201d. If at all, it sheds some light on why we have too many selfish, stupid people and too less geniuses today. Also, these concepts sort of explains why exceptionally intelligent people usually tend to suffer, otherwise I won\u2019t be here writing an answer to help someone.  NATURE AT WORK!! POWERFUL!! STEALTHY!! CRUEL!! COMPLEX!! UNFAIR!! RIGHT?? And now, I fail to see the beauty in it as others might see.  But not aesthetically though. If we married Philosophy with Evolutionary Biology, this is how it will look like.  Being intelligent is not a curse, and if you\u2019re emotionally intelligent as well, then, chances are, you are a very good and kind human being; the problem has to do when coping along with the mass inferiority in the social environment that surrounds the victim. It can be said that these complications wouldn\u2019t have existed if all the others had the same level of intelligence. So screw them if they start mistreating you, it\u2019s their fault, not yours. Hope some of these concepts are enlightening and helps you to look at the world with a new pair of eyes from now on. Sorry, it had to be a bit long. And if you\u2019ve managed this far without skipping a part, it means you can absorb and perceive the ideas I\u2019m projecting which you\u2019re very attached to. That in itself tells how you can relate yourself to all these. Keep on going!! Share it and explain, if you know of people who needs to realize this before it\u2019s too late for them. Help them!! Upvote, if this meant something to your life. And let me know what you felt after reading this. And remember, don\u2019t beat yourself up or listen to the bullies. They are afraid of what they cannot understand. You are a gem, gifted with the power to change the world, don\u2019t waste it. BE POSITIVE!! BE HAPPY!! And most of all\u2026 Thank you all for bearing with me :D   Coming from a guy who once suffered from anxiety disorder, ended up hypnotizing his psychologist, an aspiring philosophical writer, who\u2019s obsessed with the nocturnal imaginations and hates the silliness of humanity.

            "answer_text": "Some of the answers here seem to be of the philosophy that loneliness stems from low EQ, and completely eschew analysis of other factors. I think this is generally an unconscious attempt to pretend everything is fine, as is generally the optimistic and human thing to do (though assuredly EQ does have something to do with it). For me, personally, that\u2019s one of the things that make me lonely; a lot of people tend to go through life with a bit of wool or rose-colored-glass\u2014of varied amount\u2014over their eyes. Perhaps I am cynical, but I\u2019ve seen some level of rational cynicism from all but one of the particularly gifted people I\u2019ve interacted with; the world is objectively a harsh place, and when your mind connects more dots at a time, you\u2019re more often reminded of the kids who pick on other kids, the war over mass delusion and global politics in Syria, the fact that we so happily plough forward into ecological destruction, and other tragedies of varied scale. Such a viewpoint, if frankly expressed, does not sit well with the average, neurotypical individual. Compound with this the fact that we do often get picked on a terrible amount (in the high ranges) if left amongst age-peers, and you get the potential for a fair bit of cynicism. Some do avoid it, but, in my experience, such avoidance is rare, and comes with unconscious blind spots in perception. Further, to be well matched in conversation, those on the higher end of the spectrum, perhaps 145 or 150 and on, really need to interact with people somewhat close in score. This does not mean they cannot extract value from interaction with other age-peers, but it does mean that they will miss out on a very significant fraction of meaningful interaction. Imagine if you were a great soccer player, and it was one of your greatest loves in life, but only one in two thousand people even played soccer, let alone well enough to make for a satisfying game. You\u2019d be forever lacking a part of, what is for you, meaningful social interaction. If you don\u2019t constantly mask your intelligence, people will often view you as a freakshow\u2014sometimes in admiration, sometimes in disgust, sometimes in envy. None of the options above are enjoyable, and all feel isolating. All the cynicism I mention\u2014and I only truly have reliable data for a non-random sample of n=5\u2014may contribute to its own crimson-colored-glasses effect, but that\u2019s a story for another answer. It may also be an exception rather than the rule, but I see a significant elevation of it and comorbid depression in the highly-profoundly gifted I\u2019ve interacted with. ",

            "answer_text": "Intelligent people tend to be thinkers and sensory types (ex. listeners, observers). They are \u201cwired\u201d differently, going about their perception of the world in a different process than others, perceiving things as factual things with cause and effect. They may question even small details, with the 5 Ws (what/who, why, where, when, how), and try to gather contextual evidence to understand the bigger picture before acting (ex. speaking out). Other people tend to be so unpredictable that the intelligent person\u2019s act of perceiving can get tired out trying to comprehend things, on top of controlling their imagination/assumptions from filling in for a lack of context, leaving them drained. They\u2019ve learned from others\u2019 mistakes. They might consider common activities done as a get-together as events that lead to mistakes. People might pressure them to conform a little to enjoy the get-together activities, by \u201cswitching off their typical brain process\u201d or at least by \u201cloosening up\u201d. I don\u2019t know if they can entirely do this, but it exposes them to an environment that they doubt is progressive or beneficial (significant risk of being detrimental). They might merely open up their comfort zone, lowering their guard, but their sharpened senses might still be active and notice things being too noisy, witnessing uncomfortably low standards of behavior, and/or observing some other quality (ex. healthiness). They might be too polite to point out how these issues affect them personally, and instead just refuse to accept further invitations. The brutal truth might be that they\u2019re \u201ctoo good\u201d for others. They might have certain moral standards that keep them from being comfortable doing certain things. For example, they might be disinterested, or even appalled by the act of engaging certain common activities such as gossiping about other peers or celebrities, or venting about responsibilities, for the sake of improving one\u2019s personal mood/tensions (includes drinking, or other ways to release anger or escape reality). Get them to speak about something more abstract, such as the big picture in politics (Saudi vs Iran, rather than about Trump\u2019s last tweet), or events that deem action (anthropological global warming vs vegas shooting), and you might find out just how far you are from them\u2014they might not shut up once talking about these subjects, and you might be totally lost or even embarrassed if you show how unknowledgeable you are about the topics at such a scale (by speaking out). This difference in moral standards may lead to hostile reactions, with some perceiving the intelligent person as looking down on them, perhaps acting \u201ctoo perfect\u201d, and possibly becoming the topic of gossip and venting, which increases the distance between people. With high enough moral standards, they might not be interested in socially accepted debauchery or go as far as avoiding the 7 deadly sins (including seeking attention and progressing social status). The process of making friends might be judged by how beneficial it all is. The chemistry to create a win-win situation, with a bond strong enough to be considered a friendship, is considerably rare for them. Intelligent people tend to wind up \u201cbickering\u201d with each other; they end up disagreeing over minor details, even if most of their knowledge base overlaps. If they specialize in different fields, they might just wind up as acquaintances that they can call up for expert opinions. The strength of these bonds are closer to respectful, than truly friendly. There\u2019s a stereotype that says that everyone has a \u201cstupid friend\u201d and they\u2019re no exception to intelligent people, being one of the rare compatible types. Heck, one intelligent person could be the \u201cstupid friend\u201d to someone even more intelligent. Deep down, almost everyone has a unique definition of what it takes to be considered a friend. Intelligent people might be more precise or sharply aware of certain factors, which determine success/compatibility rate. They can use level of personal trust to be the core trait of friendship, followed by personalized concern for each other. They could take that further, requiring a fine balance, where trust and concern levels are relatively equal as they gradually rise\u2014attempting to rush things and placing too much trust in the other person unexpectedly might be detrimental to the relationship. They might require others to understand them as an individual. Perhaps, they might simply look for someone to bounce ideas off of. What they seek in a friend, can\u2019t really be generalized, but there\u2019s some cause and effect that can be correlated to intelligence, and common practices that almost all humans follow in making friends. Things very well might be link to the \u201cstupid friend\u201d relationship. I think that it\u2019s unfortunate that due to the trends and conformity of society that peculiar traits, such as being types that want to stay by themselves, end up being loosely correlated to a certain group/classification. This is not a trait of intelligent people, but it can be a trait of another type of people. I\u2019d guess that it might be a trait of sensitive unstable types, but even they might want some social stimulation from time to time. There are truly decent folk that are intelligent, that fit right in with society, as others have pointed out. There are others with such a trait of wanting to be alone, but they could be intelligent or not, and have a wide variety of reasons regarding why they have such a trait. A common reason for wanting to be alone could simply be due to society being harsh to them (ex. judgemental). An intelligent person might perceive things as being simpler, easier and less problematic if they\u2019re by themselves, not willfully inviting the risk of trouble without any worthwhile benefit\u2014they might\u2019ve utilized such intelligence efficiently enough to be very self-sufficient.

            "answer_text": "I have read many Quora answers to the question \u201cWhat are the signs that a person is intelligent?\u201dand these answers with 2000 likes usually contain the sentence - They like to spend their time alone. My life experience, completely disagrees with this statement. When we think of intelligent, we think of people like Newton, Einstein etc. These people are not just intelligent, these are geniuses, they are like the extreme of intelligence. When you get to this level, may be the symptoms of \u2018lone intelligent\u2019 people might show up. But there are a lot of people, millions of people, who are highly intelligent, and who wouldn\u2019t fit into this category of lone intelligent people. You can see highly intelligent Harvard graduates who also party a lot, you can see Doctor Mike, look at Oscar Wilde, Rimbaud, highly intelligent comedians, Natalie Portman. Some of the greatest tacticians in history were obviously not introverted. Alexander, Tamerlane, Gengis Khan were not spending time alone. Robert Greene said Napoleon had the most advanced technology of his age, he possessed a powerful supercomputer, his own mind. You can see all these socially intelligent Chess Grandmasters, whose livestream I watch time to time. They are certainly spending hours with each other and they are not spending \u2018more time alone\u2019. IM Sagar Shah who is also a CA, is sometimes streaming for 10 hours interviewing and teaching people. I am a medical student and I see a lot of people who absolutely hate being alone, who are party animals, and are very good at studies. Just look around. There are such people literally everywhere. I don\u2019t think there is much relation between intelligence and extra/introversion. For me, intelligence has something to do with intellectual achievement, not with having a wide range of intellectual interests. I think people tend to confuse those 2. Just because you have a lot of intellectual hobbies, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you are intelligent. You need to have some intellectual achievements, and I have seen many extroverted people beat even introverted people in this regard whether it\u2019s in chess, in studies etc. I think wanting to spend time alone is not because of \u2018intelligence\u2019 but rather a socialization need. Introverts have a more sensitive nervous system so they are bombarded with stimuli, so they need to take break from this constant barrage of emotions and ideas. But this has nothing to do with- whether they can solve problems quicker ( Physics, Biology, IQ, Maths, Organizational problems etc etc) , understand concepts very quickly, can write great poems, get their seat in medical school. You need to do such things to show me that you are intelligent and I have seen many extroverted people accomplish these things. So my life experience disagrees with that statement. If you believe I wrote of one these things, then you haven\u2019t understood what I wrote- Introverts are not intelligentOnly extroverts are intelligent.",

            "answer_text": "I've been a member of a group for parents of talented/gifted kids for a decade now. One thing that is given about people one or more standard deviations from the norm in IQ is that the further their IQ is from the norm, the more unique they are and different than others even of the same IQ. Even if they can find someone as intelligent, that person might be passionate about math, while they are passionate about art or botany. A similar IQ doesn't mean that they have a meeting ground. Through this group, I've learned much about the many different ways giftedness can manifest itself. Many people are more sensitive than others, simply because we catch on to what's going on around us much faster than others. We can see the fleeting look of dismay on someone's face and realize that the person with the quick smirk is manipulating the situation. Or we can see patterns in a series of events, and realize where something is heading a long time, sometimes months, before others do. And if it's not a good place and upsets us, we can either try to alert others and be called kooks if we don't have a degree in that area (or sometimes even if we do), or we can keep silent but upset, and seem to be inexplicably moody.  Another thing is \"excitabilities\". This has the same root cause. The highly-intelligent can see connections and meanings in things that most don't notice. So the highly-intelligent 10-year-old is jumping up and down with excitement while waiting to cross the street because he's just realized he saw a rare cloud formation or a rare bug, and those around him think his parents failed in disciplining him so he's acting like a 4-year-old.  Another thing is asymmetry in development. You may have a 6-year-old who is doing algebra, but who is struggling with reading. Or a 10-year-old who is writing a wonderfully grown-up novel, but who can't remember how to borrow to do simple subtraction. As the child grows, these tend to even out somewhat, but you'll still see adults of very high IQs who are groundbreakers in one area, like physics, but average in many others, and even struggle in a few areas (scheduling their time; have trouble with spelling). So mostly, the highly intelligent, if not also autistic, try to keep social interactions to pleasantries and try to appear as others. If we can find someone who shares an interest, even if that person doesn't have the same ability, we can develop a real friendship with that person, even if it doesn't allow us full range of our own abilities. For those who are open to it, we can learn things in those friendships and from those people.  The dream is the off chance we ever meet someone who shares both our interest and our ability. Hopefully we also hit it off personally. There's high incentive on both sides to make such a friendship work. ",

            "answer_text": "For a relatively long time I thought so. Until I\u2019ve started meeting really smart people. Not \u201cstraight A\u2019s in high school\u201d smart. \u201cSmart\u201d is vague term. \u201cIntelligent\u201d is much more useful, and intelligence is literally capability of solving problems. All kinds of problems. Doing math. Learning languages. Writing poetry. Composing. Painting. Meeting people and having a conversation. There are two types of intelligence-related bullshit: the first is about how a single number (IQ) can determine your potential in life and the second is about different types of intelligence. People want to be able to say \u201cI have low emotional intelligence, but I am good at this or that, so I am smart and that\u2019s why the cruel world doesn\u2019t accept me\u201d. The reason why smart people spent a lot of time alone is that they are busy. The smartest people I know work very long hours, deeply immersed in their projects they are so passionate about. But oh my, would you look at them during the weekend. They are the most interesting and engaging people you\u2019ll ever see. When you are having a conversation they don\u2019t talk to you about TV, weather, Kardashians, heck, they can\u2019t be lonely because they are so interesting! Not being arrogant and self-centered helps very much. Intelligent people don\u2019t repel others being obsessed with themselves, they are generally very humble. Which makes them even more attractive. That being said, sometimes a person makes a choice to be alone. A famous example is Paul Dirac who was extremely secluded. But this is a rare case. For every Dirac there\u2019s one Feynman who was life of the party and one Schr\u00f6dinger who was one helluva womanizer. From what I\u2019ve seen, being intelligent reduces your chances of being lonely by far. Not being lazy and putting your brain into work outside your comfort zone? That\u2019s where the real adventures begin\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I am intelligent. I consider myself gifted. I showed potential for gifted programs when I was younger, but did not apply myself. My parents let me decide how much academics mattered to me. When I was in pre-school through high school, and my first college, the academics were not my top priority but a requirement. I graduated at good ability but did not develop my fullest potential. Now I have applied myself and gotten into a competitive program and university with high expectations at Stanford. I have always preferred to play with my peers, and engage with interesting activities and discussions, not always related to intellectual matters. I enjoy working with people much older than me, with subject matter expertise and professional development. I find their mindset is more appropriate for responsibility expected of work. I have found that I learn best under the direction of field leaders, and persons with high meritocratic credentials. But owing to my parent\u2019s decision to let me decide my own academic study, I enjoy studying alone. I prefer to learn alone, with resources I choose, and practice on activities that I am interested in. I learn best this way, without too much person interaction, and the social nuances that go along with learning in a school or work environment. However, if there is one environment I do excel in with people, it is a design style or acting environment. This suits my style best, because it has the least social conditioning, and gets straight to the matter and problem to solve. It does not specifically narrow out specific roles and social functions. Most of this style of learning is a preference and is traceable to personality preference, such as the Big Five Inventory or more common personality inventories. The tendency is specifically called introverted preference, as well as less emotional or social interaction preference. ",

            "answer_text": "Intelligent people are occupied in their own minds planning creative things they can build, and working out solutions to things, because intelligence is a function of creativity. To me an intelligent person is merely a person who has a personality which finds satisfaction in creating things, and in early childhood learned how to make distinctions because those are the tools necessary to create anything. The creative process is solitary and not a team effort. Also well being is found in interactions with media like music because of the emotional satisfaction of experiencing creative things which one can only experience by yourself. That is aesthetic pleasure, and is a reflection of that person\u2019s values. Values are a function of that person\u2019s temperament and personality characteristics. Otherwise media products documentaries or maybe books and sources of knowledge so they can understand the world better and not make errors or mistakes. I have a high IQ and I feel a responsibility to understand the world and not make mistakes which might harm others. I want to not commit violence like participate in wars if they are not justified. If a war happens I want to understand how and why it came about. However if there is a situation where violence will prevent harm to others then I want to know it, and I want to understand what I am doing completely. I\u2019m not satisfied with the beliefs and assumptions of others. Frankly there is little I can learn from anyone who is not an experienced expert on some topic. I don\u2019t need a lot of social interaction. If I choose to be with someone it\u2019s for a purpose. People who know me say, \u201cMichael doesn\u2019t wake up in the morning or do anything unless there is a reason.\u201d There is so much to be done in life to build my own well being and make responsible decision so i don\u2019t harm others that there\u2019s not enough time to learn all the things I need to know, and do all the things I need to do. I am more friendly and helpful than most people but I don\u2019t need the company or approval of anyone. I care about people and want them to succeed, but I don\u2019t accomplish anything for them or myself by sharing their lives. People who need the company of others often do so because they are bored and need the stimulation of interaction with others. As for myself even when I am alone I never feel as though I am alone. I never feel as though I am by myself. I feel as though I am always, constantly in touch with consciousness outside of myself, and that consciousness is higher than I am, and that all persons are meant to live with that consciousness first and do not really have a genuine need for other humans unless there is a specific purpose for that interaction. That is a metaphysical explanation but it is the way I perceive it. I am never really alone. This is an unconventional answer but it\u2019s simple facts. Ask an autistic savant if they feel as though they are alone. They appear from the outside to be alienated but they are not. What they describe is having information and data pouring into their minds from outside of their minds. They are constantly interacting with creative forces outside of themselves which give them factual information. Any artist will tell you that they are accessing inspiration and \u201cdata\u201d from outside themselves during the creative process. Paul Simon says that when anyone writes a song that they are not creating the song but that the song already exists and all they are doing is tuning into reality so they can access and reveal what already exists. That is how he creative process works, and it is not solitary but involves interaction with that which exists outside of ones self but which does not involve other humans at that time. Then afterward it can be illustrated to other humans and you can transmit to them the emotions and values conveyed in the creative process from outside. ",

            "answer_text": "There is some evidence that intelligent people are more likely to want to be alone. For instance: People With Fewer Friends Tend To Be Intelligent: Study I think this is quite understandable in a number of different ways. For one thing, if you\u2019re someone who likes to think things out a lot, it\u2019s generally going to be easier to do that alone than around people. So arguably the question is a bit like asking \u201cWhy do mountain climbers tend to hang around mountains?\u201d. Perhaps intelligent people are hanging around the solitude they need to think. Then there\u2019s the fact that anyone who thinks a lot in a detailed way (which presumably goes hand in hand with intelligence) is liable to find it frustrating to be around the majority of the rest of the world, who are less into abstract analysis. Studies find that intelligence is correlated with openness to experience and to ideas. So someone who would like to discuss and analyse various ideas from various points of view might find it frustrating to hang around with people who are less into that and adhere more to the \u201cspade is a spade\u201d school of thought, or who are more likely to have fixed opinions even in the absence of evidence. I\u2019d like to think of myself that I could be quite OK company for some hyper-intelligent professor character. I like to listen to different points of view and look at things in various different ways. But if this hypothetical professor were to head out to the local bar, he or she would likely encounter a relative surplus of strongly-held simplistic opinions and a deficit of careful reasoning. A return to the comfort of books and solitude might seem quite appealing. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re talking about a Mensa group meeting then no. If you\u2019re talking about a remedial math class in high school then yes. I will make the conext Canada in Toronto since that is where I live and the only place where I have a shred of credibility in providing this answer :-) Intelligent people I take to mean those who have above average problem solving skills, memory and insight into consequences of their actions. The last qualifier is crucial because I believe that alone is why the answer will tend to be yes. An average person will likely go out to a club, have some drinks or something else recreational then party hard. There are all kinds of potential negative consequences to that sequence of behaviours that the average person either is unaware of or chooses to ignore, the least of which is a hangover. Someone who thinks about consequences will not ignore what could go wrong and with usually try to reduce those outcomes or avoid them. That leads to choosing to not go out or go in a very restricted fashion. I.e. they volunteer to be the designated driver or only take enough $$ for 2 drinks and cab fair for example. Self-controlled behaviour is very admirable when it achieves something like a sports victory or military victory or business victory. Self-controlled behaviour that results in less \u201cfun\u201d or less risk is generally not admired and often ridiculed. \u201cTwo drinks?!? Duuuude I had 4 before I came here, take the stick out man and live a little!\u201d An even better example is jaywalking across even a mildly busy street. The highest risk, which might be very tiny in the right circumstances, is your death from collision. The benefit is in many cases you save about 5 minutes of time not waiting for a crosswalk light to change. Thousands of people make that choice every day thinking nothing of it. Yet a few of those people die - they risked their entire lives for 5 freaking minutes of time!!! And those unlucky few lost\u2026 So people who lack self-discipline, either willingly or unknowingly, rarely admire people who have the intelligence to see potential dangers and avoid them. And that tends to be because the average person doesn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d those risks or thinks they are so small that they are not worth considering. It also happens from a kind of ego defence because the average person is having fun and is emotionally incentivized to defend what they enjoy to avoid feeling bad about their actions. Almost all people have rose coloured glasses from birth - humanity is very positive oriented especially about ourselves. We routinely overestimate our capabilities and underestimate the risks. Until a life experience knocks those glasses off, most of us tend to live life without much worry. So the intelligent person acting in their own risk adjusted best interest will likely experience fewer social environments where they can meet a mate. They will probably be more restrictive in their choice of mate which adds up to a higher likelihood of being alone. ",

            "answer_text": "Quora is rife with these kinds of questions, and they are nonsense. For some reason, this platform has become a beckoning stage for egotists. I\u2019m going to go against the grain here, and risk being viewed as someone who is hateful of people who tend to keep to themselves; I am not. These kinds of question, even just by being asked then treated seriously, promote such a stupid set of assumptions, void of any kind of nuance that the real world is actually composed of. People who are inept at socialization will sometimes rationalize it as some new-fangled positive, and so this stereotype of \u201cquiet people are the intelligent ones\u201d is perpetuated. Similar to the way arrogant people won\u2019t say they\u2019re arrogant, but will say they \u201ctell it like it is, and people are uncomfortable with that.\u201d Now, I\u2019ve met quiet people who will state honestly \u201cYea, I\u2019m a shy person, and that\u2019s something I\u2019m working on.\u201d \u2014 I think that\u2019s honest, admirable, and just nice. So, I\u2019m not saying it *all* \u201cloners\u201d who make these backwards-rationalizations. And one more important clarification, is that I\u2019m not saying all \u201clonerism\u201d is borne out of social ineptitude. Some people just like their own company, and that\u2019s just fine. It\u2019s kind of lame if you\u2019re out with your friends, and you hide-away into the corner of the room contemplating your own intelligence as an alternative to confronting your own social insecurities, but that\u2019s a different thing. Sometimes people just want to hang-out away from the crowd, and they won\u2019t always be formulating the next Grand Unified Theory; most the time, they will not be. I just hate this kind of self-aggrandizing BS; and this is as a person who tends to keep to themselves. It denigrates collaboration, and working with others is a kick-ass thing to do. As a counter-example to the (false) premise of this question (i.e. \u201cIntelligent people always keep to themselves.\u201d), take Paul Erd\u00f6s. Very smart dude, would wander from Uni-to-Uni just to meet & collaborate with new people. Solved more complex math problems in his lifetime than the number of tips you\u2019ll solve for on the bill.

            "answer_text": "Interesting range of answers!  The short answer?  Si!  My life is NOT one I would recommend to the faint of heart!  My close friends, colleagues, siblings, professors, musicians/artists see me much the same way: \"a freak of nature\".  Feverish early reader, I loved everything: math, science, history, music, poetry (eventually, political activism).  Progress was decimated by brutal parental alcoholism & dysfunction. To survive, I escaped at 17, discovering the \"clown-self\" within me, becoming a 'working clown' for over 30 years, doing pre-school's 'greatest hits' on mandolin for delighted children at parties, hospitals & cancer wards.  I worked at NBS (now NIST), attended community college, did music, drugs, chess tournaments, and Spacetime Physics.  Pursuing a dream to attend UC Berkeley, I drove 3000 miles to Berkeley in 1978, lived in my car for half a semester studying linear algebra to enter UC Berkeley as a math major on full scholarship, graduated, became a skilled carpenter, financed a work-year in war-torn Nicaragua (1985), worked on a health center in a war zone, got caught in a 6-day Contra attack; returned in '86 to attend graduate school, taught math for a quarter century, all the while running chess clubs, and still do.  I chose not to have children--for many philosophical & practical reasons.  I have loved many great women.  Parting was painful.  I feel lonely at times, but I chose solitude.  Alas, I am happy with my life, full of adventure and excitement.  I live facing the Pacific Ocean on a coastal mountain.  My life consists of many loving 'extended families'.  The short answer is \"Si, pero no hay alegria sin dolor\"! ",

            "answer_text": "For me it is three reasons. The first is the rarity of finding others on your level. I am in the top 1%. That means out of every 100 people I meet, there will be one that is on my intelligence level. Could take meeting 300 people before I fine one person on my level due to the way statistics work. I have eclectic tastes and interests. That means that even I meet that one in a hundred person, odds are that he or she will not be into amateur radio, shooting, and collecting knives. Lastly, is that I do not need the company of others to feel good about myself. I do not need their validation. I know who I am and what I can do. I also am not a follower. I lead. If the group wants to see movie X and I do not, I will not go with them for the sake of the friendship. If I do not feel like going to one of their parties, I will not go. Only doing things I want to do does not make lasting friendships in my experience. I enjoy being on my own. I travelled all over the world on my own. I worked from home on my own. I have had a very successful career and personal life, on my own. Friends tend to bring their drama into your life. They can also hold you back at times. Often what you want goes against the majority vote of a group. I prefer to live my life on my terms. I do have friends scattered all over the country. They are like we are, gypsies moving every few years. Once in a while we move near each other and start seeing each other again. I do not get upset if they do not call me regularly and they are the same. Most people think there is something wrong with being a loner. They think we should be like them and have a lot of friends whose lives they get involved in. I am fine on my own. I have done well on my own. I have plenty of hobbies that do not require anyone else to participate in them. I do socialize with my wife\u2019s friends when we get together a few times a month for dinner or cake and coffee. That is enough for me. The husbands are all 8 years older than me and I have to play the conservative person in front of them. My wife\u2019s friends would desert her if they knew she was bi. They are religious and we are not. Still, we socialize. I do enjoy our time together and the fact that they never ask anything of me. :) ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to Jim Davis excellent answer I\u2019d like to add that smart people often come to conclusions and hold view that are not socially popular. Even stating this possibility is likely to be unpopular as you can see from the ratio of upvotes to views on this post. Nevertheless, it means that highly intelligent people are often avoided or need to be guarded and can\u2019t just say what they believe. In the past those unpopular views that might make an intellectual unpopular might be votes for women, emancipation of slaves, not persecuting on the basis of sexuality or willingness to entertain ideas like evolution or of a non-geocentric universe. It won\u2019t make this answer popular at all - every society like to think they have all the answers and are \u2018right\u2019 - but there are plenty of similarly unpopular views that we should discuss and consider today, but to even mention them would create the same persecution that intelligent people have always faced. So intelligent may form these from clear, well thought out principles consistent with a high ethical and moral position, but other people may jump to conclusions without understanding or fully considering there real reasons. Often they come to a truth which is not palatable, not what they would have chosen it to be on emotional grounds, but is still, to the full extent of their understanding, the truth. This sort of truth is often different from beliefs strongly supported by popular wisdom - which tends to unthinkingly celebrate the Zeitgeist - the current set of undeniable misconceptions. This makes it very difficult for them to be open about their feelings or beliefs or even calmly discuss this that they find interesting without being subject to bigoted attack and even hatred. I can see this happening all the time to highly intelligent people who I know, perhaps the most intelligent. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone is intelligent. People with a mental disability can sort recycled materials, can laugh, feel, see, hear & cry. If you are alive you are intelligent. I believe we are created human beings of God. God is all we need to face another day. But it is not good for humans to be alone, we are designed as social creatures. We are designed as male and female to join as one and have offspring. We are to nurture and train our children. We have different languages and cultures to remind us that there is only one wise God and father of all. I grew up on a farm with wide open spaces with more animals, birds and insects & flies than people. I would dream as I walked behind the cows and milled the grain. It was a simple life of solitude with much thought, family and love. I was happy and helpful. Then I studied mathematics & physics. I observed nature from the classroom. However, science did not teach me about love, it just \u2018was\u2019. It \u2018was\u2019 amazing, it \u2018was\u2019 powerful, it \u2018looked\u2019 smart. Then I did further study in medical physics and worked in a radiotherapy treating cancer patients. I realized that people still died despite how much smart science we have. I realized that the head clinicians and professors made dumb personal health choices. They were human too. I realized that a person could be highly intelligent in one area and dumb in many others. I realized that an eccentric person is not necessarily an overall intelligent person. Then I started my own businesses, where you have no government grants, no funding other than your own sweat. No annual leave, sick leave, holiday pay, time in lieu (I thought that was \u2018time in the loo\u2019), conference leave, sabbaticals, 9 day fortnights, extended lunch breaks, overseas conferences (with 1 day conference and 6 days tourism). No government or employer gave us anything, we were on our own and had to believe in ourselves, we had self-respect. But we also had a dream bigger than ourselves. Immediately we commenced employing. I never realized that over the next 15 years we would employ over 100 people and have 80 percent of them not with us today. That really bothered me as they say you know you are doing something right when people follow. But a good friend of mine reminded me that not even Jesus could keep all his 12 disciples. So to answer your question; I would have to say no, real intelligent people are real people - they are real to how they were created as social people, lovers and givers. You can\u2019t give with nobody around and you can\u2019t receive when nobody is around. Let\u2019s remember this Christmas that God gave himself for us that we may live eternally. That should inspire you & I to \u2018go on\u2019, live without fear and live with purpose and gratitude towards others. Until you & I can overcome death, we can\u2019t be God. But we can be like God, we can love. What is love? God is Love. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, both by choice and by chance, but that doesn't mean they are lonely. Their brains are wired in a way that they cannot explain, and sometimes they can't convey their thoughts to others because of that, making a lot of conversations for them seem futile, since they don't see the other person grasping the point, and don't have the energy or the means to explain it. Other thing that happens is that when they try to enter in a relationship with people that can't cope with their speed of thought they often alienate them or resent them for feeling smothered and not having free time for themselves and their thoughts, since the partner wants to do things together (this happens a lot to me). This leads to a lot of fights. So in the end they prefer to be alone and focus on things that gives them pleasure, often their own projects. Also being around them can be a huge burden since they have a lot of extreme opinions and don't restrain them in a relationship, and not a lot of people can handle it (i am in favor of euthanasia, death penalty, aborption and against equal universal vote, just to name a few). It is good to notice that a lot of these people are misjudged when they are young as being sociopaths or autists (I was tested for both) because of this isolation from others and refusal in engaging in normal social gatherings, and they can become agressive or sad because they think people are mistreating them. Some of them eventually realize that social interactions is a science in some form, and eventually decide to tackle their issues, by studying social sciences like psychology, economy, PNL or micro-expressions. They can become quite charismatic and charming when they do that, and even turn their new found hobby in a profession and be quite skilled (I am a product manager focused on user growth), but in the end they always need some alone free time since the first issues always appear, and they cannot sustain huge discontinuous amounts of social interaction.

            "answer_text": "First of all I understand where you're coming from and how you must feel in your situation. But to be clear, intelligence doesn't necessarily mean someone wants to be alone, there are people who enjoy groups and people who enjoy solitude, and intelligence really isn't a factor. It is very common to get into rural areas where people just don't think about the things they do in large cities. T They may in fact be very intelligent, but you can't necessarily tell that by talking to them. Their goal is to relax and have an easy conversation and the last thing they want is to think deeply or come up with Solutions. There are many people who are very bright and all of their intelligence goes to their job or solving problems that come up that are unavoidable. Many find investigative research and contemplating moral issues something they would not choose to do in their spare time. Also many retired business people really don't want to talk about things that require deep thought and contemplation. It seems that when they retired their brains and curiosity retired with him.. I am like you. I really enjoy deep conversations talking about things, understanding what's happening, the changes in the world, why people do the things they do and all that great stuff. But unless you live in Houston, New York San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Boston (or some city with a vibrant late-night social community), then it's not likely that's going to be dinner conversation. However if you're willing to adapt to your environment and understand where they're coming from, you can avoid being alone. If being by yourself is ok, and you enjoy it, that's great, but keep in mind sometimes being alone long term can cause depression. So the bottom line is adapt or move out of town. I live in a big noisy polluted city with lot of strange situations and strange people\u2026 and I would never leave. And that's because I can't talk about Golf and the weather for more than about 5 minutes, but more importantly, I really like people. ",

To all the intelligent self proving bullshitters, trying to show their knowledge with overly abused jargon to the masses, I know who you are. I can compose documents full of sophistication. Cut the shit, and write accordingly. The reason i choose solitude, is trustworthiness. I have interfaced with corporate business, wealthy snobs, drug addicted homeless leeches, regular average Americans, and the number one reason behind my solitude is this: Secondary, self kept, self-absorbed motivation to abuse others. Go analyze Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power with his disclosed motivation and powerful speeches that led the masses into their own graves. Or perhaps how a loving wife can contemplate murder against her husband that has financial stability that she desires, then during investigations cries her way out of the detectives grasp due to her genetics and plastic surgery. Maybe go watch parents give their children \u201cvaccinations\u201d that will help them fight diseases only present in third-world countries only to give them autism. People are not capable of doing honest things, regardless of their situation. That is why. Stop filling these forums unrelated misinformation. Give the truth, not examples. If you choose to isolate from society and have above average intelligence, then you should speak your mind. If you are not one of these individuals, don\u2019t give documented results based on others that you aren\u2019t. ",

They might be alone, whether it be by choice or because of social phobia, but intelligence doesn't come with social apathy or anything ridiculous like that, as suggested by the silly responses. It can, but it's case by case. Humans, by nature, are social animals - intelligent or not. All US Presidents were married at one time and social outings were common during and after their terms. Albert Einstein married multiple times and was known to have many friends. Oscar Wilde loved the limelight and was often the talk of the town for his social behaviors. Tycho Brahe died because of his desire to socialize and please people. Kafka, who has written at length about his many phobias, even yearned for a social and intimate life. He had long time group of friends and fellow writers that he often mingled with.  Christopher Hitchens, Alan Turing, Stephen Hawking, Richard Wagner, Mark Twain, Jack Kerouac, Richard Branson, Neil Degrasse Tyson Do any of the self proclaimed intellects care to explain the above Individuals? I'll wait.  I have pretty considerable social phobia and love my alone time (for many reasons outside of just phobia). I don't necessarily consider myself intelligent, but I acknowledge that I certainly think and act unlike anyone I know. None of this subdues my desire to want to be social. It's innate within me as it is in everyone.  ",

            "answer_text": "Its not all intelligent people who like to be alone, but intelligent people do tend to be more introverted from my experience. I can only speak for myself, and I will say I was discussing this very topic the other day with a close friend. See, I am very introverted and my friend is also. We were discussing why it is introverted people seem to be more extroverted when around other introverted people. We came up with the joking answer that introverted people are really extroverts, we just don\u2019t like stupid people and since most people are stupid we seem like introverts. Now of course this isn\u2019t the actual answer, most people aren\u2019t stupid. Intelligence comes in many varieties, one person can suck at math but be an amazing writer and another person can barely spell but is amazing at math. Another person could suck at both math and language but be able to completely disassemble and then reassemble any piece of machinery you put in front of them. If you judge a fish by how well it can climb a tree of course it\u2019s going to fail. That being said, it does seem that introverted people just prefer the company of a small group of very close friends they share many interests with instead of the more extroverted approach of having many casual friends you share a few minor interests with. In places of larger populations, you\u2019ll often see large enough groups of introverts that you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell they\u2019re introverts. More people in an area means you\u2019re more likely to find people that share a lot of your interests, so even if you\u2019re an introvert finding like minded people you don\u2019t mind spending time with isn\u2019t going to be very difficult. In smaller population areas, you\u2019ll often see introverted people doing things alone and be quite content to be alone. I live in a more rural area, I have one person locally I consider a good friend. There\u2019s a couple of people I consider casual friends, and being a small town a lot of people know me and I have the occasional brief conversation in passing here and there, but I do most of what I do alone. Fortunately with the internet, you can find people who share all sorts of varied interests and it\u2019s a great tool for introverts like me to make good friends and also have solitude. I think honestly the biggest different between an introvert and an extrovert is that introverts prefer quality over quantity. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure this is always true, but in my experience I tend to use more complicated language because I have a broad vocabulary. I don\u2019t use words to impress others, but to communicate precisely, which is why I like writing. I\u2019ve noticed some people will take offense when you use a word they\u2019ve never heard, as if you are trying to impress. So, that annoys people. Then instead of communicating accurately (my goal) I\u2019ve in fact accomplished the opposite! It took me much longer than in should for an \u201cintelligent person\u201d (me) to figure this dynamic out. I never gave this issue much thought, as I\u2019ve become used to being in \u201canother world\u201d most of the time (no idea if this is related to intelligence) until my husband, who by all measures is very bright, told me he often doesn\u2019t talk much because people aren\u2019t interested in his answers. I\u2019ve noticed that what he does is give a very short answer or a long analysis, and in the latter case people don\u2019t really want to hear a long analysis. I find his insights very interesting, and by pure happenstance have married someone who I enjoy talking to. So was somewhat perplexed that his conversational style seems to alienate people. He\u2019s also very likable, I mean has a likable face and pleasant personality. After some reflection, I realized that his conversational style alienates people because they\u2019ve never thought about what he\u2019s saying and/or it\u2019s too much work/inaccessible and/or the technical language used and/or the complexity of the argument itself. I know many intelligent people who are highly social, but they do generally tend to socialize with each other - similar to the way people of particularly professions, such as PhD level and MD level, tend to socialize with others of the same \u201cstatus.\u201d It\u2019s just more comfortable to talk to someone who understands and is interested in what you\u2019re saying.

I have always had the kind of mind that absorbs little bits of information and remembers them. I call this a Jeopardy mind (as in, you know so much, you should go on Jeopardy). I\u2019ve also always known, or felt I have known, when I was right about those little bits of information. It was never arrogance on my part, simply a certainty that I knew what I knew. As a girl and young woman, I was frequently counseled to \u201cplay stupid,\u201d because \u201cmen don\u2019t want girls who are smarter than they are.\u201d I always wanted friends and was fascinated by other people. In high school I usually had friends, too, most often a best friend within a very satisfying social group. But the close friendship within this group usually lasted only a year. Then the group sort of fell apart once we went off to college. In college I loved living in a dorm. There was always someone to talk to and share day to day lives with. I still am at my best socially when I can do that. I\u2019ve often found it difficult to communicate with other people. I just don\u2019t seem to think the way many other people do. I sometimes have felt like an alien dropped into a world I was not able to understand. I\u2019m much more at peace with all this now. I have much greater insight into - and acceptance of - everything that has shaped who I am. I have been very satisfied in my worklife and continue to find other interests I am passionate about. And I have cultivated a sense of humor - I grew up in a family that had none. I am very happy that women and girls are growing up today in a society becoming more tolerant of intelligence and talent in women. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and not. Intelligent people are lonely because it is difficult for them to find people that can fulfil their interests. And this is an interior behaviour touching more people than others think. To be alone doesn't mean not to have others around, but not to have a profound relationship. Take into consideration that there are very intelligent people on the \"social\" side of the spectrum (not only the math geeks are the intelligent ones), that know how to work with groups and make them to perform better than others, but that in their personal life they have no partners. But when a \"real\" partner appear, this loneliness gives space to a deep relationship. We humans, anyway, have been designed to be social beings. And there is some type of \"partitioning\" that can be developed with age, because the lonely people realises that \"some\" interests will be for them alone and no others will be able to match their focus or their speed when working them. However, other interests can match easier other people's thinking, opening them more interaction paths that were expected on early years. So yes, you can have a relationship and to have space for you alone, for you to develop your special way of thinking. Is it easy to find that \"partner\"? Not always, but current technology open new paths to arrive to others. Before was needed to send a personal letter, traveling months to arrive to an individual, but today on seconds it is possible to find information about thousands. So, humanity evolves in interesting ways. ",

            "answer_text": "This post connects deeply to my inner core of experiences. I feel as though whenever I speak to express an opinion, word of advice, momentary question, or in any means provoke a discussion about life, philosophy, wisdom, understanding, intelligence, or anything that is not considered humorous, rhetorical, anecdotal, professional in manner, or popular within the colloquial modality of thought, then it is 99.8 percent of the time neglected and detracted by others. And yet most the time even when that uniquely distinguished moment of interest does occur by someone who genuinely wants to listen and put thought into the conversation, the expression of ones words feel forced and the effort expelled fails to promote a feeling of gratitude and overall reciprocity of value exchanged between one another. The initial discussion of openness then transmutes into a monologue or rather a THESIS vs ANTITHESIS type dialogue and the channel for connection and any feeling of embrace becomes severed. Therefore, the one wanting to share in the conversation feels neglected and inevitably develops a behavior of discretion, humility, simpicity of thought, and will respond in favor of solitude over social engagement to mitigate these feelings of disconnection with others. Yet from this propensity towards a path of solitude, introspection, and intrinsically valued interests we still have this compelling feeling of catharsis to share with others in a careful or daring fashion. So, in summation based on my own empirical analysis, I would infer that those who possess higher levels of intelligence and training of mind will genuinely have a greater inclination towards spending time alone or with fewer people than the opposite of several or many. However, that being said, I am also convinced that this is primarily determined by ones choice of personality and attachment with others. For example, if you are one who can enthuse the majority of people to listen to you through wit, sarcasm, story telling, and other ways of persuasion and connective vibes then you have a higher capacity to thrive in both atmospheres. This would then depend on ones choice of habit. ",

            "answer_text": "Solitude, or being alone, is an individual choice, not a societal imposition. And it is certainly not an ensign that is assigned to \u2018intelligent people,\u2019 or to any particular group. We all suffer isolation in life and thought, when we do not subscribe to the values, beliefs, or actions of the hoi polloi, but how we choose to deal with this isolation will determine the liklihood and degree of our (self-imposed) solitude. While it is true that intelligence (depends on how this is defined), which is generally defined as the ability to process intellectually in a higher or more sophisticated realm, will necessarily be accompanied by its share of isolation in thought, it does not follow that persons at that level must be cast into solitary confinement. And if they are, then that is undoubtedly done by individual choice. Society dictates how it prefers its members to think and act, but only the individual member can decide how they will respond to such ushering. Yes, while we may have agreed to give body and soul to God and government, we still retain sovereignty over volition will. I think the great ones, from Socrates, to Gandhi, to Martin Luther King exemplified the viability of this. They also showed that intelligence is not just the acquisition of knowledge, but also the application of it, and one without the other is like Obama without Biden\u2026..but let\u2019s not digress. In both ancient and post-modern societies, quantitative methods are used to measure intelligence, and I am not convinced that these indicators are real, as they are socially constructed values. Moreover, they do not take into consideration that the ability to function at an elevated cerebral capacity is relative, and can be applied to a large spectrum of subjects, which do not fit squarely into the line-up of those conventionally used by IQ assessors. Artistic and creative abilities, for example, has never been included in any measure of \u2018intelligence,\u2019 yet it is a primary and direct functionality of the cerebral cortex (the storehouse of intelligence), and does not operate in isolation, but instead, works inextricably and organically in integrated brain processes (as does its counterpart, reason and rationality). And the exclusion of this area from the IQ determinator thus diminishes and disqualifies more than 60 % of the human population. Clearly then, the assessment of intelligence is relative, and what is considered intelligent in one society will vary geographical and culturally. So the measure that is today universally imposed is in itself an apparatus for insulation and segregation, and is a function of social organisation. Therefore, it is a societal inference and premise that \u2018intelligent\u2019 people should be singled out (for their own good, or the good of society); however, it still remains an individual choice to accept this distinction. Now let\u2019s look at this issue from another angle: if axiomatically, intelligence is the ability to process cogently and critically not just in the domain of cognition, but also in the sphere of meta-cognition, and apriori, that would mean then that such a person is exceptionally gifted in higher analysis and reason, yes? And if this is so, then a truly intelligent person should be able to not only figure out the pedestrian nuances of societal behest, but also to suss out, and make choices that benefit their general health and well-being, right!? After all, intelligence is a responsibility, and the first task of any reponsible member in society is to evaluate and negotiate their own meaningful contribution to self and society. And an individual who follows slavishly the urgings and inculcation of society, is neither an intelligent nor a meaningful participant\u2026...am I alone in this one?? The liklihood of lonliness then is an individual decision, and the statistics are dependent upon individual will. Therefore, if it happens that an individual decides (for their own reasons, perhaps even to reject societal norms) that being alone or in a camp with other like-minded individuals is the optimum environment to promote their (or societal) interest, then that is a conscious choice, and is neither a social prescription nor a proscription. Yes, perhaps the choice is influenced by societal prejudices and or pressures (or even their own ambit)\u2026\u2026.but it is still a conscious, volitional choice! ",

            "answer_text": "I would not say \"alone\", maybe I would say \"sad\"... Loneliness being the undesirable byproduct of sadness. The problem with intelligent people (I know because I happen to be one...) is we tend to believe our own rationalizations. Here is the process: A situation happen, involving someone or notWe process it through different angles until we find an angle (or story) that suits usWe are smart so we find 101 ways to make that particular story \"true\"Since we are smart, we know how to convince people that this particular story is TRUE.Then, people around you start to sing YOUR song. Not because they have bad intentions. Generally, it's quite the contrary.At that point, there's (almost) no return. You start to become sad. Of course you don't call yourself that, you prefer \"cynical\".And now the worst happens. People don't stick with cynicals. They listen to them until someone or something else catches their attention... and there you go, you are alone...So from my point of view, loneliness is just a side result that you get when you are just plain sad.  Why are we sad? I'm not talking about regular sadness that we all feel several times a week. I'm talking about chronical sadness that we prefer calling \"cynicism\". I go back to the stories we tell ourselves. We made them up and take a stand to make them true. Unfortunately most people don't know how to tell themselves empowering stories, ones that make us happy and work deliberately toward long term goals. Being with a precious one surely is one of the top 3 that everyone on this earth would choose.  So here you go guys, tell yourselves positive and empowering stories. ",

            "answer_text": "This question could be broken out a bit more. Of course the first supposition is that intelligent people are lonely. Then there's a comparative aspect. Intelligent compared to whom? Lonely, compared to whom? Maybe, underlying this question, are several others: Are intellectual people lonely? Are introspective people lonely? Are reserved, non expressive, introverted people lonely? Here are some definitions from the Merriam-Westerner dictionary, at Dictionary by Merriam-Webster: America's most-trusted online dictionary, about the above. Of course all of the definitions are the property of the dictionary: Definition of intelligent 1 a : having or indicating a high or satisfactory degree of intelligence and mental capacity b : revealing or reflecting good judgment or sound thought : skillful 2 a : possessing intelligence b : guided or directed by intellect : rational Definition of intellectual 1 a : of or relating to the intellect or its use b : developed or chiefly guided by the intellect rather than by emotion or experience : rational c : requiring use of the intellect intellectual games 2 a : given to study, reflection, and speculation b : engaged in activity requiring the creative use of the intellect intellectual playwrights Definition of introspective : characterized by examination of one's own thoughts and feelings : thoughtfully reflective : employing, marked by, or tending to introspection As a student, he was very quiet and introspective. \u2026 encouraging a balance between the fast, upbeat songs and a band's more introspective side. \u2014David T. Lindsay There's an interesting literature that suggests that when people are sad, they tend to pay attention to themselves. They become withdrawn and introspective and very aware of their body and their mind and not very aware of the external world. \u2014Peter Salovey Definition of reserved 1 : restrained in words and actions 2 : kept or set apart or aside for future or special use Definition of introverted : having or suggesting the characteristics of an introvert; especially : possessing a reserved or shy nature typically with an inclination to solitude It frustrates and pains me to hear so many stories about how misunderstood and overlooked most introverted people felt when they were growing up. \u2014Marti Olsen Laney \u2014compare to extroverted There is something of an interlock between these five different sets of definitions. You can see a sort of human type of emerging. A person with high-end thinking abilities, coupled with a life based on an attempt at rationality, not emotions, introverted and not very sociable and not expressive. Character Types Go In and Out of Fashion People my age and older may remember a type of social presentation that was very popular in the 1950's. This was the horn-rimmed glasses, formal business suit, unemotional, discursive, professorial type of guy. These were exclusively males and almost always white. You can still see the old instructional films on the Internet. A gentleman of this type, sitting at a bulky wooden desk, discoursing in a deliberate, rational sounding way, about some topic. A relevant example, Control Your Emotions:  Actually, in this example, the professorial guy is not wearing horn rims. However he is wearing a distinctly 1950's pair of glasses. I think he is wearing a men's formal, white jacket, instead of a lab coat. Nevertheless he's got the style cold. Control your emotions, yes! It still resonates with me. Typically, when you were about to make a critical point, what later became a bullet in a PowerPoint presentation, you momentarily took your glasses off and then hit your audience with your moral-rational punchline. You would explain why Communism results from personal failings, like a fear of honest work and a Christian family lifestyle, and why the somewhat related male homosexuality was the result of a domineering, overprotective mother, plus a lack of sports training in childhood. Encouragingly, both could be cured by psychotherapy. So, how did these guys have a social life? Maybe in the staff room at the university or at the Protestant church of their choice. However, in those days of well-established gender-specific roles, it was the responsibility of the professor's housewife to be the emotion holder, ideal for a woman because of their limited intellectual capabilities. You could send the Little Woman out to socialize. I apologize for the tinge of nostalgia in this description. We Need Updated Horn-Rims For the Twenty-First Century Then, the hippies happened. Then, the self-satisfying yuppies and then the era of big hugs and the man bun. Now we lack a self-presentation style for guys who mostly think, or think they are thinking, aren't all that in touch with whatever other emotions they might be able to squeeze out and, just don't do big hugs. And then we have those women who really just don't have much in the way of domestic desires and get off on statistics and articles from Science Daily. The intellectual, not seething with passions, no I don't want to vent and I don't need yours either, self-presentation, has almost become the new, reprehensible lifestyle of our era, sort of a replacement for that good, old fashioned, evil Communo-homosexuality. Young, dance club women look at you fearfully. The guys with backward baseball caps see you as a personal insult. If you are older, the grandmother-aged women of your generation want so much to share their emotions about their grandchildren. Show them that you can't emphasize and they will head for the hills. Then there's that office. They want bonding and team building. You are surrounded by milennials who see their job time as hook-up heaven. Introversion and introspection turn into a disciplinary issue. When Do Friendships Become Obnoxious? So much of life is based on not thinking. It's not just intellectual laziness. It's because, without dreams and illusions, people can't live. Generally, you don't have to do too much thinking. An orderly daily life carries you on. Get up, make breakfast, walk to the bus stop, work, walk to the bus stop, go home. On the weekend shopping in your grubbies and your favourite sports bar. What if you started thinking about this? The barren, frozen bus stop two hundred kilometres south of the edge of subarctic Canada. The job means an abusive manager and no promotions, ever. When you get home your spouse has just come home from an equally unsatisfying job and is in no mood for family warmth. The bills to pay for your house in the suburbs, etc. If you were to start thinking too much about this you could render yourself distinctly unhappy, no team player, no joy at a hockey victory by the Ottawa Senators, no unrestricted faith that a Conservative Party majority government will resolve all problems. Your doubts will seep out to your facial expressions and body language. Your bros will quickly notice the change. They won't be your bros anymore. But, in reverse, you will know that your bros don't want to do much thinking. Their emotions are too often about false things. It doesn't matter whether the Senators win or not. It's just a sports game. And your bros don't want to know, look out your car window and your suburb has precious little going for it. Do your own thinking a little more and you can end up asking, why do I have friends like this? How Much Thinking Do We Need? If I had bros they might ask me, why think when you don't have to? Particularly in a well-off industrial democracy with an adequate social safety net, you can get by without needing to think all that much. You don't need to think about daily survival. The social safety net reduces the social problems you might feel compelled to think about. However, if you have a relatively high intellectual capacity, your mental wheels start to spin. Some intelligent people feel a compulsion to think. This compulsion may be the biggest passion in their whole lives. This passion is not easily shared. It can make a whole lot of people uneasy when they are with you. This passion can kill most of your chances for friendships, love and sex. Intelligent With None of the Above Of course, you can be intelligent with none of the above issues. You may be intelligent with regard to a particular thing, like being a really good club DJ, or predicting next year's bond market. After that particular thinking is done, you are quite able to shut it down and go on to big hugs. Love, Lots of Emotions and Passion, for Intellectuals and Introverts It's like being gay. The economics of social life for intellectual introverts are not favourable. In a Quora Answer a few months ago, I did a very rough estimate of how much of a base population is required to support a gay bar in any given, fully industrialized, democratic city. I came up with about 500,000 people for every single gay bar. This takes account of how many people in a given population are likely to be gay and how many are prepared to openly act it out. The economics for intell-introverts (How about \u201cIntellovert\u201d for a new Alt-Right insult word? An Intellovert is not the same as a Libertard.) are worse. \u201cGay\u201d defines a fairly specific type of physical activity that requires one to seek out other Gays in order to do. Being an introverted, thoughtful, intelligent intellectual is a lot more diffuse. How large a population would it take to support an Intellovert bar, presumably a place with scientific lectures, analytical karaoke fun nights where you compete to sing out various intellectual constructs, nerd girl wet t-shirt contests, bouncers with horn-rimmed glasses, the whole works? If Ottawa had one I'd be down there like a flash. However, if one could conceptualize the details of such an establishment, what population base would you need, maybe 1,500,000 people per Intellovert bar? It's not a happy equation. Only The Lonely Know the Way I Feel All Day Take that classic song by the great Roy Orbison a bit further. It takes one intelligent, rather withdrawn, non-emotive person to know how another such person feels. How these sorts of intellectual hookups could be arranged is a challenge. Maybe the social media could help. However, even when you apply your enormous thinking power to the issue, the answer may still be far beyond you. Martin Levine ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds like you are in the beginning stages of an existentialist crisis. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism  I know the word \"crisis\" looks alarming, but it shouldn't. In this case it just means you are examining the point of your own existence. Will I always be alone? Why am I here? Eventually you may even question all existence and come to the seemingly frightening conclusion that we're all born alone and die alone and nothing in life has purpose. \"Well, that's horrible! You're depressing, why would you say such things?\" Again, I repeat- it is nothing to be alarmed about. Those things are true - to a degree. We are born alone and die alone, but we work to make connections with people who can support us, and that we can support in return. Intelligent or not, there will always be like minded people in the world somewhere and they are never easy to find for anyone. To me, making those connections is why I am here and is a large part of my purpose. No matter how intelligent, wealthy or attractive a person is - it can always be difficult to find true connections so that all of the sharing and giving is not a one way street. Intelligent people may have stricter standards for making friends (in fashion or other), but so might a wealthy person, or a very attractive one. All people fear being used and some are just more cautious than others. An intelligent person can read books on understanding human nature ( Ten Keys to Handling Unreasonable & Difficult People), body language Psychology Today and other psychology tools to assist them in making life long connections with other people.  So we may enter and leave the world with even our best friends not knowing our innermost thoughts, but sometimes that can be a good thing too. I know I find my inner thoughts annoying sometimes, I could only guess my friends would too. ",

            "answer_text": "There are already plenty of answers based on personal experience. The consensus is that the answer is \u201cyes\u201d, intelligent people are more likely to be alone, which while not a statistically rigorous result suggests that the empirical answer is also \u201cyes\u201d. Let me give a theoretical argument for why we should expect this to be the case. It is difficult to communicate across an excessive difference in intelligence. Over too large a gap in intelligence, the communications are either too verbose or vague for the more intelligent person, or too condensed and obscure for the less intelligent person. This gap was discussed by Rita Hollingworth and is sometimes known at the Hollingworth gap. It\u2019s possible to bridge this gap, but it takes more effort than is conducive to close personal relationships. This means that people generally need to find other people of comparable intelligence to form personal relationships and avoid being alone. For people of average or near average intelligence, there are plenty of such people and this isn\u2019t difficult. As intelligence departs from the average, the pool of people with whom one could form close personal relationships gets smaller so the chances of being alone gets larger. Thus, intelligent people are more likely to be alone. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I\u2019ll have to speak for myself. I don\u2019t know that many other highly intelligent people. :) Early in my life, I actually did feel alone. As I was growing up, there were many things I was learning at a rapid rate. Whenever you saw me, I usually had a stack of books in my arms. I read voraciously all the time, and when I wasn\u2019t doing that, I was in my (mostly electronics) \u201claboratory\u201d I created for myself in the basement, and being a poor boy from a poor family, I did not have much of a budget, so I went scavenging for electronics others would simply toss curb-side. I learned a lot that way, but it isolated me from the other kids. I did play with the other kids from time to time, but I spent much more time reading and experimenting. To the point that my parents thought something \u201cwas wrong\u201d with me, and actually took me to a psychologist about it. I recall 6th grade. I knew more science and mathematics than the teacher, which got me into trouble. I would correct her all the time on the science she simply got wrong, and she didn\u2019t like it. I mean, should not the teacher know more than the student? Fortunately, I did not get bullied in school for being so smart. Quite the opposite. I picked up the nick-name of \u201cmad scientist\u201d. Not so bad, I suppose! I\u2019ve only ever had a very few really good friends. I suppose I was into quality, not quantity. I was diffident in those days, and lacked a lot of self-confidence. I mean, I had no one to mentor or guide me. I had to do this on my own. So alone was the default. I lived with it, was ok with it. Not much of a choice, really. When I got to high school, it was the same deal repeated. I had 3 really good friends, 2 Indians and a Jew. We would hang out together after school, and one of my Indian friends was a chess prodigy at the time, perhaps the 2nd or 3rd best chess player in the entire State we were living in in the US. On graduation day, at the end of 12 years of public school, after I was handed my diploma, it hit me hard that this episode in my life was all over, and all my friends were going off to various colleges or doing other things. I felt totally alone in a way far deeper than before. But then, the rest of my life laid in front of me. I didn\u2019t know what I would do. But I would think of something. (BTW, if your recognise the reference, let me know!!!) Spinning massively forward to today, 40 years later, do I feel alone? Yes and no. Actually, it\u2019s not all that important to me anymore. Sometimes I prefer to be alone with my own thoughts. When around others, I always have to find something to spark the conversation, else awkward silence will ensue. ",

There are many other intelligent people that are socially more intelligent than most and likely never be alone. I  have been told I was smart many times but I have never thought much of  it.  Like other compliments or praise, I find them mostly bull-crap, I  respect criticism and find it more truthful, it allows me room and  direction for improvement.  I have  friends of all types but outside of physical activities there are few I  find interesting or that are on the same level of information,  understanding or emotional control. I find many of them ignorant,  defensive, childish, and often boring or frustrating. I though have a  few friends I find very intellectual that we can converse for hours on  the same level without emotional issues. It I believe is the same thing  in sexual relationships.  I have no issues as long as sex is all we do,  but when we  converse there always seems to be something that  strikes a nerve and it is down hill from there, I hate drama I have little patience or sympathy for those who can not control their emotions. I am most content around  those I find intelligent, an more intelligent is better because they  are more interesting, usually more secure, less emotional and I am learning, I do not know any highly intelligent people who are very active, but I have known many who are extremely skilled at  things and I am both impressed and  drawn to their skills.  I am a visual learner and enjoy learning everything though I need not be the best, I am only satisfied when I know I am equal to. Their are all types of intelligent people, some are more intelligent in social skills than most, some are less, some find a social life less important than others things, there is I believe someone for everyone but if you neither need or want this, it does not matter.  Then it is my experience that when you are not looking is when you find it.  Funny though how humans feel  everyone must integrate,  the way of nature has always been for living  things to stay within their own.  There is less conflict and more  understanding when you are alike.  There does not have to be fear or  conflict between those different than you, but it is the nature if things in those  who are insecure, fear, and act before they think. It is though very clear  when you are with those like you how much more comfortable it is. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many reasons an intelligent person would like to be alone. They may be an introvert, they may be cocky and think that other people are annoying, they may feel like they don\u2019t fit in, they may be depressed, or they may have social anxiety. Finally, some intelligent people live in areas where intelligence is not accepted. I would say that, just like everyone else, about half of intelligent people are introverted. This is because introverts make up about 50% of the population. So, said intelligent person may be an introvert. Some intelligent people are arrogant and feel that because they are smarter than other people, they don\u2019t have time for them. These people exist in most intelligence bracket and every field. It is not a symptom of being intelligent, simply of having a big ego. People who feel like they don\u2019t fit in, or have social anxiety often avoid people. Some of these people are intelligent. So that might be the reason. People who are depressed often avoid people. Intelligent people can be depressed. This may be the reason an intelligent person want\u2019s to be alone. If an intelligent person lives in an area where they are bullied for being intelligent, they may withdraw from people. If your question implies that intelligent people as a group prefer to be alone, they you are wrong. Intelligence has no connection with wanting to be alone, and people are different. My best friend is very intelligent. She is going to college to finish her junior and senior year of high school and her freshman and sophomore year of college at the same time. She also generally likes to be part of groups. She likes to hang out with friends, and you would think she is an extravert. Not even all introverts prefer to be alone most of the time. My sister is pretty intelligent and she is the most extraverted person I know. She HATES to be alone. In conclusion, intelligent people may want to be alone for the same reason people of average or below average intelligence would want to be alone. Intelligence is not tied to wanting to be alone in any way unless a person is the victim of bullying because of it. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, its because my brain thinks about the big picture all the time, and its really all that interests me. So when I socialize, and people wanna discuss simpler things, I have nothing to talk about, or I\u2019ll get all philosophical about whatever topic they bring up, which is just annoying, and I realize that. Things like Nihilism, existentialism, the futility of existence, the future of humanity, space travel etc etc. These aren\u2019t things common people like discussing. Im sure everyone thinks about them from time to time sure, but for me, they colour my whole entire world view, and for others, that\u2019s just extremely depressing and annoying to interact with. Also, I can\u2019t fake my way through common discussions, like who won the latest hockey game, or if I heard about the latest x and y scandal or sexual allegations on the news. So I mostly just keep to myself. It\u2019s entertaining in here anyways. I do however, love going out dancing. This way I get to be among large groups of people, but not have to fully interact with them, just an occasional wave, or hi, how are you. More about just the communal aspect of everyone there, sharing a love for music. Something very enjoyable about that. But yeah, even though I isolate, I am never lonely, and Im thankful for that. Since I see so many other people who are terrified of being alone, that they cling to toxic relationships, and are mostly unhappy. No thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to be thought intelligent by some; I don\u2019t know anymore, but . . . Mostly I don\u2019t like having to be \u201con.\u201d That is, listening to people and responding to what they say when I\u2019m supposed to. It\u2019s a lot of tedious work and usually boring. In those situations I\u2019m usually just waiting for it to be over. I like being around really smart people, really funny people and young beautiful people, but that\u2019s not who I usually get to hang out with. Usually I just want to get back to my NYT crossword puzzle or designing circuits in my head or deciding which of my guitars to drill a new hole in or whatever book I\u2019m reading. I\u2019m never bored when I\u2019m alone; I never have been. I was a completely self-entertaining kid. If I didn\u2019t have anything to work on or anyone to play with, I\u2019d go for a hike or a bike ride. I\u2019m only bored around other people and then only if I\u2019m forced to pay attention to them. One thing I love to do is go to a Starbucks or an IHOP or someplace and just sit and work the puzzles in the newspaper. My favorite place is a restaurant across from the university that is like a huge junior high-school cafeteria. It even smells like one. It is noisy with dishes clanging and kids screaming and hundreds of people talking at once and you even pick your own food up at the counter so you don\u2019t have a waitperson coming around to interrupt you. I love the loud busy atmosphere because, as many people as there are, each jabbering mindlessly about something, I\u2019m not obligated or expected to pay any attention to any of them. I love it. In fact if I did pay undue attention to anyone they\u2019d probably think I was some kind of weirdo pervert person. That\u2019s why I like to be alone, but like I said, if you\u2019re scary smart, wicked funny or movie star beautiful, look me up; I\u2019ll try to come out of my shell. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, i feel very, very lonely right now. When reading this, keep in mind i'm 29 years old. I just went to see a miyazaki movie, and i could not get a single person to come with me. I'm a huge \"nerd\".  I read about 3-4 books each week,  and i'm constantly feeding my brain with information. When i was 6-7 i re-discovered some mathematical rules because i felt that standard mental calculation was inefficient. At 16-17, i could manage to do  multiple 9 digits operations pure mentally, up to the point my classmates would be unable to keep up with me with a calculator. My true strength is problem solving and pattern recognition, this allowed me to be extremely proficient in computer science. Also, it makes me a decent psychologist without any former training(i have a university psychology student under therapy, if you can believe that.)  I always try to see the best in people, and to enjoy their company. But i have a problem: to me, to use an example from one of the answers, it feels exactly like talking to children. They have often problems that i cannot relate in any way, because either i would not have the problem in the first place, or the solution is so obvious to me, that i pass off as \" the know-it-all\" guy. I can cover from literature to physics to biology, psychology, Japanese culture, medicine, mechanics, i could(i'm rusty) play guitar to genius level, receiving praises from people that had a formal and complete musical education. Also, English is not my first language, and i learned it all by myself, learning trough reading and listening non translated content. I did all kinds of works: from the tech guy of a store, to play music for a living, carpenter, plumber, stall boy, IT consultant, i even went on tv and posed as a tarot card reader without effort.  EVERYTHING i do feels very, very boring. Like there is no true challenge, only a level of effort of a slightly higher quality that i do not want to put in for something so boring. I do not have any real friends, and i never had a lasting relationship. The last one failed because she felt a sense of inferiority to me, and i assure you she was a very bright and smart girl, surely in the 130/140iq range but she could not take the pressure. Every time i'm forced to talk to people it feels to  me like i have to \"decompress\" information to make them understand me. like when you need to explain to a child why does it rain in very simple words. My brother-in-law, a very very smart person still finds it difficult to follow me when i start talking at the abstraction level(PhD at La Sapienza,Rome)  Even on a subject he knows very well, his mind can't make the connections fast enough for him to follow, and i have to slow down. I realized soon enough that my thoughts are processed at a speed several times that of the people around me, because i learned how to skip the thought-through-words brain level and think straight with the thought-through-concepts level. That also allows me to completely disengage  meaning and language, gifting me the capacity to understand foreign languages or extremely hard concepts( like, imaging space as quadri-dimensional entity) with minimal effort(though the only language i'm proficient in,beside Italian, is English.)All the stuff above, makes me a very, very, very lonely person. I often questioned if i was raised by my biological parents or not, what i feel is total alienation from \"common\" people, and at some point in the delusions that came growing up with such a mind, i also asked myself if i was some kind of genetic mutation.  If you ever wanted to ask a member of an endangered species, \"how does it feel to be the last of your kind\", i think i can answer you;  It's very, very lonely, and it has a sense of doom. ",

            "answer_text": "please note, this list is in no particular order! a lot of times, people don\u2019t want to spend time with them. They are often perceived to be arrogant, condescending, and a know it all.They are usually introverts, meaning that socializion is incredibly draining and they must take a break from people.They think better when they are alone.Small talk is excruciating to them, so when all anyone does is small talk, they generally can\u2019t stand to participate for long. They must have meaningful conversation that is worthwhile.Many of them learned not to open up when they were young.People can be annoying sometimes (people can get to seem that way when they don\u2019t understand that your an introvert)A lot of them can be socially awkward due to being shut down and ostracized by their classmates early on. Of course there are many brilliant people who are extremely adept in social situations but there have been some who learned a little late due to being ostracized in their early years.They tend to appear mysterious to the outside world since most don\u2019t usually speak without reason. Usually they don\u2019t talk just for the sake of making noise, they usually use conversion to discuss ideas, theories, etc, which kind of can tie into my first point but whatever.They tend to see things that others dont, and see another side to stories, and recognize that nothing is surface deep. Other people generally have difficulty understanding their logic (if they are really up there.) and they, ironically, can seem rather irrational to average people. Because of this (and most of the other reasons of course), they can find it hard to connect with people.a lot of people can be frustrated because, \u201cthey always have turn everything into an argument! Why can\u2019t we just talk without conflict?!?!?\u201d Though, they don\u2019t usually argue or debate just to prove that they are right. It\u2019s usually not a conflict in their eyes, it\u2019s usually more intended to find out which view is more correct, not in a competitive sense, but more because they just want to get closer to the truth and let go of what is false.Many of them really don\u2019t care who\u2019s popular, or silly things like that. Social boundaries, rules, norms, etc, are all unnecessary nuisances and mainly just get in the way of what\u2019s important.Often times, the world inside their head is much more interesting than what the outside world has to offer.Intelligent people are more likely to develop depression. I myself went through an episode of depression that lasted all through middle school. I remember not wanting to have anything to do with people then.Their interests are almost certainly different from less intelligent people.edit: alright, i think this answer needs an overhaul. I will make some changes later. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Andy McNish\u2019s comment in his answer: \u201chigh intelligence makes you more comfortable with being alone.\u201d Developing your cognitive capacity helps to build a kind of independence, you have your own psychological resources. My family tends to be introverted, working class autodidacts, who influenced me to look to constant reading. Doing this from a young age meant I built up cognitive capacity, and this was reflected in the tests schools given to children (which are derived from the same source as IQ tests). This building up of cognitive capacity is something that requires work on your part \u2014 it doesn\u2019t just come with genes. This is a reason that scores on IQ tests can be affected in various ways \u2014 can be changed through kinds of study. In my youth I was also sort of clueless in regard to social skills \u2014 relating to others. But the thing is this: Social skills can be learned. Through being a teacher and doing union organizing, I learned how to talk with people, to communicate in their own language, to listen. I also developed my ability to be more empathic \u2014 which I was not as a teenager. In recent decades I\u2019d say I\u2019m fine with being alone. My occupation as a writer means I do my own research and do writing as my own activity \u2014 fits in with my psychology. But I also really like getting together with friends, and I like my occasional political or other group meetings. It\u2019s just that I can only put up with so much of it. ",

            "answer_text": "In short yes: Most intelligent people have tons of things to do, finding a drinking buddy for friday and trying to write a business plan are quite different thingsWe are cursed by ambition, some of us born into shitty conditions in life and unfortunately are aware of the fact that we have only one life to liveIt\u2019s emotionally draining to be with people you don\u2019t get along withThere is not one but several perspectives, 90% of the people often lack the insight to judge a circumstance from different points or leading causesFriendship matters, but trying to make friends with everyone is pointless. Having 1 or 2 close friends is enoughWe are true to our cause, standing alone is better than being invisible in a herdDrinking is not my favorite passtime, once I reach my first 1 Billion, why not I will be gladly partying every friday, but until that there is no time to relax. Alcohol itself is a demon that slowly gets you stuck in a rutWe are aware of how fake most friendships are, a lot of these \u201cfriends\u201d only gather for drinking or shit talk about each otherBeing alone gives me freedom to do what I want with no judgement or distractions. I asked my friends the other day to go sky diving with me, I only forgot that they lack money andWhile we might look slow or boring, in fact we tend to be a lot restless, depending on a group to make decisions is incredibly slow and painful processSuperior social skills, this might sound strange but people who often driven by curiosity and ambition tend to meet with more people while retaining useful contacts and connections, where as average joes tend to collect drinking buddies more often than not",

Personally, I love to read anything and everything and have a thirst for knowledge and have had since I was a child. It\u2019s been my experience that not a lot of people share my interests and perhaps I bore them with my topics of discussion. I will find a subject and read everything I can find in the library as well as online. I stay away from politics, religion, and surgeries. A lot of the people I know want to discuss those three subjects and are so fixed in their opinions that sometimes in my mind\u2019s eye they appear to look like rabid animals. I am past the point in my life where I have to control, nag, attempt to manipulate, or spend time convincing someone to adopt my points of view. I just want to enjoy whatever time I have left on the planet. I hope I leave this world having made a worthwhile contribution and I do that by tutoring grade school children in math and reading at no cost to their parents. Frankly, I get more out of the time spent than the children, but when after a few sessions they start getting 100\u2019s on tests and/or increase several levels it makes me happy that I\u2019ve done something worthwhile. I like people. I just don\u2019t enjoy chatter. ",

Intelligent people can be highly social and extroverted. But even those that are are often very comfortable when left alone with just their hyperactive brains for company. They don't get bored spending hours with the ideas spinning around inside their heads. And for many of the more introverted ones, it can be their preference. I lived with a friend who was doing a Physics PhD at the time, called Rob. I went off to work quite often with him sitting on a sofa, staring at a wall. 9 hours later I'd come back and he'd be sitting on the same sofa, staring at the same wall. We were worried that he was depressed in some way, but, no, he was fine. He just liked to spend most of his time on \u201cPlanet Rob\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I love being alone. Sure there are moments of loneliness\u2026but by and large I make it through those moments. I paint, I write, I\u2019m a jazz pianist, I sculpt, I design and build furniture. I once read a lot, but now reading just puts me to sleep. I thoroughly enjoy driving trips and 2 years ago returned to California after I and my dog Bear spent 2 years traveling the western states. Camping, motel-ling and hotel-ling or sleeping under the stars in the bed of my truck. I can count the friends I\u2019ve had through my lifetime, on my fingers and have a few fingers leftover. What few friends there have been were very good friends. There have been many acquaintances\u2026but they were just that. I live with a lady\u2026a companion\u2026thankfully she is gone quite a bit. I miss her for a day or two when she is gone, but ease right into being a loner very quickly. And when she returns I love having her with me\u2026for a short while\u2026then I find myself looking forward to her next trip. She a loner as well, but somewhat more social than I am. We are a good match. We built her a \u2018tiny house\u2019 which is parked next to the house (we live in the country) because there are times she wants to \u2018escape\u2019 from me and be alone\u2026or at times I\u2019ll use the tiny house to escape from her. All in all it works out well. Answer; yes. alone time is very valuable and I believe required for peace of mind for intelligent as well as creative people. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people have a short attention span which is why the media portions out the news in sound bites directed at an 8th grade level audience. There is a general societal-wide attitude that intelligent people should get some respect but the average person responds interactively with intelligent people in a manner that dismisses that person's intellect because they feel discomfited because they resent feeling like they are being schooled by a teacher. Because they feel inferior or envious, people interacting with highly intelligent persons often attempt to categorize that person in a somewhat negative stereotype such as \"geek\" or the \"absent minded professor\".  A person of intellect has these experiences frequently in most social circles and because of this chooses to limit such profitless activity.   So, the answer to your question is yes, intelligent people are more likely to be alone as society does not really promote them. The caveat is that when a highly intelligent person finds a suitable mate, they are extremely loyal and generous with that partner and shower their partner with love, attention, and affection, because they appreciate and value that person so highly.

But, i would love to play the devil\u2019s advocate and share another perspective (or point of view) In this new optimistic way of thinking of mine, I would say not necessarily. In my opinion an intelligent person should be able to quickly find the clues of a successful relationship may it be between friends or his/her romantic partner. Sure this intelligent person needs some experiences in order to successfully create and maintain those relationships. But, i would guess he/she would be able to learn the \u201csecret\u201d for a good social dynamic (or relationship), way sooner than the average intelligent people. Also his interest should be taken into consideration (even though having a good social network and especially a good healthy marriage, in my opinion are quite important), if that intelligent person dedicates his/her life to studies or something else that he/she may find affection (or passion) then for sure he/she will likely suffer in that area (or aspect) of life such as friendships or relationships, thus will it be more likely to him/her to find him/herself most of the time alone and with not healthy friendships or relationships. Now someone may argue that yes intelligent people are more likely to be found alone because not many people understand them. But my counter argument would be, shouldn\u2019t intelligent people be able to have friendships easily and the moment that they would feel alone have a friend by their side. In my opinion, firstly, an intelligent person is the one who retrieves information and can find clues (or solutions) quicker than the majority of the folks. And secondly, even though I am a little bit on the fence (not sure), with the statement that i shall write, i think an intelligent person should live a happy and successful life. In the end of a symphony or a masterpiece what matters is how you\u2019ve been left emotionally, and if you\u2019ve been left with this feeling of fulfilment, happiness or feeling good bravo to you and if not maybe you should change some things in your life or the way you think. And happiness, i am mentioning happiness because that\u2019s what matters in my opinion the most, comes from three main sources 1) being content with your professional career 2) having good friends and 3) having a good intimate relationship. I know that life is difficult and many people claim that intelligent people are more prone to depression and other mental illnesses but hey aren\u2019t intelligent people supposed to be the ones who can find a way out of the life\u2019s challenges, like not being alone :P (and hopefully, if they are really intelligent even light our paths to the unkown and enlightment) ?

            "answer_text": "In short, the answer is YES! Most intellectually gifted beings are introverts. Where as they typically draw into themselves more often than not. They have this insatiable need to feed their curiosity with as much data as they can collect. There are very few who share their insatiable curiosity to understand everything around them. Which is why I think they like to spend unhealthy amounts of time alone. *Judgement free zone\u2026 It can produce a feeling of loneliness seldomly, but that\u2019s mostly when they decide to compare their lives to others who they have very few things in common with. This is what I like to call the \u201cemotional abyss\u201d. The life one seems to envy of others, is not for everyone! They were chosen\u2026 and bestowed with this gift/curse of intelligence. It\u2019s enigmatic! It can either lift you up or weigh you down, contingent upon how you choose to look at it. A select few have developed the social/situational acumen to assimilate into mainstream society, but in my opinion, it would be to their own detriment. They think light years ahead of the most people they interact with and the majority of the time will be giving explanations & trying to pinpoint on where they lost someone; whilst not trying to judge them for their ignorance. Which is a task in and of itself\u2026So in essence, They will always be alone\u2026 even in a crowded room\u2026 You can \u2764\ufe0f it or Hate it. the choice is yours?

            "answer_text": "[Question: Why are geniuses always solitary individuals?] I suppose some of them might be solitary because they think differently from others and it can be difficult to form relationships with people who think differently. But there are geniuses who are not solitary, and there are non-geniuses who are solitary, and I am not aware of any real evidence (just a few examples) that geniuses are more likely to be solitary than others. I think it is most likely that geniuses are solitary for the same reasons (and there are many reasons) that anybody else is solitary. There is a sort of mythology of geniuses as being very different from other people. It is mostly false. Geniuses are mostly just like anybody else. And they usually don\u2019t make a big deal about it, so you don\u2019t know it when you meet one. Some possibilities of where the solitary genius idea might come from: People who make a big deal about being a genius (a rather large percentage of whom are not geniuses by any definition other than inflated self-image) tend to be rather obnoxious people. Nobody wants to be around them.There is a condition called savantism where a person is incredibly good at one thing, but struggles at many other things including interpersonal skills. It is rare, possibly an autism-spectrum disorder, and most geniuses are not savants.Some people feel cheated because others are gifted, and console themselves that geniuses pay a price in other areas. But the universe isn\u2019t fair that way.",

Coming back to what you asked and probably wanted to hear, the answer is yes. The more intelligent the person is, the less people there are that could interest them enough so that the person does not seem bored. Imagine, that there is a person who is 1000 years old and this person is the only one of this age alive, other are 100 years old maximum. Now imagine that all those people try to relate to this \u201cmillenial\u201d with the same problems / events / questions / stories that this person has already heard multiple / hundreds / thousands of times. For example, a father, fully covered in joy tears, who has just seen birth of his daughter, approaches this person with her, and says \u201cisn\u2019t she wonderful? isn\u2019t the birth of a human the most amazing thing?\u201d, but the 1000 years old person has seen this \u201ccrap\u201d hundreds / thousands of times already and this is just completely out to their sphere of interest. Now, you might say that there is no such person who reached even 200 years old. Yes, there is none, if you count \u201cage\u201d by the years of existence, not by the amount of experiences / associations in comparison to the \u201caverage person\u201d. But if you count it by the latter, I can reassure you there are people that are ~1000 years old living on this planet right now. All of the above mentioned does not, probably, mean that that particular \u201coldie\u201d or any other \u201coldie\u201d is certainly alone, but there is undoubtedly a correlation between intelligence and \u201cthickness of the filter\u201d that people have towards stuff (including alive beings), that might interest them, that they encounter throughout their life. You can interest a child with a colored striped stick, but show it to their father and his face will manifest surprise or bewilderment. You can in the same way appeal to the average person with new features on your phone in the latest OS release, but\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the type of intelligence you're talking about. There are certainly people with very high IQs whose interests are limited to narrow ranges that people with normal IQs can't understand. Such people by definition then aren't going to want to interact with a lot of people and thus are more likely to be alone. Additionally it's common for intelligent people to be anxious. If you cannot enjoy other people because such interactions fill you with stress, then you'll probably isolate yourself. It's crucial to understand though that the ability to understand someone else's perspective is itself a type of intelligence, and those that can do this are LESS likely to be alone. One might be tempted to classify this as a simplistic \"IQ isolates, EQ brings together\",  but I think anyone who dismisses themselves as simply being good at the former and not the latter isn't being entirely rational. If intelligence represents on some level the ability to understand things, what does it say if an intelligent person falls apart whenever anything of sufficient complexity gets in their way? ",

I get the impression they only want to hear their annoying voice and not show interest in my worldly wise opinions. Or, perhaps, they are only interested in listening to people from own little clique and age group. Anyone over 50 is an old person who is considered out of touch or stupid. I have very good computer skills and a wide variety of knowledge. I just don\u2019t have a piece of paper that tells me I am smart. I always get the same comparison too. \u201cYou\u2019re just like my uncle, or dad!\u201d Then there are those who are not on the same page ( or in the same universe) and presume to think that I am a smart person who was well educated. They are only interested talking about the latest sporting event, movies, tv series, gossip, cars, getting drunk, smoking dope, and yapping all day long because of their insecurities. When I try to give advice or share some knowledge someone will abruptly cut me off. Women are the worst culprits. I seem to be more productive and happy when I am alone in my place. This is my special comfort zone where no one can interject nor can anyone annoy me. The world outside world seems like an episode of The Twilight Zone with strange situations full offbeat and weird characters. ",

Why would I want to go out and get doused in muddy water by some idiot driver when I can reside in comfort and tend to my actual interests? I don\u2019t care about your relationships, your ambitions, your great achievements, your stupid hardships, your frankly terrible fashion sense, and I especially don\u2019t care about Manchester United\u2019s recent match or whatever the fuck. Now, this is not always true. To some extent, I enjoy the company of people with whom I can be honest, so that the conversation has actual potential and doesn\u2019t revolve around who\u2019s getting emotionally triggered. That conversation has potential for growth, because if you don\u2019t go past certain limitations, you can\u2019t achieve a topic\u2019s full prospects. I also enjoy the company of animals. They\u2019re cute little fellas. Yes, I do realize I am essentially labeling myself as intelligent by answering, bugger off. ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly. It's more like \u201cI rather not be alone but it's better being alone than stressing myself with socialization\u201d. For me talking to average people is often frustrating, similar to talking to toodlers: you can't make it enjoyable for long. I feel like most things people say are stupid, but not in a mean way. High QI people usually have more empathy, observe more and thinks a lot before expressing opinions. It's not like we think the people are stupid, but they act and think in a stupid way, or at least stupid from one's perspective, which means not having as developed traits, I had extreme existential crises because I thought either me or the rest of the world isn't working as it should. And people may not understand what're saying although it's supposed to be simple. So socializing can be pointless and stressful. More intelligent people (just like every other human being) longs for company, but it's better not having any company than having social interaction that are not enjoyable by anyone. It's just a \u201codd one's out\" game, if everyone had high IQ the few low IQ people would feel unfittable and would prefer not talking to others at all rather than talking to people that speak like aliens.

            "answer_text": "The narcissism and sense of superiority displayed in some of these comments reminds me of the way some white people talk about black people.  Clearly most who've answered regard themselves as \"smart\". Even though there was no definition of what \"smart\" means everyone has implicitly assumed \"IQ smart\" which is a very limited way to judge anyone.  What about mechanically smart? Or artistically smart? Is there only one kind of smart that matters? But to have a stab at answering the question. If you're the kind of \"smart\" person whose whole sense of self is seen through the prism of that \"smartness\" and you need to constantly reinforce this identity by humiliating \"less smart\" people -  then this will undoubtedly affect your ability to relate to others. Having a high opinion of oneself and not being shy in displaying it - is an extraordinarily ugly trait. But the really smart people have the humility to recognise how stupid they are when faced with the complexity of life and as such are less likely to assume a self appointed alter.  Remaining human is the key. If you remain human you won't be lonely. ",

This is not always the case but it is what I have personally found to be true. You also have to look at how they were they raised. Did their family see how intelligent they were? Did they do activities to help them become more social? Really intelligent people have a tendency to be less talkative, they listen and chime in only when they find something or someone very interesting. Some people say they are socially reclusive or awkward. I personally genuinely find them very interesting but sometimes they can seem like they are on the spectrum. They do better in small settings versus large crowds, but this is just my observation. Obviously some of it is genetic and some of it is learned. So are they lonely? I'd say some are but most are not. Highly intelligent people do not need other people around to be stimulated. But let's face it highly intelligent or borderline low intelligence, none of us like being alone all of the time. ",

            "answer_text": " If you often opt to spend your evenings snuggled in bed with a boozy beverage and Netflix, it\u2019s probably a sign you\u2019re an introvert. But while flying solo can reveal a lot about your personality, it might say something about your smarts, too. Yes, it\u2019s true: New research says that introverts could have a higher IQ. Generally speaking, the more often people socialize with friends, the happier they feel. But intelligent people tend to prefer their \u201cme time,\u201d according to a new study by researchers at Singapore Management University and the London School of Economics. Sound familiar? You\u2019ll probably agree with these hidden strengths of introverts , too. To reach these results, the team of psychologists conducted two studies using data from a massive national review of over 15,000 people between the ages of 18 and 28. The first study examined the link between subjects\u2019 scores on an intelligence test, the population density in the area where subjects lived, and how satisfied subjects reported feeling with their lives. Meanwhile, the second evaluated how subjects\u2019 IQ scores compared to their life satisfaction and how often they socialized with friends. Overall, participants who lived in less populated areas reported feeling happier, whereas those with high IQ scores who lived in the same areas felt less satisfied. Most people were also happier the more often they socialized, the results found. But on the flip side, intelligent people reported feeling less satisfied with their lives the more time they spent with friends. These weird habits prove you are smarter than most , too. While these two conclusions seem to contradict each other, the psychologists believe they can be explained by \u201cthe savanna theory of happiness.\u201d Here\u2019s the basic rundown: Back when our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, spending time with friends was essential to survive; now, as a result, most of us feel unhappy when we are isolated. But because people with high IQs don\u2019t follow that norm, some scientists believe that intelligent brains are simply more adaptable to what would otherwise be unusual environments, such as being alone or living in crowded communities.

The most common thing smart people share is : They have their own zone, in which they seek peace and solace from the outer world and its peaceful according to them.They select their company carefully or even if they hang out with rag and tag team of their age cohorts they don't see them as a permanence factor rather just as an acquaintance.They\u2019re more \u2018End goal\u2019 focused but they ensure that the journey towards there is a memorable one. Which negates what half of the surrounding individuals are thinking at the moment ( normal human being never thinks of doing something at 70 when he is 17 ).Their moral compass is quite high which annoys half of the individuals in their vicinity.It's hard to force them into doing something, they're interest driven individual.They're ambitious, talented and possess a great amount of knowledge in different fields, which makes them a little intimidating to their peers.They enjoy the company of human beings too, but since they search for people that share their brain bandwidth, it becomes a little hard for them to find the exact same person they're looking for.8. They make sure another individual they care about grows alongside them (in terms of knowledge). 9. They believe in changing the world through what other people consider hopes and dreams. 10. They're kind individuals who believe the fact that everyone deserves a fair chance. These \u2018 Smart People \u2018 exist out of a common education system, but they enjoy the presence of one teacher who gets them and guides them accordingly ( a mentor ) Their personality attracts many individuals towards them. They compare themselves to ones who\u2019re already successful, as they believe doing things differently is the key to achieving something great. They may at times appear depressed because they're goal driven and once it falls apart they become confused on what to do next (mainly college and budding career stage ), that being said they're quick on their feet and can think of a response faster than most around them. Most of the smart people are not at all snobby, arrogant or unamusing. It's just that their idea of fun mostly doesn't fit well with others. I hope this was the answer you were looking for. Have a good day. ",

I have zero interest in the latest gossip about some Hollywood star or singer, some fashion trend, etc. If the topic were more substantive, the conversation would be very short as most people cannot give a single reason for anything they believe (if you don\u2019t know anything about a topic, you shouldn\u2019t have an opinion) which makes it impossible to hold a sustained conversation. Or as my brother has often said, think of the average person in the street and realize that half the people are even stupider than that. Considering the average person in the street, that\u2019s a scary thought. To take a single example, former Tonight Show host Jay Leno used to go around asking random people on the streets of New York City various simple questions; questions so simple that you would think anybody would know the answer and yet most don\u2019t. He might ask, \u201cWho won the American Civil War?\u201d and the person on the street would turn around and in all seriousness have to ask who was in it. And half the people are even stupider than that! Now what exactly am I supposed to talk about with these people? ",

They are always thinking. Even if they are suppose to be relaxing, they pick up a book, laptop, do work on the phone, jot down ideas and plans, etc. They can never learn enough, do enough, they enjoy challenges and problem solving, they tend to avoid unnecessary drama, they work long hours, have written daily goals and plans, are self driven, and are very focused. I prefer to feel productive than to just sit around. I am always working on multiple things at once. I can work 14+ hours a day, and I still wish I had more hours to work. When I see people watching a lot of tv, I am thinking about what they could be doing to be more productive. Then, I think, what a waste of time and intelligence. I am not referring to educational programs. I am highly creative and intellectual, so I prefer my own company than being around those who are not.

            "answer_text": "Definitely. Based on the very strong negative infant mortality rate correlation (r=-.84) with average IQ that has been replicated with many different data sets. Low infant mortality rates implies less likely to have kids, have sex, socialize, get married, more likely to get married later in life, more likely to be a virgin, socially awkward, infertile, sterile, have erectile dysfunction, use birth control, get abortions, not be good in the bedroom, etc\u2026 Such implications of low infant mortality rates have been shown as true for countries like Japan (a country with an extremely low infant mortality rate): \u2018Disinterest in sex is rising in both genders of all ages, the survey shows. It was this which prompted Shukan Shincho\u2019s \u201crock bottom\u201d remark. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d affirms a 23-year-old male university student to whom the weekly speaks, \u201cthat many men have no interest in women. My own friends seem quite satisfied to moon over anime voice actresses and computer game characters.\u201d\u2019 - The decline and fall of Japan and its sex drive | The Japan Times \u201cNow a survey of unmarried people aged 18 to 34 found that around 42 per cent of men and 44.2 per cent of single women had never had sex.\u201d - More than 40 per cent of Japan's adult singles are virgins, says study The infant mortality correlation with average IQ is still among the strongest ever found. Low infant mortality and birth rates can only mean that people are having less sex, using birth control more often, or infertile\u2026what else could it mean? It seems like the media stereotype of high average IQ groups as nerdy dork losers who rarely ever have sex or socialize really is true. ",

            "answer_text": "I think most answers here have failed to answer the essence of your question. Probably the complexity arises from the fact that it's an odd situation where the essence of your query is split between a trait and a behavioral preference - intelligence and the choice to be alone. While most have focused on the reasons why intelligent people will possibly choose to be alone, none of the answers I read even attempt to analyze what intelligence will enable a person to do. At the risk of sounding like a pompous moron, it's probably because the authors had none. In my opinion, intelligence is not only of the cognitive kind but also moral and emotional intelligence. The general consensus is that \"smart people\" have a high IQ. That could not be more further from the truth. Intelligence is not just a human trait, it's a biological trait. Any thing that lives has intelligence, however basic that may be. Last time I checked, a dolphin would miserably fail an IQ test but could outwit most of the authors here. Probably even myself. Intelligence is not only the ability to apply logic and reason but also show empathy and draw from experience. In short, intelligence is nothing but the ability to adapt. So \"smart people\" are those who show high levels of cognitive, moral and emotional intelligence. The balance is the key. Hence truly, a smart person will never be alone but rather choose when it is necessary to be alone and not. His or her ability to blend and adapt to multiple situations is the pinnacle of intelligence.Survival of the fittest, remember? ",

            "answer_text": "Not all intelligent people want to stay by themselves but a lot of Intelligent Introverted people do. I think some of the answers are leaning towards an almost anti-social personality type when not all intelligent people are like this. For one a lot of intelligent people are highly intelligent enough to know when they need to be social. It may kill them to have some of the ridiculous, meaningless conversations with others but most intelligent people know this sometimes needs to be done and can dumb it down when they need to so they don't make others feel intimidated or for others to think they are better than them or come off as a know it all. Intelligent people are also intelligent enough to conform to any situation or to stay out of one that wouldn't be in their or anyone else's best interest. Intelligent Introverts need major alone time and a lot of people do not understand this. They don't have the same need to be around others and they are self sufficient at entertaining themselves with their thoughts or creating projects or working on their business and success. ",

A few years ago I \u201cbecame\" intelligent and that was by being gifted with strong faith in the ALMIGHTY. Okay\u2026 This might sound like a fairytale\u2026 But it isn't. I wanted to learn everything that passed from front of my eyes, I was a computer science student, I wanted to learn biological sciences, languages, architecture, mechanics, physics, chemistry, anything, you would just name it and you'd find me sitting at a computer reading the whole of the Wikipedia. This was one of the prime reasons why I liked to be all alone. I wanted to learn and all that m classmates did was to chitter-chatter useless gossips, backbiting, interfering in others' personal matters, that had no meaning and no use. Another reason for being alone, nobody that I knew around me, by the will of the ALMIGHTY, wanted to do anything like that. They liked gossips, and that I have mentioned above. It was more like I wanted to be alone because people did not understand my \u201cneed\u201d of reading any and everything new. It was as if I was obliged to read something new everyday, to learn whatever that came to me from the ALMIGHTY. Now this might be different for different people living in different places and raised in different familleswith different environment. I hope I was clear enough. ",

I grew up in a poor neighborhood where no one really had the intense curiosity for learning that I had. Not that people didn\u2019t want to learn, but they were less interested than I was, school would finish and i\u2019d dive into books for hours, my mother would have to tell me to do my homework or eat just to get my head out of books. I became obsessed with science and technology, since in my mind it opened up new worlds that I could barely grasp with my brain, but that made my pursuit for knowledge that much stronger. As I grew up I noticed the lust for learning from others around me stagnated and I started to get depressed a lot more day by day. With no one around me being interested in science, tech, politics, debate etc. I steadily became bored, depressed, suicidal and distant from others since no one shared my interests. It can be normal to sometimes feel isolated and distant from the world since it can be hard to connect to others or discover your passion that allows you to have an anchor to the real world. Find your passion and connect with others who share your passion, go online find chat rooms, forums with people who are interested in the same thing, also debate and discuss things with people, even if they have a different opinion than you, LEARN, GROW, EXPAND you mind and take the world in and reflect on your accomplishments when ever you are down, and never stop learning.

I would like to add one more thing however, since I\u2019ve known many gifted and genius level people during my life. I do find that some don\u2019t want to stay by themselves, and that they do mix well. Some top sales people, for example, who interface with prospects in order to close a sale, get excited and really enjoy selling despite being mentally gifted. They love the challenge; they love working with people. One of the most important ingredients of a highly intelligent person is engaging in and enjoying challenges. And while some are satisfied with doing complicated word puzzles, playing chess, or determining how good they are at spacial reasoning, others like the challenge of being triumphed at sports, business, sales, and other vocations enable them to work with other people to solve problems. So to repeat, if there is a single characteristic that defines the highly intelligent individual, it is engaging in challenges, whether physical or mental, that requires them to use their brain. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that it is passion for hobby or interest rather than intelligence, that makes you more likely to be alone.  On one hand because you might want to prepare yourself and your life for personal ambitions (see things in function of the time that was given to us and making (sub)conscious decisions accordingly); On the other hand because the passion unbalances and closes off a part of a person's mind from the outside world to look more at the creativity that lies within, with the purpose of bringing it out one day. This internal world may make it hard for the outside world to understand, or they might just not be interested. I think that it is a common problem artists, intellectuals, philosophers, scientists, economists, etc... deal with: I don't think that it is specific to a certain branch. How to define \"intelligence\" is always dubious. People who successfully manage to translate and bring out their inner creativity towards a point where it has a significant positive external impact on the world are often considered genius and often they have spent a considerable amount of time in solitude. I'm not sure in how far this is by itself the result of passion, because the state of being a \"genius\" is in my opinion the result of hard work and creativity, which are driven by passion, and which are not so easily achieved in a short period of time.

And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it: so high has it grown. Intelligent people are more likely to be alone. The major reasons for this are: This society has around 80% believers and 20% who are thinkers or who aspire to be thinkers. The believers believe what they like to believe, irrespective of the logic behind it. So there are less number of people for one intelligent person to interact with.The intelligent people might find the non-intelligent boring as they have to bear with some mediocrity of theirs whenever they talk to them.An intelligent person can have a good conversation only if the other person matches his intellectual capacity. Otherwise, he has to go down his level and talk, which he may not enjoy.The non-intelligent person who is talking to an intelligent person may not be able to understand him. Either he will nod to everything he says or disprove everything with a dumb logic to show that he is also intelligent. Neither of these would interest an intelligent person.",

Take two really, really intelligent people: John von Neumann and Richard Feynman. Both thrived (in different ways) when they were around people. JVN loved being in somewhat typical social situations: Parties and dinners and so on. Feynman would do work in bars and such. But, of course, some intelligent people do like being alone a lot - and for the same reasons as others: They may be easily overwhelmed by noise, they may simply like solitude, they may have odd personal habits, they may find it difficult to be social. One good example of this is Paul Dirac. He really didn\u2019t like being around anyone. And, while I will not engage in the pernicious habit of diagnosing the dead, one biography of him is titled The World\u2019s Strangest Man. Dirac shared very little of anything with anyone. And some very intelligent people are, to use technical language, nuts. One example of this is Kurt Godel. I am pretty sure he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. And yet other intelligent people only like being around other intelligent people. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a very interesting question to ask, but in reality, what does it actually mean when someone is intelligent? It's really on what you consider to be \"smart\". A recent study has shown that extroverts have shown to pay more attention to human faces than introverts. This is why a shy person might nessessarily hangout with a good book rather than a group of friends.  So basically, people who are more outgoing and have a loud personality, can distinguish faces more rather than an introvert who doesn't really care for that most of the time. Now, I'm no expert, but to me, it's really based on their personality. Labeling has a great role in this question because we often believe that smart people don't have friends or, don't hangout with any at all. Which is kind of sad looking at our society today.  Anyway, someone can be an extrovert, and still be smart. It's just today in our world, we usually tend to believe that the extroverts dominate and become the \"popular\" kids, which is absolutely not true. There are lot of extroverts out there, who sometimes prefer to be alone.  It's just how you, me, and everyone else views things. So basically, extroverts tend to lean towards people while introverts usually want to be alone. Remember this though, personalities can be deceiving.  ",

In addition to this answer i would ask YOU, what is intelligence? or intelligent even.. ",

            "answer_text": "People come in all shapes, shades and sizes. You can\u2019t stereotype any one particular group and make one narrow statement about all of them. But the many intelligent people who like to be alone typically like it for different reasons than the less intelligent loners. First of all: intelligent people often chose to be alone because we can. We are not dependant on having a group of loud friends around us at all times to validate our existence, or our social status. We are comfortable spending Some time with just our own thoughts And reflections, rather than needing to act like drunken monkies at all times. I remember noticing this early in school. As we got older, (junior high/high school and perhaps especially after graduation, in the Army) I started to feel I was growing up and above that \u201cdrunken monkey-behaviour\u201d but many if my piers wheren\u2019t. Nothing wrong with messing about and having fun. I\u2019m all for suspending rational thought for a while and just \u201cgo with it\u201d, but the way I see it that should be the exception, not the rule. I find myself quickly bored by this. I need actual intelectual stimuli to keep myself engaged. If I never get it, I quickly retract and go back to enjoying my own company, pondering over deeper issues, reading forums or chatting with like-minded friends and strangers online. Reason two: unfortunately, our social society (especially with the teenager and Young-adult crowd) is run by \u201cdrunken monkies\u201d. The asshole frat-guy type who finds any and all conversations deeper and more meaningfull than \u201cwhat kind of beer do you like?\u201d \u201cBudweiser\u201d \u201cokay\u201d to be nerdy, tedious and boring. The one who would be rough-housing on the floor 24/7, rather than ever be alone with his thoughts, reflect on deeper issues, or raise his hand in class and answer a difficult question he happends to know the answer to. These people reject Intelligent people and writes them of as just being \u201cnerdy and lacking in social IQ\u201d, and unfortunately, these alpha-male types drag down with them a lot of people who, whilst perhaps not the brightest bulbs in the world, are actually smarter than they show themselves to be. These experiences throughout childhood and Young adulthood are perhaps one of the main reasons why intelligent people develop a habit and a need to be alone Every once in a while. This might then persists into adulthood, Even as their piers grow out of this \u201cdrunken monkey\u201d behaviour and become capable of having deeper conversations. Keep in mind this is all from my own perspective. Like I said, everyone is different, and whilst my explenations apply to me and Some people I know, it could be totally off for the rest of the world. Apologies for any spelling/gramatical errors. English is not my first languge, and I\u2019m on a phone with a Norwegian Keyboard and auto-correct. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two types of intelligences. Emotional intelligence and Intelligence, the rational one. The first one EQ has to do with the ability to understand others and emotione in general. People with a high EQ are more successful in life because they know what to say and when to say it, basically they are good with people. IQ in the other hand makes you more analytical and you will definitely have better skills to sciences and in solving problems that have to do with things and problems that don't include in emotions. A person it's best to have both of these, EQ and IQ, because if you only have a high IQ its most likely that most people won't understand you and yes you will be lonely, having a considerate EQ makes you more sociable, you can have a high IQ and a moderate EQ and that will help you more with people, EQ is what makes people good in social interactions. There are plenty of cases known where really clever and skilled people haven't got a job because they lack EQ, and someone else with a high EQ has gotten their job and maybe some other job which is better only because they know how to act, what to say, when to say it, and where to say it. The time when people only valued IQ is gone, now people see that EQ is important too, and they even say that EQ is more important than IQ. So when somebody says that someone is intelligent, ask them what kind of intelligent do you mean? Really smart people with a higher lever of awareness than most will have it difficult in the society because they wont find people at their level. But i don't think that's the case, Socrates and Platos come only once and if one existed at this time i think people would have ealready known because they have power to leave an impact. ",

            "answer_text": "= A normal distribution (bell-shaped curve) shows intelligence on the x-axis with measures of various intelligence levels (IQ) ranging on the x-axis from a low of (I-don\u2019t-know) on the left to a high of let us say 200 off to the right. For each score on the x-axis, the y-axis shows the percent of a population with that score. IQ may not be intelligence\u2019s best measure, but IQ tests at least test people\u2019s ability in doing that IQ test. Really smart people do well on IQ tests, which does not say sb with 100 IQ is not intelligent. Yet chances are that he cannot keep up with sb. whose IQ is 145. As IQ scores rise fewer and fewer have that score. Sb really intelligent is unlikely to find sb else as smart, esp. in a small town. In a big city of large population (say 12,000,000) there may be only five with IQ 200. How do they find one another? Odds are against their ever meeting. So let us say your IQ is 200. You will unlikely find another 200 even in a huge city. When one is into Art History, Architecture, Music (play piano and violin) Electrical Engineering, advanced Math, Physics, Astronomy, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, Shakespeare and other English greats, how does one share those interests with others? Chances are small that one does. He or she spends a lot of time alone. My example is extreme, but applies to people whose IQ\u2019s would measure above 125. In 1972, the average (median IQ) at Harvard College was 135. At Harvard graduate schools it was 125. Even those with IQ 125 have trouble finding boyfriends, husbands, girlfriends, and wives not to mention friends of their own sex who share similar interests. Chances are that really smart people will not find an even match which could strain a marriage or a relationship that looked good at first. ",

I struggled academically through school but excelled in the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. I still struggled socially to the point of detriment. I had an injury and was disabled I went into truck driving so I could be alone. After twenty years of this whilst reading and studying everything I could get my hands on (particularly with Christianity but I will study whatever trips my trigger), I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder with \u2018above average intelligence for my age group\u2019, whatever that means. To other people I am incredibly, awkwardly, odd. I can be quite the conversationalist if I am with someone worthy of conversation. This is incredibly rare because too many are overly emotional, ill-mannered, and hopelessly uniformed. With most people you have the equivalent of a Tweet or less to communicate your point or you're getting interrupted with a likely subject change. I have learned that when people initiate conversation, I just let them talk though most times I can't relate. Honestly, if it helps them to vent, I'm glad. This use to really bother me but I have learned how to be attentive and yet let it roll off my back (I think this is just life for neuro-typical people but learned for an autistic). Then there is the point of saturation. One can learn so much about various things that everything meshes into an understanding that is so enormous it pushes the limits of your sanity. Then you get really weird. You say things and people's eyes glaze over because you have blown their mind, slipped and let them see your insanity, or committed some blunder of social etiquette. So, you withdraw\u2026 into yourself, your insane self\u2026 Then you get drunk\u2026 can't get high because of random drug screening, and all is well  ",

Of course Quora\u2019s 200 IQ super brain user base is going to swarm this question thinking \u201cI am intelligent and alone, so everybody should be like that!\u201d Thats far from the complete truth. One of the big pitfalls that people with above average intelligence fall into is that they think of themselves higher than other people. The first problem here is defining intelligence. Lack of mathematical intelligence and a high IQ in a person doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be knowledgeable, or that there is nothing to gain from talking to them. Even in the working class there is so much intricate detail to the works many people do in their lives.  I see many people answering this question in the veins of \u201cI do this and that and I believe that requires a higher intelligence.\u201d It might not. You should step out of your glass bubble for at least a second and look at life from a different point of view. With so much difference in between one person and the next, defining personal traits based on an arbitrary measurement of how you use your brain should be impossible. ",

I spent my childhood desperately trying to find alone time. I was a middle kid of 6, and I remember the relief when I finally got my own room. It was a tiny alcove off my two older sisters' room, unheated, so the door was louvered to allow some heat in during the brutal winters. But it was MINE. I could sit on the bed, or on the floor, reading and reading, with the door closed so people knew that I wanted to be ALONE. I'm a mom of four, and was a single mom for over a decade after divorcing my first husband. ALONE was the holy grail.  When you enjoy thinking, learning, reading; those things are best done in quiet places, alone. I suspect that many other very intelligent people feel the same way that I do. I love my family and friends. I cherish the time I spend with them. And I also cherish the time that I can spend doing what I love best: learning and thinking about what I've learned. ",

Intelligence is also not the same as wisdom, it's not the same as living a good life, it's not the same as having a sense of humour and it certainly isn't the same as achieving anything. It might be difficult to find people who can challenge you effectively or keep up with you in one or two ways, but how many of your conversations really involve in depth, highly conceptual discussions? How many of those do you even want to have on a daily basis? People use intelligence as an excuse for being alone, when the reason is usually just poor social skills. Humans are social animals, there's a reason solitary confinement is a very effective punishment. Some enjoy alone time more than others, but the reality is we all like to have company, we evolved like that over millions of years. Intelligence doesn't really change people's desire to be together. Look at how much people love spending time with their pets! ",

When you consider the fact that there is also this huge slice of mediocre minds running around and claiming to be intelligent simply because they can recite well versed second hand opinions, the percentage of the population that is truly intelligent dwindles even further. As a result, intelligent people are likely to experience difficulty finding long term associations since the occurrence of like minds is scarce.  Intelligence often intimidates the average mind and people tend to run away rather than feel humbled. After all is said and done, it is a lot easier to be average or less.

I guess I do think a bit differently than most people, even tho I think that every human in this world is unique and has its own way of well, just living. I do find mentally draining being in a big group of people, and after hanging out with them, I have a habit of taking a walk alone while listening to music or going to a caffe bar for a cup of coffee to clear my head.

The rest of his tribe was probably killed in a number of clashes with ranchers and loggers in the 1980s and 1990s, with one expert explaining that \"he should not be seen as a recluse hiding from society. The man is the survivor of a genocide. He didn't choose to live alone.\" But, yes if they are academics or professionals then they would definitely like to stay alone as this gives them more time to concentrate on their endeavours and pursuits. I would say it has more to do with one\u2019s personality. If you are gregarious by nature and like people around you, you might like to be with people most of the time. Else, if you are a shy person who doesn\u2019t like to communicate much then definitely you would find yourself alone. ",

            "answer_text": "Smart people are more likely to be alone for several reasons. First, being smart usually includes intellectual curiosity that may require some amount of independent study, which, to a really smart person, is fun. Smart people may have a hard time finding peers, not in any moral sense, but a social one. Smart people have interests that bore the hell out of a non-smart person, and they must pursue these interests alone or with one or two partners. Smart people have a strong sense of metacognition. They are involved in thinking in a way others may not be, making them seem detached and even eccentric because they manage a busy internal agenda. And finally, in my experience, really smart people also have a high degree of emotional and social intelligence. They can navigate the complex principles of interconnectedness, sustainability, progressivism, and moral conduct. They possess an independent, internal moral compass that makes irrelevant the efforts of church or state to control their behaviour. They are consequently more likely to take unpopular positions on issues, which may make them to appear hard to know when they become too earnest. ",

I still did those things, but it became rare that I could have the coherence of my own thoughts without interruption.

So people with Iq of 130 140 are few and far within so the smarter you are the least amount of people you are able to find statistically that will hold your interest. However if you find a group of people with iQ of over 120 someone with an IQ of 120 or better will socialize with everyone. Why because they have so much on comon. Average IQ is between 90\u2013110 that\u2019s 75% of the population so if your IQ is closer to that you\u2019ll have plenty of friends. 110\u2013120 you\u2019ll be able have a lot of friends in the 90\u2013120 however you\u2019ll have a hard time relating to IQ of 120 and above. If you are lucky to have and IQ of over 130 you\u2019ll suffer from depression isolation and alienation you\u2019ll find very few people to relate to. When you do you\u2019ll become clingy. Some people learn to fake it but there is no deep connection. However when you meet people with an IQ of 130 and yours is 120\u2013140 you\u2019ll tend to cling to one another since there are not a lot of people with your abilities. ",

Most have worked all their adult lives doing manual and mundane work in retail, factories and warehouses. They preferred to donate their services in return to socialise ( and belong somewhere) with others who are on their same wave length.

I'd rather babble on about interesting topics, like science, philosophy, cinema, literature,music,history, the human existence, the humam condition, God (or lack thereof) etc\u2026 I find that most people talk about money, mortgages, bills, work and gossip. Or the news and all the bad things happening in the world (facebook news). Sometimes I think I'm boring and have nothing of interest to say, but I really enjoy listening to intelligent people speak about something interesting and I like asking questions. But I'm also kind of socially awkward, in terms of keeping a conversation going (especially when I have little interest in the topic at hand). So yeah, this is why I prefer staying alone, but I keep a close circle of good friends who are also intelligent in their own ways (like me) so when I'm at the peak of my intellectual isolation and in need of human contact, I know I can surround myself with good, smart folks!

            "answer_text": "I can feel you. I consider myself smart. I\u2019m an MD PhD working in US in one of the best hospital on earth. I was born in a small town in a non English speaking third world country. Grown up in a poor neighborhood and my parents want me to work in a factory just like the rest of my family members. I pretty much taught myself how to be a great student since as you can imagine my teachers, despite being nice people, were not the best ones. Look where I am now. I would say yes to be alone and feel lonely. What I feel is that I do not understand why other people don\u2019t understand things that seems straightforward to me. I wanted to help my classmates when I was in school. But I do not know why they can\u2019t understand the simple equations. I don\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t remember what\u2019s clearly in the book. So I was never a good teacher and being smart did not earn me many friends. Being smart means your brain runs too fast for most people. Others might have problems keeping up with your thoughts. I often feel so tired to explain to others all the details about things I want to do. Instead, I tell them just do as I said. This doesn\u2019t earn you friend. Being smart means you have care about others in a very different way that others might not appreciate it. You don\u2019t have time for romances because you need to go and save some lives. You don\u2019t go window shopping. Your footprint in the mall is pretty much 3 straight lines connecting the shop you need to go, the food court and the parking. Your \u201cshopping\u201d time is always <30min. You love shopping in amazon for the same reason. If I were a girl, I would not want myself to be my boyfriend. BTW, anniversaries are way overrated to you. That\u2019s my life. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not that intelligent people like to be alone, it is just tedious to deal with people on a daily basis who refuse or can\u2019t see things in your perspective and you have to keep explaining it to them and sometimes still refuse to try to understand; or worse people are not interested in learning or educating themselves. Also depending on how you are, it seems there are sometimes few people that can follow your tastes as they tend to be more eclectic. Personally I don\u2019t avoid people, I am happy in my own world if I have to be, but normally what I do is look for people with similar tastes in different areas Find someone who loves your music tastes, or your tv / movies preferences, or likes to read, or likes games, or pcs, etc. just like you do, you don\u2019t need to find someone who likes everything, just different groups that cater to your same interests.

It\u2019s like, if you\u2019re smart\u2026then just answer the damn question. Why do so many people feel the need to try and qualify themselves as intelligent? It almost invariably gives themselves away as not lol because let\u2019s be honest here, there\u2019s no way in friggin hell you could know if what I\u2019m saying is correct or not. The ONLY option you have, in this online interaction, is to trust me or not trust me. And trust, generally speaking, is going to be built by your words and actions that \u201cdisplay\u201d your intellect. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026..holy shit is the internet full of imposters lol. Be careful who you take advice from, yeesh. Anyhoo. Personally, it\u2019s not at all that I WANT to be alone. Yea, I like it, or enjoy it, but that\u2019s only because it can be pretty difficult sometimes to not be alone. People, and myself included, bring along with them a whole SLEW of personal insecurities. And when I want to talk to someone about something, the MOST important thing I look for is honesty and telling the Truth. Now if you\u2019re someone whose got a lotta secrets, or baggage, this can be very difficult to do. So a lot of the time, when I\u2019m in a group, I get faced with 2 decisions Go along with the \u201clie of the group\u201d in order to maintain an environment of funStand up for my belief but cause some kind of argument/debateSo I\u2019m sure you can see that this \u201csocial game\u201d we play isn\u2019t very fun for all parties involved. That\u2019s why when you DO meet someone who is honest to you, and can share anything and everything with you, try your damnedest not to let that person go. I could care less about an \u201cintellectual\u201d conversation. Give me something REAL damnit. Hope that helps ;) ",

Spending a lot of time with someone who is much less intelligent becomes boring and requires the more intelligent person to \u2018lead' and the less intelligent person to feel subordinate. It's not a level playing field and not gratifying to either person. That being said, highly intelligent people (not necessarily highly educated) need to find other highly intelligent people which is a smaller percentage of the population. It is frustrating to them to spend much time with people who don't understand what is so easily apparent and logical to highly intelligent people. It takes higher level concepts and complex information to interest and stimulate them. They prefer their own company to contemplate their thoughts, theories, opinions and connectedness of things. Choosing to be by oneself, does not constitute loneliness. ",

As sometimes a illusion came in my mind that i love to live alone. i can but no nobody loves to live alone it is just a illusion of our thoughts . those who are introvert mostly feel like this because they don't share things easily with anyone. yes i agree that sometimes its good to give time to yourself. it is healthy but when it comes to live forever it can't be possible. he /she will get mad . In case of every human being it is not possible. Iam reading the inner journey book by osho .One of the experiment is also given in this book they might did with someone, i don't know but it is written and it is actually happens if you think. For example, a person can be locked in a room provided with every facility and asked to note down any changes which happen to his mind. When he notes them down, he will find that without any reason sometimes he feels good in that closed room, sometimes he feels bad; sometimes he becomes sad, sometimes he becomes happy; sometimes he feels angry, sometimes he does not feel angry. There are no excuses there, the situation in the room is constantly the same \u2013 but what is happening to him? That is why man is so afraid of aloneness \u2013 because in aloneness there are no excuses from the outside. One will have to assume all the things are within oneself. Any person kept in isolation cannot remain healthy for more than six months, he will become mad. ",

Where extroverts need other people around them all the time for general stimulation, like social interaction, introverts are capable of providing that to themselves. Let me back up for a second, I am not saying extroverts are not intelligent. I am saying that intelligent people who enjoy being by themselves are introverts. Too much of outside stimulation drains them. Noise and chaos is overwhelming for them. They need their quiet time and space to thrive well. They live in a realm of ideas which leaves them very much in their element. Ideas rejuvenate them. People and expectations enervate them. They can just be and never have to explain themselves because they just are. ",

But they are sometimes loners and bagging for attention socially beacuse they think if they are more intelligent than us, they are extremely smarter than us, and more intellectually developed, these people tend to be Narcassit, and then we stay away from the intelligent people. They might be suffering from personality disorders not because we are not capable of understanind these, but In general that\u2026 they think that if they have knowledge they are sooo smart. And also they think of us less knowledgeable people or intelligent Inferiors.. How Depsperate. I\u2019ve meet around 32 intelligent persons in my life. they are fucking annoying and cause annoyance for nothing, if they don\u2019t like socialization, why the damn they come to a place where the less intelligent people are hangout\u2026 ADVICE TO YA SMART PEOPLE: Find a place where you can rest, don\u2019t just sit in areas where there are lots of people who are less knowledable but like socoalizing, and also having lots of friends..And also don\u2019t come to us like that and say \u201cLOOK, lets debate\u201d, DOn\u2019t say that, embrace that we don\u2019t want to confort you emotionally and leave us alone..BYE!

There is no analysis, no method to present a holistic view of the situation and make any assessments. There are no stats, no numbers, nothing really. They are also not psychologists, and also not incorporating any new knowledge from the last 10 years in these answers. I would require a significant amount of work to answer this question. Adding to the above, intelligence is not fully defined, personality hasn't been defined well, there are developmental issues to consider, life strategies and so on. And then there is the question of potential. Even assuming the answer was a yes, are intelligent people doomed to be alone or is this something which was happening in the past due to certain reasons including technological ones and may be changing today, or not? I could spend a year to write a book on this question to get a clear answer. ",

I only want to be around those who actually listen during a discussion and don\u2019t just wait for their turn to speak. If a person doesn\u2019t meet those criteria, then I have no problem being by myself because I will be in a much better mood than if I was with people who cannot openly discuss ideas. In my experience the majority of the people I have met do not meet my criteria. But those that have stay in my life and strong relationships are formed. I look for intelligence from a potential friend but much much more importantly I look for apathy. When you find someone with a high level of both, you have found someone truly special. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. In my experience, intelligent people often don't care to follow social norms. They either see them as pointless or as getting in the way. At the same time, this makes it easier for them to relate with other intelligent people. Often intelligent people get extremely invested in things that suit their interest, which can lead to extreme frustration when they get stuck and extreme excitement when they make progress. I can imagine this would be hard to keep up with all the time, and make them appear very self-absorbed (of course sometimes they are). When it really comes down to it, I think intelligent people aren't so much alone as they are very close to a select few. ",

            "answer_text": "It's hard to tell, but one of the most significant wounds to the question is the definition of what a \"smart\" person is. We don't even have a universal definition of intelligence - while they generally cover the same vague notions, you can yourself see the difference between them. Is a smart person inherently more smart than others, or is based on their circumstantial intelligence? There's also the problem of artifacts. Would being social make the person less likely to be noticed as being smart? Or, if being smart and sociability don't contradict each other, your question is better phrased as \"Are [not smart] people more likely to be social?\". Are they, really? Finally, a third hurdle to your question: if someone's alone, how do you find them? If they're not social, how do they become recognised for the survey? What, exactly, do you mean by \"alone\"? ",

You could be extremely sharp about sports or movies or just the neighbourhood eateries. It's all intelligence. Intelligent people avoid the casual conversation cause it bores and drains them. Imagine talking about your aunts petunia plant for 3 hours. That's how small talk feels especially when you want to debate on book, music, current events, science or history. It is easier to bury yourself in what you like and speak to the person who is interested in it. also constantly flaunting your knowledge and wanting to debate ideas or explore multiple tangents or just using big words makes one look like a pretentious prick. So it's better to just sit in the silence and avoid the drama. ",

If you get enjoyment from a chemistry set more than a outing to the movies. Just hang with people that enjoy chemistry. You have to teach yourself how to build and maintain relationships. Just as any other subject in life. A lonely person just hasn't learned how to build and maintain relationships. Anybody can do it with practice. Unless oneself can't do so because of his own personal insecurities. I mean even monkeys can communicate so why can't a really intelligent person? I've seen some really intelligent, charismatic people. If anything the smarter you are the more you can talk about you just have to learn how to do it to gain an effective response. ",

I want to be surrounded by people who will my presence in their life. I know for darn sure its better than people who miss my intellectualism when I'm gone.  I'll never be a Plato or an Einstein, but I'm already a dad, a husband, a friend.  I've learned to value the things I've already achieved. Now for the more intellectual answer - focusing on how smart you are compared to everyone else around you will pretty much guarantee what you strive for - to be alone at the top of that pyramid. Focusing instead on social intelligence and empathy, will instead guarantee you that people care for you In return. Both are forms of intelligence and both get you results in the different arenas that they operate.  Ask yourself then - which one do you choose.  ",

The thing is the more intelligent you are, the better you are at connecting pieces of information and your speed of analysis increases. So, you are faster at assesing situations, people, environments. Like so, you become faster at identifying danger and problems. As an intelligent person, as you start relating with someone, you may be seeing already 2 or 3 steps in front of him/her and thus concluding if that relationship will be good or harm you somehow. As a consequence, intelligent people don\u2019t take the time necessary to build relationships because they see something bad down the line and they pull off early. Intelligent people usually trust a fixed set of connections and before they trust someone new, that new someone has to show a genuine interest in the person. Then, there\u2019s the other side of the coin. Intelligent people like to think, obviously. To think, silence is needed or at least the company of someone who respects a calm environment. ",

            "answer_text": "For people with a certain intellect, it can be quite draining to be with more than one person for a long period of time. They do not fear to be alone because they do not feel loneliness the same way, being lonely can be and is a comforting state of being, they feel free to do what they want and feel the freedom to let their mind wander without any external influence, they enjoy their own company but this is not how they see alone time, they mostly see it as a simple pleasure deep down. Since they do not seek attention, or need attention, being with people who do can be too much sometimes, they might feel as if they need to escape the situation before they feel trapped. Socializing is for most of them not a necessity, or a top priority, and to be avoided as much as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Swharz Sardlee, I\u2019m not so sure about always, but perhaps some intelligent people do isolate themselves more than, let\u2019s say, the \u201clayman\u201d. However, I suspect it\u2019s mostly for the same reasons that anyone would isolate themselves: \u25d9 Peace\u25d9 Quiet\u25d9 Focus\u25d9 Concentration\u25d9 Privacy\u25d9 Introspection\u25d9 etc\u2026 It\u2019s important to understand that high intelligence and a social personality are sometimes diametrically opposed, yet not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, there are some \u201claymen\u201d who are both kind and friendly, yet others are vitriolic. Likewise, there are some \u201cbrilliant\u201d people who are masters of social interaction, yet others can be vapid existential nihilistic cynics. The key is to appreciate the spectrum, and find where you are most comfortable. Peace and good day. ",

I used to like hanging out with friends, drinking, chatting and all those things that the normal people do, but then i started reading books, the more i read the more i found what other people were saying to me boring. I would want to discuss great ideas and important topics from the knowledge accumulated from reading but my friends and people that i would hang around with were only interested in discussing events and other people\u2026..their conversations started boring me\u2026so i started looking for people like me\u2026people who read books to get knowledge\u2026these people are so few and they only chat about important things in life\u2026they don\u2019t have time to waste discussing things they can\u2019t control like events and other people\u2019s lives\u2026to a normal person it may seem that these people don\u2019t socialize or that they are loners or like being alone\u2026they have company all the time but its invisible to the normal beings, those books and the research keep them company\u2026and they are always happy with their lives ",

The cut-off for joining Mensa, the high-IQ society with the lowest requirements, is being in the top two percent. That\u2019s one person out of fifty. Someone \u201cdid the math\u201d to figure out what the practical communication range is, in terms of IQ, when discussing anything but superficial \u201cHi, how\u2019s the weather? Did you watch the game last night?\u201d stuff, and it\u2019s about 30 IQ points. Someone with an IQ of 130 can communicate well with almost everyone; both an average 100 and a high-genius 160 are within their range. On the other hand, someone with an IQ of 160 can talk to the 130s and above\u2026 but that\u2019s only two percent of all people. It\u2019s not that highly intelligent people are all extreme introverts (although some introverts want you to think so, because then they may be able to convince you that smart = introvert = smart), but that there are fewer people for us to choose from when looking for someone to socialize with in any deep and meaningful way. We don\u2019t want to make average people feel bad when they can\u2019t keep up (fun fact: there\u2019s a strong correlation between intelligence and compassion), so what choice do we have but to socialize primarily with other highly intelligent people?

As I have told repeatedly in my answers, the more a person interacts with nature, the more he will be happy and the more mature he will become. This is because solitude and silence make us to think. When we think, we get into the mysteries related to life. We focus on things and then we get sight of real things. Then, we deal with things that really matter, leaving behind all unnecessary things. That is what makes a person to be counted in intelligence category. Edit: Intelligence is a relative term. ",

            "answer_text": "Those who are lonely lack the desire of choosing to romance. Romance is to want others to feel loved, useful and wanted. Romance has nothing to do with sex. Romance is what causes an outgoing person to be likable to others as they care to make others feel comfortable, appreciated and happy. They are accommodating. Instead many choose to entertain the motivation of lust instead. Lust is the opposite of romance. Lust only cares when there is something to get out of another, when they can use another. Lust only cares when another interest is the same as theirs and in this they find them useful and pleasing to their selfishness. The way lust thinks is: I do not like what you like. You like what I like and if you stop liking what I like, then begone with you as we don\u2019t have anything in common and you\u2019re wasting my time. Some \u201chighly intelligent\u201d people are so self-absorbed and they don\u2019t want to \u201cwaste\u201d their time romancing others because doing so does not please their selfishness. They are unaccommodating. Then they wonder, \u201cWhy am I lonely?\u201d After that some rationalize that it\u2019s because they are so great and mega awesome and it is the \u201cdumb\u201d peoples fault. Then if they do try to care their conceit is off-putting. It is even off-putting to other intelligent people. If you want to be lonely be boastful, esteem your self over others and be unaccommodating. Only find a use for others when it suits you and do not show an interest in others interests. Do not expand your horizons and do not try anything that you assume is remedial and beneath you. If you do not want to be lonely you only have to choose to care to take a sincere interest in others interests and be agreeable. There are 7 billion people to romance in the world and you might find that they are interested in that which you may have overlooked: humanity. ",

I never really need a large group of friends to self validate and it becomes less necessary for self validation purposes the more I get to know me and what I want out of life. Life is short, our energy and resources are finite and I want everyone in my life to count towards helping me grow as a person and vice versa. Superficial relationships and superficial activities don\u2019t help me grow as a person, and networking for business purposes aren\u2019t real friendship. Cultivating self confidence, self awareness I guess is a type of intelligence - the more you know you, the more you know what you want out of your finite life, and everyone in your life and everything you do works towards that specific purpose. Choosing quality over quantity feels very rewarding. Purposefulness is very rewarding. Mindfulness is very rewarding. Transcending above what society tells you that you should have, how your life should be, feeling confident about who you are is very rewarding. Meaningful living is very rewarding. The alone time is very purposeful for reflection. The alone time isn\u2019t indefinite\u2026 you\u2019ll slowly build a purposeful niche and happiness will ensue. ",

Usually smart people are outliers from youth. Not social accepted. It the nerd or geek at school thing. So alone is often the only option. Very intelligent people end up reading more and going down idea rabbit holes the require no group consensus. I hesitate to use this example as it is the most extreme. the Unibomber is a prime example of the perverse end result. He knew what society was getting wrong and rejected society. He could have happily stayed a hermit. He chose aggression and violence and failed. But rejecting the \u201cnoise\u201d is about right. ",

            "answer_text": "Its a problem of correlation vs causation. Being intelligent should not be the cause of wanting to be alone, anymore than being extremely short would want to make you being alone. Correlation exists but it does not imply automatic causation. If the implication behind your question is that by having high degree of intelligence in some area makes you feel that its harder to relate to other people, than you are really not talking about intelligence itself. Rather you are talking about your use of intelligence and control of your emotions. Bottom line. Intelligence itself does not make someone want to be alone. Its not the cause, its just a correlating factor. ",

They are actually have been ditched, dumped, used, ignored, failed and fallen a lot of times. They prefer to stay alone because they know that no one is gonna be happy seeing them happy. They know that they were alone when they were suffering so they should be alone when it comes to success. And about success, then smart people have end goals. They focus on their goals than wasting their time on temporary people. They usually know how it feels to be alone so they plan better for their future. And apart from that, they think its better to plan things on their own than to explain their dreams or ideas to other people who don\u2019t really appreciate them. And since their thinking ability is higher than the people their age, it usually annoys others. Their morals are higher than the most of the individuals around them. They believe that they can bring a change in this world by, what normal people call, dreams and hopes. They enjoy company of human beings but most of the people around them are mature as they are. I hope this is the answer you are looking forward to. Have a good day. ",

            "answer_text": "I like Arrita\u2019s answer and I\u2019ll expand on it a bit because I think there are some other nuances. Like she mentioned you have EQ and IQ, both matter, both make a difference and in the ways she mentioned. However, whether or not you are lonely is also up to you. Admittedly, my EQ was lacking and still is honestly but it\u2019s also much better because I became aware of it more and focused on it. I tell you this because I\u2019m almost never lonely and yet I have friends with high EQ\u2019s that are. I \u201cthink\u201d whether or not you are lonely really depends on how you approach life and whether or not you truly know yourself and what you need from all standpoints. There are times when I need EQ company, there are times when I need IQ company, and there are times when I prefer no company\u2026. and I treasure them all equally. If someone asked me why I\u2019m not lonely though, I would tell you it\u2019s because I\u2019m always busy doing something, thinking about something, or doing nothing (a skill I also had to cultivate). On that note though and I agree with her again, I think a higher EQ does help people with a more dominant IQ cope with people in general. And I say that because deep down I \u201cfeel\u201d like I don\u2019t understand people and that is a lonely space. Oddly enough, even when in a crowd :) I hope this helps ",

Let me give you an example\u2026this will sound harsh but it kind of fits\u2026..you went to a paint store and talked to the people about painting techniques and brush strokes and layering and light dispersion for the best coverage and effects. On the way home you pick up a neighbor and talk with him for 2 hours on the trip to his house. For the 2 entire hours all he can talk about is the paint can\u2026it is so round and heavy\u2026it feels neat in the hand\u2026.on and on and on\u2026.FOR 2 HOURS. When you drop him off \u2026you feel a mixture of relief and frustration, and peace. You like him but damn \u20262 hours and never got past the style of a paint can. In your quiet home you turn on some nice music and paint and stroke the paint and watch for where the light falls mostly\u2026\u2026and just humm to yourself and smile at the work you are doing. Then you remember that your friend paints rooms for a living\u2026.wow\u2026.just wow. Nice guy though\u2026\u2026and you just humm and paint and smile. I hope that kind of gives you a bit of an insight. Its not arrogance or hubris it is just the way things seem to work out for me and some of my friends. ",

The man described his ideal mate and the response to his description was that sounds like a dude to me! In choosing a mate, one must demonstrate some flexibility and tolerance. Or your destiny is to be alone and that's not tied to high intellect but narrow-mindedness. Human beings have strengths and weaknesses and just because your strength is intellect, does it mean that your mate has to be just like you. This is a classic error that both men and women of intellectual capacity consistently make. If you have the luxury of doing this, that's wonderful. But most people if they want someone to love them find that love is a scarce commodity. ",

In our western society this is often still seen as the standard for measuring \u2018intelligence'.Then there is the \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d, this one lays in the right side of our brains and is the main part involved in social interactions.Generally every human being tends to have one side of the brain more evolved than the other. It's therefore sometimes the case that people we call \u201cintelligent\u201d, those who have a highly stimulated left side, end up having a less developed right side of the brain, therefore having a harder time socializing. As a result of which they enjoy spending more time on their own. Of course this is an oversimplification, there are many contradictions to this model and many cases confirm that it's not always 100% true. But the fact remains that intelligence is much more than our hability to solve scientific problems and we as a society must make an effort to value and encourage every other aspect of our nature that makes us \u2018intelligent\u2019 human beings.

This tendency of living alone can grow a bit more if the surrounding people of the intelligent person are prove to be stupid. Most of the intelligent persons; however, lead a normal social life interacting with others in the society. Living alone will not make someone intelligent for sure; it is the attitude of an individual; how a person reacts and handle a situation. We are more intelligent in a collective way than being alone. We all have some sort of special ability but we seldom could identify it and of-course we can\u2019t equally use our brain as we have some limitations to use it fully. ",

One cannot expect that the person, with less intelligence, uplifts his IQ because he is talking to you. It is up to the more intelligent person to adapt. This costs a lot of energy (and time). Maybe they stay by themselves. Or do other people stay away? When meeting people with an intelligence near to their own, they will engage in conversation. Talking to or with people with IQ \u00b1 20 points away from you is more comfortable. What you talk about and on what level, is crucial to open up (more) intelligent people. ",

I believe that many of the intelligent people out there are so busy in their self-development that they forget that they need to socialise a little bit as well. Not only that, when they try to socialize with different people, they find very uncommon to meet someone who share the same thought process and beliefs as they do. This makes them uncomfortable and think themselves to be a 'Social Misfit.\u2019 In addition to this , they do think that they are self-sufficient and believe in Solitude because they know that more the number of people in their life, more will be the complexities and burden which may slow down their productivity. While people are socialising over different mediums using Technology and Face 2 Face interactions, they are investing something that can make this world a better place. But having said that not all intelligent people are Alone. Many of them love to be an active part of the society and that only keeps them motivated to work even harder. With Love. Ankur Shukla ",

Many are introverts, that makes it pretty obvious why they need more alone-time than others. Even the extroverted intuitives are usually quite pensive and need a lot of time for reflection. In fact, I have mistaken a lot of extroverted intuitives for fellow introverts (my wife, to start with was surprised that she scored as an extrovert!) Why should intuititives need more time to think than others (sensors)? Well, perhaps we were programmed like that by evolution (problem solvers in harsh times) or perhaps because this world is not really our world (intutives make up only 25%; and despite some great intuitive achievements, from the Declaration of Independence to women\u2019s and gay rights - guys, the world is just not the place we would love it to be). Our intution therefore often tells us not to follow the majority, reflect the real worl or imagine it the way we would like it to be). Hope this makes sense to you. I know it sounds a bit crazy.

Less intelligent people often are less open for debate and reasoning, so speaking to them is often less interesting to me. It was different when I was younger. I didn\u2019t really socialize with anyone else, even in a school of other talented children, until 5h grade because I had no experience. Until then I spent all of my free time reading or caught up in my own ideas, I also was fond of math. Of course everyone is different, but I just tend to see that we all have strange and/or expanded mind sets that makes it less fun to interact with others. ",

If you classify as \"alone\" not as regarding not having friends, but \"alone\" in their judgment and appreciation of something (nature, science, God, whatever) then they are alone in the sense that very few other people are there with them to enjoy, commiserate or just contemplate...but if they write books/poetry/essays on what they experience then all the rest can enjoy and share in their experience and they are not alone any more!

We had to meet in different countries, so dinner invitations to a host delegate\u2019s home, or to a restaurant, gathering for cocktails, touring locally together, was the norm. I was rarely alone. Not only did I enjoy the job, I enjoyed the people. We were like an extended family. When I left this work and no longer needed to travel, it was if a switch flipped. For years I had no desire to even leave the house, though eventually my wanderlust returned a bit. Now my husband jokes I can be found in one of two places: in the house or in a foreign country. If I can\u2019t be alone, after a while I feel so unsettled I\u2019ll check into a hotel, if necessary, and hang a do not disturb sign on the door. I love people and enjoy being around them, but not non-stop. Given enough time and space I\u2019ll recharge, ready for the world again. Am I an introvert or an extrovert? Not sure, but like clockwork, my MBTI changed when I stopped working from ENTJ to, you guessed it, INTJ. If I don\u2019t have to be extroverted I\u2019m not. When I have to be, I open to the experience and enjoy almost anyone I\u2019m around. I could be happily alone for weeks, months\u2014reading, writing, learning something new. For years? Maybe not.

Many average minded people have excellent people skills, are great listeners and make true friends. For an intelligent person the trick is to realise that while they may have high Intelligence Quotient, others have high Emotional Quotient that is essential to live a truly fulfilled life. Thus it is a decision every intelligent person has to make one time or the other: whether to give up on average people and live a solitary life with their intelligent thoughts and ideas, or accept that people come with all sorts of qualities and capabilities and learn to live socially with them.

If you are an intelligent person but ill fated (like many) to be surrounded by people far behind you in their thinking capacity then isolation is inevitable. You are forced to seperate yourself from that company which is insufferable to you. Sometimes,rarely,intelligent people do find the company of their equals. ",

            "answer_text": "Intelligence doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to loneliness but sometimes the disconnectedness is related. It turns out that the loneliness is primarily due to lack of true engagement with others. This engagement demands us to be open, vulnerable, relate our struggles, and let down our guard. We also have to learn to listen empathically and supportively towards others in their vulnerabilities. One of the most lonely cohorts of people are those who tend towards competing with others, keeping themselves looking like they have it all together and don\u2019t need anyone or anything. In this way, some people with these attitudes and high intelligence may be very lonely. But it isn\u2019t really their intelligence that is causing their loneliness, as much as their distance, competitiveness, and belief that they have to look together or they risk losing their status. Here is some additional info on this topic. Best, S.  ",

And, I\u2019m not talking about whether they have the stored knowledge or not \u2014 I\u2019m talking about whether they can follow logic as easily. In those instances, we may be quiet instead of trying to explain. But, we aren\u2019t like they try to portray us on television. If it is a social setting..

Second, preferring to stay alone is probably not driven by intelligence per se. Independent thinkers prefer staying alone. Because having to constantly defend one\u2019s point of view to the majority is tiring. Introverts prefer staying alone. Because being with others for too long saps introverts of energy. However, to my knowledge there is no proven correlation between introversion and IQ. There may be some evidence between \u2018independent thinking\u2019 and IQ, but that is also a vague term that is hard to pin down. A paper covering this second point can be found here. ",

It depends on the culture And anyway, do intelligent people also fail or appear to fail? No there is no way to answer your question because anecdotal case studies such as \u2018intelligent people who like to study' may not represent intelligent people as a whole and so no generalization can be made Have fun doing whatever the hell you want ",

Being alone to contemplate a solution can easily be better in many instances. Conversely we are intrinsically social creatures so it is fabulously rare for this to be the norm among anyone. Certain personality types are more prone to be this way. Certain kinds of introversion for example, but even then there are many kinds, especially combined with other personality traits. If you are very sensitive & can only accept so much sensory input before overloading, that would encourage the seeking of alone time. Also being autistic (again even that varies). ",

Overusing one at the expense of the other can cause a person to become more intelligent than others, but lacking some emotional intelligence to socialize and feel conected to them. Same would be true for people who tap into their emotional pathways and use those neurons more than the intelligent neurons. Thinking smart people are lonely is probably a generalization.

I'm pretty bright; I enjoy solitude - hard to read in a crowd, plus it's rude! - and I love chances to spend quality time with friends. I do see different sorts of friendships (not more/fewer), but that likely has more to do with my primary social group being church-related than anyone\u2019s intelligence. Again, a difference in types of friendships definitely exists based on age and/or marital status. In general, the older you get, the less drama you want in your life, so you tend to avoid people who live for that. I value quiet, whether alone or with friends. Talking, sharing our lives, rather than loud, crowded places. Maybe that's all just me. Curious to read other answers.",

When you choose to stay alone, it helps you to understand your self better. It will definitely boost your self confidence. It will help you to understand Your capability, strengths, weakness, fear factor everything.. If you choose to stay alone doesn't mean that you are an introvert. It just mean that you are happy with yourself. And you can do better without anybody most of the time. But we should make sure that we have a handful of people who are trustworthy , who you can always rely on.. Of course we all need good friends and family in our life who can make our lives even beautiful. ",

Not all conformity is bad and drama is inevitable in building relationships. With that said, think about the \u201cnegative\u201d conforming trends in college. Partying, drugs, immature relationships, etc. I am not saying all these things are bad but they tend to be more of a distraction for someone achieving their goals. By either choosing to spend time alone or spending time with a select few, one can focus on what they can control and their goals, i.e. good grades and career. ",

Smart people do not have reasons to be with others since they can solve problems individually. They do not need compliments from others as they are already aware of the worthiness of themselves. They do not want to spend a lot of time hanging out with friends because they already have something they can enjoy by themselves. It is not to say that all clever people enjoy their solidarity, but I reckon that these reasons apply yo a lot of intelligent people based on my several experience of talking to smart people. ",

Time As they are intelligent they know the value of time so they spend less on roaming around cities mall and college area, they respect their time and utilise it in better place.

            "answer_text": "Not all highly intelligent people prefer to stay alone but for the sake of the question I'll give you a couple of reasons why some do: 1.) some of them don't want to be alone but are simply too anxious to approach other people, hence their loneliness. (many smart people have to deal with a variety of anxieties, not all but a good amount of them) 2.) while others prefer to be alone simply because they're introverted. Those people literally get exhausted from being around other people and talking to them. If they attend social events they'll need some alone-time afterwards in order to recharge. 3.) in some rare cases extreme childhood bullying has scarred an individual to the point where:  a) the individual is actively avoiding other people, or  b) becomes a bully himself and people avoid him, because he's unpleasant to be around *cough* Sheldon *cough*  ",

Some smart people prefer isolation, or extreme introversion, or distanced misanthropy, but barely at different rates than any other categories of intelligence. But, if I am not reading too far into your implications, I think it is safe to say that many, many smart people would not rather be dumb and more socially lubricious or successful than they currently are. Falling outside the average bounds of various social and cultural structures can make socializing more difficult, or less, more profitable, or less.  The \"tortured, socially awkward nerd\" archetype is more valuable as an expression of cultural values, perceptions, and fears than as an accurate representation of a class of individual---though the stereotype is definitely self-admitted by some people who feel it works for them.

I'm much happier reading articles about the latest space endeavors, reading about medicine/philosophy/theology/sociology, watching documentaries. I would rather have a discussion about the implications of string theory on how we perceive our own subjective reality than say the weather. So it's really a desire for a more meaningful deeper existence and connections that offer that; which means escaping the vapid, shallow, self indulgent, greedy, simplistic crust of society. ",

If you are normal, most people like the same things as you do, they can help you mutually with your homework, and you can relate to their lives and bond over mutual experiences. If you are not normal, that bonding is not going to happen and you have little in common with your age-group peers. They cannot help you with your homework, but still want you to help them with theirs. While this changes when you become an adult, those childhood habits have fossilized into adult behaviors. Most people, regardless of IQ tend to keep behaviors they learned as a child even if they no longer benefit them or are even self-destructive. ",

Intelligence and smartness has been discussed and correlated. Remaining lonely however have very wide connotations. They may be alone on purpose. They are better time managers. They want to optimize the usefulness of their time. They want to shield themselves from time and energy wasting activities. Solitude is needed when deep thinking is to be done. INTELLIGENT PEOPLE USUALLY DESCEND DEEPER IN THINKING WELL. They do not want others to be around when they are busy doing that. They are within a company only when it is UNAVOIDABLE.

Giftedness in general can be a very controversial topic, due in part to the fact that many people don\u2019t like to think that someone else is naturally better than them at something. But it\u2019s not just about skills or talent. It\u2019s about the way we think. Giftedness is part of us, so it might be hard to form connections with certain people. So, in summation, the loneliness comes from a lack of connection (sometimes even if you have \u201cfriends\u201d), and the misunderstanding comes from\u2014 society? Sorry, that seemed to fall flat. I don\u2019t know exactly why gifted people are misunderstood. Something about superstition or lack of modern science back then, or materialistic and shallow modern culture\u2026 ",

Without further delay, here be my reasons: Others aren\u2019t capable of followering my thought track, so I generally lose people within a sentence or two.Others don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. There are exceptions to this, like some of my smarter friends.Humans are cruel abusive creatures that attack the things they don\u2019t understant, i.e. MeI am capable of holding a mental debate with myself for up to an hour on the most trivial of things. Don\u2019t get me started on complex subjects.I don\u2019t like the vast majority of people. Sorry it\u2019s nothing personal, atleast with most people.This one is kind of odd, but people call me Sheldon, as in Sheldon Cooper, so I am half inclined to behave like him. I\u2019m quite good at it.Edit: A Andy Smith pointed out to me something about the Sheldon Cooper nickname. So in light of what he said, it is one of my many nicknames and they aren\u2019t to be heeded as any real effect towards my preference of my own company, as I gained the nicknames only in the last year or two. I also have the nicknames of Siri, Dictionary and Google, just to give some perspective. ",

On leaving I realised that in the normal world there is a paucity of such people. I am quite naturally extrovert myself and I do consider myself to be fairly intelligent and well read. The best way to interact with people of average intelligence I have found is to simply amuse yourself in playful antics, getting them to believe things that aren\u2019t true or just messing with them a little. I don\u2019t do this maliciously, although of course there are many who do. It saves getting too bored. Of course sadly a lot of intelligent people numb the pain of hanging out with the masses by using drugs to dumb themselves down. ",

I ended up nodding (out of to conform social norms than being agree) than fully participating in the conversation. 4. I don\u2019t make small talk at workplace or with close friends. I only do, at the till or just to break the ice with strangers while travelling. 5. I can make people bored easily with heavy deep topics. I hate one side conversation. 6. To avoid being label as snotty smart cookie, I tend to keep to minimal talk. People don\u2019t like to feel inferior or to be told wrong when sometime they are obviously showing basic ignorance. I have passed the age of being people pleaser. Now I stick to my gun. If people think I\u2019m a loner, snob, sound high or mighty, that\u2019s their problems. I find my life amusing. I intend to keep it that way. Those who stay are the keeper. I cherished them at heart. Helps a lot in distinguishing real friends or just a passerby. ",

            "answer_text": "Smart people are more likely to be alone for several reasons. First, being smart usually includes intellectual curiosity that may require some amount of independent study, which, to a really smart person, is fun. Smart people may have a hard time finding peers, not in any moral sense, but a social one. Smart people have interests that bore the hell out of a non-smart person, and they must pursue these interests alone or with one or two partners. Smart people have a strong sense of metacognition. They are involved in thinking in a way others may not be, making them seem detached and even eccentric because they manage a busy internal agenda. And finally, in my experience, really smart people also have a high degree of emotional and social intelligence. They can navigate the complex principles of interconnectedness, sustainability, progressivism, and moral conduct. They possess an independent, internal moral compass that makes irrelevant the efforts of church or state to control their behaviour. They are consequently more likely to take unpopular positions on issues, which may make them to appear hard to know when they become too earnest. ",

So human behaviors become predictable and you have already been able to conceive all the multitude of reaction one can take in order to achieve the desired state afterwards. It's boring, really. But productive when it comes to writing movies, stories and screenplays. And thus why we need solitude to have enough brain space to imagine all possible scenarios instead of being caught up with only the mere one single scenario available in front of us. Which is probably why direct human interaction is so boring, you only have access to one possible scenario (that is the only one you're having with one person at a time).

My brain works so fast and makes leaps of logic that most people can\u2019t follow, and I get tired of having to go back and explain myself in what I consider \u201cbaby talk\u201d. I have found that there are two types of people, there are the ignorant and the stupid. Ignorant people don\u2019t know and what to learn. These type of people will ask intelligent questions and indicate that they truly want to understand, in which case, I have infinite patience in showing them what I mean if they have the slightest aptitude for the subject. Stupid people don\u2019t know and could care less, these people I have no patience for. I find if I just stay by myself, I get into less trouble, and there are less misunderstandings. ",

For others, it can mean doing work in a different unconventional way that is innovative. Some people may attach the word smart with being wise, and so on. However, if I'm able to understand what you meant by smart here is - Someone who is wiser than average to handle problems and innovate solutions that are often unconventional for commoners. If that is so, I'd say a No to your question (Not in absolutism but a rather generalisation). Yes, such people may sometimes feel like not engaging with others who can't entertain their curiosity but it is not to say that they love loneliness. They're too as you and me. Like, you may not like to spend time with my type of friends or I might not like your taste of companionship. Similarly everyone has their own cirlce that they'd like to be in. In a nutshell, I'd say- Everyone has their own set of choices. But everyone likes companionship. [Hafsa Samreen, thankyou for asking]> ",
