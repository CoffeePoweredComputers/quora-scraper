            "answer_text": "This is a multi-layered question!! On first glance, the answer is no, not really. An employee will have to do as asked - i.e. help or train another employee. That is in the contract - \u2018other duties\u2019 statement. It applies to normal circumstances. However, I have also witnessed a situation where an employee was nominated to the main source to train, support and help a long-standing colleague returning from long-term sickness. No discussion about this nomination had taken place. The employee refused point blank to support his colleague when told of the decision. This refusal ruffled a lot of feathers and HR immediately resorted to policy, supported by the team manager, and penned a letter warning the employee of his behaviour and how it has undermined the manager of the team. The letter informed the employee that any further behaviour like this will result in disciplinary action. The employee responded citing the reasons why he was refusing to be the \u2018main source\u2019 of the returning colleague\u2019s training etc. These reasons referred to: A long history of bullying and harassment at the hands of this colleague and the managerThe colleague\u2019s performance history and disruptive attitude on project teams etcThe support he had to seek in the past to cope with the bullyingThat he was petrified of the vulnerable position this decision was putting him in and that he felt completely exposedHR had to withdraw their letter. It had been an ill-advised and poorly considered knee-jerk reaction. This is an extreme example of why the answer to the question is just as simple as saying \u2018the employee will be fired\u2019. It doesn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, always work that way. There is often more to such a refusal than an employee simply refusing. It is worth forgetting the \u2018lets refer to the policy\u2019 approach for a little while and scratching beneath the surface. Implementing the policy should be your last resort because all it does is apply a \u2018policing/enforcement\u2019 approach to the situation. There are many reasons a person may not want to train/help his/her colleague. Your aim should be to identify the reasons/causes of this behaviour and do something about them rather than simply reaching for the reprimand. In a time when employee engagement, health and well-being such reprimands need to be preceded by a little fact-finding. If the colleague refusing to train/help their colleague is at fault, then the reprimand is justified. But it is always advisable to make sure you have carried out your research before reprimanding anyone. If members of a team are not prepared to help their colleagues, then there is a deeper malaise that no policy or procedure is going to fix. I think HR should be asking different questions. Of course, most situations will be \u2018in normal circumstances\u2019 and the employee should, of course, train and/or help their colleague. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. An employee can refuse to help or train another employee. An employee can tag another employee as unfit tp be trained or quote any problems with the other employee to avoid training him. The employre can also quote his work pressure as an excuse for his inability to train or help another. Typically, to stay diplomatic and to look good in his boss's eyes, the employee may still take up the task but not really impart any training to the other employee. The latter is usually true. Therefore, trying to run after an employee who may have been straightforward is practically useless unless ypu may have any scores to settle with that employee. ",

I guess it would depend on your job description and your ability to train another person, that might prevent you doing the leading, e.g. if you are illiterate and learnt the task verbally and by being shown.

But I am not sure on how it can be legally enforced at the moment. ",
