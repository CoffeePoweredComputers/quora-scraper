On the contrary, when I read YA or watch a film with high school drama or teenage angst I again give thanks that I am no longer in high school or a teenager. Here\u2019s the thing: you choose the bills you pay. We chose our phones, our phone plans, our streaming service(s), the cars we drive and the home we bought. We choose what we buy (and what shows up on our credit cards). We also chose the jobs we apply for which enable us to pay these bills. Is paying bills and taxes fun? No Is life expensive? Yes Do you sometimes wish you had more money for fun stuff and didn't have to pay so much for insurance, gas, electricity and water and other things to stay alive and housed? For sure. Is adulting hard? Yes. Would I ever consider giving it up in favor for going back to high school? NO! Not only no, but [insert expletive] no. Not in a million years. I thought the adults who said those things were full of it when I was a teenager. I was right. ",

From the time I was 12 until I graduated high school I was incarcerated in a \u201cboarding school\u201d for the high crime of being an orphan. Yes they fed me (poorly). They housed me in wooden barracks filled with saggy metal frame bunk beds. The local public school sent a bus to pick us up every school day for a rather questionable education. On the downside, punishment for infractions of the rules were barbaric by standards of this century. A small percentage of my fellow inmates were socially maladjusted to the point of needing to be removed from polite society. A larger percentage of the staff fell into that category. Put yourself in that situation and your high school diploma is a true ticket to freedom. I rather enjoy having the liberty to decide which services I want to partake of and therefore which bills to pay. Never again would I want to relegate that job to anyone else. ",

Many I\u2019ve been struggling to come to terms with for the last 30 years. Had I done it \u201ccorrectly\u201d, then yes. I would miss it just like all the adults said I would. Instead, I miss it in the sense that I did it poorly. With ignorance and arrogance. It has held me back in certain areas for much of my adult life. I regret that I missed out on a lot of opportunities as a result. And I can\u2019t go back and change it. ",
