            "answer_text": "There is no or very less possibility for the schools and colleges to reopen before end of this year which is why many schools have already started teaching through online classes to ensure students education must not be affected. Many parents throughout the India have been opposing to reopen schools and colleges in India as the infections spreading around at a higher rate. Considering various factors our government also encouraging schools and colleges to conduct online classes till they make the decision regarding this. Also they stated that no timeline has been decided yet on reopening of schools. While the government is looking at the possibility of starting some classes for senior students from September end or October, no decisions has been taken yet. Also CM of Tamil Nadu stated that the Schools in Tamil Nadu will reopen only when the conditions are safe. Though Covid-19 affected major economical growth factors, education is much more important for us to preserve and think wise and act on before it gone worse. We need to take appropriate measures for students to pursue their online classes and make sure the basic facilities needed is available for everyone. We need to act soon in this on time for the students who are ultimately going to become the wealth of the society. Thanks!! ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think the schools will re open this academic year. Schools and Colleges will be the last one to open up. Until unless we have some remedy's like Vaccine, none of the parents will be ready to send their kids to School. It's not that easy to manage the School children, social Distancing, wearing mask for 8 hours and washing hands at regular intervals is not at all possible. So according to me Schools will reopen only next academic year, may be for 10th and 22th student's, school may have some alternate plans. But for others our country is still not ready. ",
