College in America doesn\u2019t work that way anymore. Thomas B Walsh's answer to What has changed about being a college student over the last 25 years?  I\u2019m going to let you in on a secret. Back in the day, almost nobody went to college, but if you did go and graduated, prospective employers assumed you were smart. Today, given that college has been watered down and everybody and his brother goes, when you graduate, you have to prove you are smart. You do that by building a compelling resume. Your major is one important element in that resume. Experiential learning is another. Thomas B Walsh's answer to As college degrees become the norm, they no longer distinguish potential employees. What does? Notes What Can You Do with a Liberal Arts Degree? Plenty, With the Right Skills | Burning Glass Technologies Underemployment: The Long-Term Impact on Careers A Couple Anecdotes: Ragin' Cajuns I was in Dallas to see the Buckeyes win the national football championship in January 2015. Coming home through DFW I stopped to grab a BBQ sandwich before my flight, and joined in a conversation with a couple recent graduates of the University of Louisiana Lafayette\u2014Ragin\u2019 Cajuns. One was behind the counter doling out brisket, chips, and beer, and the other was a customer catching a plane to his new energy sector job in Houston. This is just one example of how decisions on post-secondary education today can have widely disparate outcomes. Today, with an army of teenagers matriculating, your major and your resume matters\u2014A LOT. The Rose Bowl Two weeks before graduation, I was sitting in the main library on the Oval reading the sports page of the Columbus Dispatch. (I\u2019m pretty sure this was the first time I had ever darkened the door of the library.) The story I was reading was about the upcoming Rose Bowl between the Wisconsin Badgers and the USC Trojans. The lower right hand page contained a quarter page ad for a leading computer manufacturer. (This company was the Google of the day.) I didn\u2019t have a job lined up. I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was going to do come January 2, the day after the Rose Bowl. So, what the heck, I answered the ad, and, lo and behold, was invited to interview. I don\u2019t remember how they contacted me, since I didn\u2019t have a phone. I borrowed a tie from my boss at the Student Union bowling alley. One of my roommates lent me his car, a battered Ford. I spent a pleasant day at my prospective employer\u2019s office in a small Ohio city. Late in the afternoon the branch manager asked me, \u201cWould you like to be a systems engineer, or would you like to be a salesman?\u201d A penniless college student, the idea of living on commission scared me senseless. So, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious I don\u2019t want to be a salesman. I\u2019ll do that other thing.\u201d As I was on the way out the door heading back to Columbus, the branch manager called out, \u201cBuy a suit.\u201d I don\u2019t know this for a fact, but I might have been the only one who applied for that job. That was the beginning of my thirty-six year career in Information Technology. That was the 1963 Rose Bowl. USC won. PS I didn\u2019t have a resume when I went to that interview. If I had prepared one, it would have been one line: BA Philosophy The Ohio State University Today that resume would land me a job at New Lex Hardware and Supply in my hometown. ",
