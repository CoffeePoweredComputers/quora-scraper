I hope this serves. I have limited myself to Eastern Canada, as it has been nearly 35 years since I lived in the West\u2026 If you are looking for welcoming people renowned for their generosity, hospitality and home grown culture who will value every newcomer and desperately need immigrants, particularly entrepreneurs and skilled trades, then you might want to consider the Atlantic provinces, particularly St. John\u2019s or Halifax. Irish, Acadians, Scots, Americans, Lebanese, Tamil and Syrians and many other groups have settled there. The Mikmaq and Innu and Malaseet people are the original holders of the land and users of the sea there. If you like a distinct culture, with a laid back approach and overall cheaper cost of housing and living, try Quebec - particularly Montreal. Food, entertainment, festivals and other diversions make for a great place for young immigrants. French, Scots, Irish, English, Italians, Greeks, Haitians, Algerians, Jews, Portuguese, Americans and others have all thrived here. The Abenakis/Wabanaki, Algonquins/Anishinabeg, Atikamekw , Cree/Eeyou Istchee, Iroquois/Haudensaunee, Huron/Wendat, Innu, and Inuit are the original people of that land. The people of Quebec are not always seen as welcoming. This is a shame, as in my experience, the welcoming spirit of Quebec is better shown by the lyrics to this song (in translation): About my solitary country I cry out before I am silenced To all men on earth My home is your home Within my four walls of ice I put my time and my space To prepare the fire, the place For the people on the horizon And the people are of my race Ontario, and particularly Toronto, is the white hot centre for immigration and magnet for new Canadians. The infrastructure here - social services, education, culture - are well set up to help immigrants. There is a thriving metropolis where most anyone from around the world can find goods, services and communication from their country or culture of origin. French, Scots, Irish, English Indian, Pakistani, Italian, American and people from around the world flock here. Thousands of languages and hundreds of nationalities are represented in the GTA. There are jobs, but there are also issues with accreditation. You might not get the job or position or career you expect without waiting or upgrading skills. Housing costs are high and getting higher all teh time, but if you are willing to commute from the suburbs or exurbs, they are manageable still. The land in Ontario has been held since the beginning by over 140 First Nations groups, including people of the Anishnabek, Oji-Cree, Odawa, Pottawatomi, Wendat, Haudensaunee, Cree. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhich place is best for immigration in Canada?\u201d I am going to address what I think would be the best place/s for new or would-be Canadians to immigrate to. First consider what language you speak: Canada has two official languages: English & French. You might be surprised to find that there are French enclaves throughout the country while Quebec, the province, is the main area where French is spoken, it\u2019s also spoken, as the first language, in Manitoba & in areas of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, & I believe, Saskathewan. Being spoken as the first language, means you see it on street signs, spoken in shops, in the classroom. So if you speak either of these two languages, you have vitually a whole country to choose from. Otherwise, most languages are spoken somewhere in Canada; while standing in downtown Hamilton, I was told that 65 different languages & dialects were spoken in a 5 block area of where I was standing. And as another point of interest, Chinese is Canada\u2019s third most-used language. We are multi-cultural & rather proud of it. Now as to jobs - it depends on your training & education as well as your work experience: some jobs are just more common in large cities. You will find very few postings for a Professor of Law in a small town; but, the town will usually require grade & high school teachers & even a Lawyer (you would have to requalify for the province you move to). Many jobs now can be done on-line & this would allow you to live anywhere you can get reliable hi-speed WiFi connections. (And, no its not everywhere in Canada: in fact, it was humourous to see guys, in the north, with these cell-phones walking to the end of the dock trying to get reception - we got a land-phone to fix that problem) If you are not dependent on a large community to practise your particular skill, then I can heartily recommend the smaller towns of Canada: here you will find housing to be cheaper, with some places being 50% or more cheaper than their larger counterparts, some eateries though generally of a meat & potatoe variety & nothing to compare with what a moderate to large-sized city can provide, good schooling, grocery, clothing, hardware, building supply, auto sales & repair, plus safety of person, & a generally less formal lifestyle that appeals to artists & artisans, outdoors-types, & do-it-yourselfers. Now having said all that, you will find that many newcomers prefer the large cities as they are certain to find people from their homeland as well as restaurants, groceries, entertainments etc. catering to their tastes. So what you may ask does Canada expect from its new citizens; firstly a commitment to its laws, secondly a reasonable work-ethic & while a desire to contribute to the community you live is nice, its not required or expected: most Canadians are polite & respect the privacy of others. All places in Canada will offer you excellent healthcare, good schools, good roads with all-season access (except in the truly Far North), grocery stores, mail service & banking. The reason I am reluctant to guarantee WiFi/TV outside of larger centers in the south is due to my own experience in the north where the weather seems to play a major role in being able to get on line or recieve a TV signal. No big deal if your livlihood doesn\u2019t depend on it; just a minor annoyance if your team is playing & you can\u2019t watch. While I cannot give a definitive answer as to the best place, I can say this this: if you choose Canada, you will not be disappointed & you will be joining over 30 million people who if they are not immigrants, their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents were & you will be adding your life to a wonderful medley of old, new in a cultural milieu so diverse it has not yet mets its equal. So welcome, whoever & wherever you are. ",
