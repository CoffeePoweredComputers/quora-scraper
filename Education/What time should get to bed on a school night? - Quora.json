            "answer_text": "Depends on the student. Every school-age child needs plenty of rest. Grade School children (ages 5\u201310) should go to bed at 8:30pm. Middle School children (ages 11\u201313) should go to bed at 9pm. High School teens (ages 14\u201318) should go to bed between 9:30\u201310pm (this also depends on how much homework the student has). College students should try going to bed at 10:30\u201311pm (this also depends on when the students have class[es]). It is not always easy to pick an appropriate bedtime, but, as parents, we are the ones who make the decisions and getting our children accustomed to specific hour to go to sleep, will help them as they grow older to choose wise decisions for their own good.

            "answer_text": "Depends on the student and how much sleep you need to function. I\u2019m not a student but I am a working adult. I know that I need about 6 hours of sleep. I also know that even though technically I could sleep in later, I like to wake up at 6:30 so that I have two hours to get ready\u2026 not that I need two hours but it means I get to relax and actually enjoy my morning instead of rushing around with no time to sit down. So if I need 6\u20137 hours and I want to wake up at 6:30 that means I absolutely need to be asleep by 12. And while I technically fall asleep fast it can take a bit to \u201cdecompress\u201d so I\u2019ll be in bed by 10 or 11 which gives me time to watch tv/scroll on my phone or just talk to my fiance before turning over and falling asleep.
