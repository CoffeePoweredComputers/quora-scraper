            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Coming to your question.Yes it's possible to get admission. Based upon the year of passing your 10th grade,the duration of the Sr. Secondary course would be as following : If there is a time gap of two or more than two years between your 10th passing year and the session of your admission in NIOS, then you would get first opportunity to sit for public examination after exactly one year from the session of your admission and subsequently get your result.If you have just completed your 10th grade and as of now you want to opt NIOS then the minimum course duration would be two years.And if you have just completed your 11th or failed in 11th and want to opt NIOS then also the minimum time length of the course will be two years. There is no admission in 12th in NIOS . You have to get admitted in 10+2 course named Sr.Secondary in NIOS.Remember the 10+2 grade examination of NIOS cover the total syllabus of 11th and 12th. Hope got the answer .Feel free to query more.All the best wishes. MJ ",
