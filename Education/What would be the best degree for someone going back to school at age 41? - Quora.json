I can't just randomly answer without some knowledge. But, at 41 you have made the decision to go back to school. Did you start, then stop? Did you already have a degree goal in mind, but life got in the way so to speak? Or, did you decide halfway through you hated what you were pursuing? Seems like you have already started to do some analysis. So, what would you really rather be doing with your life for the next 25 years? Not to just say anyone can do it, but your life experience might be just what it takes to become a vocational education teacher. I work with a man who was a rocket scientist, then decided one day he wasn't fuelled in life, so he is now a math teacher.

It can and does predict the future in jobs, employment, careers, professions, all things including what would be the best degree for someone going back to school at age 41. I used it, and it was spot on. 10, 15, even 20 years predictions based on centuries worth of data and trends in employment, technology, the economy, etc. The library may have a current copy, but it takes time to get on the shelves, and then may be a reference book, unable to remove from the library. It requires reading and research. It is usually available in paperback from regular bookstores for a reasonable cost. But heed my caution; only the most recently published will help you; no outdated ones will do. ",
