            "answer_text": "Unschoolers and kids in democratic schools do choose what to study. In fact the way they learn doesn\u2019t even look like school. It looks like pursuing their interests. Even though it doesn\u2019t look like school, they can go onto college with no problems if they want to. Essentially the reason you\u2019re made to learn that stuff in school is because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been done. Once something works well enough, people are afraid to mess with it. They come to believe it must be done that way. They\u2019ll even come up with reasons that it supposedly must be done that way. But, here\u2019s the secret. They don\u2019t really know. Without a group to compare it with, educators have no way of knowing what effects are from school and what effects are from living and growing older. They\u2019re just assuming school is responsible for what students are able to do once they leave. But since unschooled kids and kids in democratic schools don\u2019t do what schools do, their success calls that certainty into question. Originally free public schools were created to increase the minimum level of education of the masses. The main two goals were to get kids reading, writing and able to do arithmetic so they would be employable. The second was to provide them with a general education about the world while keeping them off the streets. And to do it cheaply, which is why schools look like factory production lines, with teachers as line workers and students as their product. (Factory model school - Wikipedia) Since the goals were modest, it worked well to rely on filling kids heads full of facts. It didn\u2019t matter whether the facts stuck or not. The original purpose was to expose kids to a general education. Public schools worked so well for that purpose they were asked to do more and more. Now they\u2019re expected to prepare as many kids as possible for college. But memorizing facts is a poor way to learn. It leads to rote learning, not understanding. And now kids are expected to memorize far more than the system was ever designed for. The Underground History of American Education: A School Teacher's Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling by John Taylor Gatto is quite enlightening about why schools are as they are and why that\u2019s a problem.

            "answer_text": "The school forces you to learn a wide variety of subjects because they have no idea what you'll end up using and what you won't. Many schools do allow you to pick subjects to an extent, especially once you get to the higher grades. But you still have to take the same mandatory classes, because your goals for the future will change as you get older and learn more about yourself. When I was in middle school, I was convinced that I wanted to be a doctor when I grew up. If I had the ability to pick my classes, I probably would have picked biology, chemistry\u2026you know, stuff you would need in order to become a doctor. Now that I'm older, I know that being a doctor is not a good career choice for me. I did my research, and I figured out that(among other things) I really, really suck at biology and science. Now, I'm studying to become a graphic designer. But you know what? I might even change my mind on that. I never know with me. So, just in case I change my mind, I still take classes that help me improve basic job skills, so that I can be adaptable and switch subjects without having to start all the way back at square one. It's the same thing with other people. You can specialize eventually, but before that happens, you need to build up a base of knowledge. And besides, in today's society, people who know a little bit about a wide range of subjects are much more useful then people who only know a lot about one specific topic. ",
