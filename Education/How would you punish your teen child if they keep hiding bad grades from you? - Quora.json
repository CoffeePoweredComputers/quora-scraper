            "answer_text": "No. I would ask myself why I am making them fearful of me knowing things about their life. It sounds as though punishment is a key part of your parenting strategy and that might be your answer. Your job as a parent is to support your child\u2019s development, not to demand their development and punish deficits. As a mother of an academically successful twenty-something and a longtime educator, I assure you that being supportive, safe, understanding, and reassuring will better support good grades than being punitive. If they are afraid to show you their grades, then you best get them into tutoring, after school homework sessions, a reading program, etc. Be the parent who is regularly at the school volunteering, visiting teachers, hosting study groups at your house, taking your kid to the library to find books to read every week or two, and reading books WITH your kid to bond. Be the parent who turns of the TV, Youtube, videogames, and the radio and sits down with a copy of your child\u2019s homework at the kitchen table and asks them to help you do it yourself. Ask if you can sit in on some of your child\u2019s classes and then go home and try to do that homework yourself. If you can\u2019t do your child\u2019s homework (while they do it separately for themselves), then you need to learn how to do it, do it alongside them (separately but at the same table), and keep up. If you do this every single day for every topic and get tutoring for both of you at the same time if you can\u2019t, chances are that your kid\u2019s grades will start to climb, they\u2019ll end up helping you with your homework, and they\u2019ll be showing you their grades, proud of themselves for doing a better job than you do. When you have a teenager, you\u2019re not running to keep up with them like you did when they were a toddler. You\u2019re working hard mentally to keep ahead of them or just to keep up beside them. You have to in a way be smarter than they are. If your kid is hiding grades from you, then they are smarter than you are in a way. If you want your child to succeed and all you do to make that happen is threaten, yell, hit, deprive them of devices or contact with friends, or otherwise punish, you\u2019re not that smart. If you lure your child into competing with you for grades on the same homework, then you are smarter than they are. Be smarter than they are. Ditch the punishment. Create a learning environment in your home\u2014for EVERYONE including you, not just that teen. If dad is sitting in the recliner with a beer watching sports all day and mom is on Facebook exchanging puppy photos all day while little sister is watching cartoons and little brother is playing video games, how the heck is the teen going to even focus on homework, much less do it? Get all those devices turned off, get everyone a book and some kind of \u201chomework,\u201d and get everyone at the big table or in the same room at least reading or doing their \u201chomework.\u201d Let one parent balance the checkbook or pay the bills. Let little sister practice writing with a workbook. Let little brother read a chapter book. And, YOU do identical homework to your teen\u2019s homework. Do it. Do this every weekday and sometimes on the weekends so that all the teen\u2019s homework gets done by both of you. Being a good parent isn\u2019t about carrying a big stick. It\u2019s about having a big heart, a heart big enough to make your home and your activities supportive of your children\u2019s success. ",

            "answer_text": "In the book Nurture Shock - there is a great chapter on why kids lie. Hiding and keeping secrets is a form of lying. Children do this to protect the parent. The child lies in favor of NOT disappointing the parent. Punishing often reinforces lying, hiding and withholding. The grades are a result of something else. Perhaps the child is not getting the support he/she needs. I recommend talking openly with the child and trouble shooting what the cause of the bad grades are in the first place. Doing this from a non reactive tone is best. We want honest open conversations with our teens. We want them to feel safe so that they tell us EVERYTHING. And punishing doesn\u2019t foster trust. If a teen thinks the parent can\u2019t handle the truth - then they will STOP telling us the truth. This is true for grown up children too. And it doesn\u2019t lead to the closest relationships. The parent may be the last one to offer the support the child needs. At this age finding a tutor or seeing if there are tutoring services at your school can be the best solution. This way the child becomes accountable to someone else. AS this relationship forms with the tutor or peer tutor, you can work on building up the emotional trust between you and your child. We want to be a consultant that the teenager comes to for feedback and perspective. Then they will go and make their own choices and their own mistakes as well. If we have a trusting, open, honest relationship they will come back without shame without fear and say - hey, mom, dad I f\u2019d up. Can you help me? And without shaming or blaming or reacting we can be a good consultant. We can say - OK. Let\u2019s look at some options here and see how you might fix this and make a different choice. We offer support without fixing their messes for them. ",
