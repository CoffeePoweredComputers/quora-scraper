            "answer_text": "Sure. Now, let me be more clear, because that answer is going to be grossly misleading without proper context. I can look at someone, male or female, and appreciate their aesthetic. People are allowed to be attractive, there\u2019s no crime in it. Some of my students are objectively attractive. But, you know what else they are? They are kids, under my care. It doesn\u2019t matter how pretty they may be, they are young and need adults to treat them like people. They need people to exemplify what SHOULD be demonstrated every day, that your looks and gender don\u2019t influence your worth or potential. That you have more to offer someone than your sexuality. For that reason alone, nothing, and I mean NOTHING, would convince me to act. Furthermore, attraction is a lot more than aesthetic. Have you ever met a pretty person with a terrible personality? I have. It\u2019s the same way with my students. Not a single one has a personality I find attractive, because, once again, they are kids. We have nothing in common, we have nothing that we relate to each other with on a personal level, there is no way that a romantic emotional attachment would form between us. I don\u2019t care if they are 18, they are still 10 years younger than I am. Not my cup of tea, ",

            "answer_text": "Some might, but whether it is normal or not is another matter on its own. If we are talking about high school teacher then it\u2019s certainly disturbing that the male teacher would find his female students romantically/sexually attractive. This type of men are the last people to be allowed near any school let alone be a teacher. High school girls are developing kids, who are still in their physical and primary mental stages of development. They don\u2019t look like grown women yet, and if a man can differentiate his feelings toward young girls vs young women, then he might have some problem. Now, if we are talking about college teacher or professor then that\u2019s a different matter. College kids are young men and women in their physical prime. Attraction toward them is normal but acting on it is not appropriate. ",

So, I think it likely that some male teachers find some of their female students attractive. And the same for female teachers and male students. It\u2019s biology. Being a teacher does not mean one loses his/her awareness towards attractive members of the opposite sex. But many people assume finding a student attractive equates to some perversion or some potential wrongdoing (which it can, but not automaticaly). Thoughts are not crimes. One can notice an attractive person and simply leave it at that. If we could be convicted because of impure or inappropriate thoughts, we\u2019d all be locked up. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe everyone of us encountered a pervert teacher once in our lifetime. I am not trying to sound any wrong here,but we boys recognise a pervert teacher way early than a girl ever think of that man llike this or realise it. If you are curious about reason ,then I'll say, Because We are boys , we know how a boy or man touch or talk when he is showing affection/love,asking things or behaving like a teacher or when he is giving a perverted touch. And there's another reason,we don't trust people who is extremely sweet to girls,we always be cautious about them and watch their actions carefully. I can't say whether a girl is pervert or not\ud83d\ude05.. When we were in Std.7 ,we had a Science teacher,S***j J*******l (yup,I remember his name).He was 24\u201325 years of age,a young teacher.When he came to our class for the first time,he was showing extra attention to girls. The first thing every boys in our class told about him was,\u201d Tharki hai Sa**a ( He is a pervert\u201d. After few days,his attention toward girls increased and he started having sweet talks and touching them.For that time,we were sure that he is a pervert and we always used to talk about him that how he is touching girls of our class.Maybe our assumptions were wrong\u2026.hold with me\u2026. When I was in Std.10 . Our English tuition teacher's husband was a Biology teacher who used to take classes of 10+2 students,he was 50\u201360 years old. Sometimes during our tuition he used to come to talk to us (us never meant boys or all students). He used to pinch girl's cheeks,touch them in the wrong way, with disguisting smile and sweet talks. He used to do the same to our friend(girl), we(me and my friends,except her) always used to get angry or get disguisted just by his presence..believe me ,the first impression we have of him was of a pervert\u2026.. Maybe,here too our assumptions were wrong.. Getting back to the stories\u2026We told about Science teacher to one of our classmate,she didn't believe us and left saying you all are assuming things. When we told about that that old man to our friend,she didn't believe us. Cinclusion:-1st story:After one month many seniors(girls) complained about that Science teacher and he was fired.Reason,he was a pervert,always touch them in the wrong way\u2026\u2026\u2026 2nd story: When we were in class 11th ,and out of town (we all went to study in different cities) we heard a story of that old man being attacked(attacked in the sense,being shot by the gun but bullet missed the old man) by a girl's father.Reason,he used touch that girl (all girls) in a wrong way and tease her.She complained about that old man to his father .And his father attecked that old man in rage\u2026\u2026..So,our assumptions were never wrong\ud83d\ude05 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. :) ",

For most of the students that I was working with I was within 5\u20137 years (in rare cases I was almost ten). For reference my parents are six years apart which is about average in my family, so growing up I always considered this kind of an age gap normal. When I started working in high schools; however, that changed. There was something so young about the students that was just a major turn off. Now granted going in I had a mentor tell me: \u201cremember Ryan; Lolita was a warning, not a romance.\u201d Now of course I never had any intention of throwing my career away over having any kind of inappropriate relationship. Though, thinking of Lolita as a warning I figured there would me more temptation. For me there has never been any kind of attraction. I will say that because I am human that I find myself evaluating the aesthetic attractiveness of students without even realizing it. Honestly though, when I do it\u2019s far less exciting than seeing a cute dog. ",

There have been so many news about female teachers seducing and doing things with teenage boys. I don\u2019t think I have to put the links for news articles. You get the point. Even when I was a teenager, and was in grade 8, there was one teacher who one day, told me that she likes me and just looked at me in an innocent but weird way. It was very odd because we were not even close, I was shy kid, not good at studies, and never talked to teachers, and when she suddenly told that to me, it was very uncomfortable and foreign, I didn\u2019t know how to react. But nothing else happened more than that. It was veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrry weird. ",

I have students from elementary all the way up to 39. I\u2019m 45. Many college girls are beautiful and we compliment each other all the time for the sake of English- manners (compliments) are nice. Many students have said they want a boyfriend like me, to marry a guy like me. They are attracted to me. Looks, I speak and know both cultures, tough guy, smart, balanced, unique, funny\u2026there are many reasons for attraction. I am attracted to a few of my female students that are older, they are really beautiful and smart. I\u2019m even attracted to some mothers who give me gifts and praise. I don\u2019t know how some of you define attraction, but mine isn\u2019t about sexual fantasy. This is Crystal who is a student of mine. I find her attractive, he husband is also a student and he\u2019s a stud. We\u2019re all close friends and we\u2019re building homes next to each other.  ",

Their trust in me matters a great deal, far more than anything I would ever get out of anything physical with them. And as Schopper said, they are kids.

There is a high chance that if a professor makes you understand he has an eye for you, he will come take what he wants from you and he wont care about your consent. Its often a power trip aimed at humiliating you and boosting their ego rather than any real interest about who you are as a person. There is a lot of competition nowadays between professors about how many first year students they can fuck in a semester. They rarely see their students as people and couldnt care less about ethics since they are never prosecuted for sexual abuse. ",
