            "answer_text": "Yes, I'll tell you exactly why. When I entered college, I was kind of relieved that now you got some space to try things. But that messed up my percentage. It was steeply budding down. You can cover up but only so much. But then something happened, I met someone. It entirely changed my perspective of looking at things. People told me that it was a waste of time but may be it was all so refreshing and new. My percentage took a huge leap. I could find time for academics and everything. My aggregate went beyond what I could ever imagine. Now, it was the convocation day, and I went with utter pride to take my degreee. But hell no, what the fuck. They wrote someone's else name. Everyone was laughing at me. I asked them what is this crap. They asked did you have girlfriend in college. I said no. That's why you are not being awarded your degree. So, the answer to the question is yeah it is extremely needful to have a girlfriend in college otherwise they don't give you degree. Cherry-on-top, they laugh too. My entire four years were wasted because I didn't know that girlfriend was also needed. Today I have neither girlfriend nor degree. You might be wondering who was the person I met. It was just a stupid senior. He gave me the notes (which students thought were in a new form,so,might be a waste) and and some guidance tips that definitely changed my perspective and my percentage boomed. And you know where did it hurt me the most. They wrote someone else's name. He came to collect the degree but I clamoured to everyone that this guy wasn't even in our college let alone in branch, so how come he is being awarded degree without even being enrolled for college. Everyone shouted at once, because he has 66 girlfriends. And that was the most exasperating moment of my life. So, please do the needful. ",
