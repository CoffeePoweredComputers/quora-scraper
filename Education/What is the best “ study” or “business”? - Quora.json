            "answer_text": "it depends on what\u2019s your priority. i often had this question asking by people around me when they know that i\u2019ve decided to not go to university. i think what exactly people looking for after graduate and get the bachelor is work. in my country, approximately 70.000 students are fight for the national test which known as sbmptn, when the available seat is only for 3.000 or so. its only to get the university. when they\u2019re graduated, they will looking for the job that also limited. and the last option is exactly business. i dont say that study is not important. its also important. but,some people need to open the job for the others. so i think why must we\u2019re looking for the job ? why not we take the option to open the job for the others and help them at the same time ? because when there\u2019s no people open the job no people can work then. and study also can goes well when you take the opportunities to business. you can do both of them at the same time.
