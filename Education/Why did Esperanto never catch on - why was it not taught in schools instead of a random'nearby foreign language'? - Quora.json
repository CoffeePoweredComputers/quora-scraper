            "answer_text": "Esperanto was badly timed. It actually was catching on to some extent in the late 19th and early 20th Century, but then, after WW1, and the Great Depression, nationalism and antipathy to cosmopolitanism suddenly flared up heavily. Totalitarian regimes generally tended to ban Esperanto as it ran against their interests to encourage cross border communication among citizens. After WW2, English slowly but steadily began taking over as the de facto international language, pushing aside the former diplomatic tongue, French. Nobody with money or power was really all that interested in Esperanto anymore. Today the biggest promoters of Esperanto tend to be a few weird cranks as well as some newer religious groups like the Baha\u2019i. It has basically become a hobby cause for a handful of random people around the globe. These days, Esperanto has about as much chance of becoming the global tongue as Dothraki or Klingon. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the same reason why English is not spelled phonetically or why the Dvorak keyboard is not standard. It is merely polticis and the political interest are to make English speakers cheap and available and this can only be assured if it is taught everywhere. I think an explanation can be found in Namibia and South Africa is now favored over all despite of being the mother tongue of a tiny minority. There is no fault in Esperanto. It is just that its speakers are mostly ordinary people and not the owners of international companies nor politicians. The situation would be totally different when you browse through job ads and at least every tenth or so requires Esperanto skills. ",
