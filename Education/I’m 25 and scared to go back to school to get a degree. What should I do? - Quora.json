            "answer_text": " After working for a few years I went back to college to study commerce. I was 25. Here\u2019s what I felt at first: It felt weird to wear shorts and a t-shirt after wearing a shirt and pantsIt felt weird to be surrounded by thousands of people that were all in their early 20\u2019s (or younger)It felt weird to have complete freedom after working 8 am - 5 pm each dayIt felt weird to be told what to learn in classI felt scared that I wouldn\u2019t be as smart as the other studentsHere\u2019s what I discovered after a short while: It was fun to wear shorts and t-shirts every day - I felt free!I enjoyed being around young motivated, interesting, and fun peopleI embraced the freedom of study and the responsibility of managing my own timeI realized that a system of learning keeps you on track and that it opens opportunities to go on your own \u2018self-learning\u2019 tangents.Being a few years older, I was more mature and able to focus better.I was no longer scared, but excited to learn alongside other students and help each other towards our common goal.To Conclude: You are still young. Go and enjoy the Bachelor of Science if that\u2019s what you want to do. Let me know how you get on! The Reformed Student ",

            "answer_text": "FInd a local community college or find some classes on line through an accredited source that you are interested in and start out taking one or two to ease yourself back in. You are never to old to learn and as an older student you have experiences and perspectives you can use in classes and discussions that many people don\u2019t have. I started at a community college and went to school with a number of adults that were 40 plus, one of my female classmates was 50 she went on to not only complete her undergraduate at a very prestigious university but also completed law school where she graduated at the top of her class and she is now a practicing attorney. I asked her one time why she came back to school after being away for so many years even though she was financially set for life and her simple answer was she had always wanted to get her degree and to prove to herself that she could do it. So Go For It!! and Good Luck! Besides education is the one thing in life no one can ever take way from you ",
