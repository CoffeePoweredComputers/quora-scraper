            "answer_text": "1.Biology Clear your concepts through ncert books first read it , then understand each paraghraphs ,and mark each important term or words.Since assertion reasioning types of questions are heavily drawn from Ncert , Please read each and every single line .The paper will be online so scan each and every diagrams and their labellings in your brain.If you had done Ncert by heart Your 60% work is done , remaining will depend on your frequency of revision.For extra knowledge you may follow Akash Institutes/Allen booklets , and for practising the Mcqs and A and R types question you may follow mtg Ncert at fingertips for Biology. 2. Chemistry Clear your concepts from Ncert.For solving numericals of physical chemistry please solve questions from the Ncert first then from any question banks. Please also solve questions of previous year IIT Jee Main question Paper becauce level of numerical of high level.For inorganic chemistry NNcert is more than sufficient ,just learn all exception cases and hybridization of inorganic componds by heart.For organic chemistry first cover all topics from ncert and please learn the organic chemistry in following way this will make you to learn and get concept easierNomenclatureIsomerism and structuresOrder of stabilityName reactionsMechanism of reactionsOxidationReductionSpecial ReactionsAll chapter in deepLearn all Name reaction and their mechanism .Order of stability , boiling and melting point must be learned and their concepts must be clear in your mind.For Practising questions you may follow mtg Ncert at fingertips of chemistry. 3. Physics : Here comes the devil.Cover Ncert then Try numericals from Ncert then from any question bank .For getting good score please practice previous years questions of IIT JEE MAIN AND ADVANCE .For Assertion and Reasoning you may follow Ncert atfingertips for physics. 4. General KnowledgeRead newspaper daily , please focus on new schemes which are going to be launched by the Government. Any case regarding judiciary may be asked so please also have eye over this topicsAnd questions may be asked fromAnykind of DisasterNobel prizesFILMS AWARDSLogical thinking will be also tested in the exam so also.prepare for it also.

            "answer_text": "Physics and Chemistry.The two subjects ,practically having no use in mbbs curriculum :but still a great need of budding doctors to crack neet ug exam.Firstly i start with chemistry(as my favourite) CHEMISTRY firstly i would say ..clear your basics and read organic chemistry whenever you get any leisure time\u2026because this part of the subject is just like a twisting road with many flyovers(the tricky methods)..you just read it many times..and you can find your route\u2026the roads will become more and more clearer to you..as more you read\u2026then comes physical chemistry\u2026you just need to practice more and more numericals from good books like n avasti or cengage or arihant dpp\u2026practice will make you perfect\u2026nothing to say about inorganic chemistry as you simply need to memorise all things\u2026i will say only thing..in this branch practice less and read more\u2026.the only decent part is coordination chemistry\u2026else is very boring\u2026solve good mcqs from goods books nike himanshu pandey,ms chauhan for organic\u2026..v k jaiswal ,ranjeet shahi for inorganic chemistry\u2026and dig deep to clear your concepts..thats all for chemistry.. PHYSICS It is always been difficult for medicos\u2026but those who enjoy it are the winners\u2026.For mechanics keep your concepts regularly clear \u2026you may solve question from dc pandey,cengage,irodov(only few,not all),\u2026it covers a large topic ..the hydrodynamics,elasticity,shm,wpe,laws of motion\u2026which are some of the most important topics\u2026practice as much questions as you can\u2026then comes heat and thermodynamics\u2026thermodynamics seems to be a bit difficult because a lot of theory is attached with it\u2026which are almost 90percent wrong\u2026as no machine works ideally\u2026so its a bit weird to say about the questions..you need to practice it with generous effort \u2026as some part of it is very difficult\u2026then comes waves(considered under mechanics)\u2026so let it go..just clear your concepts and that will be enough. Now class 12 ..a lot of things to be understood properly..firstly the easier ones ,electrostatics,current electricity\u2026very easy concepts ..requires much less time to master it..just keep your concepts clear \u2026.then comes electromagnetism\u2026.the most loved topic..concepts are numerous\u2026better study it from hc verma and cengage and solve ample of questions\u2026.then comes the most hated part\u2026modern physics\u2026nobody gives a shit\u2026except some parts..semiconductors\u2026there is nothing except calculation\u2026so during exams \u2026.it will just check your calculative skills\u2026nothing else..in neet level\u2026 Rest \u2026all upto you..strategy is entirely upon you\u2026how you plan..how you execute it\u2026give your best..and try your best\u2026 Thanx for reading :) ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest you to immediately follow these guidelines in order to score well Rigorous Writing Practice- write down all the reactions in order to prepare them well.Avoid Procrastination : Do ur work on proper time. Dont avoid themMeditation: keep ur mind calm & relaxedSet targets : Even small targets will do . For example take 5 reactions per day . This means you can do more than 450 reactions in 3 months. Increase your target step wisePlanning : Do not study organic chemistry Haphazardly. Organize your work. Study the concepts first. Then go for the reactions .Motivation: You can motivate yourself at the end of big targets with a choclate or a treat. One more way is that tell your friends about your target . They will do the rest work. For eg. If u have to complete 10 reactions in one day & u find it difficult . Tell ur friends abt ur target & they will ask u again & again \u201cwhat about ur 10 reactions Are the done???\u201d & So on..Revision: Toppers generally succeed due to proper revision tactics . Keep revising the reactions u did . Make charts & stick them on the walls of ur bedroom .Self assesment: Be a teacher of your own. Take your own test at regular interval of timeMake self notes: This will help u at the end . Things u find it difficult & have to be revised at the nick of time are to be written in this.Reference :For chemistry :You may refer to Modern ABC Chemistry ( subjective ) for both 11&12 .It provides the best basic knowledge in a simple & lucid language. For higher level, Cengage , Pradeep , Arihantwill do.For physics : Try solving as many as numerical as u can . U may refer P.S.Bangui . HC Verma, Modern ABC , Arihant, Pradeep help one to solve a variety of mcqs & are best for competitive exams. VK Mehta is one of the best for basics in physicsLastly most Important AVOID STRESS . Just work hard and you will get good grades Hope this helps you :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well physics and chemistry are equally important for NEET as they form other 50% of question paper and approach to them is different from biology, for physics I will tell you what I did last year that gave a significant increase in performance PHYSICS:- Start with NCERT, don\u2019t try to understand them just read them like a novel read a chapter 2\u20133 times which will give you a fair idea about the chapter next extract all the imp equation given and values of constants given in chapter and write them on a page also write some imp and frequent terms from the chapter now read the page and try some solved examples given in NCERT you will start feeling ease with them after that do some question solved and unsolved of ordinary thinking/beginner level from your coaching modules or books like USS and HC verma, ask for help from your coaching teaching or anyone else in tough part and ask for short tricks or quick tips if any from then, Allen\u2019s and Resonance give handbooks for quick revision and for short tricks use them. After that start doing as much question you can and previous year question papers Chemistry :- start with the same method as in physics, reading 1st from NCERT then move to other books, for inorganic NCERT is enough, go through them thoroughly while for organic stick to Allen modules or another coaching modules and class notes or you can go for OP tandon for an extra edge over others, for Physical chemistry I suggest you to stay with coaching modules+class notes+USS for question that will be enough, practice is important for physical chemistry so please do as much practice as you can P.s. Please don't ignore NCERT at any cost they are the most under rated but best book for preparations so please read them at least 3\u20134 times before even looking at coaching modules. THANK YOU ",

            "answer_text": "As a student, Physics was a life saver for me while chemistry was the subject where I usually lost marks. I naturally loved physics more because somewhere it was helping me improve basketball skills (I play awesome ..!! ) I had a mate who was preparing for JEE advanced and I studied physics with him. He was way ahead of me in question grasping, and applying the required concept. I observed him for few days and started copying him, and after a month we were neck to neck in physics (almost). Anyways he sticked to HC Verma and the modules provided by VMC ( vidyamandir classes) while I, who was trying hard to be like him had to do what was necessary , I started on HCV and DC Pandey combined ( I had to learn from the illustrations provided by the DC Pandey books). Soon I had a strong base in physics and I was in par with my mate. Fun fact: He and me are best friends. He is doing computer science from IIT Delhi (pretty impressive, eh!) Well I improved pretty quickly (maybe out of desperation) and soon physics became the reason I was opted in for the scholar\u2019s batch at Aakash institute. That\u2019s the tale of physics. About chemistry, now my new mate and me, we were both weak here so it never hurt me much. I had lots and lots of books in chemistry and I tried solving many. Though I recommend physical chemistry to be done solely by Aakash modules since there it\u2019s given complete enough ( if you have any doubts, you can always flip to Pradeep textbooks for chemistry). Inorganic chemistry from NCERT only. And for organic chemistry, I had to work hard in the competition at my institute. I recommend working hard in the first chapter called \u2018general organic chemistry\u2019 and solving MS Chauhans elementary problems in organic chemistry. This will build a very strong base and from here on you can stick to normal textbooks. Don\u2019t do advanced problems in physics from DC Pandey\u2026 just do the introductory excercise and be happy with it. ",

            "answer_text": "I shall tell you some tips and books about physics and physical chemistry preparation. For physics you'll need Recent Allen module (not older than 2015)NCERT textbooks and exemplar (can be downloaded as pdf from ncert website)Allen's module has everything written in it. It has well written concepts and questions. Every topic is followed by a set of examples and a question set named \u201cbeginner box\u201d. There are golden key concepts which are important things to remember but in a short cut way. At the end of chapters there is 3 set of exercises. 1st one is basic exercise and tests understanding of chapter. 2nd one contains questions from previous years. 3rd one is assertion-reason type. Reading NCERT is must. First you should read module and at the end of a topic refer to NCERT and read it. For ex if you covered total internal reflection from module in afternoon, you should study the same from NCERT within a day. This is crucial for boards and Assertion reason questions. NCERT exemplar has varieties of questions from mcqs to short answer and long answers. It is a must solve book which either people don't know or ignore it. Apart from that if you feel confident you may try solving dc Pandey objective phsics or hc verma. That would be your call. For physical chemistry: Either Allen's module or O P Tandon will do.Ncert textbook and exemplar.In physical chemistry, everything written in ncert is kinda primitive. It gives you information but not sufficient to solve every competitive questions. You can solve 12\u201314 out of 22 questions but that would not be enough. For that you can refer to either module or op tandon. Advantage of module is it sticks to basic NCERT concepts but also gives you enough competitive edge. Chapters for module are designed in same way as physics module with examples, 3 set exercises etc. Op tandon has theory and questions written for upto jee level. While reading book you will have to cut some topics from chapters to avoid wastage of effort. The intext questions and miscellaneous exercises of op tandon are good for neet practice. After solving these you may solve basic questions of N Avasthi book. N Avasthi is also helpful for inorganic chemistry problems. For inorganic chemistry NCERT textbook alone is sufficient if you have a teacher guiding you. If not you can refer to op tandon inorganic chemistry but only to understand the reason behind a particular concept. O p tandon is not default textbook for reading. It is only for clearing concepts. Allen's module is xerox copy of ncert but has questions in it, so you'll need it for solving questions. For organic chemistry Ncert textbook + exemplarAllen's module (only from 2016 onwards in this case)Etoos organic lectures by N J sir, if you are studying by yourself.The video lectures i mentioned has every theory and questions required for both neet n jee aspirants. It feels like a live classroom. Teacher will tell about a topic and then questions relevant to that topic is solved after that. NCERT book is not enough for nomenclature, isomerism, mechanism and hydrocarbons chapters. Without mechanism you really can't solve questions. Rattafication only helps if compound asked in question is familiar with the compound you remembered. But even a slight change in it or introduction of isotopes may change answer. Earlier Allen's module had only questions in it's organic book. Everything else was taught ny teacher. From 2016 onwards book has everything written in it along with questions. NCERT books are only helpful if you know nomenclature, isomerism and mechanism properly. Some tips for physics and physical chemistry: Follow this sequenceAllen's module \u2192 ncert book \u2192 ncert exemplar \u2192 dc Pandey or/both hc verma objective question (physics)Allen's module \u2192 ncert book \u2192 o p Tandon examples and miscellaneous \u2192 ncert exemplar (physical chemistry)Always try to practice a derivation. Learning formulas won't help in boards and in neet bcz of stress. If you know the derivation it will only take a minute or two to get the formula, bit if you forgot formula, there would be no help.Mark questions which you feel is important. It helps im revision.For inorganic chemistry: Mostly people leaves inorganic chemistry (and chapters like morphology, anatomy, ecology) for last month preparation because these are boring. Try to read inorganic every sunday for 3 hours if it hasn't been started in coaching. If coaching begins with inorganic, keep revising it's concepts regularly. Revision is more important than remembering. Solve questions for practice. For organic chemistry: Mechanisms are very important. Organic is vast and varies at every step. Therr are exceptions, change of methods and what not but basic mechanisms remain same. Like you have to keep revising inorganic, you'll have to keep practicing reaction and its mechanism. Revision of nomenclature and isomerism is not required on weekly basis because it has it's application in reactions which keeps it's concepts afresh. ",

            "answer_text": "hello there..! Some tips for studying are: Divide your day into a timetable first of all. say you study 6 hours daily, divide these 6 hours into 5 sets of 1 hour each and remaining one hour as break time in between these 1 hour slots, now assign topics for practicing questions to these slots. You might not be able to complete these or even half of it but don't use time of any other topic for the previous one that's not completed, just leave it at once jitna bhi kiya hai and start the next one. this is definitely helpful to save time and make your day more productive.For physics specially, read the theory and formulas just once and don't use your one hour time just reading the same formulas everytime you study a particular topic. Instead set a goal ofpracticing questions .Try to read NCERT along with your regular classes and don't just leave it for the last time or for AIIMS preparation time. This is my personal experience that I was unable to read some physics chapters even once at the time of boards or entrance exam preparation.Make a formula list of each chapter and include just the formulas in it and not the whole notes thing and read these whenever you get time say before meals etc.You can also use a white board or the back of your room door to write formulas abd keep reading these and updating with the newer ones.Practice as many questions as you can because in the end only this is going to help you and try to get the correct answer in the very first timebecause this actually marks your progress in a particular chapter.hope it hepls.. all the best\u2026! :)) ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a complete strategy that will help you prepare in the right way - Best books for Physics are:   *Concepts of Physics by H.C. Verma Vol 1 & Vol.1  *Objective NCERT at your fingerprints for NEET by MTG  *Series of Feynman Lectures on Physics Mechanical properties of solids & fluids enjoyed the majority in NEET 2017 Physics. While semiconductors is expected to be a less popular topic in NEET, Laws of Motion, Alternating Current & Work Energy Power are the chapters that should be practised as much as possible. Mechanics is the most important topic. 12-13 questions were asked about it last time. Physics \u2013 Mechanics, Optics, Thermodynamics and Nuclear Physics I will suggest you cover topics from above-mentioned units first because of their high weightage in the question paper. Other than these, you can cover Semiconductors, Physical world and measurement, Electromagnetic waves and Alternating Current easily within less time. Also, don't think that just by learning the concepts you will be able to solve numerical problems in the exam without practising them because you will find a lot of numerical problems in the Physics section during the exam. Solve sample papers and mock tests, as this will help you manage your time during the exam. The aggressive competition that surrounds NEET may be quite overwhelming. A genuine need to succeed coupled with a positive attitude will help you face the challenge without feeling the nerves; only strong-willed and determined candidates are the ones who ultimately make the cut. So, be optimistic. So don't forget to solve numerical problems. If you won't try problems then there is no benefit of learning Physics for competitive entrance exams. Devote maximum time to practice and try to solve as many questions as you can. Physics is easy when you learn and understand concepts rather than cramming them. All the best! ",

And if time permits, practice IIT JEE Mains questions too.. No need to do any other book !! Practice previous year questions MANY TIMES.Become perfect in them.Solve other people\u2019s doubts. These will help you score better :). People run after so many modules and crap test series. Instead you should focus on limited material and do it more number of times !! Many questions ask only basic concepts but a good clarity in them. Self study is definitely most important.

I was taught JEE Chemistry by my three Gurus : Physical Chemistry by N Awasthi aka Sodium sirInorganic Chemistry by Vimal Kumar Jaiswal aka VKJ sirOrganic Chemistry by Mahendra Singh Chouhan aka MSC sirSo, it was quiet obvious that we were recommended to solve MCQs from their own Balaji Publication Book (It is recommended for JEE but I am sure they would come in handy even for NEET). To solve Chemistry NEET paper with high level of accuracy and speed, one needs to have a complete grasp and understanding of all the concepts. For the same, getting lectured with the best teaching style and with the best materials is a must. I was among the fortunate & lucky ones to be taught by these GODs of respective subjects who had a proven track records of making many IIT aspirants into IITians. You were very rarely find this combo or trio anywhere else. But the problem at hand, is many students won\u2019t get a chance to be taught by these teachers, thanks to the batch system followed in ALL the coaching institutes. I think all the willing and deserving students MUST get a chance to be taught with this style of teaching pattern. They ALL deserve this. To bridge the same problem, I and my friends decided to come up with HIITS Achieving App and Youtube channel which brings you numerous video lectures based on the same style and pattern of these TOP coaching faculties. You can leverage them by subscribing to the chapters in the App at affordable prices from the comfort of your homes.

That should be sufficient. Do buy a mcq book(Personally recommend NCERT At Your Fingertips or any coaching module) that consists of questions primarily from the NCERT textbook.

Also learn formulas and learn to solve quickly with great accuracy. For chemistry: Be thorough with NCERT. That's your basics. For inorganic and physical, its more than enough. For organic,try to understand and appreciate the way how questions are solved. Get some mcq books like Himanshu Pandey or MS Chouhan and solve them. If you have friends who are preparing for JEE, sit with them and solve questions in physics and organic chemistry in school. Also, I would suggest you to register Continue Reading",

Among physics and chemistry from my experience chemistry is very easy you would easily solve 40/45 questions of chemistry whereas for physics the questions take time to solve. Preparing for chemistry you should mainly focus on organic and biochemistry as most of the questions comes from these two sections. You have to prepare a time table for continuous revision of reactions and basic tricks as chemistry will increase your score in NEET. Preparing for physics you s Continue Reading",
