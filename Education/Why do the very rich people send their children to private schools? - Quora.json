            "answer_text": "All the same reasons everyone else wants to send the kids to private school, plus many more. It\u2019s well documented that high achieving private school provide a better product. The campuses are much nicer, the teachers are better, the students are high achievers. Students from private schools are far more likely to attend college, they attend better colleges; when they get there the coursework is somewhat easy compared to the private school. I went to an elite private prep school, then on to a public university. All throughout college when people asked where I went to high school they would act disappointed that I went to a public university. They\u2019d assume attending (and paying for) a private high school was a waste sense I ended up at a public university. Most people assume that sending your kid to a private school is all about having magical teachers that will make you smarter. This isn\u2019t the case. In fact in my experience, the actually coursework and instruction was mostly similar to a public school. There wasn\u2019t a lot of magic happening in the classroom. The benefit of the private school came entirely outside of the coursework. It was all about the culture. Private school, where it be a grade school, high school or university, do two things extremely well. They create a filterThey create a cultureThe school I attended mostly took the smartest kids, which the smartest parents, the most money and resources, grouped them together for four years, then graduated them. The school wasn\u2019t filled with a bunch of geniuses. But it didn\u2019t have any losers either. My graduating class had 302 students, 299 of which went on to a 4 year university, 1 become a professional baseball player, 1 a professional soccer player, and 1 went to Broadway to be an actor. If you would have polled everyone at graduation asking what they planned to do for a career, at least 50% would answer doctor/lawyer/finance. Obviously plans change, but at the time that was the culture I lived in. Most parents are willing to pay a lot of money to get their kids in this culture. It\u2019s the safe route. Parents are willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars to make sure their kids are around other kids similar to theirs. A lot of parenting is about setting expectations and standards for kids. You spend years teaching your kids that \u201cpeople like them do things like this\u201d. People like them means smart, happy, successful people. Things like this means getting good grades, being nice, successful, etc. Private schools teach kids to do all the things that parents want. ",
