            "answer_text": "In a startup, no amount of growth could be enough and you always want more and more. But still, we are doing reasonably well :) Given that we are trying to create a new category altogether, the path is challenging for sure. Awareness regarding online tutoring is low and those who are aware, are at first skeptical about the efficacy of online learning for their children. People take education in India very seriously and always think twice before trying something new. But parents who have tried out Vedantu will have a very different story to tell. They have witnessed the effectiveness of online learning (which is superior to offline in many ways). They have seen the quality of our teachers (less than 1% selection ratio for teachers) and have also seen significant learning improvement of their children. It is a certainty that online tutoring will be the future of education in India, it is only a question of how soon. I personally think we will see a radical shift in 2 years time. We at Vedantu hope to be spearheading this revolution in Indian education system. ",
