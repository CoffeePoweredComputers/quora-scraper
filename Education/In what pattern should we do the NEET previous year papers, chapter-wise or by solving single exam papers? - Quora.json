            "answer_text": "Solving the questions chapter - wise is the best way to approach previous year question papers. It has several benefits like :- Once you complete a chapter there needs to be a reality check whether your preparation is going on the right track or not. Solving last year questions immediately after a chapter completion gives you a sense of satisfaction that you're done with this chapter.It ensures that you don't have any pending work because if you will wait for syllabus completion to solve previous year questions it will always be there in the back of your head , bothering you in tough times.Even if you are unable to solve some questions, you can quickly go back and revise those topics. Since you have just studied that chapter,it will be easier for you to solve them.But if the same happens after syllabus completion then this inability to solve questions is intense enough to demotivate you and let you doubt yourself. And this should never happen. So the best way is to keep on solving them along with chapters that are being studied. After you are done with completing whole syllabus you can take the previous year question papers (but this time not chapter-wise but the whole paper)and try to solve them in a span of three-hours in exam like environment. Since you are acquainted with these questions so it will be easier for you to solve those questions which will eventually boost your confidence. ",
