            "answer_text": "Study Apple, Disney, Coca Cola. All 3 have captured a piece of the consumer's imagination. Like seriously what other consumer electronics company can boast of having people stick their logo on the back windshield of their cars?? None. Apple started off as the 'rebel' in the computer industry and has become the epitome of simplicity and elegance. The ads do a great job of creating this vision. It started with an FU attitude, as a company for creative types as compared to IBM types. Watch the 1984 apple- dissing IBM ad. I think it's considered one of the greatest ads of all time. ",
