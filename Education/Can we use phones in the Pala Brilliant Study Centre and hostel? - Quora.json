            "answer_text": "You are allowed to bring a mobile phone ( only basephones without camera, no smartphones ) if you are staying at a hostel, but you have to handover the phone to the respective warden within a week. I was a JEE mains repeater and was staying at St.Mary\u2019s hostel run by Brilliant. Things are quiet strict at brilliant hostels than the other ones .We had lady teachers as warden and were getting phone thrice in a week for exactly 30 minutes. Also mobile phones are strictly prohibited in the campus.Anyway landphones are available at the campus for making calls if necessary. If you are staying in a privately managed hostel or as a paying guest.. ,then u will be having limited restrictions..free to use mobile phones at anytime and there is a lot of chances to get distracted from studies. So I always prefer brilliant hostels ..try to get into a best one and concentrate on study.. Upvote if you think my content is helpful.. ",

But in my hostel (PRIVATE), we can use phone for 1 hour and that too everyday !!! Our hostel is also not strict about phone usage, that sometimes we do not even give phone tray to them. and they too will not ask about it. However it is not the same case for every private hostels.
