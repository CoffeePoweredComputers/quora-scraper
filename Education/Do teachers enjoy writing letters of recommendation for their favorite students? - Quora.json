            "answer_text": "I was a teacher for many years (I am now 75 years old and long retired) and I remember vividly an interesting and moving situation when I was a high school teacher and was able to \u201crescue\u201d (for lack of a better word) a very troubled and deserving student. Please forgive a very old man reminiscing a bit about my \u201cgood old days.\u201d I have taught everything through preschool through ten years at the University of Oregon, all in Oregon and Washington. To begin with, after spending most of my youth in Los Angeles and Orange County, California, I attended six high schools in three states because my father was trying to blow up the world. It sounds like a joke, but was not really. Go back to the worst days of the \u201ccold war\u201d with Stalin in charge of the USSR and Kennedy still the USA President. Although it sounds kind of preposterous and histrionic, my father was one of the many people who invented modern computers and the earliest versions of the Internet (quite a while before the WWW) in the 1950s. In the days before the earliest programming languages, my father programmed in machine language running punch cards through the earliest compilers and coming home with his clothes covered with chard, in part because he was cheating on my mom with an early female programmer. Anyway, my father\u2019s story was kind of a real life counterpart to DOCTOR STRANGELOVE which in fact based on real people and real events. It actually was probably as close to World War III as the world ever came, though today with people like Trump, Pence, Putin, Kim, etc. we seem to be creeping closer to committing species suicide than even those dark days. Anyway, my mind wanders. If you have the patience to stay with me, this is actually a heartwarming and encouraging story, something we all need once in a while. This was in the 1960s. My wife and I had been married for about five years. My wife had been born in Santa Monica, CA into a \u201cHollywood\u201d family, a term and an experience she despises so don\u2019t tell her I said this or she will kill me despite 53 years of faithful and exclusive marriage. My wife\u2019s father had been one of the \u201cLittle Rascals,\u201d also known as \u201cOur Gang.\u201d Some of them became famous for various reasons. Not my wife\u2019s father and his older sister; they had about 15 seconds of screen time when the studio needed more little bodies to fill the screen. Her father worked for the studios all his life, growing up to be a \u201cBig Rascal\u201d with five marriages and more affairs than you can count. OK, if you are still with me, I will get to the heartwarming story. In the 1960s, I was teaching at the second most dangerous high school in Seattle at the time. If anyone reading this remembers Seattle in those days, they had very few black skinned people, and most were congregated in a \u201cghetto\u201d called the the Central Area. As my ancestors were all Eastern European Jews from places such as Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Poland, Latvia and so on, ghetto has a slightly different connotation to me because of charming people such as Hitler and Stalin. Anyway, I was teaching at Rainier Beach which was the most diverse school in Washington at the time (and may still be, though I have not been back for many years. In those days, diverse was not the cool thing many people think today. It mostly meant your skin color is different, you religion is different (in my case I became an atheist at the age of 10 after reading the Bible and childishly saying SURE SOUNDS LIKE A FAIRY TALE TO ME \u2014which gets some silly people asking: HOW CAN A JEW BE AN ATHEIST\u2014which makes me wonder\u2014HOW CAN THE JEWS BE ANYTHING ELSE? Anyway, my wife and I lived right behind Rainier Beach with our ten year old daughter and every face on the street except ours was black or brown. Even though Rainier beach was a dangerous community, one gets used to anything once one becomes familiar with it. And actually, it\u2019s quite possible the we \u201cwhite people\u201d scared the \u201ccolored people\u201d more than they scared us. Anyway, nothing happened on our street in the two years we lived there. Students came and went all the time at Rainier Beach. People got married, got divorced, had babies with or without marriage, went to jail, got our of jail, hid from the cops, and so on. One gets used to anything, as long as one stays alive and out of prison. One day, a strange and unfamiliar white girl with a bit of a Southern twang showed up in class. She was very quiet and sat by herself. She was obviously depressed and uncommunicative. At that time I was young and stupid. Now I am old, even stupider and fairly senile.The girl was named Janet. We were told to be counselors as well as teachers, a job I adopted with stupid enthusiasm. I will have to come back and finish this story if I don\u2019t drop dead or forget what I was saying. It\u2019s dinner time. OK, I am back. I tried to talk with Janet in my class, which was an English class, but it was difficult and she was obviously very depressed. Somehow, I had a gut feeling that she was a lot more capable than she was revealing. Every once in a while an intelligent and perceptive comment would break through her gloom, like a sudden beam of light shining through the (usually) gloomy Seattle skies. After school most of the students left in school in their groups of friends and/or gangs (Rainier Beach was that kind of school) but Janet always walked home alone, looking kind of frightened and wary. The class was the last one of the day, so after she had been in class a few months, I asked her if she minded if I walked home with her, just to make sure she would be safe. Rather to my surprise, she agreed and said that having grown up in a very rural, small town in West Virginia, a \u201cbig city\u201d filled with strangers made her very nervous. As we walked, she began to relax and open up a bit. I actually walked her home for several weeks, and gradually learned her sad story. Her father was in the US Army, and frequently deployed for six months at a time. Janet was very close to her mother, and felt much more comfortable in her West Virginia \u201chillbilly\u201d one room schoolhouse. She had done well in her small school, such as it was. Unfortunately, her mother had become ill with cancer, and with her father away overseas somewhere, it had fallen on Janet to take care of her mother, who died only a couple of months after being diagnosed with cancer. Janet\u2019s father, as soon as he learned of his wife\u2019s death, got an emergency leave and had flown home. Although Janet had no grudge against her father, he was almost a stranger to her, and he felt there was no way he could take care of her and fulfill her military duties, which were basically his life. After some awkward moments after the funeral he said to Janet, There is no way I can be a proper father to you and take care of you. I have a sister who lives in Seattle with her husband, and I am going to ask them to adopt you and take care of you until you are an adult and can take care of yourself. Janet, still grief stricken, had no idea what to say. Her father bought her a ticket to Seattle, put her on an airplane and left left for his overseas duty. When sat and sobbed in her seat on the flight all across the country. When she arrived at Sea-Tac she stood confused and terrified and bewildered after deboarding. Finally a couple of brusque people with German accents located her and stared at her. Finally, the woman said curtly You must be Janet. Just like my brother to dump you on us and expect us to raise you and care for you like you are on of our own kids. The man was no friendlier. He snarled something along the lines of Just like your father to marry some stupid woman who would get herself sick and die. As you can see, this was hardly what a grief stricken young lady from West Virginia needed to hear. Before coming to Seattle, she had never been in a city, and had never met a person who was any color than white. I said to her Janet, life has dealt you a very bad hand. But even as little as I know you, I can tell that you are very intelligent and actually very strong to survive this as well as you have. You are a senior now and I will get some help from other students (nice ones, and there are some at Rainier Beach) and if you settle down you can graduate, and you are actually college material in my opinion. She began to sob. I hate this place. I hate Seattle! I hate all these loud, noisy, push kids! And I\u2019ve ruined my chances of getting into college, and I certainly would not want to go to college here! I said, I do not things are quite as bad as you might think. Washington is a large state, and Eastern Washington is not exactly like West Virginia, but a lot closer than you might think. Obviously, you are not going to get into Harvard, or Stanford, but there are lots of good public colleges like Eastern Washington state college. You father cares for you in his own rough way, and he will support you. If you settle down and work, you can still graduate, and I will write a letter to the admissions office at Eastern State college and similar schools explaining your circumstances. I have every confidence that you will land on your feet and do well. The last month before graduation, Janet came to me with tears in her eyes. Tears of happiness.She threw her arms around me and hugged me, which was not exactly appropriate for high school students to do with their adult male teachers. I was admitted to Eastern Washington State College. Your letter did it! I have a complete scholarship and a dorm room and a work-study job for living expenses. So that\u2019s the story. The thing about being a high school teacher is you seldom know what happens to our former students. I don\u2019t expect to hear from Janet, but you never know. I am kind of a gloomy person, but I will imagine this story turned out well. ",

Especially when given the vast variety of people they can ask, it is an honor to be one of those people who are asked. It also means that they most likely also enjoy my lectures and class. Good students usually do well in many classes and have many options. Also, consider that once in the past, you were also in their shoes. You were also a student who hopefully \u2018stuck out\u2019 enough, in spite of doing well in class, who needed instructor recommendations for an internship or job opportunity I consider this a form of \u2018since they did this for you, you will do this for that student\u2019. I once had a summer session and I was teaching Calculus III. I had one student who was a part-time enrolled high school student who had just finished his junior year. He was amazing. He could see the ends of my few proofs coming far down the road, he could nail down the Calc 1 and 2 material without a problem as well. I remember once during vector Calculus, I believe I was using Green\u2019s Theorem on an example and I had to represent part of its straight boundary using a secant function. It made me stop and think for a moment, he raised his hand and suggested and Soh-cah-toa like equivalency and it worked like a charm. He saw it faster than I did. He was brilliant at age 16 and better than kids who were 19\u201320. When I asked him which school he was applying to he was like \u201cOh, you know, Princeton, MIT, Yale (i.e. next door), Harvey Mudd, they keep suggesting Cal Tech but that\u2019s so far away\u2026\u201d ",

For the kids who express to me early that they are shooting for a competitive school, I start doing what I can to help them hit their goal - things like helping prep students for SAT/ACT, writing college essays, encouraging them to join Key Club (I'm the sponsor) and run for positions etc. Not only do these things look good for an academic resume, they give me opportunities to see how a kid performs in settings outside of the classroom. I got this job because I wanted to mentor and help kids like my teachers did for me, and there are few things more satisfying than a kid running to your room with a Yale or Columbia acceptance letter in hand. For the kids reading this, the hardest letters for me to write are for the kids who perform well in my class but don't make an effort to reach to me outside of class. Writing about your academic merit is great, but a rec letter is really strong if I can say something about your leadership capability on your sports team, dance troupe, service club, etc. Invite your teachers to your games or competitions or whatever so they can see how passionate you are. The worst that'll happen is they say that they're busy. But at best, it could be a ticket to a top tier university. ",

            "answer_text": "I almost always felt honored when any student asked me to write a letter of recommendation. When one particular student who had some offbeat habits handed me the forms and asked me to fill them out to recommend him to a college, I said that I\u2019d do it but that I would be honest. He immediately grabbed the papers out of my hand and left. The next day he came back with those papers, handed them to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the best I could do.\u201d I wrote an honest recommendation, and he was accepted by the college. He was a strange kid with a lot of potential. I\u2019ve had a lot of \u201cfavorite\u201d students. There are good things about almost every teenager. OTOH, I didn\u2019t necessarily enjoy writing recommendations. They take time, and there\u2019s a degree of stress in knowing that teacher recommendations could fail to help or might even hurt a promising student. It is not a trivial matter to write a good and honest letter of recommendation. Thus, I was honored to be asked but didn\u2019t necessarily enjoy writing the letters. I did take pride in my ability to write a good letter of recommendation, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing as enjoying the process. ",

It\u2019s not particularly fun and it doesn\u2019t provide one with a feeling of accomplishment. It is nice to be asked to write a letter of recommendation. I enjoy knowing that a student feels that my support or opinion matters. It\u2019s nice that they care. But composing a letter of recommendation, whether original or a cut and paste job, is just a time consuming task that only provides value and utility for the individual student. I accept that it\u2019s part of the job though. ",

That part is not enjoyable, no matter what the topic. It is well worth it for a good student (or a good officer, in my line of work the two frequently overlap), but that does not mean the actual writing process is enjoyable because what one school may find good another may not in the text\u2026and with some schools I even worry that just the official letterhead or having a military and academic signature block may to some academics degrade the recommendation for an otherwise imminently qualified student\u2014in certain schools that could be viewed as a negative. So, those can be some of my worries in the actual writing process\u2026but ultimately I am honored to be asked and for a good student I am more than willing to take the time to write a good letter. Ps: Recommendations I write are typically for graduate school or postgraduate jobs, not undergraduate admissions, so I should clarify that. ",

The least enjoyable is when the student needs a recommendation in the next few days, as opposed to giving the teacher a couple weeks before the due date. That just makes teachers grouchy. ",

I change a few sentences to personalize it for the student, then send it on its way. My biggest problem is that the students tend to ask me to write on the day that they need it, so I have to drop everything to do it. They\u2019re annoying. ",

            "answer_text": "At least I love writing them (I am not sure if everyone does), but only in the following scenarios: Student rated very highly in my class, (at the very least an A grade, and hopefully in top 3\u20134 students that semester).I get enough notice to do that, not a couple of days but a couple of weeks. Many many students are very good in this aspect and send me an email months before they are applying.As everyone probably knows, the recommender typically writes about their own experience with the student, so unless the student ranked very highly in their class, it is not easy for the recommender to write a convincing letter.

I can\u2019t even imagine why colleges ask for them since they must all be the same. I ask students for a list of accomplishments, clubs, sports,charitable activities or anything worthwhile. I then regurgitate that and say how much the university will be better if they accept the student. I teach mostly sophomores and juniors so I only write about 2 or 3 a year. I know some teachers who write about 30. One I know has had to set a limit and tells kids at the beginning of the year that they only write 20 per year. Knowing the student values you is cool, until you find out they asked all their teachers and you are not that special. ",

I am always truthful, factual and NEVER write a negative reference, not only because it would be mean to do so (and risk potential libel action!) but also because in the UK a reference is usually only asked for after the student has been offered the position.I hope this helps.Ali ",
