            "answer_text": "Is it hard to learn how to pay your taxes? Couple of variables in the answer to this question. Where do you live? Depending on the Country, State, and locality you live in has a major impact on your taxes and their complexity. What is your tax situation? Do you just have a W2 job (US). Do you have investments? Do you have a business? Do you employ others? Dependents? School? Real Estate? Foreign Bank Accounts, Crypto Currency transactions, On and on and on. The more variables and complexities the more education and experience it takes to do your taxes. Do you want to legally minimize your taxes? If you don\u2019t have lots of experience and knowledge you may not know enough to take advantage of all the tax reduction strategies legally available to you. In addition the laws (in the US) change all the time and what you knew last year or the year before may be worthless today. In the US there is a licensed individual called an Enrolled Agent. These people are trained and approved to practice tax preparation and our subject to IRS Circular 230 oversight. The following is from the IRS website about them. \u201cAn enrolled agent is a person who has earned the privilege of representing taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service by either passing a three-part comprehensive IRS test covering individual and business tax returns, or through experience as a former IRS employee. Enrolled agent status is the highest credential the IRS awards. Individuals who obtain this elite status must adhere to ethical standards and complete 72 hours of continuing education courses every three years.\u201d It is not easy to become one or a CPA. EA and CPA spend thousands of hours training and many hours every year keeping up to do one area of taxation. Few try to do all types of taxes as it is overwhelming. See point two above. Sorry I can\u2019t give you an easy answer but there is not one to this question. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s going to depend where you are. In the UK, it\u2019s pretty easy. The only taxes you have to think about in Income tax and National insurance. VAT is totally automatic (unless you operate a business), Council Tax is a really simple fixed payment. Most people who are employed do not even have to complete any form of tax return at all - employers do it all for you. If you have other income, you have to complete an income tax return. You do it all online, and most of the figures are really self explanatory. If you have a business you put in figures for sales and costs, which you need anyway. If you have shares, you enter dividends and capital gains (which your broker probably supplies) It does all the calculations for you. Where it gets hard is where you are using some of the more complex allowances to reduce tax, have things like overseas income where some tax has been paid at source. The hardest part then is understanding if you actually qualify, and at that point it might be worth paying an accountant for a day to help. National insurance is easier - for most people it\u2019s automatically deducted from pay. If you are self employed, they will give you an amount to pay every quarter. Other countries will be easier or harder, depending on tax laws ",
