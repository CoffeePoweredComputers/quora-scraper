            "answer_text": "What's it like being in jail? If you have ever accompanied someone to an office party where you did not work, or found yourself around the redneck side of your significant other\u2019s family you will get a slight feel for the social nature of it. These are people you do not want to piss off, out-think, or make feel threatened or feel foolish in any way. In the mentioned parallels it is because these people are important to someone you dont want to have to get friction over your actions. In jail it is due to self preservation. You don a mask that is bland and non-offensive by never really offering up a perspective of controversy, and by putting a few feet of foam rubber between who you are and what you display. It is an unhealthy but necessary practice so that you dont accidentally offend someone who has nothing better to pass the time with than hating you. That is the most painful part of the average ordeal- the suppression of self and the adopting of a persona which is comfortable living amid criminals. If you had little proclivity to criminal behavior prior to going in, you certainly dont have less coming out. The routine is relentless and inescapable. Chow times are always a specific time regardless of rain shine or sickness and the food is really bad but with time becomes a normal to which you will start to measure things against. The soupy attempt at beans is better today than it was exactly 7 days ago when it was last served. In the space between meals- meals being the way one notes the passing of time- there is nothing to do. So much nothing to do that you will find yourself looking forward to the pushups you will do after lunch despite always hating pushups your entire life. You will find yourself enjoying watching spanish tv (if you have a tv in your cell block that is) even though you dont speak spanish. Why? It passes time. The body odor is omnipresent and thick. You are always being seen and always hearing the loud conversations of others. Always. Every single moment. Let me restate that: NEVER SILENT NEVER UNOBSERVED EVER. The only place I have ever been offered crack was in county jail, so there is no attempt at rehabilitation do not be confused on this point. Jail is about revenge for breaking a rule and it has created institutions around it that are parasitic and will attempt to keep the jailed, regardless of their debt, serving time. They do this by damaging the identity of the individual incarcerated long term, and then further by branding them with a scarlet letter X once out of jail that will reduce their chances of finding work in an already glutted with competition workforce. Jail is about the degredation of human development and growth in exchange for a criminal networking center with a dual purpose as a revenge based storage facility and that feeling is no more clear than when one is inside.

            "answer_text": "Ok lets say your first arrested and you go to the county jail and your facing charges and denied bail and have to go into the jail either genral or a secruity. You are first like veryone brought through booking were you are placed in waist restraints at least where I was. You are then examined by medical and other people to examine your healt and what secruity you might be in. You are then finger printed and your mugshot is taken, even if you already have them. Nost liky after this they take you to be strip searched hand you jail cloths and you go to your secruity, for some reason I was always the highest secruity so I got to wear depending on the jail red and sometimes white. I think I wore black and white strips once, and then red 7 or 8 times, and then blue onnce, and Green twice. you are then teansported to your wing or cell unit, most of the time you are in restraints. While you are in jail you still have to go to trial, my bail trial was always over a computer tv screen thing. I was moved into the room in restraints and left in restraints and then brought to my cell and take out of restraints. For the main trial I had to go to the county or federal court. Their the transported us in vans by sex or they had a bus with two parts. You were required to be restrained in court so here was the line up. Ankle restraints, belly chains, and then box cuffs for maximum. Then a chain was linked to are right arm and connect to the prisoner behind and infront so we travelled in threes,then a another chain went on you left arm to connect you to the same people. While in jail I was on 22 hour lock down and other was spend in a exercise cage. While moving form cell to cage I was in leg irons handcuffs behind my back and occasionally waste chains. Your privacy in jail is terrible, the showers have no covers or walls, the toilets are easily seen form the door, and you are only given one tampon for the month and two role of toilet paper. ",
