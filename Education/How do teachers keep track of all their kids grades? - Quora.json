            "answer_text": "Most Estonian schools use online systems for this. Two of these are called Ekool (literally e-school) and Stuudium. What does it look like? You have the same number and letter combination as the class (year nine would be 9, and if there are two year nines, then one would be 9A and the other 9B). If you click on that, the class list will open, you will see the students, all the previous lessons (date, homework, lesson description) as well as tests. You can set the date for the test and the system will not let you add a test if somebody else already has (it\u2019s law: you can only have one big test per day; doesn\u2019t apply to quizzes). In fact, it looks very similar to an MS Excel sheet. You also receive a day planner from the school (with the school logo, no less) which has pages with allocated spaces for kids\u2019 names and slots for grades. Here\u2019s a picture of the math class I taught this year:  As you can see, there\u2019s the class symbol - year and letter. On top, I\u2019ve marked the dates, so there\u2019s a neat correspondence between grades and dates, as well as marking what was done in class - just in case I forget once I get home. Ekool and Stuudium look very similar to this. Don\u2019t be fooled, I don\u2019t keep their grades in my head. I\u2019m fairly certain most schools either use online systems analogous to the two I mentioned or use pen on paper methods. ",

            "answer_text": "I use a online grading system called Engrade for this purpose. After I finish grading work, I type the actual final grade into the online system and it is calculated accordingly. I mark pop quizzes this way too. Even better, it is free and I can track attendance as well. I even have the option to make class lists and encourage pupils to monitor progress. When I am at home, I simply open it up on my laptop along with a spreadsheet and spend about 1\u20132 hours simply marking work. It makes my life a lot easier. I do not have to waste time or money on unnecessary note books or pens either. Back in the day, you had to write down grades on a piece of paper or use a formalized ledger book to record grades. ",

To keep track of work that had been assigned but not handed in yet, I used a checkoff sheet on a clipboard. ",

It\u2019s the same with exams. That is, an exam that is poorly designed can take hours to grade, but this was not your question. It is best for everyone if the assignments are planned and organized. I am in email contact with all of my students. Assignments are made via email, announced in class, and turned in via email. I have used this system for years and it works. No assignments are ever lost by anyone. Being organized upfront is always the best. ",

It\u2019s the same principle. We enter the grades every time we assess student work. The nice thing is the electronic grade book offers many options for weighting the difference pieces of work and it calculates the averages automatically. ",
