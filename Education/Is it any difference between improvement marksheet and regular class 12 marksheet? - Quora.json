            "answer_text": "Ofcourse it matters, the original one and the again given one, there's a difference. Let me explain with an example. Suppose you have to buy a nike shoes, in market there's the original nike shoes which comes with a lots of money and there's its 1st copy which is a lot cheaper. Exactly alike the regular 12th marksheet which comes with hardwork,persistance, faith, and optimism has a different look than the improvement. However, only star is added infront of the subject the improvement is given else the marksheet is same but that star means a lot. To the one seeing your marksheet and to you as well star gives a bad impression. But let me tell you some sheet of paper with marks on it doesn't define your future and it doesn't define your talent. Never give up keep on improving!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Actually yes, there is little difference between improvement marksheet and regular marksheet, improvement marksheet shows that you didn't score good in your previous exam that's why you give the improvement exam whereas regular marksheet shows whatever you scored in exam. But today's time they doesn't make bad impression on where you will go for admission or for other thing. There are many students in my college that had compartment in few subject even they got admission so don't be afraid actually it's good for you that improvement exam makes your %age good in comparison to previous one if and only if you gave your best in improvement exam. Thank you!",
