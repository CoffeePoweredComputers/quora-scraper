            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to answer without more details. You mention a \u201c0\u201d on \u201csomething.\u201d Was the something a test? An essay? A project? A presentation? In the next sentence, you say, \u201cI did all the assignments\u201d (plural). Was the zero on one single thing? Or was it several zeros on a bunch of assignments? Note that if you did \u201call the assignments,\u201d that doesn\u2019t necessarily matter. You could still get a zero on one assignment even if you did nine other ones in the same class, as each assignment might have its own grade, and some assignments will be worth more than others. (For instance, if you have a zero on one big assignment that\u2019s worth 40% of your grade, and you have a \u201cB\u201d average on six other assignments that are each only worth 10% of your grade, you would still flunk the class.) Did the teacher give a rationale for the zero? For instance,\u2026 (1) Was it not submitted on time? If you did it all perfectly, but turned it in after the due date, it doesn\u2019t count. It will be a zero. (2) Did the teacher have reason to suspect your work was plagiarized? If so, it might be \u201cperfect\u201d but still be assigned a zero. (3) Did the teacher have reason to think you might have cheated on part of it? Then again, it might be \u201cperfect,\u201d but still assigned a zero. (4) Even if your answers are perfectly accurate in themselves, did you fail to fulfill all the requirements of the directions? A student might produce a wonderful or flawless study on economic effects of autism on poor families, but if the assigned topic was to do a study on business law regarding the rights of autistic workers in poor families, it will be assigned a zero. (5) Did your work fail to meet the minimum length requirement? If the assignment was 8\u201310 pages long, and you turned in 6\u20137 pages, it might be a zero. (6) Is your work written below the proficiency of a college-level paper? You can have one one or two typos, three or four grammar errors, and some passive voice and still get a passing grade of \u201cC,\u201d but if you have typos on every page, grammatical errors left and right, and poor transitions/stylistic problems in every paragraph, the teacher may not consider it college-level work. Now IF (big IF), you answered \u201cno\u201d to all the above questions, there may indeed be a problem. Ask your teacher to explain the grade\u2014find out the rationale. If his response to any of the six questions above is \u201cyes,\u201d you may not have a leg to stand on. However, if the teacher says, \u201cI gave you an \u2018F\u2019 because I don\u2019t like you\u201d or \u201cI gave you an \u2018F\u2019 because I thought it would be funny,\u201d or some other patently unjust reason, the normal procedure is to appeal the grade to the Department Chair. Mind you, this is normally done at the end of the term after final grades are submitted. (At least that\u2019s the policy at many schools). Make copies or scans of the work, and present it to the Department Chair after setting up a meeting early in the Spring Term. The Department Chair can review the work himself, or the policy at the school may be that he consults with 2\u20133 other teachers in the field to assess the work, examining it in the context of the assignment directions and course policies. If he thinks you have a point, he can override the instructor\u2019s grade. If he thinks the instructor\u2019s assessment is fair, he can keep it. In the latter case, you can usually appeal one more level up in the hierarchy to the Dean of the program. The same process happens there. If the Dean also rejects your appeal, that\u2019s usually the end of the road. Some desperate students try suing a school if the appeal process runs out, but that hardly ever works, as the legal system generally recognizes and defers to the expertise of school officials to assess student work.

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re in doubt, take your assignment to your teacher\u2019s Head of Department: it\u2019s their job to oversee your teacher and make sure they\u2019re acting with full professionalism, as well as to check that all students are making the appropriate levels of progress, and keep the department\u2019s grades on track. If your teacher flunked your assignment, you can ask for it to be re-assessed by another teacher, going through the Head of Department, or through a Deputy/Assistant Head. I\u2019d advise asking your parents to make the request: teachers are more likely to accept a request made by a parent than by a student. That observed, you could just ask your teacher why they\u2019ve graded you down so heavily. It sounds like they\u2019re being a little on the harsh side there, and you need to get to the bottom of the reasons for that. Start there, and if you get no results, then talk to your parents and ask them to intervene with the school. Good luck! ",
