            "answer_text": "The 85-inch screen is a larger version of Samsung's Flip 2 digital whiteboard. It's intended to be used by students and teachers in the same room. The screen has two HDMI ports and can hold up to 20 fingers. It costs $2,599, which is less than the Flip 2's $1,999.99 price tag, but not much more than a new TV would cost. It will go on sale later this year. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know what Samsung thinks. But I don't think that screen has any features that make it more suitable in this covid19 periode we are in now. I see more questions for remote learning over internet where teachers use conferencing software like Teams to teach their students while they stay at home. For that devices like usb camera's and microphones are needed, not a big interactive screen. ",
