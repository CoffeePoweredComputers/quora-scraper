            "answer_text": "No one answer can really be meaningful, because the two represent quite different approaches to problems. C# is a somewhat smaller language with an immensely larger library. Learning the language itself is relatively quick and easy, but that's only a small fraction of what it takes to learn how to actually program with it well at all. Much of learning to use C# well at all is really learning .NET. Basically, .NET is the standard library you use with C# (and VB.NET Shop, etc.) While it is well organized, much of this is about simply memorizing huge quantities of information. C++ is a larger (but contrary to popular belief, not drastically larger) language with a much smaller library. The library is also factored somewhat more orthogonally, so most use involves much less memorization, and much more application of rules. Yes, much like in English almost all the rules have at least a few exceptions, and there are even exceptions to the exceptions. Most of the exceptions, however, are corner cases that rarely arise in real programming. Another part of the difference is that C# is much more about tooling. Many people writing C++ still use things like Vi and emacs, often with little or nothing to specialize them for writing that particular language. This puts a great deal of pressure on the language to provide the features necessary so that most refactoring can be (and in well-written code is) restricted to a few small parts of the code. Nearly everybody I know of who uses C# writes it in Visual Studio--and most use at least one (and often several) add-ons to VS as well (if you haven't used it, ReSharper is particularly recommended). Yet another huge difference is in memory management. C++ (rather famously/notoriously) uses \"manual\" memory management, while C# is \"managed\" (i.e., it uses a garbage collector). At least in my experience, this portrayal is close to the opposite of reality. When I'm writing C++, I almost never think about managing memory *or other resources* at all. When I'm writing C# (or Java) managing memory is a little more work than in C++, and managing other resources is comparatively painful. This aspect is also frequently overblown as well though: although C++ (more specifically, RAII) does make resource management easier in general, the difference isn't really enough to make a large difference between the two overall.  At least in my opinion, the vast majority of comparisons between the two vary between slightly and horribly misleading. To a C++ programmer who's accustomed to breaking functionality into tiny pieces and using things like template template parameters to put together a complete algorithm out of tiny pieces, C# looks like a blunt instrument at best (and C# generics particularly so).  Conversely, to a C# programmer who's accustomed to having a choice between half a dozen different tools to carry out any of a few hundred different refactorings, writing C++ generally seems like an extremely manual process, with tools running the ragged edge between primitive and downright unusable. Each tends to hold quite a dim view of the other. It takes considerably time and effort to separate the tools themselves from one's own mindset enough to compare the two objectively at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Both C# and C++ are powerful languages. But there is a slight difference in their learning strategies. Generally, C++ is the first or the second language that a programmer learns. Add as a result it is obviously a bit harder to him, compared to any other languages he may learn later. And C++ is a language that has been derived from C. And it remains most of the features of C. As a result, the language contains a lot of functions that are not really useful for the general mass. And some of its functionality is more complex compared to C#. C# is not a direct dependent of C++. It is more of a hybrid of Java and C++. But it is actually not as complex as either. In fact, it is easier compared to the other two. It is a lot more flexible compared to Java. It doesn\u2019t support pointer to the full extent. As a result, C# programmers don\u2019t need to learn the secure application of pointers. It is a lot more high level compared to C++. It has a much more descriptive system of passing variables, although the traditional method can also be applied, the language also supports data structures such as list, something not present on C++. A list is essentially a dynamic array. And as a result, one doesn\u2019t need to write a complex code only to make the program dynamic. The language has a huge arsenal of libraries that come in handy in many real-life situations. These libraries often have to be manually coded. The language also has a larger range of frameworks for real-life applications. The language also gets rid of redundant functions, that is, different functions with similar outputs. C# can also be used to make functions that work on the generic datatype. A generic data function is such that, a single function can take any type of data as a parameter. This type of functionality would require function overriding in case of C++. All these should prove that C# is easier than C++. It is however not easy. It is a very powerful language, and its proper implementation must be learned. To that account, I suggest you learn C# from a specialized training academy such as \u201cHolberton School \u201c, that would teach you the desired skill on C# and how to implement it in practical life.
