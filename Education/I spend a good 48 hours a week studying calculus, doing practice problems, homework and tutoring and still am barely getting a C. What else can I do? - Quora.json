            "answer_text": "If you are studying that much and still not succeeding, then the problem lies in HOW you are studying since you obviously have the drive and commitment to succeed. 20 years ago in my first semester in engineering school things were pretty tough for me. The level and pace of the classes was much higher than I experienced in high school. Additionally, I was no longer among the top students academically; I was surrounded by other students who were all at the top of their classes. It took me into my second semester, but I finally got on track and things started to go really well. In fact, I ended up going for my masters degree in mechanical engineering when I completed my undergraduate degree. The most important thing is to work SMARTER and not HARDER. No engineering degree is going to be easy, but there are certainly ways that you can work smarter and do better in the long run. Here are my three basic tips for studying effectively: Regardless of whether you have homework or not, spend 20-30 minutes EVERY DAY working through some problems. Math, in particular, is a subject that is best attained through practice and repetition.Take advantage of the professor\u2019s office hours to get one on one explanations. Bring the problems that you have worked through or some problems from the lecture and have him explain any details that you found confusing.Create a study group. Get a group of 3-4 of your classmates together on a regular basis to study for this class. This will avail yourself of others to answer your questions. Additionally, in areas where you help them, you will gain a better understanding when you have to break it down to explain it to someone else. Having a study group will give you some added motivation to work harder since nobody wants to come to a study session and be ill prepared.Keep focused on the end goal and you will get through this.

            "answer_text": "Clearly, something is not sticking, you have to understand all the details in every area that you\u2019re studying. What I typically do is read the entire section of the textbook that I\u2019m working with word for word and I mean every last word and re-work all the example problems in the section and then I\u2019ll try working exercise problems at the end of the section, and then look at the solutions manual after I\u2019ve worked it out and see if I\u2019m on the right rack and that typically does the trick for me. If I\u2019m still not getting it I try to figure out why I\u2019m not understanding cause I should be able to understand it and do it, I have to be missing something conceptually. You need to figure out why you\u2019re doing something wrong and then fix it, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll do better. ",
