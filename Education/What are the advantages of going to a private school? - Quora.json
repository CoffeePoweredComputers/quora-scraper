            "answer_text": "Teachers in private and public schools are dedicated and professional. I don\u2019t think private teachers are more dedicated and professional than public school teachers. Of course, I am speaking of the many teachers in the profession, and of course there would be the few that are not dedicated or professional but they are rare. In my experience, teachers do not teach for the pay\u2026 so it must be dedication and the love of making children see their worth in so many ways. Now to answer the question, the advantage of going to a private school vs a public school, would be the class sizes. Simply that in the public system, children cannot be turned away from a school, every child deserves an education. In private schools, this will vary, from some schools excluding children for stupid reasons. So therefore, it is not that teachers are more compassionate or dedicated or professional in private schools, it is just that, they do not have the challenge of big classes with varying academic levels of students nor do they have behaviour or special needs students in classes, they basically get the cream off the top\u2026 and while that may seem ideal; real teachers like to make a difference.
