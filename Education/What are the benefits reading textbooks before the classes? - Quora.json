            "answer_text": "If you mean reading an assigned chapter before a class, the benefit would be that you can better anticipate what the teacher or professor will cover during the lesson. If you have any questions about the text, you can ask during class and end up with a better understanding of the topic than you would have had if you had not done the reading. If you mean reading a textbook before the start of an academic year or semester, I would not advise reading the whole textbook. Decades of educational research have established that disbursed learning (meaning learning little bit of information at a time) is more effective than cramming. I have found that, by reading three chapters, and taking notes on them, helps to keep me ahead of schedule. It also ensures that if I am sick or have to attend to a family emergency during the course of a semester, I will still be up-to-date with the course syllabus. If I have not answered your question, please feel free to ask some follow-up questions. ",

            "answer_text": "You will not only be prepared, but also find the class to be easy! When I would go into my chemistry class, i would read and ensure i know the chapter and the methods for that class. As a result I was helping more students around me than the actual teachers!! I aced all workshop questions, and went into the exam with a 49% grade. Meaning I only needed to worry about passing the exam to pass the unit. I finished on a High Distinction. You will also be noticed by your teacher which is not a bad thing. If you stay in academia after graduating, the teachers that know who you are make great references, even they have contacts to the outside world to assist in getting you a good job just by putting a word in. For the sake of a couple of hours reading before class, this seems like an easy trade off to me! Corey Forsyth ",
