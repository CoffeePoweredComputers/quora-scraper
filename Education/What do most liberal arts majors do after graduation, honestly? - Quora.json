            "answer_text": "Liberal arts majors can do whatever the fuck they want with their lives. They can write books or articles, paint paintings, draw, cook meals or run a restaurant, shoot photos, become lawyers, or doctors, or vets, or actors, or policemen, or politicians, or body builders, or fitness coaches (or whatever), shoot films, blog, vlog, comment, run, fight in a cage, do stand up. Whatever the fuck they please. Believing that something you did in your late teenage years/ early 20s (like the thing you studied) defines you is the surest way to have an unsatisfactory life. This conventional thinking that in your late teenage years you must acquire some \u201cpractical\u201d education, thus pick a major that offers good, concrete career opportunities (which is the kind of mindset most people, especially parents, have, and which they then pass on to young adults) is the biggest mistake people can make.

            "answer_text": "Pretty much anything. I went into finance and became an executive, my boss was also a liberal arts major, as was our CEO (big finance company, Fortune 100). My wife is a university administrator. I know recent liberal arts majors who are insurance underwriters, hospital administrators, cybersecurity experts for the military, lots of financial types, human resources executives, computer jockeys, lawyers, physicians, web designers. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything a liberal arts major can\u2019t do. It depends entirely on the liberal arts major. ",
