            "answer_text": "I would say liberal arts colleges are an old solution to a new problem. While LACs offer a highly flexible curriculum that focuses on critical thinking (especially outside the box thinking), writing and speaking, and combining disparate fields to tackle problems, large research universities are teaching to exactly the opposite of what is needed now. Research universities teach in a way that ignores the modern job market, not catering to a clientele that will with few exceptions switch careers several times, work in a profession that does not yet exist, and/or work in a job that does not fall into the field of their major. As university programs become increasingly pre-professional, it's no surprise employers report that graduates are overwhelmingly less than qualified nowadays, with particular weaknesses in writing, communication, and general critical thinking.
