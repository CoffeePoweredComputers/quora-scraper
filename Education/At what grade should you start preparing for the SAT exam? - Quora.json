            "answer_text": "As someone who has worked in the test-prep industry for 23 years I can give you some really good insight into this. I would say the EARLIEST that you should start preparing is the Summer between freshman and sophomore year. In that case you would be preparing him to take the PSAT-10 (which is very similar to the SAT). However, I even feel that is too early. Summer between sophomore and year is the optimal time to prepare. That way he can spend some of the \u201coff\u201d time preparing, get ready for the PSAT, and then get ready for the SAT some time after that (November or December). That will give him enough time to see his scores, evaluate them, and then perhaps take the test again in the spring (March, May, or June). This plan usually works out well because it will give him enough time to take additional tests (if needed) such as the ACT and/or SAT Subject tests. You\u2019ll want to have him focus on his school work and keep those grades up. His GPA will be the most important factor in college admissions. Also, extremely important that he takes time to do things he enjoys and not spend all his time worrying about testing and school. Hope that helps. ",

Contrary to popular thought, standardized exams such as the SAT or the ACT is best done when prepared rigorously for a short period of time (3\u20134 months). A lot of students prepare for 1+ years, and this actually ends up having a negative effect because you will eventually exhaust your energy in what is, after all, very tedious work. As a veteran instructor, I will tell you that none of my students have ever worked with me for more than 5 months maximum, most only having actually worked for about 2\u20133 months. Personally, I prepared for the SAT & ACT for 2 months back when I was in high school, and was able to bring my score up from 1450 to 2330 on the SAT and 28 to 35 on the ACT. ",

And it\u2019s really important to enroll in a proper coaching institute for SAT, since your SAT score is one of the most important points of consideration in your college application. You can try Manya-The Princeton Review, my cousin took coaching from them last year and he was quite impressed by how much attention they pay to their students. As a student fresh out of school, you really need an experienced institute to guide you and I believe Manya can do that for you. All the best for your exam. ",
