            "answer_text": "Your school presumably already has your address (or your lack of one), but it\u2019s not clear to me whether your teacher would have access to it. If you\u2019re uncomfortable giving this information to your teacher, and you\u2019re under 9th grade in the US*, just do not give it. You could write an email and say you\u2019re not comfortable and you understand you\u2019ll get a bad grade on the assignment. Your grades do not count for college at those ages, so there\u2019s truly no harm. If you think your parents will be upset, discuss with them. If you\u2019re 9th grade or higher, then your grade will count on your transcript for attending college, so this may be a concern. In this case, you probably want your parents to advocate for you that you should be excused from that part of the assignment. If your parents are unavailable, raise it with your teacher in email, and if your teacher says no, then forward that to the principal. (Communicate in email or in text messages that you screen capture so that you have a record of conversations.) You should not have to give personal information to teachers in order for them to teach you. The teacher should be able to come up with a substitute address for you. (The school, a public location, even a post office c/o \u201cGeneral Delivery.\u201d)  *My son, when he was 4th grade, was asked by his teacher to talk more about his feelings in his daily journal. When I asked him about this, he said he did not want to share his feelings. So I relayed to his teacher that these were private to him, and he was under no obligation as far as I was concerned to contribute that to his journal. If that hurt his grade, I absolutely do not care, did not care. His grade was irrelevant to his ability to create and maintain a boundary, even with people who are in positions of power. ",

            "answer_text": "Your teacher already has it. We have what we call ECCs or Emergency Contact Cards and your teacher has access to them for each student. It has your address, parents phone, best contact phonex parent work phone, and all sorts of stuff. It helps us in an emergency get in contact with someone, or helps us send materials to your home. If you are really concerns though, use a fake address for the assignment. Unless it's something related to your house specifically, we generally dont care. Addresses are just something most kids know we can use as a subject for exercises. ",
