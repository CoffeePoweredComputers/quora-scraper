            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A No , You won't get any certificate by just qualifying for 2nd stage .I think you have asked the question because you want to show somewhere with proof that you have qualified for 2nd stage, if this is not the case then the remaining answer is of no use for you . If you want to have an evidence showing that you have qualified for 2nd stage then there is a way out . After the results you will receive the admit card for 2nd stage and along with that you will get one letter from state board head congratulating you . That letter has a signature of the state board head and it has a good amount of importance. So just laminate that letter and your certificate is ready . Thank You , Hope that helped .  ",
