            "answer_text": "The Catholic church sets great store by not evolving, in fact according to their own claims, it is their unique selling point. This is why it has consistently been on the wrong side of every social question, from contraception and women's rights, to homosexuality and stem cell research. For over 300 years it insisted that it was heretical to claim that the Earth went around the Sun. Scripture can't be changed, so over time it becomes less and less relevant. As new knowledge replaces the ignorant guesswork of the Bible, it becomes a mixture of things that must be believed, to maintain the doctrine, and things that must be ignored, to preserve one's sanity and credibility. Dragging its wooden leg centuries behind the times, the Catholic Church represents the trailing edge of human understanding. I confidently predict that in future it will continue to fail to evolve, making itself less and less relevant as time goes on, and ever more dependent on the compulsory enrolment and indoctrination of children of Catholic parents. Given that the child abuse scandals that have rocked the church are just the tip of an unreported iceberg, it is hard to see how it can ever recover any moral credibility. In Ireland, for example, the church went from being a dominant force in social affairs to an irrelevance, in less than a decade. ",

It is HIS Body on earth: Acts 9:1-6 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE) The Conversion of Saul 9 But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest 2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 3 Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. 4 And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, \u201cSaul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\u201d 5 And he said, \u201cWho are you, Lord?\u201d And he said, \u201cI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;[a] 6 but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.\u201d 1 Corinthians 12:12-13, 27 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE) One Body with Many Members 12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body\u2014Jews or Greeks, slaves or free\u2014and all were made to drink of one Spirit. 27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. Romans 12:4-5 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE) 4 For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, 5 so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. Ephesians 1:22-23 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE) 22 and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all. Colossians 1:24 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE) Paul\u2019s Interest in the Colossians 24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking[a] in Christ\u2019s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church, Footnotes a. 1.24 what is lacking:* Christ\u2019s sufferings were, of course, sufficient for our redemption, but all of us may add ours to his, in order that the fruits of his redemption be applied to the souls of men. Of course we have no guarantees about how big it will be, nor any guarantees about individual members, including the Bishops and the Pope. ",
