            "answer_text": "It depends upon why you\u2019re getting bad grades in the first place. When my older daughter was younger and in school I knew she was smart as a whip but was having problems getting the work done because there were some subjects she had complications in therefore; I would help her and when we started spending all night completing assignments I went to her teacher and explained what was happening. Thankfully he was very understanding and told her to only do 1 hours worth of work at home and bring the rest back to class and he would help her. He didn\u2019t dock her grade because he could see she really was trying. If you\u2019re really trying but need help understanding and completing assignments talk with your parents and teacher\u2026ask for help and help them understand you. Your teacher can be your best advocate towards your parents understanding. ",

            "answer_text": "Understand means that you want them to empathise with you ie, they know what its like to not study and not get good grades. What they probably see is someone not working, making an effort. Not understanding the work in class and not making an effort to do better. Why are you getting bad grades? Do you have a medical condition that prevents you from studying? do you have a mental illness that prevents you from absorbing information? rather than seeking that your parents are not too hard on you you need to do more to get better grades by studying more, getting a tutor. Don't shift the blame onto your parents here. ",

            "answer_text": "This happened to me at the age of 18. My grades were tragic. My Father blew a complete fuse and banished me from the house, disowned me and said he would never speak to me again. I went round to a friends bedsit and we shared a bottle of gin and got very drunk. I laid low for a few days and then went home when my Father was at work. It was a tricky time. He ignored me for months but then I enrolled at another school and re-took my exams and then a year later was at University. It was all forgotten in the end and I graduated just fine. Now over 40 years later and a parent myself I still wonder what it was all about. Things worked out fine in the end. Just get on and do your best, no shame in that. ",

If you have difficulty with a particular subject may be one of your friend or class mates would be able to help you. Put your best efforts (make it visible to your parents) in to getting good grades. If you do these and can\u2019t get good grades, tell your parents that you do need help. Either they can help you, or get a tutor for you for a while. If your parents will agree that you did all you could, how can they get mad at you? ",
