            "answer_text": "What are the \u201carts\u201d composed of? Let me do a goggle search and find out. Okay, I\u2019m back. Some of the arts include: Major constituents of the arts include literature (including fiction, drama, poetry, and prose), performing arts (among them dance, music, and theatre), and visual arts (including drawing, painting, filmmaking, architecture, ceramics, sculpting, and photography). The arts - Wikipedia What you have there encompasses a lot of human accomplishment. Under literature alone, you could eliminate every single library. Just imagine, no libraries. I know some countries would like this, but most of them wouldn\u2019t. People put their lives in mortal danger saving libraries. Teenagers wouldn\u2019t have the excuse of going to the library when they want to party and you\u2019ll have to see them more often. Is that old school? Does anyone leave the house anymore? Architecture is included in that list. Who\u2019s going to build things without architecture? I guess we could all just live in concrete boxes with no running water or electricity. Oops! You forgot to put in a window and the supporting beams. Ah. Too bad. I like the cloud of dust it made though, when it collapsed. The seven liberal arts include: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. I know the word \u201cliberal\u201d is one of the seven naughty words George Carlin wasn\u2019t allowed to say on stage, but still. Grammar! Logic! Arithmetic! MUSIC! No rock and roll? No Bach or Beethoven? No Byrd or Basie? What are we, animals? Now we\u2019re getting to the heart of the matter. Much as we love them, would often like to be like them, we are not animals. We decided to do more with our lives and it\u2019s been one long mishegoss ever since. We had to go to school and play with flour and water to make a copy of a fort, and fingerpaint on construction paper in order to fill the Museum of Homebased Children\u2019s Art, when we would have preferred watching Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck while sitting on our bottoms at home. Well, we wouldn\u2019t have had the Bugs or the Daff without the theater arts. Art is the medium through which our spirits soar, our hearts seize hope, our minds design the future and consecrate the past, and our selves become incarnate. Perhaps some don\u2019t want that for their children. Perhaps some should quiet down and let the rest of us soar, then. \u201cThou shalt not ban any art in schools unless thou finds an orangutan that can build the UN, correct thine sentences, and plot a course to Mars, all while singing \u201cJailhouse Rock.\u201d  \u201cDude, let\u2019s invest the school funding in just football. I got a good feeling about that Ernstein kid and I think I can make some bucks on him this year.\u201d 'When the EU Referendum results get to you....' - Funny Baby Orangutan can't cope with the stress of it all ",

            "answer_text": "The arts enrich the lives of the children that learn about them. It is a studied, published, proven fact that music helps increase endorphins, prostaglandins and serotonin. Music is used as an adjunct with analgesics in hospitals for pain management. How do you feel while listening to your favorite song? I have never pushed, but I was extremely supportive of all 3 of my children learning to play instruments including guitar, violin, saxophone, drums, ukulele, recorder and didgeridoo. I believe in my opinion that their lives are richer and fuller for having the knowledge of music. Drawing and painting are something that never really caught on with them; they never complained when I would take them to the latest exhibit at the art museum in the nearby city. They would listen to my ranting and raving as we walked through the halls. My two oldest sons even had me draw tatoos for them that they subsequently had tattooed permanently on their arms. The art teacher at my youngest son's school told me that the district was thinking about cutting the art program entirely..I told her over my dead body would they. A few emails and meetings later the art program is here to stay. No one has the right to deny children knowledge which brings me to my last point. There is no such thing as useless knowledge. How a person chooses to use knowledge they are taught has no consequence on the knowledge itself, it is for the individual to decide. Knowledge empowers us and knowledge of the arts empowers our children, enriches their lives and makes our world that we share a much more beautiful, interesting place to be. ",
