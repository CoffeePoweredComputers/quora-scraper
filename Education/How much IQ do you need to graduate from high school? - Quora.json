            "answer_text": "Theoretically, a public school curriculum is designed for people with IQs as low as 75\u201380, without any type of learning disability, to be successful. This is the \"slow learner\" range, not defined as \"intellectually handicapped\", and although they may find it more difficult, they should be able to graduate. It will all vary by person, because each of us learns differently. For example, some will have better memory skills than others, some may come from homes with a very poor language (vocabulary) culture. But, assuming all skills are evenly developed, with no significant weaknesses in any particular area, they are expected to be able to pass the curriculum without specialized instruction. Extra help in the form of tutoring, maybe, but not the help of a special education teacher, or an Individualized Education Plan. That\u2019s why intellectual impairment starts with an IQ of 70. Anything above that will have to qualify for Special Education services for some other reason. I hate it when people think of IQ as a single factor because it\u2019s so much more complex than that. But, for those without training, it\u2019s normal to think of it in black and white terms. Inaccurate, but typical. ",

            "answer_text": "Legitimate hypothetical imo. Anyways, technically people in special education do graduate high school although their experience is obviously significantly different from most students. The lowest end of IQs in this pool is maybe 40(?). As far as regular students, I'd say anyone with an IQ just barely high enough to not be in special education could graduate high school. ",

            "answer_text": "The major problem with the IQ test is that you cannot trust one low score. You would need several IQ tests administered over a long period of time in order to use it to classify a student with a low IQ. Many things influence the results of any test we take. nutrition, emotional state, and knowledge. A high IQ test results could be trusted better than a low test score because it would mean everything was optimal for the student that day. You would still be better to have several High test scores also. Public schools MUST take the student in if they live in the attendance zone for that school. NO choice. ",
