            "answer_text": "If you are already in 8th grade and are at the end of the school year, do you have a reason to suspect that you won\u2019t pass 8th grade (in the US)? Did the school administrator attempt to make an appointment with your parent or caregiver? Did guidance office call for a meeting? You can check your grades online by checking your report \u201ccards\u201d or grade reports. They are usually posted somewhere and protected for privacy with a username and password. Often, the username is your student id and you may need to create a password if you haven\u2019t already accessed your grades online. When you do this, you can see by calculating the averages of the 3 quarters completed already to get an idea. That\u2019s the long way around though. The best way is to ask each of your teachers. Usually, in the US, the academic subjects\u2014math, science, English (ELA), and Math\u2014decide if a student is promoted to the next grade level. Get up the courage to ask. You might also go to your school guidance counselor. Make an appointment with the school guidance counselor, sit down and find out. ",
