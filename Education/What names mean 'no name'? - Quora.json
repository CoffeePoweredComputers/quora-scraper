            "answer_text": "You mean the one-who-must-not-be-named? I thought that was known as Voldemort? Or is it \u201cThe Name\u201d or \u201cHaShem\u201d (\u05d4\u05e9\u05dd) as G-D is referred to in Hebrew? On second thoughts, no\u2026 umm - that means \u201cThe Name\u201d. Not \u201cNo Name\u201d.  I found it in the labyrinths of my cognition. There\u2019s no whataboutery involved, I promise.  Allow me to introduce you to \u201cNo Name\u201d. Say Hello to \u201cNo Name\u201d.  Image Source This is an actual brand in Canada, the products of which are commonly found in \u201cThe Real Canadian Superstore\u201d chains, as well as in the \u201cNo Frills\u201d chain (at least that\u2019s what it was several years back when I used to live in Canada). For more information, visit: No Name (brand) - Wikipedia Poor people, graduate students, people of colour, immigrants or hapless people (like me) who\u2019d check more than one of the above-mentioned categories belonged to the target customer groups of the \u201cno name\u201d products. We were the ones who wouldn\u2019t care about whether their chicken or vegetable broth has less or more sodium than Campbell\u2019s as long as it\u2019s broth, and as long as it\u2019s cheapest, even while coming in a carton. Names not only carry meaning, but also a lot of values and the relationship between these two variables are often circular. Having \u201cno name\u201d entailed having a cheap and affordable product. Even though no deliberate branding was intended, to keep away from cost-cutting in establishing a name, \u201cno name\u201d became quite famous based on its \u201cstrange\u201d criterion, to catch the attention of Buzzfeed: 21 Of The Most Hilariously Honest \"No Name\" Products  How one of the \u201cno name\u201d products would look. Image Source  An even bigger question is: Can a \u201cno name\u201d mean a no-name? What if the meaningless of a \u201cno name\u201d is not apparent to all? That\u2019s possible too. For example, while living in Taiwan and Singapore, I\u2019d love shopping for specific kinds of household goods from a particular chain, called \u201cMuji\u201d. They had nice, reasonably durable products, and were quite affordably priced too.  A Muji store, in Singapore; Image Source Now, when I hear \u201cmuji\u201d, it doesn\u2019t mean anything; but I tend to associate the word with \u201cmoja\u201d (not \u201cmawja\u201d) in my native language (Bengali), which means: socks. Not a big deal...just one of those things of how you figure out living in foreign lands \u2014by associating them with their apparent similarity in something. But then, the originally intended muji is not remotely related to \u2018moja\u2019 (i.e. socks). The name Muji is derived from the first part of Mujirushi Ry\u014dhin, translated as No Brand Quality Goods: Muji - Wikipedia Muji means \u201cno brand\u201d, just very similar to the \u201cNo Name\u201d of Canada. Same thing, but different names. No names want to signify no meanings. But that doesn\u2019t become very apparent, unless you know the language in which the words hold some meaning and value to you, the languages in this context being Japanese and English. In India, the name \u201cAnamika\u201d literally means \u201cthe one with no name\u201d. It also means the ring finger, because apparently we couldn\u2019t name the \u201cring finger\u201d as ring finger, so we gave it the name of \u2018no name\u2019. But it\u2019s still a name. There are thousands of Indian girls with the name \u201cAnamika\u201d (and a famous Indian designer). There are thousands of \u201cNo Name\u201d products in Canada. There are hundreds of \u201cMuji\u201d stores. Some names could mean \u201cno name\u201d, but you can\u2019t say the same about \u201cno name\u201d-s. They do mean something. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be there to begin with. ",
