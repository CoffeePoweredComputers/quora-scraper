            "answer_text": "Well I got 4 (I did further maths as well), and I'm afraid the answer is just lots and lots of hard work, a passion for the subject and not being afraid to ask the teacher for help understanding things. I also did hundreds of past papers (it felt that many anyway), as they are undeniably the easiest way learn how to pass an exam. All in all, you have to put the effort in, be dedicated (and not lie to yourself about being dedicated!) and not be afraid to ask for help. There is no easy way round this. People always said I \"got\" physics and maths - and that it was easy for me, which actually annoyed me no end - I was good at maths and physics because I loved it and was interested enough to put hours and hours of work in.
