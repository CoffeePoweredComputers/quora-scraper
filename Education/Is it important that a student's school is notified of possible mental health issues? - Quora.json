            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Most students are minors, and we, the adults in the school, are responsible for them. The more we know about their well-being, the easier it is to watch out for them, to make modifications in their work, if necessary, to alert the school counselor or administration. We will also know when we need to be extra gentle with the student, or firm, or whatever. It\u2019s essential for us to know this information, and we will keep it confidential. ",

            "answer_text": "If the issues are things that would affect behavior at school, then yes it is a good idea to notify the school. As a parent I want my kid\u2019s teachers to be aware of any issues my kid has so they can help them appropriately and understand why they may not always act as expected. As a teacher the more I understand about my students, the better job I can do meeting their needs. ",
