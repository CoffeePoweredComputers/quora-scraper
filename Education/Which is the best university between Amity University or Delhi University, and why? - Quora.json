The campus at North Delhi is the home to prestigious institutions such as Miranda House, Hindu College, St. Stephens College, and Delhi School of Economics etc. and the South Campus is the home to colleges like Sri Venkateshwara college, Jesus and Mary college, and SP Jain Centre for Management Studies etc. If you have the percentage to get into the best colleges of Delhi University then obviously DU. But, if you are not getting A grade colleges of DU, then Amity University Noida is good. Amity has good environment and placements too. ",
