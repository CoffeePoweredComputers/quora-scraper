            "answer_text": "The overwhelmingly best (and only) way to study physics is to do physics problems. Solving the problems forces you to know the formulas and understand the math. It creates the landscape in which you will learn the concepts, develop your intuitive sense of how physics works, and fathom the rich interconnection of the ideas. If you read the textbook, or listen to a lecture, you get an idea of what the landscape looks like, but it is not the experience of physics. It is like the difference between watching a TV program about the Grand Canyon, and actually walking around in it. I have been studying and re-learning my college physics in recent weeks because I got the idea in my head that I could go teach H.S. Physics. I took a practice AP Physics test, cold, and I think I got a 4 on it - mind you, it\u2019s not really a 4 because I took a lot longer than 90 minutes, but I flatter myself\u2026. Still, pretty good for a subject I learned formally >30 years ago. Yesterday, I successfully derived centripetal acceleration, you know, [math] a = -v^2/r [/math]. Yay! It took an hour and two attempts with different approaches. The point is, once you learn physics well, the intuition for the methodology will stick with you. You learn to think about technical, logical problems in a deep and sophisticated way. It\u2019s worth the work - it is so intellectually satisfying! Another point: I\u2019m amused by all the Quora posts about quantum mechanics where folks claim that it\u2019s not intuitive or natural the way classical physics is - that you cannot learn QM the same way because it doesn\u2019t jive with your everyday experience. Well, my recollection of freshman year physics is that it was hard, and not intuitive at all, until you learn it, and then it is. I think we make QM harder because teachers introduce ideas (like the Bohr atom) that have you expect that sub-atomic particles are little solid spheres of matter. Go stare at waves on the ocean, especially as they interact with interesting boundary conditions, like in a boat harbor with jetties and docks. Then come back to QM and see if it makes more sense.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve tried a lot of ways to learn about physics throughout the past four years. As a sophomore, in a high school with a less than stellar science department, I became interested in physics. I started feeding that interest by reading basic online articles and by watching some online videos. Slowly the material there became repetitive at which point I subscribed to Physics Today. I would read the monthly issues with excitement, but I rarely understood anything below the surface level. Finally, I went off to college and enrolled in an introductory classical mechanics course. That is where everything started to click. After struggling (quite a bit) through the beginning of the semester, I finally fell into a rhythm. I have completed the two introductory courses in classical mechanics and electromagnetism, and I will be starting thermodynamics and special relativity in the fall. What I\u2019m trying to say is that the best way to learn about physics is to go straight to the basics. Trying to read about quantum mechanics and general relativity may seem like a really cool and exotic way to satiate your interest, but it won\u2019t truly make sense until you have the basics under your belt. Whether you take classes at a college or you simply pick up a book on mechanics, that is the best place to start. In the words of Richard Feynman, \u201cYou\u2019re unlikely to discover something new without a lot of practice on old stuff\u2026 .\u201d ",
