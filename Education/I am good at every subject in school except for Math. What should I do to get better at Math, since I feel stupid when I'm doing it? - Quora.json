            "answer_text": "First, I am glad you feel frustrated about your lack of knowledge in Math and have the desire to improve. Math is a fascinating and useful subject that develops your thinking in the long term, but often it is not very well taught in school. In addition, people that don't have a natural knack on it, give up easily partly because of lack of support. Here are a few pieces of advice I can give you from my personal experience:  Don't give upWork hard and every day without skipping any lesson in school. This is particularly important since concepts in math build on one another. Many people give up after they missed some foundational material.Get the help of a tutorAsk the teacher more questions in classMake a study group with your peers, if you find that there might be other people interestedLastly, I can tell you a little bit about my own experience. As a middle schooler I was pretty good at Math, but I was not an A student. My Math professor was  particularly hard on us, and the only subject I was not getting As in was Math. So I studied hard, everyday, and focused on Math particularly. Fast forward a few years in high school: I started participating in math competitions and did well at a national level. My boyfriend at that time who was a few years older than me, majored in Math and he influenced me as well to major in it. I wound up being a Math major at Princeton and now I'm doing a PhD in Applied Math.  It's so weird to think what would've happened had I been less ambitious at some time in middle school or high school and had given up on Math. ",
