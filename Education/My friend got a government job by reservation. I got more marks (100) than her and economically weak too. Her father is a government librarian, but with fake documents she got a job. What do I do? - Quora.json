            "answer_text": "If your friend does not belong to reserve category but got job on the basis of fake documents, it is usurping rights of genuine persons belonging to really deserving reserved category. You must file a complaint in her office, her father's office and in the police station where they live. It is your duty to help the system. As regards having jealousy about people of reserved quota, it is not a good mindset as our constitution provides reservation of certain categories. Now, even economically weaker sections are being covered under reserved quota. Don't have malice towards reserved quota persons. When you see a sweeper, cobbler or some scheduled caste etc. persons, just think that we all ( general category persons) have not allowed them to even live with dignity. You may have heard that in UP, Bihar, Odisha etc, people of lower castes are not allowed to take water from Wells where higher caste persons take water. There are hundreds of examples where the downtrodden are suppressed for thousands of years! Be happy with what you have got. With your talent and facilities available with people of your caste, you can crack IAS exams! All the best. ",
