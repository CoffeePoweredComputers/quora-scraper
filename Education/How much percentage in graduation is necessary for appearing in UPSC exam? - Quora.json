As you can see, there is no percentage mentioned explicitly and you just need to have a degree, although,your college might be having certain minimum percentage to offer you a degree and that implicitly becomes the percentage required to appear for cse. Do not worry about the percentage unless you want a job as a backup, wherein, you require atleast 60% for placements. I will still advice you to try to score the maximum you can else you risk getting yourself compared to another sharmaji ka beta/beti. Thankyou. Please be home and stop corona, otherwise, you\u2019ll not be there to read my answers in few days from now. Keep writing and sharing. ",
