            "answer_text": "The QS global ranking asks employers for their opinion of the reputation of universities. This is probably a better measure of prestige among the informed public than academic reputation rankings (as also used by QS and by Times Higher Education alongside other rankings) as academics are asked who is best o at doing research in their field, not whose graduates they look to employ. The 10 UK universities in the top 50 in the world as ranked by international employers are: OxfordCambridgeImperialLSEUCLManchesterWarwickEdinburghDurhamLondon Business SchoolTo put this in a US context, Cornell comes in 49th, just behind London Business School. All of these could be considered at the Ivy League level of prestigiousness internationally (taken as an average, Americans might well rate them lower but this is cancelled out by people elsewhere rating them higher). One university missing from that list which would certainly be considered prestigious in the UK is St Andrews, which comes in 162nd in the QS ranking. This is probably because it is a small university that isn't well known outside of the UK, despite being in the top three of all of the national rankings. ",
