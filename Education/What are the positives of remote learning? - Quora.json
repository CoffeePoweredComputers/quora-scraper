            "answer_text": "There are a lot of variables on this. Funding and policy are core to this structure staying at an effective scale. As we look ahead, lock down will ease but the focus now is on blended learning - with a reduction in pupil numbers in school and therefore by default, many more pupils studying and learning at home. It\u2019s therefore crucial that we build on everything we learnt during lock down. Teachers have upskilled fast, students have received a more personal experience and technology is here to stay. We\u2019ve proved we can do it as educators. We know the solutions exist and are effective. If we are strategic and ensure that learning is the centre point of our motivation for change and our new way of teaching and learning, we\u2019ll never go back. It\u2019s been \u2018sink or swim\u2019, and our educators have learnt to be olympic class swimmers in this new world. The tide of remote learning that\u2019s carrying us is not going to stop. It\u2019s here to stay. As long as we ensure equity of access, we leave lock down with improved ways of learning - digitally. Google tools, and in particular Google Classroom, have seen massive traction over the recent period. Classroom has been used as the almost de facto tool for educators to store and send out work, assignments and materials - creating a structured digital workflow. Educators have built an ecosystem around this core platform - ways to complete worksheets, to have work assessed, to quiz and provide feedback and enable discussion. Our own Texthelp tools have really engaged educators in how to extend this platform and address the core needs of learning. Beyond that, there\u2019s been a huge rise in video use. Not just the usual \u2018YouTube\u2019 clips - but teachers embracing tech creatively to create explanation videos for new concepts, walk through assessment pieces, and in many cases teaching synchronously. The tools that are now seeing a huge rise in use are those that provide motivation. As an example, Fluency Tutor tool encourages students to practice reading aloud. It\u2019s a simple concept - students select a reading piece, record themselves reading and can send it back in one click to a teacher to get feedback or have it assessed. It\u2019s a digital tool that really motivates and engages a student. When you are remote learning this motivation is key, and teachers know that and are actively seeking out and using these types of tools. ",
