            "answer_text": "Andhra university is not so prosperous compared to IITS ..Let me make you understand with the following reasons ...1. Major problem\u200b is Andhra university has nowadays become very commercial .. One can easily get admitted into Andhra university by paying donation fees .. There is an exam called AUCET by which one can get admitted into the college very easily (fees per annum is 1.5 lakh).Previously there used to be admissions only through EAMCET ( competitive exam ) ..But now the glory of the college has come down due to admissions based on AUCET ..2. As far as this generation is concerned,, people who can't get admitted into IITS and NIts,,join in state level colleges ..So the academic standards and intellectual qualities of the students are not so high..Hence the competitive spirit of the students is not so high ..  3. The faculties and infrastructure which the Andhra university has is nothing compared to IITS and NIts ...4. RAGGING (major cause of damage to student career ) Morning at 6 juniors should go to ground to do bowling for their respective branch seniors..Till 8-30 there will be ragging ..9-12:30 classes 2-4 classes Again 4:30-7 ragging (physical ) ..Till 9 again some useless works like movie tickets.. After that seniors will give you records and all .. Timewaste full.This is the main reason behind why people are unable to get good ranks in competitive exams like GATE, GRE,CAT, UPsC , even campus placements also ...Finally when there is no proper platform for any student to flourish in life for pursuing higher level of studies or which can't give you a decent pay ,, then what is the necessity or benefit of studying in andhra university ..Andhra university is one of the most useless colleges in India ..Girls are also not that good, ambitious,matured,That too most of the girls are perverted and very unmatured type mindsets.Only a few girls have commitment towards their life .. Believe me guys Iam also from Andhra university pursuing electrical engineering..Out of all the girls of first year (nearly 200) combining all the branches,, not even one (1) girl is intelligent,matured, ambitious and even beautiful .. Here girls are very overconfident also .. They know only 10% and feel like they know entire world .. Especially mechanical -my parallels are most stupidity girls ..nothing they know .. Useless and overconfident brains ... They know only how to mug up and score marks in semester exams by reading useless sampath Xerox material .... That is the fate of andhra university ...Please don't join .... ",

            "answer_text": "I am student of IIT Madras and from naval architecture\u200b (related to Marine engineering) department. Just a month ago one of my professors came to my class and gave a small talk about our department placement statistics. He : \u201cOut of 54 , 28 are placed from our department in the first phase and second phase is ready to begin\u201d. Students : (applause) He : Wait ! listen :( (With Little louder and anger). All these 28 guys who got placed all are for non-core Companies. No one, no one for core companies. Every one studied naval architecture and settled on coding. One student : Is there no core company came for placements ? He : Many core companies came. Sad thing is nobody (students) interested in core and many are not even attend the interviews\u200b which are conducted by core companies. Everybody wants to be a programmer. They just study here to get b.tech degree or certificate. That's all \u2026\u2026 Last month I went to \u201cvizag\u201d to consult and invite Hindustan shipyard for placements. Fortunately, they agree and decided to came. But before , they want to conduct some test based on ship - building to our students along with Cochin University, Andhra university students. This time luckily, many of our students attended that test. Hindustan shipyard management and out department are blindly believe that there is no competition for our students (IIT). Results announced ! worst performance by our students. They unable to compete with regional universities. Andhra university students got very very very good marks and our performance is almost negligible before them. Cochin University is also did well. So, this is your turn. Atleast your batch take our department seriously\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026. (I stop here, remaining is irrelevant for this question) After hearing the name Andhra university goosebumps :) once our professor started praising Andhra university double goosebumps :) One side sad feeling because my college students didn't perform well. On other side \u201c\u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c2e\u0c3e! \u0c2e\u0c28 \u0c06\u0c02\u0c27\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3e \u0c30\u0c3e! \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c30\u0c3e \u0c2e\u0c40\u0c38\u0c02!\u201d Translation: Hey! Our Andhra man! Apart from this small incident Andhra university is nothing in front IIT s any way it is very good hear. Thank you for sharing :) Edit (Aug, 2020) : After three years since I wrote this answer, I got placed in CITI, Chennai as Software analyst. Sorry sir :) ",

            "answer_text": "IITs are elite technical institutes with modern facilities , innovative methods of teaching and research ,independent assessment and highly qualified faculty. The placement record is great and admission to any of the IIT s is every one's dream not only for placement but also for the proactive way of doing things independently. Andhra university was one of the oldest, having good track record of educational and managerial acumen. It's jurisdiction includes various academic colleges in coastal districts, postgraduate studies in important academic and technical courses. Post graduation in physics,oceanography, management ,and engineering are some of the well appreciated and much sought after courses. Inspite of its history and academic speciality, it has to face lot problems to comply with the conventional requirements like most other universities in the country being controlled and intervened by the state government, unlike IIT. The comparison will be between unequal entities, like ploughing with bullocks on one hand and with tractor on the other hand however great the bullocks may be. ",
