            "answer_text": "So I will give some backstory. I joined FIITJEE Jaipur when I was in Class 8. I joined 1 month late because of some administration issues. All the other new students had extra classes for them since 7th grade,but not me. By the time I joined the first IT was around the corner. I didn't know anything at all, so my rank was the last. It went like this for the whole goddamn grade. The students started bullying me to the next level. I was the keen joke of the class. Not even the faculty spared me. The problem was that there was only one batch therefore every student was in it. Then in 9th grade, I was shifted to the 2nd Batch (out of 3 batches) and a lot of things happened. First, I got away from all those who bullied me,and met other students who really were my classmates. I felt the confidence and my ranks started improving. Now comes the current grade 10. I was still in the Second batch(still 3 batches) and recently had My IT. I got a rank of 18 out of 200 students. This was mind blowing. I performed even better than some of my previous bullies (not all). Now comes the problem. I am pretty sure I am getting in the First batch(where all my previous bullies are) but I really like the teachers in my batch currently. But who knows. Maybe the first batch has even better facility than the second batch. So that's the story. Please suggest me what should I do. ",
