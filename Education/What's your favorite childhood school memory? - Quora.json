            "answer_text": "What\u2019s my favourite childhood school memory? Well, there are, of course, many! One, however, that stands out in my mind, I have mentioned before on Quora, but I think it bears retelling. I was just 6 years old and at Boarding School on the South Coast (of England), my parents being abroad due to my father\u2019s work. Usually I would stay with someone in my large extended family, but people were ill, away, etc. , so I was boarding for a short time. Once a week all the little girls were taken down to the nearby beach. It being early 1939 the war hadn\u2019t started yet, so the beaches were free of the concrete pillboxes and anti-tank blocks, barbed wire, etc. that all too soon would be there. I think we were taken to the beach for lessons about the sea and various sea creatures. That really didn\u2019t interest me. What I was interested in were the lovely sandwiches we took with us. I can taste them now, yum! Made of thin white bread, which would dry out and become rather crisp, in which the cooks had placed slices of thick ham. Yes, OK, but the ones I really loved were those spread with golden syrup. The syrup was absorbed by the crusty bread, absolutely delicious. I would rush around secretly swopping (not allowed) my ham sandwiches for the syrup ones and hiding them in my pinafore pocket! We all wore red and white checked gingham pinnies over our good school gymslips. Matron asked me once why my pinnie was so sticky. I was honest and told her it was because I put my syrup sandwich in there. She asked didn\u2019t I like it? I said oh yes, that\u2019s why it was in there. I didn\u2019t tell her it was 4 or 5 sandwiches! I wasn\u2019t that honest! My granny wrote to say my parents were on their way home, so I then had the added thrill on beach days, of watching the ships on the far horizon sailing, I imagined, into Southampton. Whilst eating my syrup sandwich(es!), I would point out a ship to my fellow pupils and tell them that was the one my parents might be on. Little girl like, I wanted them home, but I was a bit wary, as I didn\u2019t think my mother would approve my eating of all the syrup sandwiches I managed to wheedle out of the other little girls! ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, so in third grade there was this girl in my class. I couldn\u2019t tell if she loved or hated me. Maybe she was jeleous of all my elementary popularity. I mean. I was cool back then. At recess, me and my friend group would make food for our candy shop with the sticks and mud. So one day, this girl, Makenzie, the one that was so jelly over me, hung out with us. Since we didn\u2019t want to be rude and exclusive, we let her join us. But here\u2019s where it gets mean. I was hunched over the mud pit with my pine cone. I was making a chocolate covered apple, obviously. And Makenzie walks over, and pushes me into the mud. I was covered. My white shirt and cargo paints were stained and everything. I had to wear a change of clothes from a friend, who was at least 6 inches shorter than me, so it didn\u2019t exactly fit me. She always said that it was an accident, but I will never forget. Long story short, we\u2019re not friends anymore. peace out Girl Scout, sarah ",
