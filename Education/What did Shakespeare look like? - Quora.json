            "answer_text": "Hmm, this is a good question. The trouble with this time period is that the rich and powerful were the most likely to be painted: this is why we are pretty confident what Elizabeth I looked like. Elizabeth I had very long slender fingers and was very fair skinned even without all the makeup. She would have been a bit under 5 feet tall, had beetle black eyes, had red hair (at least until she was 35 it was all hers) and a long face with a medium bust. She unfortunately inherited her grandfather\u2019s schnozzola and it looked better on Henry VII than her since she got her slender frame and petite size from the Boleyn side.) She would have kept a pair of glasses in her pocket since she had inherited the Tudor family tradition of astigmatism. Shakespeare was a commoner. They were less likely to be painted. Most could not hope to ever afford it. The most likely portrait to be Shakespeare of all candidates is the Chandos Portrait. Its provenance is the best documented. Men of Shakespeare\u2019s time working as playwrights were not considered artists but were thought of as craftsmen, and unfortunately acting was not exactly thought of as respectable (actors were thought of as vagabonds.) The man in that portrait is wearing the clothes of a playwright, the collar gives him away. The portrait overall closely matches a statue in Stratford that was commissioned by Shakespeare\u2019s family and also an engraving, done some years after 1616, from the First Folio. Henry Condell and John Heminges knew what their old friend looked like and would not have wanted that engraving in the book if it didn\u2019t bear at least some resemblance to the real man. The best description of Shakespeare is of a man of about 170\u2013174 cm; for those times that would be about average. Walking down the street you would notice that he was a wee tiny thing compared to Ben Jonson, Richard Burbage, and Edward Alleyn: those guys, Alleyn in particular, were just freakin\u2019 huge for that time period, like Fezzig from the Princess Bride huge. He had brown hair, almost black, a long nose, brown and slightly googly eyes, thin lips, and a moderate build that got a bit chubbier as he got older. By 1595 he would probably be well dressed for that period-black was one of the most expensive colors-and might attempt to cover up the fact that he was balding at age 31. (Ben Jonson satirized Shakespeare\u2019s attempts at trying to climb the social ladder in a play of his for comic affect; the character was constantly inquiring about what the done thing was, trying to impress as a noveau riche.). BONUS: the only way to know for absolutely certain what he looked like would be to find his skull. It appears to have been stolen from his grave in Stratford in the 18th century. A forensics expert could scan his skull, similar to what they did for Richard III, and rebuild his face from there. Let us pray that someone finds it. ",

            "answer_text": "Several portraits definitely or very probably show William Shakespeare. The Sanders portrait shows him as a lively young man with a sly smile.  That\u2019s my favourite. It, incidentally, shows him with a high forehead but not yet bald. The Cobbe portrait shows him at about the same age, but it\u2019s an idealized portrait, a kind of pin-up picture, with rosy cheeks and all. People have speculated that the person who had it painted had a serious crush on our William.  The Chandos portrait shows a man with the hair quite gone, and rather dark. I think the gold ear ring is a nice, piratical touch.  Then there are the two portraits that have no doubt about them at all. The Droeshout portrait that appears on the First Folio and that Ben Jonson vouched for as a good likeness. Notice that the beard\u2019s gone, and there\u2019s just an undistinguished effort at a moustache.  Finally, there\u2019s Shakespeare\u2019s likeness in his memorial in the church in Stratford-on-Avon. It seems he put on weight in his last years. He looks like a businessman now, but is shown with a quill in hand. The beard\u2019s back as a goatee and the moustache is upswept.  ",
