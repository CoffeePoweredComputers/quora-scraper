Conic Sections(Circle,Parabola,Ellipse, Hyperbola) - A highly important chapter , which usually has high weightage in JEE papers.PnC - You may not find many questions from this chapter but it's knowledge will be useful for covering questions of probability( Class 12th), and probability is a very important chapter.Complex Nos. - Something many students find difficult, if you master this then you'll have an edge over othersThat's it!
