            "answer_text": "You can't apply as single if you are married. You must include your spouse in your application. If you fail to include your spouse and say that you are single - then you will never be able to sponsor your spouse later. Also, you will be committing representation (lying in your application) - which can result in your PR status being revoked. If you have declared your spouse will not join you, I believe you will not be able to sponsor him later when you are a permanent resident of Canada, as you have already declared your intention in your PR application. Otherwise all the married people will try filing as single and then later sponsoring their spouses. So it's a kind of misuse of the system and CIC might already be aware of it.
