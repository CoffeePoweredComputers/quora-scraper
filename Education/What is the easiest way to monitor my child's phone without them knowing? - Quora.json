            "answer_text": "There is no easy way of monitoring your childs phone without them knowing. You either give them a phone and trust them to use it suitably, or you don\u2019t give them a phone. The phones themselves are made in such a way that anything a normal person can do cannot \u2018monitor\u2019 the device. All apps I know have very limited background ability (such as seeing what the current active app is) and it would mean you\u2019ve got to install the app anyway - making this not a suitable solution. Buy a phone which only calls and texts if you\u2019re concerned, but don\u2019t lie - sadly the damage has probably already been done if they\u2019re old enough to have a phone. There\u2019s no point monitoring the phone - Anything they might not want you to know, they\u2019ll remove evidence of. Trust them to share with you what they feel comfortable sharing with you, and keeping some things personal. It might be that they\u2019re not comfortable sharing all that much with you. It is better for them to be able to decide what is good and not, for themselves, not based on the fact that their parent is watching. There\u2019s a much larger issue here which can\u2019t be answered in a single Quora answer, but needs addressing. Have a look and see if you can find it. ",
