            "answer_text": "\"Dinda Bowling Academy\". As a true cricket lover, nothing hurts me than seeing this. This should be used the other way. He isn't as bad as Social media projects. I repeat, he has an economy rate of 7.62 (according to your trusted ESPN Cricinfo stats) in T20s.  Being an ardent fan of Dada, I loved each and every man who debuted under him. I still remember watching a county match where Dinda's action was noticeable and right after that match, I remember Dada talking about Dinda and explaining why he is special. And there you go. People come from different part of the country and their journey to reach this far is nothing short of inspiration. Dinda's too. Hailing from a village of Naichanpur, Dinda lost his father, who was a homoeopathy doctor, when he was in 1st standard. He was the youngest of the family. His siblings had to go to different parts of the country for earning. They got into some tiny jobs and sent back the money.  He knew cricket and nothing else. He, in a way, was glad that he was a bowler because the bat, the kit would have cost him more. He didn't have anything but a shoe and a glove which was presented to him by a friend. His place was three hours from Kolkata and he would travel for his training day in and day out. He would board a bus to Panskura at 5 am. From there, he would take the 6.10 am train to Howrah and then a bus again to wherever the match was played. He used to stay with his uncle, who lived near South Kolkata, during the match days and if there was no match, he would return home. Though the journey was tiring, it worked out well until his uncle was nearby but a few years later, they left Kolkata. Dinda was playing for club those days and had no money to afford a room to stay during the tournament matches or somedays training. Those days, finding a place even to sleep was difficult for him. He then found a place in an embroidery factory. After his match, he would wait outside the factory and once everyone left, he would sleep there and would wake up early for the next day training. This continued for years.  Soon, when he began to play for High court, he had a place to stay, thanks to his coach who took care of him for a few years. He then had a basic contract with Kalighat club and then played for the Australian Institute of Sport. Some good performances, helped him find a place in the Bengal team in 2005. His delivery stride was a hit and so was his consistent pace. He was among the wickets as well. In 2008, he was a late addition to KKR squad. He went on to impress with 13 wickets while giving away just 6.66 runs per over. This led to Rest of India team stint. Soon, he made his T20I debut. The Indian team debut came when a few of the senior players were rested. He fared decently there but unfortunately, was overshadowed by a few talents in the bowling line-up. He continued to perform well in the domestic level and was the leading wicket-taker for Bengal literally every single year he played. After 420 first-class wickets, 151 List-A wickets and 146 T20 wickets for Bengal, he will be playing for a different state now.  After his stint with KKR for two years, he was with Delhi then Pune Warriors followed by Royal Challengers Bangalore and Rising Pune Supergiants. So far, from his 70-odd IPL matches, he has 65+ wickets at an economy rate just over eight.  For someone who has done extremely well in the domestic circuit and has a decent record in T20 compared to so-called best bowlers right now, \"Dinda Bowling Academy\" should be something different, something positive. It is just sad that the man himself had to put out his record on social media to \"silence\" the trolls and abuses. The abuse, I tell you, are the worst. I have seen people being racist, discriminate him for something they shouldn't. For someone, he isn't. Oh, yes, People doesn't give a care about mental health neither do they care to look into records. They see what they see and want to be a part of something, even if it is nonsense but the worst part is even big websites like Cricbuzz are carrying such trolls and even RCB content page.

            "answer_text": "After Umesh Yadav\u2019s stellar bowling performance against KXIP, RCB\u2019s official tweeter account tweeted: \u201cDinda Academey? What\u2019s That?\u201d. Later they found that the tweet has a bad taste and deleted it. But the tweet was already noticed by the fans and it spread on social media.  Tweeted By Official Account Of RCB after Umesh took 3 wickets(Later Deleated) Seeing an IPL franchise\u2019 official Twitter handle trolling him, Ashok Dinda found this unmanageable and he came up with a post on Facebook to shut his haters.He shared his T20 bowling stats and a pic showcasing him the leading wicket-taker of Bengal for the last 9 years.After that incident Ashok Dinda said.. \u201cHaters, helping you get your statistics right. Stop and stare well your opinion is not my reality. So shut your hating selves and keep me out of your mouth\u201d.    You might be thinking what is Dinda Academy and why Ashok Dinda is getting trolled for the bad performances of other bowlers. The thing started a few IPL seasons back when Dinda conceded too many runs in few games also his IPL record is not that good that\u2019s why he has always faced trolling from the fans. In IPL 2018 and 2019 auctions he didn\u2019t get any buyer. But this year trollers came up with a fictional thing called Dinda Academy. Whenever a bowler concedes too many runs in his spell, they include him in this academy showcasing with memes. Umesh Yadav, Jaydev Unadkat, Mohammed Siraj get trolled for the same. Ashok Dinda has not a very good IPL record but he has done well for India in T20s. In 9 matches for India, he has struck 17 wickets. Also, he has a great domestic record for Bengal.
