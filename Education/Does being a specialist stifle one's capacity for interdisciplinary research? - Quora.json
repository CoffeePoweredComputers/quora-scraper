            "answer_text": "I'm not a researcher and I don't come from the scientific world but rather from the educational/entrepreneurial world so my approach and answer comes from a completely different set of experiences that might or might not be applicable. What I have seen and experienced is that as long as your speciality does not constrict your openness from external inputs it is actually something very valuable when doing interdisciplinary work. I mean that it is more a matter of how you decide to approach the research and work you are doing and how helpful you think what others can bring to the table can be mixed with your knowledge. History is full of stories of people that serendipitously discover or invent new things and a lot of this comes from a completely unrelated element being \"mixed\" in an otherwise known pattern. I would say that the only barrier that specialisation puts to cross-field collaboration is convincing ourselves that because we know more than anybody else on a field they don't have any value to add and then we could miss opportunities. Sometimes we do this unconsciously because we are used to doing things they same way we do them daily, or the exact same way they were taught but in the end it may be allowing these sometimes random elements that may actually lead to breakthroughs or real innovation. Just like kids sometimes see very easy and simple solutions to problems adults cannot because of our mental limitations we are not even aware of. That said, the cross-field collaboration will always be richer if there are people that have deep knowledge of disciplines which allow a concrete application of an idea from an external individual that might not have the tools to make it a reality.

            "answer_text": "No. You can apply your specialty to multiple domains. The trick with collaboration is that you don't have to understand everything; a deep understanding of just part of a problem is enough. In fact, I think that's one of the best ways to do interdisciplinary work: understand a single domain or set of techniques so well that you can effortlessly apply it anywhere then use it to work together with other domain experts. You can still make great strides without more than a cursory, high-level understanding of the second domain involved by restating the problem in terms of your core competency and getting an expert's help at the edges. As odd as it might sound, this approach is fundamental to much of modern programming language research, the field I'm most familiar with. It helps that we have what is probably the most systematic approach for attacking outside domains: we design domain-specific languages (DSLs). It's not just about general purpose languages any more! The idea is to design a small, purpose-built language for representing ideas from the domain you're interested in. You get some domain experts to help you with the language design and perhaps to write programs in this language. But once you have the language and some programs, you can apply general programming language ideas to it just like any other language. This lets you design tools and make conclusions relevant to any domain but stemming purely from an understanding of programming languages and semantics rather than that specific domain. This ranges from merely being a force-multiplier for people already working in the area to coming up with legitimate results of your own. For example, an interesting sub-field of PL research is program synthesis which investigates techniques for automatically generating programs. Much of this work tends to be pretty narrow and tailored mostly towards normal programming problems like optimizing programs, porting code between different architectures or building compilers. Fairly narrow. But Ali Sinan K\u00f6ksal, a graduate student I knew at Berkeley, managed to apply these ideas to solving interesting problems in biology. How? By designing a programming language to model cellular processes and then using program synthesis techniques and formal methods to synthesize and analyze these models. While I suspect Ali picked up a more than fair amount of biology working on this, a core part of the results is self-contained PL research befitting a real specialist. Dan Grossman wrote a great overview of this idea recently: What is PL research and how is it useful? It has a similar theme with more examples. The more general point, of course, is that you can contribute to many different domains by expressing their problems in terms you are familiar with. Yes, for most specializations, it will probably be less direct than in PL where we literally express the domain as a programming language, but the idea is still applicable. The important part is that this sort of approach does not force you to know much about any other area or domain. It's helpful, and you will learn about it anyway as you do the work, but it's not crucial. Instead, you just get help translating into what you're already familiar with and then do most of your work there. To be clear, this is also not the only way to do interdisciplinary research. But it is a way and it demonstrably works. Being a specialist does not stifle your capacity for interdisciplinary work. ",
