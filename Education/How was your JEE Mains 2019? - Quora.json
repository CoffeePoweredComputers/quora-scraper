            "answer_text": "I would like to mention that JEE mains was never my first priority so don\u2019t expect a lot from me here. My JEE mains January attempt was on 9th Jan first slot. The paper was not very easy or difficult. Was quite moderate and similar to past year\u2019s trends. I started off with physics which was my favorite. In the second question itself, I wasted a lot of time as none of the options were matching to my answer that too in an extremely easy question. I marked the closest value and moved on. Even though I wasted a lot of time on that question, I managed to solve the paper easily in the 45 min time I usually allot for physics. Next came chemistry and I found it very easy. Most of the questions were direct questions from NCERT diagrams and a lot of questions from the most ignored chapters i.e. Chem in Everyday Life, Biomolecules and you get the rest. I took 25 mins to solve the chemistry paper. Now came the section I dreaded the most. Maths. Now to make myself clear, I was not good at maths. (From IIT JEE mains standards) Even though I was decent at maths on the CBSE or JEE mains level. I was nowhere good at it from a competitive point of view. Still my paper went quite well and I was able to attempt more questions in maths than I normally would in mock tests. My usual score in FIITJEE AITS JEE Mains used to be 140~160 (AITS is way harder than JEE Mains or even Adv) and my scores in JEE previous years and other mock tests was between 230\u2013320. (Which is much more closer to the actual JEE mains). So you could say that I was expecting at least 210 marks in the actual paper. After the paper I was hoping at least 230 marks. Some Coaching classes immediately released answer keys within 4\u20135 hours of the exam. From those keys my score was ~240. However from the actual first NTA answer key, my result was 251 Marks. But remember there was one question in which my answer matched none? I challenged that question. I was also sure NTA had messed up a question in chemistry on MOT topic. I challenged that too. Of course I first consulted my teachers about it. I was first about to challenge 3 questions but my teacher corrected me in one of those questions and said it was indeed wrong. Good news arrived, both of my challenged questions were corrected and I was now at 261 Marks which was my final score. I got results from NTA soon and I had secured 99.77 percentile. I would like to mention that from previous year trends, even 230 Marks could fetch you a rank under AIR 1000 but I think due to the exam being conducted in 2 shifts my rank was almost doubled and my final rank was AIR 2775 in GEN category. Though I was hoping for a better rank, I knew I had scored enough to take admission into any JEE mains college in any stream I wanted. If I were to take admission in any college on the basis of JEE Mains marks, I would have chosen NSUT in the CS branch. Even though I was getting CS with AI branch easily, I preferred CS branch as I am not confident about the AI and Machine Learning environment in NSUT. You may be thinking about my JEE Mains April attempt but to be fair, knowing the fact that I would secure any college and branch I lay my finger on except the IITs, I focussed more on JEE Adv and Boards. I even managed to get 350+ score in BITSAT so I was guaranteed a seat in BITS Pilani campus in ECE branch (which is the second most preferred branch after CS). In short my JEE April attempt was for formalities and I focussed on boards rather. My marks in JEE April was 180 Marks and a percentile of 99.4. (I got the hardest shift I think). So my January attempt was counted as it was the better one. In the end I would like to wish best of luck to all aspirants for JEE Mains and JEE Adv. Hope you had a good result in Mains 2020 January and that you perform better in Mains April. Also if the result was not that you expected, you should be even more motivated to study better. Hope you have a nice day! ",
