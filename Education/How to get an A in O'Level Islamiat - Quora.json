            "answer_text": "I got an A in Olevel Islamiat, so from my experience, I can tell you the following points will help you get a good grade. Study your coursebook well, at least twice.Make notes in class. Learn those notes.Memorise Ahadith and Verses from the Quran. You should know a lot of these because references are extremely important in Islamiat. Your long questions should have at least 3\u20134 Quranic verses or Ahadith in it.Include at least two verses from the Quran when explaining an Ayah and at least two Ahadith from the Quran when explaining a hadith.Past Papers are key to a good grade. I cannot emphasize enough on how crucial past papers are. You should attempt past papers of at least 5 years (both October November and May June variants).Get your answers checked and graded by your teacher.Study everyday and don\u2019t let everything pile up till the last moment.Take breaks while studying, so you dont stress out.",
