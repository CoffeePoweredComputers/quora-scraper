            "answer_text": "There are doctors and medics that have an uncanny sixth sense about things\u2026They also have the mentality of \u201cwhen they hear hoof beats they think of zebras, not horses\u201d. Part of this mentality is being didactic\u2026These people read about EVERYTHING they can. It is part of their nature to learn about things they do not know about, and become more informed than a any top diagnostician or specialist. Many have an attitude of \u201cbeing the smartest person in the room\u201d, and ooze confidence. They challenge their peers, yet if they do not know something they ask questions to learn. The good ones have a fun personality, and often seem as though they are the \u201cJokers\u201d. However, they are deadly serious when it comes to finding out the cause of medical problems. They do NOT believe in just slapping just on a \u201cband Aid\u201d to temporary stop the symptoms\u2026They have an inner drive to find out what is causing it, and do not give up! It will keep them up at night trying to figure out what is causing the problem! Ego, IS part of their personality, yet these types of people are the ones you WANT to have on your side! They are like a real life \u201cDr. House\u201d, and hospitals and insurance companies hate and fear them, yet they also save they them money from lawsuits\u2026so they are tolerated. These doctors do not give a shit if they are reprimanded and threatened to be fired because they are running tests, their ego and especially their drive to be the best is what makes them so good at what they do. Do NOT write off a doctor due to their eccentricities and somewhat unconventional approach. They are usually the ones who are going to end up saving your life, or giving you a better quality of life. Medics who have become doctors are some of the most high aware people to find as a doctor. As medic, you are trained to examine the whole body from head to toe, and that has been ingrained in them. You may come into a hospital because you have a stomach ache, have a deep cut, or even a gun shot\u2026Yet, as they treat the obvious, they take a full medical history and will run tests not associated with the obvious injury if they see or sense that there may be something else going on. Like I said, these doctors are almost clairvoyant and see even the smallest of things that most doctor would miss. It does not mean the other doctors are not good at what they do\u2026. However, the \u201csixth sense\u201d doctors just have an extra edge, drive and almost supernatural ability to be the best at everything. How do I know so much about these types of doctors? I am one. Although I am no longer a practicing P.A. (I purposely chose NOT to get my MD because I had more freedom to treat people without the red tape, and I also kept up my medic license which gave me even more liberties), I am constantly being called by medical professionals ans specialist for my opinion. Also, I also still help everyone who comes to me for help (many people can not afford to go to a doctor, or the treatment is NOT working). I often change their medications and treatments that other doctors have put people on because their doctors were completely wrong. I have even had to treat myself while I was in the hospital with severe bacterial pneumonia (which I was dying from and was NOT expected to live), because the doctor\u2019s were NOT knowledgeable enough to do it. I still am in perplexed that I lived through that\u2026If I was the treating physcian for what I was going thourough, I would have had to pre pare the family the I was more than likely going to die. The doctors who were treating me told my husband when he asked if I was going to live\u2026They gave a vague answer of \u201cShe should\u201d. In other words, they thought I was going to die. Fortunately, I was telling them what meds to give me. although I do NOT remember most of it (my son and husband told me I was giving orders to the doctors), and the only thing that saved me, which my son who is wise and astute beyond anyone I have every known, said that what really saved me was that I had no clue how sick I really was (I had blood poisoning, my kidneys and liver were failing, my heart and lungs were filled with fluid and I had a fever of over 105 F)\u2026In other words, my body had shut down and was in full blown medical shock. My son was right, not knowing how I really was kept me going\u2026Also, somehow being able to continue to order medications and treatments while in being in a delirium helped\u2026 Yet, the most important of all was the \u201cUNBREAKABLE PROMISE\u201d I made to my son: I told him I would NOT die on him! I kept my promise! I have been \u201cAlmost\u201d dead several times in my life\u2026My heart has stopped three times and I was what is called \u201cclinically dead\u201d, yet I came back to life! I have been shot, stabbed, poisoned, and beaten so badly that I \u201calmost\u201d died. However, I have a saying that I have used for years, mostly on other people, but it does apply to me: \u201cALMOST DOESN\u2019T COUNT\u201d!! To sum up everything I said: Find the one doctor who in checking on things that are NOT always related to your obvious \u201cproblem\u201d\u2026They may NOT always have the best \u201cbedside manner\u201d, or do NOT look like the typical \u201csmart\u201d doctor\u2026But, that is what makes them stand out id they do not just follow the \u201ctext book\u201d, they are the ones who surpass the ordinary, and venture into the extraordinary! These types of doctors are a rare breed\u2026You may NEVER find one\u2026and there are many people who have had doctors fail and give up on trying to diagnose them\u2026THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP!!! I suggest researching the internet\u2026Go through actual medical journals written by other doctors (here is a link on Wikipedia: List of medical journals - Wikipedia). Type into Google search symptoms you or someone is having\u2026Especially things that are strange or obscure. Many times you can find something that a doctor or scientist has written about and continue researching. MANY people who have had doctors basically give up on them, their children, or a loved one have actually found the ANSWER to what is causing the illness by researching on the internet!! If the doctor they are seeing refuses to even test for your theory , then find another doctor!! Even go to an ER! Many times there is an ER doctor is more prone to run a test than your GP, specialist, etc. American ER Doctors are highly trained is so many different specialties because they cannot always get a \u201cspecialist\u201d to come and see a patient in time. Not all ER doctors are that way, but once again\u2026DO NOT GIVE UP!! I am speaking not only from experience with my own family and myself, but also helping other people. Had I NOT taken the time to research and read through hundreds of \u201cmedical journals\u201d, I would NOT have found answers and even some simple treatments that helped my family and others. ",

            "answer_text": "You should be kind, empathetic and patient and never arrogant. Be very observant and be respectful of the patient and others. Have an excellent depth of knowledge which is up to date and which should extend extensively beyond ones own areas of expertise. Have had as much clinical exposure as possible during ones training particular in emergency and unplanned cases which should have been wide ranging. Be a patient and good listener and when taking a history give the patient time to tell their story. Be particularly aware of the importance of past history, family history, occupational history and travel history and don\u2019t shy away about a patient\u2019s sexual history irrespective of their age or gender. Develop a subtle way of interrogating patients using a combination of open and focussed questions recognising that 80% of diagnoses can be made on the history alone. In conjunction with this develop excellent examination skills. Use the experience of others to hone these. Don\u2019t underestimate the benefit of a long apprenticeship in developing these. Be meticulous, careful and gentle with examination recognising they the examination starts with observation. Never make the error of not fully exposing the patient or examining the entire region in question. Have learned the neuromuscular supply of limbs, thorax and abdomen, the dermatomes and the cranial nerves. Learn the principles of auscultation which is not just confined to the heart and lungs. Be skilful in palpation and learn to recognise the normal as well as the abnormal. Never be ashamed to admit you have made a mistake and always be prepared to change your diagnosis if new evidence becomes available or if clinical signs and symptoms change. Be approachable and take joy and pleasure in teaching others as by doing this you will continue to develop and expand your skills. Great diagnosticians are not born but are carved out of years of experience and practice in much the same way as are great musicians. Not all doctors will become great diagnosticians but it is not possible to become one without the hard work necessary. ",
