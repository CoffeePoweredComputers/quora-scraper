            "answer_text": "Usually at the age of 18 years of age is considered an legal adult ( unless a person is mentally disabled then they are kids in an adult body ) or needs a caretaker because of other disabilities but in this current era of how \u201ckids\u201d have to live with parents until they are ages of 25 , 30 , 35 + because of survival costs as high ass rent , mortage , car , not finding good jobs even with college degrees and society has less maturity for adults as a whole . They are some persons that do mature mentally and physically at the ages of 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 years old as a full adult with little hitches and nowadays a person age of 20 ( 2000 - 2020 era ) is closer mature to a 15 or 16 in the early 1980s and this soft era we live in the western world a lot of 20 year old males / females are extremely young minded , smug , profound and the world owes them everything so in a way they are adolescents . The age of 21 is now legal to drink and now the age of buying smoking products but a true adult is a person in there mid 30s but in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s people used to meet there high school / college sweethearts and build a family at younger times .

            "answer_text": "What are you using as a measuring tool? A man\u2019s body does not fully mature until he reaches 25\u201329. Does that mean he is still an adolescent at 23? A woman\u2019s body matures much faster than a man\u2019s so does that mean her adolescent stage is over at 18 or 21. Is it a biological time or a cultural time? For the sake of simiplicity I feel that 21 is a good age for both. By that time people are settled down, most are just about out of college or trade school. Some have already been in the work force. No work place would tolerate adolescent behavior from their employees. Unless they traditionally hire teens and even then the teens have to grown up quick and act professionally. Stay with 21 and avoid a useless disussion ",
