            "answer_text": "Teaching is the art and science of helping others to grow in their knowledge and understanding. But more than that:  Teaching is holding the hand of a young one and saying it's going to be OK.Teaching is being careful that you acknowledge every student every day.Teaching is never forgetting that for a moment each day you might be the only person who touches someone's life.Teaching is constantly being aware of what you are doing wrong in the classroom and trying to find ways to fix them.Teaching is keeping up with both the latest research and honoring the enduring traditions.Teaching is worrying that you don't know about about the subject deeply to make it easily accessible to everyone.Teaching is correcting papers when you family is relaxing watching TV or out in the yard.Teaching is pushing both yourself and the students those last few weeks of school.Teaching is running around before school getting your room ready, the copies made, the desks straightened, and being careful to check that the whiteboard markers are still good.Teaching is listening to attack parents complaining about how you mark too hard and hearing caring parents thank you for the tireless work.Teaching is receiving gift cards at the end of the year from shy students who give them to you and run away with smiles on their faces.Teaching is grading papers and entering grades while simultaneously eating lunch, giving a makeup test, and helping a student with a particularly difficult math problem.Teaching involves the giving of oneself to others so that possibly, just possibly, the piece that one gives will blossom in the heart of another and, even more importantly, might cause others unknown to you to blossom. Teaching is all these things. And honestly, I wouldn't trade it for anything. Thanks for the tremendous question. ",

            "answer_text": "Teaching is an art form. Teaching is daring to think the things you have to say are important enough to make a difference in the life of someone else. Teaching is caring about the life successes and failures of many individuals at once, and then convincing students that they should be caring and respectful as well. Teaching is trying to be flexible enough in your approach to helping that you meet the needs of the most people at once, and then loving your other students (who did not \u201cget\u201d something the first time) enough to try to meet their needs by another pathway. Teaching is being willing to share personal experiences, and the stories of others, with students so they can learn from the teacher\u2019s personal failures instead of feeling like everyone needs to learn all things of importance through the school of hard knocks. Teaching is about sparking someone\u2019s curiosity so they care about asking critical questions to learn something - even if the questions are not directly related to the teacher\u2019s subject matter. Teaching is the act of steering kids into to being creative thinkers, not merely encyclopedias. Encyclopedias can be found in many places. Each student is a valuable individual beyond his storehouse of facts. Teaching should demonstrate the real difficulties presented by some situations. Teachers should be willing to say, \u201cThis is hard.\u201d People need to be problem solvers throughout their lives, so teaching has to involve the development of personal persistence - otherwise the puzzled person will be inclined to just give up when the going gets rough. Teaching involves honesty with students - sometimes telling them harsh facts in a kind way. Teachers need to be willing to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d but then help an inquisitor to find sources that might answer their questions. Teaching is a real act of love! Students who claim that teachers do something simply because they want a paycheck, or because they have a strong desire to make the lives of others miserable just don\u2019t get it. ",
