            "answer_text": "Now the time has came when most of the students will search on quora and you tube and on other platforms..What will be the cuttoff of NEET 2020? Some will say around 600 some will say around 550 and some top educated people will say 700 also but let me tell you one thing cuttoff is not decided by marks it depends on certain factor which i will tell you:- 1. Percentile:- it means the no. Of students who have scored better than you or ahead of you for eg. I have scored 605 marks in neet 2019 i was thinking i will get mamc A/O last year cuttoff but when result were announced my rank was 6655 so basically it depends on the performance of other students too and not only yours. 2. Due to delay in exam:- many people saying that this will impact the preparation and student will fear in giving exam in corona pandemic and student will score less falaana dhimkaana..but the truth is that the top air 10000 will not stop their studies bcoz they are dedicated determined towards their goals. Those who have studied with their full heart will not fear of anything.. these are those students who say Re-Neet after the NEET. 3. Due to merging of aiims:- Aiims has been merged NOT the exam conducting body of aiims. NTA is still theconducting body of NEET so merging aiims will should decrease the cuttoff as aiims seat will be added also. 4. Exam difficulty level: see if exam comes easy it will be easy for all if comes difficult it will be difficult for all so this will not impact your cuttoff as i have already said it is the percentile which decides your rank and from that you can predict the cuttoff. 5. No. of students:- as the no of students increases no. Of droppers will increase. Exam top ek fresher krega but exam me selection lene wale droppers jyada honge so every year these droppers will apppear again and again and will impact the cuttoff as they will come to know the pattern of exam and will read only NCERT and NCERT.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 safalta ki kunji If talking about NEET 2020 difficulty level i will give my opinion:- Physics :- This year mostly questions are directly formulae based unlike previous year aper which have ambigious question having two answers so if one have prepared with honestly will score more in physics in comparison to previous year. But most of the students have fear of physics due to which they can't even solve formulae based questions. Chemistry:- This is almost comparable every year not diffcult not easy..every year chemistry is the easiest one to score high every year. So will not impact the cuttoff. Biology:- this year i genuinely feels it easy because there are no questions which have two answers as previous year there were 3-4 ambigious questions having more than one options correct but this year paper have to the point question. And many students find biology interesting one as their favourite subject. So here they will score but the physics factor will compensate this. There was a repeated question in biology and chemistry which amino acid is basic wala\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 NTA was thinking inko kya hi pta chalega\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 This is rank vs marks distribution of previous year:-  So i think the cuttoff should not increase too much as they are already touching the sky but may be increased as no. Of students and droppers also increased this will affect percentile and so the cuttoff but additions of aiims seat and corona pandemic upto some extent may decrease the cuttoff But the major factor for increase in cuttoff will the no. Of droppers as they have scored around 590 which was the cuttoff in 2019 and now they appear again in 2020 and will try to score 650+ so if every dropper tries to do it then you can imagine the drastic change in marks vs ranks this year. But Let the result come out all doubts will be cleared out then so be calm and enjoy these 2\u20133 months ",

            "answer_text": "NEET 2020 CUT OFF Most asked question following day 1 of exam, see analysis will land you stress, I suggest people who have given well kno very well that they are gonna selected, and those whose paper didn't went well knows from inner self ki kahan kami reh gyi. Still my analysis to NEET 2020 says that seeing 2019 paper which I attempted Biology section was far easier than 2019, straight direct questions, may it be length of human DNA without any calculation you can mark, old scenario of match the following in neet follows in 2020 also where only one option you decide and the answer is yours\ud83d\ude01. For those who found out Bio section tough then sorry you can leave NEET preparation and do something else, questions which I personally liked in bio in NEET 2020 was one on cockroach ventral nervous system, Question on LH surge, Estrogen ; one question on anthropogenic evolution, Light reaction, there is only one place in TCA cycle where GTP is formed direct questions. Rest I think an average student can score 320+ in bio I myself went for 45 min timer to check how much I score after 1 year of mbbs and boom I got 332, suggests that many, literally many are going to get a perfect 360 in bio. Chemistry was easy to moderate with slight tricky questions in physical, rest organic is pure ncert, lysine is the basic amino acid which now everybody is aware off\ud83d\ude06(2 times), questions on bond order was always my favourite He2 is the answer B.O-0 , rest according to me an average student must score around 140+ in chemistry this year. Physics was super easy in the history of NEET, Aiims and jipmer would be in doubt\u2026 was that an exam for medical entrance?\ud83d\ude01.. questions like 3/2kBT direct formula they are asking should not be made wrong, if it is then it's a blunder, question on significant figure has made me confused too that was it too significant to put it in NEET\ud83d\ude06 these type of questions used to come in my minor test series, so according to me the questions were basically direct formula based an average student should have scored about 140+( this year for physics my average expectation is high) Remember that easiest thing seems easy and we go for practicing the hardest sums may it be H Verma or DC pandey, u all can see the level of questions in neet it won't match with any of these books, and following exam when in pressure we mark wrong answers because it has not been practiced many times, just seen. Mantra here is for 2021 aspirants that, do 1000 times 1 question as compared to 1000 questions one time. So total brings up 600 marks as the cut off according to my predictions, but wait let me make u aware of something, cut off for All india quota seats is fixed and is always high and depends on the range that how many students are there in the range of 600\u2013720, my predictions suggests it is going to be super inflation greater than previous year in ranks, still coming to state quota there also every state has its own cut off different from each other, cut off for UP, Delhi, Rajasthan can touch heights, but other states would be more or less same as previous years. All depends on rank inflation and how many students are standing on one particular marks. P.s Don't feel u are not worthy enough to do anything in life if it didn't went well, especially for those who are gonna be at the last closing marks because remember the one with the same marks got selected and u were with the same marks 1 rank more than the one got selected. Upvote and follow for any help Edit-1: This is the expected minimum cut off for AIQuota and for some states too any thing less than this is not expected, had talks with many aspirants, paper level, seat availability, Quora flourishing with many literally many getting above 700+ and 650+ and many other points too.
