Learn some extra curricular skills while preparing for the second attempt.Tell your father that you will help him in his business, or whatever work he does.Tell your parents that this is your first and last mistake, if a all.Think hard and try to find out why you failed this time.  This lapse is momentory or you are made for something better than just studying passing, getting a job.This break can be life changing if you take it positively.Do not be scared to argue your case with your parents, if you are sincerely regretting this lapse and want to just move on.",
