If you want to pursue Mcom for serious academic purpose, it is better to do it from a regular university. But if you are a working professional and don't have time to attend college then go for a distance degree. As far as recognition is concerned, IGNOU degrees are UGC approved and are recognized for all purposes including government jobs. But there are certain jobs which specifically require the applicants to obtain degrees from a regular universities. ",

            "answer_text": "A Post-Graduation (PG) from IGNOU is a reputed form of distance education, but it is generally pursued by working class people, who work in pvt. scetors, a pursue courses from IGNOU or any other distance learning platform for a better promotional opportunity. It'll be good to go if u just wanna add \u201ca feather to ur cap\u201d. Means, it's good only if u want to add an additional qualification to ur name. Don't expect too much from it, as u'll not get any kind of placement and the degree will not be accepted in any govt. organisation as it's a distance course. Let me tell u it's advantages and disadvantages. Advantages : 1. Something is better than nothing. It means, atleast just being a graduate, it's better to have a PG either it's from a distance or regular course. 2. It'll be helpful for u if u r working or will work in any private organisation. Disadvantages : The PG from a distance course is not recognised as valid by govt. institutions.It'll give u no benefits if u r working or willing to work in any govt. organisation.A distance course from IGNOU has the same value, as it is from any other Open University or Distance Learning Institution like Sikkim Manipal University or any other. My suggestion for u : If u r a student, and if u have enough time to continue ur studies, I'll suggest u to do ur PG in a regular course. All the best.  ",

If you get back in any subject then you can take your exam after 6 months. You will not have to wait for a year like sol.Ignou has assignment system. By assignment, you get a good idea about exams and questions also.In ignou you can get your results in 3 months.If you are a student you can do easily any degree program from IGNOU.If you are a worker then it's little hard for you because of assignment.",
