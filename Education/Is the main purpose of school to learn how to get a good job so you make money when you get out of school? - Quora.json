            "answer_text": "The main purpose of school is to keep you out of the labor market and off the streets until you grow up enough to take care of yourself. Whatever purpose you can find to stay in school is the main purpose. If you want to get a good job, that\u2019s a good purpose. If you want to absorb the wisdom that the School Board in all its beneficence has offered you, that\u2019s a good purpose. If you want to go to college, that\u2019s a good purpose. And if you want to make your parents happy that\u2019s a good purpose. I was pretty disgusted with my school because it was boring as hell, and they never taught me the important things about Matewan and Ludlow and Wounded Knee and the Pullman Riots and the San Francisco Maritime Strike. They wanted to teach me about a bunch of pederastic Greeks instead. The purpose of school is whatever purpose you can find in it. But you really don\u2019t have much option. Out on the streets, you\u2018re likely to get involved in criminal activity before too long \u2014 because what other option do you have? I\u2019d only suggest that you fully engage in any studies that you find compelling, any teachers you find sympathetic. And build on that. As the saying goes, \u201cWe\u2019re all lying in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\u201d You have the precious opportunity as a student to indulge your curiosity and improve your mind.

            "answer_text": "It didn\u2019t used to be. But now it is. Which is an adjustment to current reality. Which also means that you won\u2019t get your money\u2019s worth, or a high paying job, if you enroll in one of many currently useless \u201cStudies\u201d majors. The goal of education in general was once believed to be offering to the incoming student the opportunity of a \u201cwell-rounded\u201d \u201cliberal arts education.\u201d The notion was that students (in the US, at least) should at least get a survey of Western literature, language, art, philosophy and history to provide a general cultural background in addition to the coursework devoted to a student\u2019s major area. Today, that\u2019s out the door in most US colleges. All the survey stuff, if and where it still exists, is now devoted to an anti-US, anti-West ideology meant to indoctrinate students with an entirely different, negative historical perspective. Even STEM major areas have gotten infected with this. So, while studying a STEM discipline is today more likely to get you a good job than anything else available, even STEM has gotten infected with the overall ideological objective. So today\u2019s practical student must try to negotiate a path through this morass and at least obtain the knowledge and the right degree to gain entree into the higher paying echelons of the business world. Studies in cultural and historical information are essentially gone, replaced by a bizarre and terribly negative world outlook, which is really not very useful. It\u2019s a mess. Today\u2019s students are not getting anywhere near their money\u2019s worth anymore. ",
