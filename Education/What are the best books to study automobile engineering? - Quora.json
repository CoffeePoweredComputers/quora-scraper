            "answer_text": "People in automobile engineering are generally passionate about automobiles, and so have the added advantage of working with something they truly appreciate. The job often requires automobile engineers to work under the immense pressure of tight deadlines. The best of jobs are available for the sector so to get the best job one needs to be well acquainted with all the terminologies. The best books can give you a clear idea about the subject. So some of the best books are mentioned below : Principles of Vibration Analysis with Applications in Automotive Engineering Author : C. Q. Liu Ronald L. Huston : This book is written for practicing engineers, designers, researchers, and students, summaries basic vibration theory and established methods for analyzing vibrations. It gives understanding about principle of vibrations and integrates the advances of modern modal analysis, experimental testing, and numerical analysis with fundamental theory. No other book brings all of these topics together under one cover. The authors have compiled these topics, compared them, and provided experience with practical application. Integrated Computer-Aided Design in Automotive Development : Development Processes, Geometric Fundamentals, Methods of CAD, Knowledge-Based Engineering Data Management Author : Hirz Mario, Wilhelm Dietrich, Anton Gfrerrer, Johann Lang : This book provides a valuable overview of the development tools and methods of today . It is targeted not only towards professional project and design engineers, but also to students and to anyone who is interested in state-of-the-art computer-aided development The book begins with an overview of automotive development processes and the principles of virtual product development. Focusing on computer-aided design, a comprehensive outline of the fundamentals of geometry representation provides a deeper insight into the mathematical techniques used to describe and model geometrical elements. Understanding Automotive Electronics An Engineering Perspective Author : William Ribbens It includes mathematical models, providing a qualitative explanation of each subject that requires no mathematical background. Thoroughly updated throughout, this new edition moves away from introductory mechanic-level electronics to cover topics such as automotive camera systems and typical electronic camera systems, hybrid control, AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) and vehicle networks. These are the best books for the subject you can definitely buy these books online from SASTA BOOKS. It is an online bookstore that has books for students at the lowest possible rate. The cash on delivery payment method is available. Along with that additional discounts are given under the My Coupon section. If you are confused between some books you can refer to this website as it contains different section for automobile engineering too. ",

            "answer_text": "Automotive Mechanics by Crouse and Anglin: A classic book. Has been around for a number of years. Attractive and important diagrams are available so it would be great if you buy a multicolored addition. Again I want to add that this book is not for all people. Buy this book if you want to be a real automobile engineer. It is an amazing book and many people will agree with me. Buy the new addition which includes all the latest data. It is great for beginners and students. This books is a great reference book. It will provide you information about all the parts of a car. It also covers the safety of the workshop and discusses the tools. The language is simple and includes a automotive dictionary. Theory of Ground Vehicles by J.Y. Young Great text and reference book for both educational and professional purposes. Discusses about the fundamentals of performance, handling as well as design of the ground vehicles. Authors have done a great job explaining and using mathematical formulas. It is a great resource for automotive engineers as it contains many plots and visuals along with many other overwhelming information. If you want to make yourself expert in a specific topic then this books will provide you with vast information. Fundamentals of vehicle dynamics by Thomas D. Gillespie If you are not from mechanical engineering background but you love automobile then this book is great for you. You just have to know some basic physics and you are ready to go. Automobile engineers give this book a high rating because it provides an easy understanding. Most of the topics are covered with equal importance. The only annoying thing that comes into my mind while going through this book is the units used. It is not in S.I unit or metric unit. It uses English-system for measurement. A meticulous yet easy book for understanding the dynamics and performance including sample problems and solutions. This is one of the best seller automotive engineering books. Internal combustion engines fundamentals by John Heywood Not a best automobile engineering book but it is sometimes called the bible of internal combustion engines. All the answers of questions starting with why, how is present in this book. It has theories and mathematics. But this book doesn't discuss about the high speed SI and turbo diesel engines. The book discusses everything with very much details so sometimes you have to skip some pages to keep your enthusiasm intact. At this moment I have these books in my mind for studying automobile engineering. If you have some more books in your knowledge the you can share and help students and professionals to find the best automobile engineering books. ",
