            "answer_text": "I am not sure there is a consensus on what counts as \u2018good parenting skills\u2019but I do believe that reproduction is a natural mechanism. So our bodies and minds are naturally equipped to be parents. The 9 months of pregnancy help the couple prepare physically and mentally for the challenging task of parenthood. When the baby is born you feel intense love,responsibility and need to protect your baby. Usually these feelings come to you naturally and they help you figure out the rest along the way. The business of keeping your child happy,safe,fed,loved,cherished and pampered. The desire to see them excel in life and become decent human beings. These emotions and earnest well wishes for your child equip you for parenthood. Healthcare professionals give you lots of advice and even pamphlets/books particularly if it is your first child. Hands on experience with your own baby gives you lots of insight. You start hanging out with other parents and swap notes. The more babies you have the more your \u2018parenting skills' improve. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Good parenting skills are usually developed by trial and error. Talk to other parents and discuss the topic. Go to the library and check out parenting books. Remember to respect your children\u2026always. Recall the good parenting skills your parents had and use that as a foundation (if that\u2019s a bad memory, then avoid it) Many schools and churches have parenting classes throughout the year. Read your local newspaper to find out where they are. Some classes are free! Good luck! ",

After having my own kids and taking care of them over the years, I\u2019m still not an expert but I feel comfortable being a parent and know a lot more now about kids than I used to. ",
