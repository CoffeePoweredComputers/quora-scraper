            "answer_text": "I'll start by saying I don't think this is a very useful question. Second, I want to introduce a distinction between caring for their students and doing a good job for their students. Think of all the services we pay for throughout a week. Is it fair to ask if the chef at your local restaurant actually cares about you? Does the clothing store actually care about you? I'm tending to think that these are irrelevant or at least moot questions. These are busy hard-working people. It's not fair of me to expect that they \"care\" about me. It's enough for me if they cook a tasty meal. Returning now to colleges, I'm thinking about all those thousands of professors and administrators that run the place. I don't want them to care about me per se. I want them to do a good job. This is the critical question across the country. If the professors are mainly concerned with instilling certain political and ideological visions, then I think they're doing a lousy job. If you're paying for an education in English Literature, and your professors are trying to create a PC robot then I don't think we can say they care about YOU. They care about what THEY think is true. This is the problem throughout American education from K to 20. I went to one of the famous Ivy League schools and I see the shift in politics in the alumni magazine. I don't like this. I suspect they do not care about me and the things that I think are important. They care about making me agree with their values. That's reckless, selfish stuff but I think it's common throughout our school system, unfortunately.. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written some \u2018critical\u2019 stuff here regarding the University of Caliifornia San Diego campus, and was contacted (my message box is always open) by a seriously concerned Dean there; so yes\u2026 when an individual as high-up in their food chain as she is \u2018wants to know more,\u2019 the concern she expressed really is \u2018care\u2019 for her students. At UC Berkeley a past chancellor used to always go outside, between classes, and be open to \u2018chat up\u2019 students as to how things are going. The concern was focused, and genuine. THAT\u2019S why he got the position. The first UC Merced Dean was also of this character. In business it\u2019s called \u2018management by walking around.\u2019 This means that even for groups larger than a thousand head, the HEAD of the company can be found wondering about, alone, talking to anybody that smiles, or pauses and wishes to speak to them. I use to always arrive a half hour before the rest of staff and the manufacturing floor, and wander about as they enter\u2026 \u2018looking at stuff.\u2019 I often learned about \u2018stuff\u2019 long before middle management had their chance to address it\u2026 and thus I was sometimes so far ahead of the game that at meetings middle management would be caught speechless.

            "answer_text": "Yes they do because if they did not care at least somewhat they would be out of business. The alumni of Universities define their reputation. So it is in their best interest to train high quality people. This means failing people who are not up to par and being selective about who they let in. This might seem unfair / uncaring, but employers and the government are relying on colleges to provide some means of making good choices about who to hire. ",

Students may not always like everything a college or individual prof does, but that is true of all human interaction; it is particularly true in a relationship in which the dynamic is that of student and teacher.
