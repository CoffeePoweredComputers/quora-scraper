            "answer_text": "Are old people a burden to society? I don\u2019t believe old people are a burden to society. However, I believe their antiquated ideologies are. Let me explain. Here in the U.S. the older population (Boomers and older) are quite a conservative bunch (with few exceptions). They come from an America that is starkly different than America now. That, if you just work hard, you will become successful and happy. And, to be American means to be patriotic, supporting our troops and military at all costs. That everyone should own a gun or two and damn you for making it more difficult to do so. That healthcare is a privilege not a right, so quit whining. That socialism is equated to communism or fascism. That all immigrants must be legal to live and work in America regardless of their circumstances. That, if you just go to college, work hard, you can later retire with a full pension from a major corporation. This not to mention, they come from a time of the civil rights era where black people were treated like second class citizens and still looked down upon even today.  Now, guess who the largest voter base is in the U.S.? That\u2019s right. The Boomers. They are bringing their antiquated and conservative mindset to the polls, electing conservative officials, conservative Supreme Court judges, and passing conservative legislation. Often reversing progressive bills that had already passed. One step forward, two steps backward. In other words, America remains a bit backwards not because of technology or lack thereof, not because of resources or a lack thereof, but because of backward and antiquated mindsets that are prevalent among the largest voter base in the U.S. Mindsets that do not align with the realities of today\u2019s world. In a sense, I believe old people are what\u2019s holding America back from progressing, and to where it can be. Contrary to what they say, they don\u2019t really want to Make America Great Again (MAGA), but what they really want is to Make America (Like It Was in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s) Great Again. And, so to this end, yes, I believe old people are a burden to society. But, because it is the right and humane thing to do\u2026 us younger generations will continue to care for them and treat them with dignity regardless of their antiquated beliefs. It\u2019s the progressive thing to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Are old people a burden to society? Our former President Jimmy Carter continues to build houses for Habitat for Humanity at age 92. He is a compassionate elder who serves as a role model, regardless of political opinion. However, even if an older person is not currently \u201cproductive\u201d in material terms or does not serve an inspirational role, they have contributed significantly over their lives, as individuals or as a group, no matter how humble or impressive their status, from the top one percent to the rest of us. Do you really mean \u201cpoor\u201d old people who don\u2019t have sufficient resources to meet the cost of living or need medical care? But then, the elderly folks with resources would be just fine. Maybe when elders file their income tax return each year, their fate should be reviewed? Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d about A for ADULTERY. B in a neon color on your shirt can stand for BURDEN. Elders have taught and raised the next generation, worked in all ranges of occupations that keep the economy functioning, supported causes and promoted values that enhance quality of life, contributed to the Social Security and Medicare system for five or six decades. Many have invented or been involved in developing useful products, important technology, and scientific processes that have improved and strengthened our way of life, including medical advances and innovative forms of communication. Tremendous hardship and misfortune befall many\u2014entire groups without legal protection have been mistreated, even those that served our country or simply because of their identity. They did not have the opportunity to fulfill their potential, or prove their economic value to society, in large part due to systemic flaws and imbalances. If each person had to justify in dollars their right to live or receive social benefits or continue to be a respected member of society, then what are the criteria, what is the cutoff point, who or what (a death or expusion panel?) would make that determination? So many other groups, in addition to elders, can be arbitrarily determined to be a burden to society, isn\u2019t that a frightening vision of the future. Hitler was the arbiter in his country\u2014 he decided that Jews, homosexuals, gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, and other groups were a stain, a burden, on his society. The next step after selecting the inferior group is to marginalize, deprive of rights, spelchek or incarcerate, then DESTROY. Now, in the USA, both immigrants and refugees seeking asylum are added to the list and considered a burden. The line of thinking that would classify entire categories of humanity as burdens\u2014less than human\u2014sickens me. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m 74, and my husband is about to turn 78. We may be old but: We still pay taxes. Regularly. Every year. We actually pay quite a bit in taxes. (What I pay in taxes actually exceeds the amount of state pension I\u2019m paid.) After \u201cgetting old\u201d we raised one grandchild ourselves, and contributed considerable funds to the raising two others. Now all three are out there working and paying taxes. We do volunteer work. Work that wouldn\u2019t get done otherwise. Or work that someone would have to pay to get done. We still pay for what we consume. Food. Heat. Light. Clothing. Transportation. Occasionally amusements. Our money, it seems, is still welcome in the economy. Some of our friends, of a similar age to us and even older, are still employed in the regular economy. We are a regular source of advice to our children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren, and occasionally to other younger folk than us who are not related. What to do when the boiler breaks down. Who to call when this or that happens. What is likely to happen if this or that takes place. Should I do this or that. How can I budget for this when I need to buy that. That\u2019s because, by and large, we lived through those same sorts of crises, had to work out who to call, what could be done, who might be helpful, whether choice X or choice Y was better. Lastly, I\u2019d add that there are younger people who are a \u201cburden\u201d to society. For whatever reason, they are not \u201cproductive\u201d. But then, maybe they are; it depends on how one defines \u201cburden\u201d and \u201cproductive\u201d. The housewife who raised several healthy, happy children to adulthood, looked after her own aged parents and helped keep her husband in employment is not \u201cproductive\u201d if all you count is paid employment. But she\u2019s been productive in many, many other ways. The individual who\u2019s had health issues and is not \u201cproductive\u201d for that reason may, in fact, be making someone else very happy, or helping out as best he can, but he\u2019s not getting even the minimum wage for it. Children below a certain age are certainly not \u201cproductive\u201d, and no doubt there are some who view them as a \u201cburden\u201d. First: define your terms. And then start looking around you.

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cAre old people a burden to society?\u201d Yes. Absolutely. But whatcha gonna do? AT one time a hundred years ago, the rich bastards who own this country, literally, were doing a great job of shaping it for the future. They invested in heavy industry and offered jobs. In those days, just about every job could be learned in just a couple of days. They gave it a great transportation system so people could leave their family farms and get those jobs in the city. But some liberal a$$h0le, elected, re-elected, and re-elected again, got the crazy idea that all those children in the factories and all the farms going to waste, and all those widowed, aged grandmas with no way to make a living, needed to be fixed. So he invented Social Security and the Welfare nanny state. Then, a good war came along, and another bunch of liberals invented GI Bills and home loans, and then there were civil rights and voting rights and affirmative action and all that. Now just about everybody is a burden to society. WELL, ACTUALLY, MAYBE NOT. Because, you see, no one is actually PAYING for all those would-be burdens. We have a pretty low tax rate compared to other countries that provide a lot more for their people\u2014for their society. And we sent a lot of people to school. We educated our country. We eradicated diseases. And we kept our farmers in business, so we never lose the land again, like we did back then. When all those liberal Europeans paid those big taxes, they received in return a nation full of very healthy people living in modern homes with good infrastructure, outstanding education, and a great quality of life that even has many paid holidays and paid maternity leave for the first year of a child\u2019s life. But we don\u2019t pay high taxes. So our people aren\u2019t really a burden, they are just accounted for in debt, sold to the highest bidder for fiat money that isn\u2019t backed up by anything. It\u2019s magic! So I take it back. Old people are not a burden to society\u2014they ARE society. And there IS NO BURDEN, because no one is paying high taxes. The same thinking that says \u201cthose people are a burden\u201d is the same thinking that makes our nation weak, unhealthy, disabled, uneducated, and fully dependent upon perpetual war to keep the GDP up.

            "answer_text": "For background: I am 76 coming on 77. There are many heartwarming answers here, answers that I very much agree with. However, we have to reckon on the underlying argument about being a \u201cburden\u201d. Regardless of its origin (state or private pension, or living off savings), old people who do not work for money, or for whom earned income is only, as in my case, a very small fraction of the total are, in effect, using resources that would otherwise be available to those who still work for their income. Medical expenses (whether state-funded or not) also fall unevenly. In those cold financial terms, some of us will be more of a burden than others. Like many other old people, I am blessed with reasonable health; I still contribute in a voluntary capacity to a variety of endeavours; In a word, I am still useful in ways outside those of family loyalty and support. The fact remains, though, that I am spending, using resources, that would be retained by those younger if I was not there. The idea of \u201cburden\u201d seems to have taken hold because of the apparent drain on state support, although private pensions are just as much paid for by others. And are encountering difficulties as the ratio of old to younger people shifts. The problem is one of scale. With the exception of some less honourable people, family and community obligations (for both old people and their younger relatives) were recognised and valued. When things become less personal, it is easy to see why the notion of a \u201cburden\u201d takes hold as the numbers of old people increases. And we will be less than honest if we do not acknowledge that there is a baby-boomer issue here. However well earned, the sight of wealthy retired folk living it up when much younger folk are struggling, struggling and knowing that their retirement will be less cushy, is not calculated to create empathy. I can, for the time being, put some of this behind me: I am still doing stuff valued by others; we pass as much wealth as possible down the generations. But I might at any time lose my capacity to contribute in a direct and measurable way. The costs of my care might increase greatly. Within a family, such costs might be regarded as simply a duty and the product of love. When pushed out as a cost spread across society, things look different, especially when the volume increases out of proportion to the working population. I don\u2019t have some kind of \u201canswer\u201d. But those of us who are boomers (I just escape, formally, because born in 1943, same difference), would be being less than straightforward if we did not see that those much younger than us have problems we did not have to face.

            "answer_text": " Young people think that they will never grow old. It\u2019s a fact. I felt the same way when I was their age. Now, I\u2019m seventy-four. I couldn\u2019t imagine looking the way I do. I couldn\u2019t imagine feeling the way I do. I couldn\u2019t imagine ever losing that blush of youth. I can imagine it now because I\u2019m living it. I don\u2019t feel like a burden to society quite yet. I was rushing around the house doing laundry, making the bed, cleaning the kitchen, paying bills, showering, and getting dressed to go out. I asked my husband, who was helping me do several of these things, if he thought there would ever be a day when we would need help doing all this. He said yes. I don\u2019t want to live into being a burden. I want to go on my own terms. If I don\u2019t have a mind, if I\u2019m in diapers, if I can\u2019t walk, if I can\u2019t talk, if I can\u2019t continue to contribute to society, I want out. One of the posters to this question pointed out how much older people bring to this world. We know a lot more than young people who think they know everything. I have so much more life experience and so much more life knowledge than younger people do. I\u2019ve lived, I am wise, I am smart, I am capable, and I\u2019ve learned how to be wise, smart and capable in an way that younger people can\u2019t even comprehend. Look carefully over your shoulder, Mr. Questioner. Before you know it, someone younger than you will be asking you the same question. When that happens, then you will understand why the answer is no.

            "answer_text": "\"These are people, our brothers and sisters; maybe their life is unproductive, but productivity is not a justification for killing(\u2026) If all unproductive people may thus be violently eliminated, then woe betide our brave soldiers who return home, wounded, maimed or sick.\" Cardinal Clemens von Galen ( Mar 16, 1878 - Mar 22, 1946): Sermon of 3 August 1941 Aktion T4 was a postwar name for mass murder by involuntary euthanasia in Nazi Germany. The name T4 is an abbreviation of Tiergartenstra\u00dfe 4, a street address of the Chancellery department set up in early 1940, in the Berlin borough of Tiergarten, which recruited and paid personnel associated with T4. Certain German physicians were authorised to select patients \"deemed incurably sick, after most critical medical examination\" and then administer to them a \"mercy death.\" Hitler's order for the \"Aktion T4\" Euthanasia Programme was dated 1 September 1939. From 1939, the regime began its program of euthanasia, under which those deemed \"racially unfit\" were to be \"euthanised\". The senile, the mentally handicapped and mentally ill, epileptics, cripples, children with Down's Syndrome and people with similar afflictions were all to be killed. The killings took place from September 1939 until the end of the war in 1945. The number of victims was originally recorded as 70,273 but this number has been increased by the discovery of victims listed in the archives of the former East Germany. Among those murdered was a cousin of the young Joseph Ratzinger, future Pope Benedict XVI. Church leaders who opposed it \u2013 chiefly the Catholic Bishop Clemens August von Galen of M\u00fcnster and Protestant Bishop Theophil Wurm \u2013 were therefore able to rouse widespread public opposition. Galen's three powerful sermons of July and August 1941 earned him the nickname of the \"Lion of M\u00fcnster\". The sermons were printed and distributed illegally. Hitler wanted to have Galen removed as a bishop, but Goebbels told him this would result in the loss of the loyalty of Westphalia. The sermons protested against Nazi policies on Gestapo terror, euthanasia, forced sterilization, and concentration camps. His attacks on the Nazis were so severe that Nazi official Walter Tiessler proposed in a letter to Martin Bormann that the Bishop be executed. On 3 August 1941, Cardinal von Galen's third sermon described the continued desecration of Catholic churches, the closing of convents and monasteries, and the deportation of mentally ill people to undisclosed destinations, while a notice was sent to family members stating that the person in question had died. This is murder, he exclaimed, unlawful by divine and German law, a rejection of the laws of God. Cardinal von Galen stated in his sermon, \u201cNo, these are not the reasons why these unfortunate patients are to be put to death. It is simply because that according to some doctor, or because of the decision of some committee, they have no longer a right to live because they are \u2018unproductive citizens\u2019. The opinion is that since they can no longer make money, they are obsolete machines, comparable with some old cow that can no longer give milk or some horse that has gone lame. What is the lot of unproductive machines and cattle? They are destroyed (\u2026)Once admit the right to kill unproductive persons . . . then none of us can be sure of his life. \u201c He said he had forwarded his evidence to the State Attorney. If that were indeed a justification for execution, he reasoned, everybody would have to be afraid to even go to a doctor for fear of what might be discovered. The social fabric would be affected. Galen then remarked that a regime which can do away with the Fifth Commandment (\"Thou shalt not murder.\") can destroy the other commandments as well. Galen went on to raise the question of whether permanently injured German soldiers would fall under the programme as well. Thousands of copies of the sermons were circulated throughout Germany. The resulting local protests in Germany broke the secrecy that had surrounded the euthanasia programme.

Some fool posted on here that people over 50 should be restricted to being greeters in Walmart. This is not only offensive but incredibly stupid since people of this age have college degrees and experience worth far more than that of a kid fresh out of a school whose curriculum was dumbed down after the Baby Boomers graduated. What I have been seeing lately is evidence that many younger Millennials and Generation Z want all the Boomers to die and get out of their way. Sorry, but they're not going away to please you. They came of age to find a world with changing workplace environments, less respect for the education and expertise they worked their butts off for, massive inflation, and the escalating cost of education that was consistently being dumbed down while the next generation was growing up. If you are advocating Logan's Run, watch it again. You will see that this situation would be a huge loss to you even before your time would come. ",

They\u2019re either a burden to the extended family who has to watch them when the parents can\u2019t because the parents can\u2019t afford to pay a babysitter. If they receive any kind of government handout, they\u2019re a burden. Teenagers can be a burden when they cause car accidents as new drivers without experience, with needing expensive programs in school to satisfy the myraid desires for sports, band, drama, etc. and all the extra-curricular activities that we the citizens pay for through our property taxes. Young people who demand higher minimum wage put a burden on all of us through increased cost for services and those who have become addicted to drugs through loss of our hard-earned possesions due to theft or the cost of incarcerating them. Middle-aged people who become disabled and have to live off of disability, funded by those who paid taxes before them and those still paying taxes. Not to mention those addicted to alcohol who take the lives of loved ones. And then there are old people. Some have planned ahead and were lucky enough to earn enough money or work for a company with a good pension plan and have no financial worries. There are those living on $800 a month in social security, but wait, they paid into that social security so that doesn\u2019t make them an automatic burden. If they pay their own bills, take care of their homes, do their own chores, grocery shopping, doctor\u2019s visits and don\u2019t ask for help from anyone (most are too proud to do so), then who exactly are they a burden on? If they get Alzheimer\u2019s or something that requires them to go to a nursing home and they can\u2019t pay for it, all their assets are liquidated to pay for their care. When that runs out, then Medicaid will pay for a crappy nursing home, but at that point are they any different than the poor who have medicaid, WIC, food stamps, welfare, section 8 housing? Being human and needing help isn\u2019t a crime\u2014unless you\u2019re scamming the system which happens a lot, but usually not by old people. ",

But that is their call, no one else has the right to do it for them. There will always be people with a calling for care giving. They WANT Infants, Indigents, Invalids, and the Infirm to care for, wash, feed, comfort. Their heart needs, even requires, these people for its fondest expression. Where would Florence Nightingale have been without them? and Clara Barton? and\u2026wait for it\u2026Mother Teresa\u2014and, for that matter, my Dear Cousin, Doreen, in Orange County, who has done nothing but care for ailing and dependent members of her family her entire life, with nary a whimper of complaint.

            "answer_text": "My grandmother\u2019s mother lived with her daughter (my grandmother) until she died at 85.  (Credit- UNFPR Myanmar) She never worked. She was a wife of a very rich land merchant in unpartitioned India. When borders were set in papers, she, her husband and a preteen daughter were clueless. They were to pack all they could and leave, or get killed. They chose former. They packed whatever they could and somehow managed to stay alive and came to Gurgaon, Haryana in India. She was uneducated but understood the power of education. She encouraged her daughter to study hard, which she did and ended up being a professor after securing two masters. She supported her daughter by taking care of her kids, while grandmother studied and then worked. She helped my grandmother a great deal in managing the house. She ensured that my father and his siblings go to school and study. She filled the void and emptiness of the house. She was full of love and warmth for everyone in the family. Although she went from riches to being nothing almost overnight but it never frustrated her. In fact, she stopped being materialistic after that lesson. Even when she could do very little of physical work, she would chop vegetables, sew clothes, massage her grandchildren and great grandchildren, feed the little ones, received guests. She did everything she could in her power. Even when my father got married and all his siblings did- she went to stay with all her grandchildren for a couple of weeks every year. She spoiled us and even at the age of 70, preferred to cook and of course, we preferred her cooking over anything in the world. There were more family gatherings when she was alive. Life was more alive with her. She was home. Home was her. She died and left a void that none could fill. My father is almost 63 but still feels that something is amiss. No, old people aren\u2019t burden. Old people are the bases of any family. They are to be respected and treasured for the world would be so restless without old people. ",

Are adults who work full time a burden on society. Still, yes. Did that last one throw you a bit? A working adult is spending time outside of the house, using fossil fueled transportation to get to and from work, not caring for their children while they are at work, not exercising while they are at work, not caring for the elderly while they are at work\u2026 Everyone is a burden on society. Even the pre-born are sometimes the cause of loss of productivity because their mom\u2019s have to take time off work to make a human being. Your entire childhood is a burden on society. At what age did you become a productive adult? I know people in their 80\u2019s who still go to work every week. Maybe not a full time job, but a job nonetheless. Are they a burden or are they being productive? I ask this because the 80 year old who doesn\u2019t want to retire is not vacating their position for someone younger to take over. Who is the burden in that case, the 80 year old or the young unemployed person? I\u2019ve also seen plenty of adults in their prime years living on the streets and sucking up tax resources as homelessness is a huge handicap in becoming a productive member of society. I would ask the questioner, are you a burden on society? ",

I have a BA+ one year and ended up with a disability so I had to quit my teaching position. Will I be a burden to society when my money is gone? Someone who is in skilled nursing facility and on Medicaid and Social Security, are they a burden? All of these people are just as important to our society, they were once young too. They were instrumental in bringing our society to what it is now. They are our history books. They started the traditions that we celebrate today.They pass down family stories that show us where we came from. They let us know who our relatives were. Would someone want to call young people a burden to society? It sounds like someone wants to whisk the elderly away out of society's eyes and ears so they would not have to see or hear about them. What would happen if someone wanted to get rid of the elderly? That's a hypothetical question but who knows? ",

I know many die in their 70\u2032s and of course some in their 90\u2019s as well . If we though get rid of or neglect old people or seniors as just because they appear to be a weight or burden that cannot be right and how can you spin it as right [ ?] . And they might be a burden but have a right to live especially when they choose to . My source is the bible and first if you kill the old people God is not going to say good job son . I would not want to become guilty of making it so old people are killed as if exterminated as a burden . Some are warning now that many might feel they should be some day gotten rid of ! Which it should still be such a outrage and how can it be fulyl justified even ? I wanted to comment that if persons say it only is a matter of survival or evolution well i would think the guilt is on them or what else can i say ? Humans are still yet not mere animals anyway. Old people might be such a burden , but so are vandalizing young people as well and those doing crazy stuff . See also my feeling is we kill or rid ourselves of certain groups of people than there may be no end to what else we might think to kill off. BUT for any moment if we choose some how to kill innocent humans we need to first treat them very nice and comfortable until they die to the second or to the hilt , which has to cost something too but still it is a guilty wrong or unethical to almost kill the innocent souls thus .There is another problem we may get so greedy and can be so spoiled at least it seems.

If that\u2019s your limited view on the meaning of human life, what they produce and what financial resources you can extract from them, then your answer is yes. Otherwise, the old people are the most precious source of wisdom you will ever find, if you are ever willing to look outside your small box. They are a fascinating living history, the product of another era that created this one we are seeing now. You can\u2019t get close to life itself than observing blooming and fading flowers, leaves, seasons: blooming and fading life, creating the next life. The smiles of elderlies and the smiles of babies are the same smile, same life in various stages - same soul in a brand new or worn out shell, hands that grew up to be used, eyes that got week because they have seen things. While we are born looking very similar, every face of an elderly person tells a very different story, moments of sadness, happiness, obstacles to overcome, fights that were fought - it\u2019s something magical about it.

The opening prayer, a couple of songs, and the reading of the scripture are complete. The pastor spoke about the contributions that the grandparents gave our church, the community, and their families. He asks the seniors stand for acknowledgment. The senior citizens are standing. There is that quiet fleeting moment when you can hear a pin drop. Suddenly, there is the clear piping voice of a little three-year-old child, \u201caren\u2019t you going to stand up, mommy?\u201d The church roars with laughter. The seniors are laughing the most! They laugh until tears are rolling down their cheeks. \u201cOld\u201d or \u201csenior\u201d is a matter of perception.

The longer answer is that \u201cold people\u201d is just a subset of \u201cpeople\u201d\u2014an entirely subjectively drawn subset I should add\u2014and since what is true of the larger group must be true of any subsets, what is true of people is still true when they become old people and people in general are the biggest burden imaginable on society. This all seems counter-intuitive because people create(-d) society for their own protection, advancement, and to better provide for all of their own needs (including any special needs which might develop in old age). Yet, not only do people resent society\u2019s demand that those same people at least tolerate other people including the people who happen to be older than they are, but people usually resent and dislike society as a whole. And it gets worse: People not only dislike society, but they tend to believe that society actually dislikes them as well, even on an individual basis. In the end then, people are doomed to suffer one another in the thing which they themselves have constructed to provide for the betterment of all.

I like hanging around the elderly more than hanging around people my age. The insight they provide is so interesting. They offer a window into completely different times, offer perspective to my own life, and gift me with lots and lots of tips. Why, I suspect the only reason anybody could claim that old people are a burden is because we\u2019re not making the most out of what they have to offer. I\u2019m surprised life mentoring isn\u2019t more mainstream. Imagine if troubled youths such as those with drug addiction problems, teenage pregnancy, delinquency etc. could be paired up with an older mentor who experienced and overcame all that. It would make a big impact on mental illness. ",

            "answer_text": "Surprisingly I was thinking about the same on my evening walk today evening. The reason - my mother in law refused to take care of my husband\u2019 paternal grand father. My mother in law n sister in law just didn\u2019t didn\u2019t want to take care of my father in law\u2019 father. My husband\u2019 grand father was 90 plus yrs old and non of the sons wished to stay with him so it was decided that he would stay for four months with each son. When it was my father in law\u2019 turn, my mother in law n my 40 something unmarried sister in law created a big issue out of it. Sadly we were visiting them at that time and I even told them that they were forming a bad impression on my daughter - their grand daughter. They couldn\u2019t expect her to respect them and take care of them if they weren\u2019t taking care of their elderly. My sister in law who is unmarried, unemployed and unapologetic considers my in laws house right fully hers and had the audacity to speak the maximum against her grandfather. She was later shameless to ask for a part in the grand father\u2019 property after his demise. My own mother despite her ill health had taken care of her mentally challenged brother for 20 yrs. My mother in law\u2019 argument was that such responsibilities cause stress and should be avoided n that my uncle was the reason for my mom\u2019 poor health. my argument : Aren\u2019t we a responsibility as children ? But our parents don\u2019t discard us. Why the progress in medical science for increasing the life span of humans ? Why the endeavour to nurture n preserve human life if we cannot take care of the elderly. Don\u2019t we all wish to live to a ripe old age ? Don\u2019t we expect care from the younger generation? Then why can\u2019t we take care of the elderly. The elderly have contributed to the society through taxes. Even their pension is taxable. Hence the state has to look after them. it\u2019s a circle of life \u2026 I wish karma started to play it\u2019s role again. ",

If you judge old people to be a burden, then you judge that their net benefit to society is negative. So, how do you suppose people provide benefit to society? That\u2019s where you need to think about your question. If you believe that work and production are the primary benefit that society derives from a person, then old people become a burden. If you believe that knowledge and wisdom can all be found in books and on the internet, then old people become a burden. If you believe that most people have no intrinsic value, then you must know that you also have no intrinsic value, and you, like old people, are already a burden on society. How do you like them apples? Edit: (first answered 7/14/18, edit of 9/17/19) Each person is important to every other person for collective existence. This is a profound statement (selected from a larger statement of \u201cThe Aloha Spirit\u201d) which explains the fundamental relationship we all have with life and the world. Nobody is a burden. To think otherwise is to sow pain and chaos in the world in which you must live. ",

            "answer_text": "Any parent knows that while children bring joy they are also a burden. First they parasite for nine months on their mother and then they need constant feeding, drinking, cleaning and attention. Things get somewhat better after a couple of years, where you only have to make sure that there is food available and they just plunder the fridge, and you don\u2019t have to take care about moving them around yet instead you worry about them moving around. You\u2019ve been a child once and you were a burden to your parents.You might live long enough to become somewhat of a burden to \u201csociety\u201d, where your parents are long gone and your children might have departed as well - if you had any. In that case others have to take care of you, because there is nobody else available. And in many societies even though the kids live they care little, because society changed in such a way that this is no longer possible. This should be sufficient to consider that you might perceive old people as a burden, yet it\u2019s less of a burden than raising a child and we all have been one. ",

Picture what this country would look like if all the people before you did not exist. I have always paid my way and I still do. I collect Social Security and I have Medicare but that money has been set aside for that purpose. I don\u2019t know if you are aware of this but the money that is in that Social Security Fund has been used by the government to keep it running for along time. It has borrowed from SS and yes Interest has been paid but sooner or later the bubble will burst and someone will have to pay the piper. It is a dangerous financial position that this country is in and we need our elected officials to start paying attention. But your question is answer with a resounding NO. We are still paying our way and in a lot of ways we are still giving back with the Seniors that volunteer every day to help a lot of society get along. So just think about what I said in the beginning and I hope that you have a few elders in your family or community that could teach you a thing or two about a lot of things. Because like me, my body is falling down around me but my brain still beings something to the table. ",

Also, a significant percentage of people in between young and old are a burden to society. That is what society is. We choose to work together and to share the weight of burdens, because in sharing burdens, the weight is quite manageable. And because we realize that at some point, each person is a burden, but each person is also a gift, and brings something of value to our whole. We must treasure our elders, while we have them with us, and enjoy the wisdom and knowledge that they have accumulated. (Also, to keep them on their toes, inject an occasional \u201cok boomer\u201d.) When did \u201cburden\u201d become a bad word? I will gladly carry more. Some day, my children will gladly carry me. ",

            "answer_text": "No more so than the smoker who disregards all the global information of cancer warnings yet continues his habit - who picks up his medical expenses? Answer: everyone, through higher insurance premiums or Medicare/Medicaid costs. Same situation with bikers who ignore the common sense of wearing a helmet - when they crash and burn every one of us helps to pay for their medical expenses. Seniors pay all their working life into Social Security but seldom see a dollar for dollar return on their mandated investment. If you take into account what we feed our bodies in these past 100+ years its no small wonder why we become such a drain on society as we age. We're our own worst enemy as we are so gullible (me included) to accept what our government tells us to eat. Why is it that every week we see new medical snake oils to fix what we continue to do to ourselves - nasty circle of events. For reference take a peek at \"What The Health\" or \"Game Changers\" on Netflix or Amazon Prime - may change your thinking a bit about what you put in your mouth. But then again, if you think there is not a problem with our climate, may not change anything at all... ",

            "answer_text": "Where does the Thought Path that leads someone to this Question go Next? If someone wants to travel this thought-path, they should look at the next step . . . drug addicts who aren\u2019t contributing members of society who commit crimes. Oh, such a slippery slope they travel, unaware of the destination. From there, what other differences will be targetted? Diversity is a source of strength. It would be so much easier to make a case that drug addicts are a burden than for many older people . . . Older people have wisdom, contribute mightly through both working and volunteerism, pay taxes, support their families emotionally and financially, support the economy through the products and services they purchase, and provide a sense of continuity that helps people understand the circle of life and remind people of lessons they shouldn\u2019t have forgotten. Drug addicts are not paying taxes, may be producing drug-addicted babies and committing crimes. I am not arguing that drug addicts are a burden. Humanity must value humans. You never know the value someone may add or what someone might become with a change of direction . . . Someone who believes that a perfect life is a bed of roses without thorns is a greater burden to society than an elderly person.

A typical anonymous troll Quora user hasn\u2019t really started their productive years. Many old people still work, helping families, taking care of the youngest, and doing all kinds of charity work. The ones that don\u2019t, contribute to society as consumers. Buying stuff, traveling, or using medical services. In addition, old people have worked all their lives have forgotten more than you ever knew, created most of what you have ever seen, and own most of what exist. If anything, you (and me, and everybody) are more of a burden to them because you use and enjoy the fruits of what they created. As people get elder and infirm, it is as much our societal responsibility to care for them as it was for your parents to care for you when you were a child. So be nice, because once day - should you be so lucky to live that long, which I hope you are - you will also be that age. And you will be ashamed of having asked these questions, and annoyed that young whipper-snappers dare question you after everything you\u2019ve done for them. ",

Grandma and grandpa didn\u2019t become useless burdens, they just changed a little in the work they contributed to the family. You took care of everybody in your family, from infant to elderly, and you did it within in a convenient natural setup. Some things would be a pain in the ass, but overall they were not a burden. The Industrial Revolution is very recent. The idea of dragging all the most work-hardy people to a particular place to perform an industrial task is new.

It is the same society they have contributed to and would like to reap the harvest in their last stage of life. We all are product of time. We had been invested upon, then we paid back and then there is a \u2018comfort phase\u2019 for which they are the rightful earners. There is a very large fleet of oldies who continue contributing till their 70s. They are energetic and intelligent. They pass on legacy for others to follow the steps. SOCIETY SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR THEIR PRESENCE. Thanks for reading the above feelings. ",
