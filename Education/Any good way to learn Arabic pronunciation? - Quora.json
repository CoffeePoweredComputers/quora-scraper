            "answer_text": "Use your tongue and first feel the portion of mouth behind the upper teeth. You can feel a hard fart portion of mouth. This portion is called alveolar ridge. Then move your tongue behind the alveolar ridge you can feel the dome shaped part of mouth. This dome shaped part is called palate. There is also another part called velar ridge behind palate that cannot be touched by the tip of the tongue. This can be touched only by back of tongue. When we pronounce letter k or g our tongue touches velar ridge. Alveolar ridge is used in pronunciation of n, t and d. Fricatives are consonants with characteristics that when they are produced air escapes through a small passage and makes a hissing sound. There is no contact between tongue and mouth . There is a small gap between tongue and mouth. Fricatives are letter s , z , sh, ch. Articulation happens when the tongue either touches / is in contact with alveolar, palatal and velar ridge. Each pair of the following have same place of articulation but they differ in usage of vocal cords. No Vocal cords / vocal cords T / D P / B S / Z K / G Ch / Sh Those consonants which use vocal cords are called voiced consonants. Velarised consonants are consonants in which the mid/back of tongue is near the velar ridge . Exampl \u0628 Or B When two lips come in contact and we suddenly open our mouth we pronounce the letter b. We use vocal cords. Th of the word \"the\" For Native speaker the consonant is a fricative pronounced when the tongue is about to touch the upper teeth but doesn't touch the teeth. T It is pronounced when our tongue touches the alvelor ridge. Only the tip of the tongue touches the alveolar ridge. \u062a This consonant is pronounced when the tip of tongue touches the back gums of upper teeth. The alvelor ridge is completely in contact with portion of tongue behind tip of tongue whereas for t only the tip of tongue is in contact with alveolar ridge and the tip is little behind the articulation of t. \u0637 The articulation is similar to \u062a but the mid/back tongue is near to touch the velar ridge where as the tongue is not near velar ridge as \u062a. It sounds like the of the for Asians or non native speakers. \u062f This consonant has same articulation of \u062a but vocal cords are used in this. It sounds like the of the for Asians or non native speakers. \u0632 This consonant is about to touch the alveolar like but doesn't touch the alveolar ridge. It sounds like Z. \u0636 This consonant has same articulation like but the mid/back of tonue is near the velar ridge but doesn't contact velar ridge. The side of tongue touches the side teeth . It sounds like z. \u0638 This consonant has same articulation like but the mid/back of tonue is near the velar ridge but doesn't contact velar ridge. The side of tongue does not touch the side teeth like . Vocal cords are used. It sounds like z . \u0633 This letter is produced like \u062a but the difference is that the tongue doesn't touch the alveolar ridge and it gives way for air to pass. It sounds like s . \u0635 This letter has articulation as \u0633 but the mid/back of tonue is near the velar ridge but doesn't contact velar ridge. Try to pronounce ksa you will find difficulty while pronouncing this . Now avoid making k sound but the tongue should be near velar ridge. It sounds like s . \u062b This pronounced like th of thin pronounced by native speakers. The tip of tongue is behind the front upper teeth , it is not near the alveolar ridge . Tongue doesn't contact teeth. It lets air to pass through gap. It sounds like a for non native speakers. \u0630 This pronounced like th of thin pronounced by native speakers. The tip of tongue is behind the front upper teeth , it is not near the alveolar ridge . Tongue doesn't contact teeth. It lets air to pass through gap. For a native speaker it sounds like th of word the and for non native speaker it sounds like z . \u0634 This articulation is alveolar palatal. The half of front part of tongue is near the alveolar ridge similar to s and half of the front part of tongue is near the palatal region this half part doesn't contact the palate. The front part of tongue is not in contact with mouth roof. It is like sh in ship. \u062c This articulation is alveolar palatal. The half of front part of tongue is in contact with the alveolar ridge similar to t and half of the front part of tongue is near the palatal region this half part doesn't contact the palate. It is like j in jug. \u0644 The articulation is same as \u062a but the tongue remains in contact with alveolar ridge . Air passes through the sides of the standing tongue. \u0643 The mid/back of tongue touches the velar ridge. The air is trapped and released. \u0642 The back of tongue is in contact with throat much deeper than velar ridge. It is not like k. \u062d The back of tongue is near with throat much deeper than velar ridge but doesn't touch the throat. It is much like but it is a fricative. \u062e The back of tongue is near with throat much deeper than velar ridge but doesn't touch the throat .Also the mid/back of tongue is near the velar ridge but doesn't contact it. \u0639 The back of tongue is near throat much deeper than velar ridge but doesn't touch the throat . There is no h sound in this . Vocal cords are used in this just as we pronounce vowels. \u063a The back of tongue is near throat much deeper than velar ridge but doesn't touch the throat . The mid/back tongue is near velar ridge. It is much like \u062e. The difference between them is using vocal cordsThere is no h sound in this . Vocal cords are used in this just as we pronounce vowels \u0641 The upper teeth come in slight with lower lip . Air is passed . Air is passed through the small gap between upper teeth and lower lip . \u0649 The mid of tongue is near the palate . There is no contact. Vocal cords are used. \u0648 The lips are slightly rounded. Less Air passes through the slightly rounded lips . Vocals cord are used. \u0629 Air is passed through vocal cords. There is no relation of tongue and mouth in this consonant. Pronounced like vowel in cup. \u0646 The consonant has same articulation as \u062a but no air passes out of mouth . Slight air passes through nose . Nose is very important in this consonant pronunciation. \u0621 Air is suddenly stopped by the closure of vocal cords. Mostly heard in native speakers pronunciation of t in hat. They don't make t sound there but a glottal stop. \u0631 For native speakers the tongue goes near the alveolar ridge but doesn't contact with it. Lips are rounded . Vocal cords are used. For Asians or non native speakers it is a flap. The tongue comes and contacts the alveolar ridge and then releases the air suddenly. Just try to pronounce rr made by tractors. Arabic \u0631 is similar to Asians R. Rounding lips are not used in pronunciation of Arabic letters. Rounding of lips is done for sh, ch, j and r of English but not done in any Arabic alphabets. Vowels. \u201cu\" Is much like the vowel in took . \u201cuu\"Is much like long vowel in spoon. \u201ca\u201d much like the vowel in cup. \u201caa\u201dIs much like long vowel in far. \u201cI\"Is much like vowel in spin. \u201cIi\"Is much like long vowel in teen.

            "answer_text": "The following answer is a copy of my answer to a similar question about Arabic pronunciation:  I agree that the Arabic language is one of the most difficult languages  (and occasionally I would see even the news anchors have to correct  their pronunciations, despite their linguistic skills), and initially, I  had to pass on this question about 12 hours ago, because I didn't see  myself as qualified to answer it.  However, I have reconsidered in light  of Mr. Rommel Wang's (the person who raised the question) persistence,  and due to the lack of answers since it was posted yesterday, Monday*.    Please consider the following as my current answer, and since this is  my first effort at answering such a question, I would add any  clarifications or additional materials in the comments section, with my  best wishes: 1-  I would strongly suggest that one doesn't over-emphasize the vowels and  consonants and their accents, or configurations   \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u0643\u064a\u0644because in  most books, newspapers, magazine articles, online texts, etc...written  in the Arabic language don't include the accents at all (not even on the  last letter), i.e., it's not important to know the accent over each  letter, but rather only at the last letter (if at all), which one gets  to know by learning, habit or instinctively. 2-   Since, I don't know the questioner's current level, I would assume that  he's in the beginner's stage and suggest the following four online  resources on \"you tube\" in an offhand manner, since I didn't research  the subject: a-       (this video appears to  teach phonetic pronunciations for beginner's, and I suggest the related  videos, including the musical ones, for different levels). b-      : How to Write the Arabic Alphabet! EASY & FREE Tutorial Basic Arabic Letters  c-          This series is  provided by \"Iftih ya Simsim\"  \u0625\u0641\u062a\u062d \u064a\u0627 \u0633\u0645\u0633\u0645or \"Open (the Door)  Sesame!\"which is related to the children's program \"Sesame Street;\" and  even though I'm not a teacher or other expert, I would also recommend  that beginners consider other children programming including the Arabic  version of Teletubbies, or those provided locally by \"Tyoor Al Jana\"   \u0637\u064a\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0629 / \"The Birds of Paradise\"  or   \"Baraem Today\" i.e., \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0645  \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \"The Children of Today.\" d- I would also consider the free video products of companies like the\"Khan Academy, \" such as at the following link: Khan Academy *: Since a similar question was asked on Saturday, I intend to post a  copy of this answer on that question's page as well, in case it can be  of use to others.

            "answer_text": "I prepared this answer for a similar question which was deleted just now while I was writing. I'm a native English speaker, so obviously you are better off learning from a native Arabic speaker. But maybe the tricks I learned while struggling to learn unfamiliar Arabic sounds 50 years ago will help someone else. The h sound in Ahmad is the letter hha. It is an unvoiced pharyngeal stop pronounced at the base of the throat. More about it later. The corresponding voiced pharyngeal stop is the letter `ayin. When I studied Arabic 50 years ago, I went around for weeks trying unsuccessfully to say it. One day, in the Boston Zoo, I heard a camel make a sound very much like that in its throat. I imitated it, and I think it's a fair approximation of an `ayin. I don't intend any insult. Hebrew still has that sound among some speakers, and maybe guttural sounds like that are natural in a desert climate. Once I figured out `ayin, I figured out its unvoiced form hha (hhet in Hebrew), as in Ahmad about which you asked. The letter qaf, as pronounced in readings of the Qur'an and in Modern Standard Arabic, but not in many spoken Arabic dialects, is a k in the back of your throat, like the cawing of a crow. The letter ghayin is somewhat like a French r. The 4 emphatic letters sahd, dahd, tah, thah are pronounced by pushing the middle of your tongue against the roof of your mouth and pulling it away suddenly while pronouncing s, d, t, or th as in that. I think dahd is easiest to learn first. These letters color adjacent vowels darker. The kh sound is rough, like Scottish ch in loch. But you should listen to recordings of native Arabic speakers making these sounds. Look in Google. And maybe you need a tutor to listen to you. ",

            "answer_text": "To learn pronunciation you have first to learn makharij Alhoroof (the emission points of the letters). It tells you exactly where should you place your tougue and lips. Just search it and you will find videos and photos on this.   \u200b\u200bThe second thing is try to read a \"mushakkal\" book, you will notice that the writing and pronunciation are matching. There are some exception like (\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0639\u0645\u0631\u0648\u060c \u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 ) but mostly they match. Later, reading a non-mushakkal book is not a big deal. The difficulty in Arabic is not in the pronunciation (except makharij Alhoroof in the beginning which needs exercise) but in (\u0627\u0644\u0646\u062d\u0648 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0631\u0641 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0629).

However, you say that there are exceptions in the letter combination and spelling: do you mean that it's the fact that the consonant letters change their form depending on the surrounding letters? If so that may not be a problem with pronunciation as such, but with the writing system. There's another factor, which is that the exact pronunciation of a sound, as in other languages generally, does vary according to the surrounding sounds. If the vowel (not the letter) /a/ is preceded by the consonant /S/ (sa:d) the 'a' is not pronounced as it is when it's preceded by /s/ (si:n). ",
