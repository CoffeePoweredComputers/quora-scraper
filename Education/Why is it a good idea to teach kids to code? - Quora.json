            "answer_text": "Regardless of making coding as your career, Coding is important for every kid to learn in this era. Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them. Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future. Coding helps children with communication, creativity, math, writing, and confidence. Some reasons to define why teaching coding to kids is a good idea :- Coding teaches children how to think.Computer programming is the future.Coding helps children learn how to have fun with math.It increases a kid\u2019s IQ and EQ (Intelligence quotient and Emotional Quotient ).A child expands their creativity when they learn how to code.Computer programming gives kids a challenge and helps them develop resilience.Programming helps children learn to problem-solve.Apart from all these, a kid should have knowledge about the technical innovations in this tech-focused world and for all this a kid should be introduced to coding at early age. WhiteHat Jr. is the platform that I noticed which is focusing on all of the above points along with best coding courses to kids of age 6 to 14 years. WhiteHat Jr. is a good platform for autistic children to learn coding, as WhiteHat provides 1 on 1 live video training for kids where they can learn at the comfort of the homes without any distraction. Also, there is a certified educator for every child who is always there to clear any doubts on the spot. WhiteHat Jr. states that their mission is to prepare kids for the digital future by making them creators of tech instead of being mere consumers. This is one of the fundamental reasons why kids should be introduced to code at an early age. It prepares them to face the bold future.\" Join them to make your kid grow according to the growing technologies. Regards!! ",

            "answer_text": "Teaching Coding to kids is a great idea for sure as it opens new doors of opportunities and can help define career goals for your child. Learning how to code builds on independence so that the child has the confidence to work independently and passionately. It's important for kids to learn about coding as early as possible because as per the NASA study, it identified that kids peak in creativity at age 6, followed by a drastic decline right until adulthood and beyond. Hence, coding can be very fruitful at an early age as it the best time of life where the creativity of a person is at its peak and it slowly declines with passing years.  Technology has improvised so much and this is the age of globalization and enhanced machine learning. Since technology is the future, and the knowledge of coding will be demanded by any recruiter from the industry a few years down the lane, hence coding must be taught to young kids at an early age either in schools or at home. Coding serves as several benefits such as: Kids can learn decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking to solve problems logically. It also balances the left and right brain and enables peak creative expression.Kids can build on their analytical skills, attention to detail, and persistence to create tangible code as good as tech entrepreneurs, ready for products to commercialize in the world.Coding in several ways increases the skills and abilities of an individual to a much higher level than other non-coders. The need for coding and computer programming is definitely going to increase in the coming years and so my kind advice for all parents would be to get their children enrolled for coding classes as it is the Ultimate Future. So, let's motivate and guide our children to give it a good try at the earliest before he gets overburdened with his school tasks and regular academics. ",
