            "answer_text": "Depends on what you want to do, your resources, your aspirations and any limitations ; Do you want to be rich, famous, well-loved, powerful - do you like working with people or with machines, with teams or on your own? All these are readings  about your true self that will help you in choosing a direction. For health/medical area and speaking in general, Nursing and Pharmacy are areas that are continuing to enjoy a decent (and sustained) demand in the economically advanced regions of the world;  With molecular/genome based medicine coming, Labs will be increasingly important.  Finally, there are some exciting things with imaging and Radiology, if that is an area you like. In short, there are many diverse areas . I suggest that you go to a library/bookstore and get some interesting books that will give you some guidance or provoke some self-reflection: here's an example: What Should I Do with My Life?: The True Story of People Who Answered the Ultimate Question: Po Bronson: 9780345485922: Amazon.com: Books  Before you make a firm commitment, you may want to spend some time with someone who has already made similar decisions.  Good luck, ",

            "answer_text": "In the UK, I believe The National Health Service, NHS, will take Associates / HNDs for trainee Accountancy jobs in the Finance department. I think you would train for the CIPFA accountancy qualification. That's the recognised accountancy qualification for The UK Public Sector. I think only A levels are required to register as a student with any of the Accountancy professional institutes;  whose exams you will be sitting. ( The other Accountancy institutes are The ACCA, ACA, CA, & CIMA ). However there are an awful lot of unemployed or underemployed graduates out there in The UK. So you'll be competing with graduates for those trainee positions I would have thought.  In the UK there are also 2 year graduate conversion courses for graduates who wish to qualify as a Nurse, Physiotherapist, or as a Medical radiographic technician. But I don't know if they take Associate degree holders. Maybe they do because it is possible to register as an  MSc student at a university with only an Associate degree. I think the procedure is the Associate first registers on to the Postgraduate Diploma course, but attends the same classes as the MSc students. Then if you pass the end of year exams at the MSc level ( usually an overall score of 50% or better ), the university will then allow you to adjust your registration so you can continue on to the Research project stage of the MSc course. Then if you pass the project you are awarded an MSc just like your classmates who were registered as MSc students from Day one of the course. I have a cousin who has a HND and an MSc but no BSc; so I know it's a possible. My cousin was studying Computer Science however. Graduate conversion courses are listed along with all other postgraduate courses on offer in the UK on www.prospects.ac.uk  So if you contact the course provider they can tell you what's possible.All NHS vacancies are advertised on their website.  I don't know much about the USA apart from the fact Nurse Anaesthetists in America earn on average $159000 per annum.  ie it's one of the highest paying occupations in the USA. However for that Nursing speciality you'll need a Master's in the speciality. I know that Michigan State University runs 18 month Nursing degree conversion courses for graduates. You would then need to complete a 1 year MS Nurse Anaesthetist degree to qualify as a Nurse Anaesthetist. Then work your way up to that $159k average salary. That average runs as high as $200k in some states. Good luck. ",
