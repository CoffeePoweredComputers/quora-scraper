            "answer_text": "Many people have asked the same question on this Forum and I have replied more or less the same, except tailoring to their income & needs. The basic rules of investing involves knowing how much to invest and for how long? For that you need to know your surplus income/investable income to plan for your financial life. Gross sum is not useful, you need to plan out net income, expenses, possible savings etc before you embark on a financial planning journey. There are many ways to invest but investing systematically will help you in the long run. Before you start investing off, the first thing to do is have 6 months worth of your expenses in your bank account. This is because incase you lose your job (assuming you are a salaried employee) you will not have income, but expenses only till you find the next job. This money is to tide you over that period, which you can leave in an FD earning 7.25% pre tax. U need to take health insurance (take separately even if your employer provides one for you) for yourself (assuming you are single) early on, so that you can get exemption on pre-existing diseases later on. A Rs. 5 lakh policy should be more than sufficient which can be increased later on upon marriage or when you have children. Useful for tax exemption. After that you need to take term insurance (life insurance) to the amount equal to the liabilities/loans that you have so that incase of any unfortunate circumstances they will be paid in full. Term insurances are cheap in earlier part of life when you are young. A 1 cr term plan will cost you less than 10,000 Rs. Useful for tax exemption. Once you have secured all the above then you should start investing. Equity mutual funds, direct investing in stock markets will yield more than 18% on an average, if your holding period is more than 8 years. PPF, EPF, Corporate bonds, will yield anywhere between 6 - 9% on an average investment over a 15 year period. Liquid funds, fixed deposits, debentures, government bonds will yield a post tax return of 6.5% on an average holding period of 3 - 5 years. If you have a girl child aged <10 years, then you can invest in the sukanya samruddhi yojana for a maximum amount of Rs. 150,000. Details of the same are provided here. [1]  First, start investing in PPF for the maximum limit of Rs. 150,000 each year for a interest of 8.7% compounded annually for a period of 15 years, this will yield a sizable sum which you can use in 15 years for either starting your own business or down payment of the house or for your other needs. PPF also helps you in meeting the 80C requirements (tax exemption). Second, start investing in SIP of mutual funds - fixed amounts in the beginning and then start increasing the allocation by 10- 15% each year, as your salary increases. There are many good mutual funds that should get you started off. If you complete all these then you can start investing in direct equities, in small amounts across varied sectors. Invest Rs. 50,000 per month (or an amount based on your monthly income & savings) through SIP of 10 mutual funds spread across categories. Out of the below mentioned schemes, Pick 1 scheme from each sector/class. Also, pick growth option or dividend reinvestment option. Picking 2 funds in small and midcap is important, they act as a booster for your returns in some years giving 50 - 60% returns. Important to pick dividend reinvestment option, so that any dividend declared will be reinvested for you to get more units at a lower price as compared to future years. 1. Pharma 2. Banking 3. Technology 4. Power 5. FMCG 6. Large Cap 7. Small and Mid cap (S&M Cap) 8. Small and Mid cap (S&M Cap) 9. Diversified Equity 10. Balanced  You can do this allocation till you have exhausted the Rs. 10 lakhs or incase of a monthly income, for a period of 20 years or till your retirement, then I am sure you will have sizable amount that would have compounded at the rate of 15 - 18% each year. You would be financially secure and ready to support all your life goals of marriage, children's education, owning a home and leaving enough for retirement. Hope I have been able to provide you some direction. Incase you have any questions, please feel to write and I will be happy to help you out to the best of my knowledge. Happy Investing.
