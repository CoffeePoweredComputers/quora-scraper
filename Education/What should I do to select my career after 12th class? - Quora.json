If you are in the XII th,urgently consult a Career guide to determine your aptitudes and make a choice. It is always ideal to start at Std VII or VIII and orient your preparation for the higher studies on those lines. Anyway, get the aptitude testing done quickly and start with some supplementary training to bridge any skill gaps, like learning Geometrical drawing and free hand drawing, and model making for those choosing Architecture, undergoing voice culture and histrionics training for those choosing to become actors, etc Whatever the choice you make, make a serious appraisal of your abilities and weak areas. Strenthen your abilities and quickly become strong in your weak areas, during the first year in College. Whether it is a Three year Degree Course or any specialized professional degree, the first two years should be utilised to thoroughly work the basics till you can do the tests easily. This foundation wil determine how easily you will progress in the chosen profession later in life. Don\u2019t waste time.Give the study all you can. Learn new skills. Also pleae look up my earlier answers to the same question in identical or modified language. ",
