            "answer_text": "Hello, I have been alloted GMC BADAUN in my state first counselling. I visited there so the institution is still under construction though it has been completed for first year students and also for there next year. Hospital is also not fully completed OPD is working with fair amount of load. Trauma centre is under construction. Faculty here is good and looks promising. Campus is approx 5 km away from city. Now acc. to me it will still require atleast two years to get completed in major aspects. It can be a good choice if u are going for new GMCs. Thanks. ",
