            "answer_text": "After reading over all these answers I guess I am abnormal. The only class I got a B+ in was French, but this didn\u2019t stop me from passing the French philosophy baccalaureate after high school. I started getting straight As in junior high and I don\u2019t remembering studying very hard (but I don\u2019t remember doing anything else either). My primary \u201cstrategy\u201d was to be curious about what my classes would be in the future. I studied algebra in library books before entering 6th grade. I asked my teacher if we would be studying algebra that year. She just smiled and shook her head, not saying a word. I have no idea what she was thinking, but I continued studying algebra on my own, so when I did Algebra 1 and 2 in 7th and 9th grade, I got A\u2019s and continued to get As in math throughout high school. So learn how to learn on your own and you will be able to keep learning the rest of your life! My second strategy (according to what is written in yearbooks) was to spend much of my study time explaining the material to classmates. You need to learn the material well to be able to answer questions that you hadn\u2019t thought to ask. This is the first advice given to law students, form study groups! Don\u2019t sit there by yourself wondering for hours why the first derivative of a logarithmic function involves an inverse. The problem then becomes who to ask to be in your study group. In law school you are required to do 8 hours of studying per day, every day, plus classes, and social drinking (aka networking). This is to push you to your limits: Will you be able to work to deadline for 168 hours (in a week) sleeping in naps and drinking kefir to stop your stomach from growling? So you divide up your subjects and one or two people focus on contracts, property, civil procedure etc. Unfortunately there are freeloaders who focus on networking and don\u2019t spend time figuring out the significance of the Fountainbleau case. Instead, in high school have a study group for each class. The primary purpose is for you to learn the material, so if someone in your study group doesn\u2019t keep up, don\u2019t worry about it: just work harder. Bottom line (1) be curious and learn how to teach yourself and (2) be cooperative with your classmates. You are not competing with them, you are competing with every high school student in the world. Teams of teens are always more supportive than one teen! ",

            "answer_text": "In high school, your grades serve one purpose: to get you into college. Because of this, GPA is extremely important because it can help in the admissions process to your top colleges and also when applying to scholarships. Having just applied to a bunch of colleges and scholarships as a senior in high school, I have seen first hand how useful they can be. But, also from experience, grades aren\u2019t everything. I had a weighted GPA of 4.2 on a 4.0 scale, which isn\u2019t too bad, and just short of a perfect score on the ACT, but I still didn\u2019t make it into more than half of the schools I applied to (of course, most of the schools I applied to were highly selective schools with acceptance rates of about 10\u201315%). But I digress. The reason I wanted to mention that is that you certainly want to do everything just to look good. That\u2019s a bad idea. Instead, you want to participate in and do well in activities and classes that you actually enjoy. So, first I suggest is that you try and balance the two, preferably with the high level courses in your strongest subjects. Don't try to be completely well-rounded. That doesn't make you special, contrary to what everyone else might say. You certainly want spikes, with certain areas demonstrating having a much stronger area. You kinda want to learn to be the math kid, the science kid, the history kid, the drama kid, the athlete, etc. Choose one an just be the best at it. Now, I'm not saying that you should just give up in all other areas. But I'm certainly not advocating that you try to be the best at everything. It's counterproductive. You end up losing a lot of time, building up a lot of stress, and never reaching a solid aptitude in any particular field. So now that you've gone on to balancing out your courseload, do the same with your extracurriculars. Don't overload yourself with after-school activities. Choose a few activities where you really devote your time and move up the ladder. Everyone would prefer to see that you were in one or two clubs but as the president of those clubs rather than merely members of 10 clubs. Finding a good balance in your extracurriculars will also enable you to find time for homework and anything else that maters in your life.

Finding a good balance in your extracurriculars will also enable you to find time for homework and anything else that maters in your life. So, now, to actually being a straight-A student. Unless you are just a naturally gifted student, especially one with a photographic memory, getting straight A's will be difficult, but nowhere near impossible. It merely takes a lot of work and commitment. The first step is obvious. Study. Find other students in your class who may be at a similar or higher level than you in the class, maybe some people who are already getting straight A's. Even if you can't meet up with them all the time to study, you can certainly have them show you a few different studying methods. Maybe you'll like one of them. And when it comes to homework, unless it's a big assignment, don't place to much effort into it. I know, you're probably screaming, \"What?\" But trust me, half the time, the homework assigned turns out to be busy work. I think that completing these assignments quickly and efficiently can allow for actual studying while at least indicating whether you know the material or not. But ALWAYS do the homework. Most times it's a busy work, but as I said before, it can indicate how. I have of the material you know. And a lot of times, the homework will be worth free points. Now, the second point is that you must develop relationships with your teachers. It's absolutely essential. They can be a lot of help one-on- one when the material doesn't make sense and they can certainly offer help in other classes and provide great recommendation letters. Third of all, you want to find the perfect place to study, and bring along the proper tools. Notecards, notebooks, textbooks, pens, pencils, and highlighters. And create a system for note-taking. You want to find a way that you can write the information down somewhere because it will help you retain the information better, but you want to do it in a way that is quick enough so that you don\u2019t waste too much time writing everything down. And please choose a place without distractions. It can be so hard to not get distracted sometimes. So I usually advise that students go to libraries to study. Why? Because the library is generally a quiet place to stay, with internet and computers if needed, and you\u2019re always surrounded by books. And it\u2019s also a great place to meet up with friends and go study together. All in all, getting straight A's can be easy. But if you want some difficulty in your classes and want to show colleges and employers that you are motivated, you want to take the more difficult classes. Good grades depends on balances within your schedule and setting up relationships. You need to learn to study, and it's very important to find your learning style early on. And you need to stay motivated. Don't get hit by any senioritis early on. Remember that you're responsible for your own education. Don't lose easy points for homework, and use your resources to do well on tests. Always, ALWAYS study. You can't expect to do well if you don't put in the work. Just follow these steps, and you're sure to be on the path to straight A's. You'll be able to refine this plan once you find your own rhythm and system. Good luck! You got this! ",

            "answer_text": "So you want straight A\u2019s, huh? Well here\u2019s how you do it, coming from a guy who\u2019s only been a straight-A student for a single semester in his life and spent the rest of the time messing around. Let\u2019s get started. Get ready to say goodbye to your social life because holy shit you will have little to no spare time This is the entire reason I abandoned my pursuit of good grades in the first place. It\u2019s so time-consuming and stressful. You\u2019ll have to alienate all your friends when they invite you out and you have to say \u201cSorry no I have to study\u201d so many times they think you hate them. If you\u2019re responsible in high school you\u2019ll be juggling a hell of a lot. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re taking a full plate of classes, you play a sport, you\u2019ve got a part-time job and you hang out with your friends. You\u2019ll probably get no sleep and explode from exhaustion at some time throughout this shit. So prioritise. If you asked this question then I assume you\u2019ve chosen to prioritise your grades over several other things in teenage life. So my advice is hold off on getting a part-time joblimit your extracurriculars; you\u2019ll be spending a lotta time studying and contrary to what everyone seems to think, being in a marching band won\u2019t make universities like you betterdon\u2019t go on super super time-wasting social events or events that have a really long recovery time e.g. binge drinking, drug benders, full-day hangouts. Limit it to the length of a movie. Or just see a movieNow for the studying thing. Find your favourite flavor of gum and load up on it. Chew that flavour in class, when studying, when researching and during tests/exams. Only chew it during academic activities. This is for two purposes. For one, chewing it only when studying will do some association thing where you start almost liking studying cause you like the gum. For two, chewing the same flavour every time will lead to better memory retention. Hence sticking to the same flavour.Get your typing speed up as high as you can possibly get itDon\u2019t highlight. Highlighting don\u2019t do shit and are for people who read things over twice cause they didn\u2019t understand it the first time.Type out all the notes you get verbatim. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve gotta get your typing speed up, so it\u2019s not too time-consuming.Typing out your notes, plus the gum, leads to maximum retention of everything. What sticks with you is usually most importantIf you insist on studying late at night and messing up your sleep schedule, No-Doz, Red Bull and Ritalin are your best friends. Both for the night and for waking up the next morning.Learn your school\u2019s referencing system off by heart so you can cite your sources without having to google how to do it every timeGood luck, y\u2019all. Hopefully your pursuit of academic excellence is successful. I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it, but then again I\u2019m the same guy to nearly kill himself from binge drinking and get a Venn Diagram tattooed on his wrist, so don\u2019t listen to me.

            "answer_text": "For one thing, many students who enter high school find it to be a very different game than what they had experienced before then. They are suddenly thrown into an environment where the academic level is more challenging, the teachers are more demanding, and - most of all - there is suddenly far more competition for the top grades. Everyone knows that K-8 is all just preparatory, and while you need to do well, your future is not going to be determined by whether you get an A or a B or even an occasional C in any particular subject. When you get to high school, however, the brighter kids who have always assumed (and their parents expected) would be college bound quickly realize that now things are different, now the grades do matter, and a single non-A grade in just one class could make the difference between whether or not they get into the college of their dreams. Thus, the really serious and motivated students step it up big time, and quickly, and leave the other students - which, unfortunately, includes you at the moment - in their dust. Just to warn you, this whole phenomenon will repeat at an even greater level of intensity when you start college. Fortunately, it is not too late for you to make some changes and salvage your high school experience. It sounds like you have already damaged your GPA, and so class valedictorian is probably beyond reach for you - and maybe some of the most selective colleges as well. Nevertheless, there is still time for you to step it up, finish strong, and position yourself to have some good college options. Even with your best effort, though, you might not make straight As. This depends to some extent on your competition. If you are attending a school with a lot of very bright kids, you might still get beat out for the top grades in some courses. A lot depends on the teacher: some will reward top grades to all who earn them, no matter how many that may be. Others may \u201cgrade on the curve\u201d - either by personal conviction or because they were ordered to do so. I would suggest just resolving to do your personal best and not worry about the competition or how your grades compare to theirs. Doing A-worthy work in high school does require quite a step up from middle school. There will be a further step up when you get to college, or when you take AP or dual-enrollment courses. The general rule of thumb is two hours of study for every hour of class in high school and a 3:1 ratio for college-level classes. Of course these are just rules of thumb, and the actual amount of time needed will vary somewhat depending upon the student and the course. In most cases, though, the difference is in the direction of more, and not less, time being needed. It is pretty clear that most high school students don\u2019t come any where close to this 2:1 ratio, and quite a few college-level students aren\u2019t hitting 3:1 either. Simply blocking out enough study time in your schedule to make sure you are hitting these ratios will go far toward assuring that you are at least in pack and will be competitive. Time alone won\u2019t be enough, though. You also have to study smart. Give yourself breaks, get plenty of sleep and exercise, and eat right to keep your brain at its peak. Set up a good study area, organize your notes and materials, and ruthlessly eliminate all distractions. You need to put intensive effort into your studying; quality, not quantity, is the key. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a straight A student myself and honestly people definitely exaggerate when they say you will have no social life if you want straight A\u2019s. Of course some people need to give up on their social life in order to have time to study but I myself for example never have to do that. I graduated high school (well, secondary school since I\u2019m not in America) this year and never studied more than like 5 hours a day. Most of the times I studied half an hour and then got distracted for around 15 minutes and then started again. Sometimes I didn\u2019t get distracted and it was easier to memorize it all but things like getting distracted and having struggle to memorize is something everybody experiences. But getting A\u2019s is not the most difficult thing in the world. It\u2019s really just about how you study. If you know how to study efficiently you won\u2019t need to give up on anything you\u2019re doing tbh. You just need to find out the studying method that works best for you, start off early enough and repeat your stuff and of course take enough breaks or else you will actually go insane. I actually made a video where I talk a bit more about that, so if you want to check it out, here you go:  ",

            "answer_text": "Build good habits, especially sleep. This is quite possibly the most important. Not only should you work to develop studying and work habits, but even simple habits like washing your face every morning, cleaning your room, tidying your desk, not checking your phone often, clearing your email etc. When tasks like those become habit, it\u2019s much easier to focus on your larger goals. Sleep is the number one habit you should work on. While it\u2019s near impossible to get 8 hours of sleep on a school night (for me anyways, I wake up at 6AM), you should always have a goal of at least 7 hours. Now it may seem hard at first going to bed earlier AND doing everything you need to do, but trust me its worth it. When you\u2019re in class you\u2019ll be able to focus better and you\u2019ll retain a lot of the information, which means you don\u2019t have to study as much. Plus, you\u2019ll come off as a nicer person in general. Building habits is not easy. There\u2019s different methods that work for each person. Personally, I used apps on my phone. Productive and SleepTown worked best. Productive was great for tracking any habit I wanted and SleepTown was great for forcing me to go to bed and wake up on time by restricting my phone access. I was essentially parenting myself. But find whatever works for you, sometimes apps aren\u2019t that useful. Learn to beat procrastination through willpower, not motivation. You\u2019ll hear a lot about motivation. But the hard truth is, you\u2019re never going to WANT to do your math homework. Motivation is simply the reason why you are about to do an action. What you need is willpower, and here\u2019s why: Procrastination is not just a human thing. It\u2019s an animal thing. For example, when two hyenas meet at the border of their territories, both dogs will proceed to dig a hole in the ground. This is because the hyena is confused if they should cross the border to protect their territory or respect the boundary and walk away. There is a conflict of instinct, so the hyena therefore does neither option until the other hyena makes a move. When you have a project due in a few days, you feel a pressure to start the project because you know you want to avoid doing it the night before. But at the same time, you also want to avoid doing the project at that moment, because you\u2019re tired and it\u2019s not an activity that you enjoy or benefit from directly. So of course you do neither and stare at your phone for three hours. You are conflicted between wanting the thing to be done, but not wanting to do it. You can overcome this through WILLPOWER! Not motivation. Willpower, in this case, is the ability to overcome instinct and conflict. Obviously, the assignment can\u2019t be done without you doing it, so you have to push through. Usually this \u201cpush\u201d comes when it\u2019s the night before and you panic, commonly known as the procrastination tipping point, but you want to avoid that. Willpower is like a muscle. And like any muscle, you can strengthen it through exercise. I used chores as my exercise. For example, one morning I randomly took all of my clean laundry that I hadn\u2019t put away and dumped it all over my bed, forcing me to put it away. You can use any progression of small tasks to build your willpower. This is how some people seem to just get home and immediately start their homework! Prioritize and organize Not only should you write a to-do list, but write it in a very specific order. Whatever work is due directly the next day, do that first. It\u2019ll take it off your shoulders. Start with something easy, like a quick worksheet (I usually start with chemistry because I find it easy). Use it like a \u201cwarm-up\u201d the same way you would for a workout. Also include a cool down like vocabulary studying. Put the large projects and assignments in the middle. You can come up with your own system, but this is what I suggest. Learn to focus Focus is another muscle that needs exercise. The ability to get \u201cin the zone\u201d and work for hours on end is extremely useful, especially when the environment in which you\u2019re working is not quiet or peaceful. I used the app Forest, in which you plant a tree for a set amount of time, and during that time period you can\u2019t use your phone or else the tree dies. I also listen to lo-fi hip hop/jazz with headphones in to block out any other noise. Both of these things help me focus purely on what I\u2019m doing. Meditation can also help, especially mindfulness. While I can\u2019t speak from experience, I know many people find this useful as they develop the ability to block out distracting thoughts while they work. Work faster and smarter Sometimes studying for 45 min is just as effective (if not MORE effective) than studying 3 hours. The length of time does not matter as much as the material you cover and how you cover it. As said before, everyone has different methods that work for them, but here are my main tips: Use Quizlet for vocabulary. If you haven\u2019t used it before, start using it now!Study for math or any similar subjects using practice problems. Ask your teacher for extra practice or look something up.Use online videos like Khan Academy and Crash Course to do a quick review if you\u2019re in a pinch. While your notes and textbook are the best source, these videos help when you only have about 15 minutes.For humanities subjects (especially history or government) draw flowcharts and other visual representations of knowledge. It\u2019ll help you draw connections between all of the things you\u2019re learning. It\u2019s easier to remember one multi-faceted concept than multiple simple topics.As you\u2019ve probably heard before, don\u2019t study all the night before. When you\u2019re given a new vocabulary list for a language, make a Quizlet right away! Start learning right away! You know there\u2019s going to be a quiz eventually. Prepare for the inevitable, because often times teachers don\u2019t announce things early enough.There\u2019s other ways to work faster, and most of it comes from practice. I can type very fast and I tend to work at a VERY fast pace which gives me a huge advantage. I developed this speed by using my summer homework (which I get a lot of) as \u201ctraining,\u201d setting a timer and seeing how much I could finish before the timer was up (while still submitting quality work!) It\u2019s tough and there\u2019s a limit, but keep trying. (Also can you see my theme of treating school like athletics? Oddly enough I\u2019m not an athlete\u2026) Finally, learn when to give up. You can\u2019t win every battle. Sometimes, you\u2019ll bomb a quiz you studied really hard for. Sometimes you\u2019ll get home too late and you can\u2019t finish your homework. Sometimes you just don\u2019t get it and the extra help isn\u2019t working. Sometimes you\u2019ll stare blankly at the paper and feel like you\u2019re brain dead. It\u2019s okay to fail. It\u2019s not the end of the world. Just keep trying. Remember to take breaks. I never do homework on Fridays. Ever. I never stay up past 10PM, not even for homework (unless it\u2019s a group project and I\u2019d ruin other people\u2019s grades). Sometimes I say \u201cscrew it\u201d and just nap the whole afternoon. I still get As though! Take care of yourself, take mental health days if you need it, see your counselor if you need it, talk to who you need to talk to. Don\u2019t ever prioritize school over your mental health. It\u2019s just not worth it. For context: I\u2019m a straight-A student in a magnet program in which I take highly advanced humanities courses (plus STEM stuff if I want to). I take piano lessons, I\u2019m in choir, and participate in stage crew. I get home around 5:30 each night. I\u2019ve been in a magnet program since 6th grade. ",

What should I do, Doctor?\" A doctor would then begin to ask questions among them - are you doing anything differently this year than last year? To which question one could give many answers like - this year I only sleep two to three hours a night. With that kind of answer, Doctor would get an idea of why you don't feel well this year and prescribe more sleep and possibly something to help you sleep. What 's different about this year than last? It's quite remarkable for an A/B student to become a D/F student - that's not an accident, that doesn't just happen. 10th grade may be more difficult than 9th but there's not enough difference between 9th and 10th grade curriculum to doom A/B students to Ds and Fs. And your skills were strong enough in 9th grade to warrant As and Bs - the answer does not lie in your skills. Skills don't slide downhill between 9th and 10th grade. If you were a capable reader and writer last year, you still have those skills this year. So what is different? Is your attendance at school still regular? Are you in school most days? Prior to your panic attacks - were you paying reasonable attention in class? Have you been handing in homework and on time? Are your homework grades decent grades or are your homework and test grades both spiraling down? Do you have a history of panic attacks prior to this year? Your Ds and Fs this year are not the problem - they're a symptom of the problem. To answer your question, more information is needed but even without it it's safe to say - you could get on top of this. A/B students can return to being A/B students. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends: What kind of straight A student do you want to be? There are two types: Easily made A\u2019s and slightly more challenging but still pretty easily made straight A\u2019s. Easily made A\u2019s To achieve this level of straight A\u2019s, take on-level classes where no studying is required. Attend class, and pay attention. That's it. That\u2019s all you have to do. Slightly more challenging but still pretty easily made straight A\u2019s To achieve this level of straight A\u2019s, take all AP or honors classes. Expect to have projects, homework, and a tad bit of studying. However, here's the key here: it is not difficult. There is more work and it is slightly more challenging, but as long as you apply yourself with the mentality that you can succeed, you will. If you wrap your mind around the fact that these classes aren't really more difficult than the on-level ones; rather, there is more work and it is in greater depth, you're going to have your A\u2019s. This is the most important thing about high school that academically inclined kids need to remember: straight A\u2019s don\u2019t matter. A B is fine every now and then. The important part is understanding the material, retaining it, and knowing how to apply it later on. I made a 98 in Algebra II, because I wanted an A. My problem was that I wasn't truly learning the information. I was retaining it for as long as I needed it for my A and then it was gone. That was two years ago, and as I type this, I've not the slightest clue how to do Algebra II. I'm not dumber than I was, but I didn't let the material become a part of me, and now I couldn't recall how to do those problems to save my life. TL;DR: A\u2019s are cool, but understanding and retention are cooler. Don't get so caught up in straight A\u2019s that you forget to learn something. ",

            "answer_text": "Study smart, not hard. This might seem like a cliche line which probably every revision Youtuber says, but it's actually true. If you want to improve your grades shift to a goal-oriented study rather than a time-oriented study. You may see your peers boasting about the hours they have put in studying Physics or studying and creating notes on Psychology, while you just feel how unproductive you have been. But in fact, all they have done is waste hours of time and energy on a thing which might have taken much less time than they think. What is a goal-oriented study? Studying through goals. Each day you write down your aims and you complete it. Show dedication towards your goals. Don\u2019t sleep without completing it. In the long run, you will notice how sometimes you are able to study longer hours without even realizing it! In the time-oriented study, you tend to set an unrealistic hour of study and create a mental block that after this I will no longer be able to be productive. For example, say you thought that today I will study for 8 hours, you open a book and you start studying, after some time you check the watch 1 hour has passed you think damn 6 hours worth of study left, a mental block is created because \u201c6 hours\u201d is a big figure, you start feeling lethargic and you get distracted, some think that we 6 hours left, I can do it after some time, and thus you end up being unproductive. In the goal-oriented study, you know that you have one whole day, you have to complete your goals so that you can go on and accomplish new goals tomorrow. If you start following this, you will read ahead of classes, understand much more than your peers, and complete your syllabus much before the examination, which will give you time to revise thoroughly using the very same method. Dedication and discipline will help a lot in getting the most out of this technique. If you pair this up with a good note-taking method it can get much more effective! ",

            "answer_text": "Here are the three methods ways that come to my mind: Learn how to learn. This is the obvious one that everyone points out. Learn how to be more efficient with your studying. If you get a bad grade on a test, figure out what you can adjust when studying for the next one. Create methods for note taking and stay organized. Review consistently throughout the school year, and always think about how you can improve.Take easier classes. Going into high school, I took three honors courses and stuck on the honors/AP tracks throughout high school. My grades suffered as a result. I also have friends that did not take the honors/AP route and study less while getting better grades and a superior GPA. Think about this a lot first, because it\u2019s harder to enter an honors/AP track later on than it is to drop.Take classes you enjoy. It\u2019s a lot easier to get better grades in a class when one actually likes the subject material.HOWEVER, consider why you want straight A\u2019s in the first place. While it looks nice on transcripts, it\u2019s really not that important. I can understand if you want straight A\u2019s to show colleges, because I\u2019m going through the application process right now, but in 10 years, will anyone really care whether you got an A or B in any of your classes? Will you care? Chances are, that\u2019s a hard no. Challenging yourself and learning as much as you can is far more important to your personal development and career than a letter on paper ever will.

            "answer_text": "From my experience of being in high school, I have developed a few habits that have helped me thus far. Now, I don\u2019t know exactly who you are, what you excel at, or how well you are currently doing in school at this moment, but I have three important tips that can truly enhance your experience and help boost your grade up to reach a 4.0 (or higher) GPA. Motivation and Focus. Although many people would like great grades and excellent test scores, they find it daunting to actually study hard and work for it. Hence, motivation comes in. If you truly want to get an A in your class, you have to study for it. You don\u2019t have to study like a maniac nor do you have to cut time off with your friends/family just because of the Biology Exam you have in a day or two. Find time to study, before or after school. Do you spend some extra time before school, having nothing to do or no where to go? Go over your notes and annotate/highlight them through, rereading the concepts you understand and emphasizing the areas that you may be weakest at. It is difficult at times to comprehend various different concepts at the same time and it may seem overwhelming, and that\u2019s alright, it\u2019s a natural feeling many students know well. I feel that way frequently in my Chemistry class. You have online resources (Khan Academy being one of the best) that will help you. If you put your mind to it, you will achieve great things, I can assure you that. If you put in the effort, it will bear fruit.Organization and Time Management. I cannot stress how important being organized is, especially in high school and especially if your juggling through numerous AP classes or Honors classes. If you can invest in a cheap planner/calendar to keep your notes in, please do. Write down important dates (exam dates, pop quizzes, assignment due dates, etc\u2026) and manage your time well to not only study for the tests but to get your needed assignments finished on time and with great effort. Do not slack off to the last minute. Most teachers will know and realize if you wrote this up in the period before. Do not risk getting a docked grade because you forget an assignment date, either. Write everything down, it helps tremendously.If You\u2019ve Studied But Still Don\u2019t Get It, Ask Your Teacher or a Tutor. My mom always tells me that it\u2019s better to ask questions, no matter how stupid they seem, than to sit there in silence and get no answers. If you have any questions, write them down and ask your teacher perhaps after class or after school. If your teacher can\u2019t help, then find a tutor who is willing to help as well. Teachers ( at least most of them ) are willing to help you if you are willing to seek help. There\u2019s no shame in asking for help if you truly don\u2019t get what\u2019s being asked of you.Personally, I have gone through my high schools years thus far getting straight A\u2019s and good grades on my mid-terms and finals rather easily, but I realize that for other people, it may be difficult. I hope the above tips will help guide you in a similar direction and help give you the motivation that you need to strive for success. P.S. Please, don\u2019t cheat your way through high school either. Not only does this guarantee a fail in the assignment/class/course, but it ruins your reputation for a substantial amount of time unless you are able to mend your mistakes, which is a difficult task to do. Be honest and humble when it comes to your work. ",

            "answer_text": "Getting straight A\u2019s in High School can be difficult, but not impossible. I\u2019ve said this before in a post: grades are not indicative of your intelligence but instead a sign of the hard work that you\u2019ve put in. The reason A\u2019s are so difficult to get for some is because it requires a good amount of time put in. Think of it like this, if you have a trip to China coming up in 1 year, but you only practice Chinese for half an hour once or twice a month, you really think you will be proficient in Chinese by the time your trip comes? Probably not. It\u2019s the same with grades. You need to put in the time to show that you\u2019ve mastered the material. My suggestion would be to manage your time wisely. There are a lot of courses you take in high school at once. Put in more study time for the courses that you find difficult and less into the ones you find easy. Also, ask questions. Do not skip over anything that you\u2019re unsure about. Sometimes, class moves fast and has no time to go back and give you a full explanation of what they spent 1 full class talking about. Another is to set realistic goals. If you\u2019re averaging C\u2019s in a class, instead of A\u2019s and B\u2019s, and you\u2019re still looking to score an A, chances are, you won\u2019t. But still, try to do your best and score your best despite the odds. Sometimes, things work in your favor if you display hard work in the end. For example, I once scored C\u2019s and D\u2019s on all of my exams for one of my toughest chemistry courses I took during undergrad. I somehow scored an A in the class. Apparently, if you scored above 95% on the final, your final grade replaces your overall grade. It was a strange grading system, but to my professor, it displayed something different (also, his final really was brutal, most students were happy to score a 60% on the final to keep their C). Since you want to balance gaming and school, definitely time management is key here. Set a strict hour for gaming in your day, and the rest for school. You have the weekends to game for many hours, save the weekdays for school. ",

            "answer_text": "Although I may be completely wrong, this seems like a high schooler burning out. This year, are you taking a lot more Honors or AP classes than last year? If so, that\u2019s most likely it. Since your school most likely has counselors, try to talk to your counselor to readjust your schedule for easier classes. Take Honors and AP classes for things you actually like. For example, if you want to be a writer, you should most likely not be taking AP Calculus in your Sophomore Year. Although it will be hard to come back from failing grades, with easier classes it should be plausible to get a passing grade. In the unlikely chance it is not because you\u2019re taking harder classes, it might be extracurriculars and other things in your life. Trying to juggle community service, daily instrumental practicing, playing multiple sports, a social life, etc. all while trying to get the 9 hours of recommended sleep might be too much. Talk to your parents about perhaps removing a couple and only keeping things that you know you\u2019ll be able to handle. If you can\u2019t identify with either of those, definitely talk to a school counselor. If your school doesn\u2019t offer one, talk to your parents about it to contact a separate counselor who is knowledgeable in studying habits. If you\u2019re getting F\u2019s right now, it will be almost impossible to get straight A\u2019s this year. However, this doesn\u2019t mean just give up even for this semester. With drastic changes, it will be much easier to get straight A\u2019s in subsequent semesters and years. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is to work smarter, not harder. It is entirely possible to have good grades, a social life, and a sleep schedule that\u2019s not too bad, contrary to Ethan James\u2019 answer. First things first: Get a sleep schedule. Make it so your day revolves around this. Also, make sure you get around 7\u20139 hours of sleep: that\u2019s crucial.Start rereading the materials taught in class. This may or may not take long (depending on whether you can read fast or not).Do not procrastinate. No matter how smart you are. Do all your homework on or before time if you can - be reasonable, of course. Yes, this may sometimes mean you squeeze time in on the weekends to do homework.Pay attention in class. Simple. You can always take time to write notes outside of class. But pay attention in class, for the love of God.Study for a test by rereading something. Go make an outline. Treat the whole experience like a conspiracy theory or an activity you like so that you actually remember things.Memorizing something? Go by rote memory: do flash cards 3\u20134 times. Then take a break. Do something else. Then come back to the flash cards. Try this, and believe me, it legitimately works.Try to explain stuff in your own words to your classmates. Explaining helps you understand more, too.Make your notes fun. Highlight things so they stick out in your brain and you remember them.Last: don\u2019t get too stressed out. That wrecks everything. Chill for an hour or two, and go watch TV or text or something.I\u2019ve been doing all this for eleven years. It\u2019s worked. ",

            "answer_text": "It is past December 20, but I figured I should say Hello. First off, if grades are the only thing that truly make you happpy, you need to find a few other things to enjoy. Even though you need to focus on school, paying attention to only schoolwork will drive most people nuts. I do have some experience with poor study skills, though my experiences are possibly different than yours. When I was in grade school I was extremely smart and very good at my academics. I had a little trouble with homework due to muscle fatigue, but I seldom needed to study. It was pretty easy, and I had a really good memory. I was a weird and shy kid, who didn\u2019t have a good sense of the appropriate. When I went to junior high I was still decent on my academics, but I was starting to have a little trouble. Tests could be a little trickier, I couldn\u2019t do longer assignments well\u2026 but I still tested well. Only a few friends, but that was OK. High school was more difficult. My first school wasn\u2019t particularly rigorous academically but even so I started doing poorly in English. Writing was a pain. Things really started going downhill at my second high school. I had trouble taking notes. I didn\u2019t do well my first year there, barely passing French by the skin of my teeth. Three or four of my classmates weren\u2019t so lucky. I think the teacher wasn\u2019t very good, but still. I had a few friends in high school but had trouble socializing. In college I had serious difficulty. My study skills weren\u2019t very good at all and I had trouble with longer-term planning for work. I ended up flunking out\u2014you seem to be worried about the high school equivalent, being held back a year. I was more interested in pretty much anything other than academics. Seven years ago I made the decision to go back to college. I\u2019d been in the workforce for a while and was better at focusing on work when I knew what the work was. I asked my parents for help with a laptop computer so I could take notes more easily, which they did. I do not know what will make the difference for you. For me, suddenly being able to take high quality notes meant I took more notes and didn\u2019t sweat so much about hand cramps or timing, as I am much faster at typing than writing longhand. I remembered the material better when I typed it into notes. Review was easier when I had my own notes. I think you need to review what you\u2019re doing. You mentioned trouble studying. Is this just trouble reading the material? Are you attentive during lectures and actually understanding what the teacher is saying? Also, you need to talk to your teachers. Don\u2019t go in there to ask for a better grade\u2014grades are earned. Tell your teacher that you have difficulty understanding the material. Go over the things you don\u2019t understand. Mention that you have trouble with the study materials. It is entirely possible that all of this is on you, yes; but it is also possible that you need some assistance you haven\u2019t had before, especially in study skills. Ask for that help. If they say No, get it in writing. Use the written refusal to move to the next person up the chain. Fight to improve your education. I cannot fight that fight for you, but from my little corner of the world I can support you while you do. It can get better. When I graduated college four years ago, many years after flunking out, I graduated summa cum laude with a departmental award. ",

            "answer_text": "You know what, straight A\u2019s is a joke. I used to have straight As, until I got a B in Spanish, and I think that is the best thing that has happened to me. It kicked me right in the a**, and taught me that I should know how to study, and not worry about grades all the time, because grades are only a part of yourself. In University applications, if that is you are worried about, you have the chance to make another impression by the other work you have done. Grades is not everything, for example, I am Student Council President, and have done a lot of work in reforms in the school, at the oppurtunity cost to have perfect grades. But besides, you should really find something else to get happy about. There are so many things, such as helping another person. As a tutor, I find one of my greatest pleasures comes from helping a student and seeing them grasp the concept and perform well in the next test! For studying, I would recommend that you start following these steps as they helped for me in getting my Spanish Grade back up. Destress, and stop worrying about every little thing that goes wrong. There will be several like this. Learn to let go.Clear your mind of past failures, all that matters is now. Ever hear of the saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t change the past, but you can change the future.\u201d Not only that, if you turn around your grades now, you will have an amazing story to talk about in Uni Applications, or perhaps to other people in general!Realise that Nothing is Easy. Not even 1+1=2 (What is the proof of 1+1 actually equals 2, why not 3?) Sort of a rhetorical question, but it forces to you see what you are taking implicitly, and what you are actually thinking about. Once you have this mindset, everything becomes a challenge to overcome, appreciate, and THINK about.Learn how to think critically. You say that you are having trouble with finding whats wrong with you, well observe your actions and find out! Look deep within you, is it laziness? is it procrastination? is it the glorification of your past grades?Try to grasp things conceptually. I dont know what class you are struggling with, but I would say if it is a math or science, try to understand the concepts. If it is a language, I would say to work on memorizing the grammar, listening to music in that language, speaking in that language when you dont need to. Writing, etc.PRACTICE and GET HELP from your Teachers, friends, parents, everyone around you is to help you. Teachers definitely know, and they will help you if you have genuine interest in improving.Finally, have fun while doing it. I know from personal experience that it is painful to get through this. At times your efforts will not come through. My efforts in Spanish did not show up until late into the second semester! But once you do it, you are no longer under the burden to be perfect, and you know how to get back up and keep on going - just as Rocky Balboa had said!If you need inspiration, please watch this youtube video about failure: It got me up and running at my low points!",

Nothing is \u201cwrong\u201d with people who don\u2019t have straight As and saying so is hurting yourself and others who are happy with Bs. If grades are the only thing that make you happy, then it will actually affect your performance. I\u2019ll tell you how to get your grades up. Your teachers have to like you. This is so important. Smile at them. Answer questions. Sit up straight and make eye contact.Turn in your work on time and complete. Keep in mind that it won\u2019t always work out. And that\u2019s fine. Homework adds up but there are more important things.Have friends. This one seems to be your biggest problem. BE NICE TO PEOPLE. They will want to be your friend, I guarantee it. This will have really positive outcomes on group projects, and you will have a homework buddy. And you will have a motivation to study, and the right information. Splitting up schoolwork between other friends will bring up your grades immensely. Share notes with each other. Study. Check each other\u2019s essay. Ask a friend for help before you ask a teacher.Study in advance. I\u2019ll admit. I rarely do this, but cramming will always bring your grades down. Try to find time to study, be it in between classes. On the bus home, review notes in the subject you have a test on next.Pay attention. Another one I don\u2019t do very often. But if you follow what is going on in class, then there is no reason why you can\u2019t succeed.Don\u2019t cut down on after-school activities. You have more time than you think. A few hours a night to do something creative and fun will only help you. Clubs and extracurriculars will look more impressive than grades on applications and they will make you happier and more eager to do well in school. You aren\u2019t eager right now. You\u2019re desperate.",

            "answer_text": "For one, don\u2019t stress out too much. The grades themselves don\u2019t matter too much. If you are worried about college, you still have time to recover. They won\u2019t be \u201cperfect\u201d anymore, but that isn\u2019t really needed. A lot of schools will look at how you\u2019ve improved. So if you made mistakes early on, but buckle down and improve them and keep it up, you will be fine. Just don\u2019t become complacent about your grades again. Second, a lot of people who find school easy early on run into problems as the challenge increases. For some this is high school, for others it might be college. I\u2019m guessing that what you are dealing with is that school was so easy before that you never needed to actually study. I\u2019ll tell you one thing. Most knowledge you gain in school isn\u2019t what you need out in everyday life. Sure, lots of things come up here and there. Basic math and reading is useful all the time, but knowing how to conjugate a verb or reduce an algebraic expression is only useful depending on what you do for a living. What is useful is how these things help you learn how to learn. That is one of the biggest tools an education will get you. So while some may argue that \u201cI\u2019ll never use this out in the real world\u201d I like to point out that the process of figuring it out is the real point. And it\u2019s something you need to practice, so never stop learning. For your particular case, talk to your teachers. Asking them for help and letting them know you are trying to get better can possibly give you some leeway when it comes to a close grade. They might be able to provide some suggestions also. Talk to classmates (not during class) that seem to be understanding the topic. See if you can get a tutor. Form a study group. Look for other ways to absorb the knowledge. There are lots of online resources. Check out Khan Academy (or other similar sites) to see if they have the same topics you are covering. https://www.khanacademy.org/ ",

            "answer_text": "I feel like these answers miss an important aspect of the question. It's one thing to learn how to memorize content well, though that skill isn't particularly useful for anything other than passing tests. It's not helpful outside of school and undergraduate university. I was dux (top in academics) at my school 4 years ago (now about to finish an applied maths/engineering degree), and very little of my success was down to having a good memory. I'm pretty weak at this, to be honest. I always focused on being able to understand, and also derive, all of the key concepts in the class. If you can pull that off, then a nasty exam question (that you haven't practiced repeatedly) can't throw you off, because you have a good grasp of every tool that you might need to answer it, whatever the question might be. (If you're interested in an example of this approach, really getting to the bottom of a concept, then comment on this with a topic from school that you're pretty comfortable with, and I'll try apply it to that. Idk what age and year level you are, so its tricky to know what a good topic would be for the example :-)  ) The way you get to this level of understanding is to constantly apply what you've learned to the world you see around you. Come up with little theories, then test them against what you've been taught and see if they give you the answer you expect. If not, make a question from it, and talk to someone more knowledgeable about it, like a teacher. Explain what you do understand, and the bit that doesn't seem to make sense. You'll either find out that you were wrong, and improve your understanding, or occasionally find out that you're right, and that there's more to it than they explain at your level of school. I always loved that feeling, and the explanations of the extra bits were always pretty interesting too. All this has three advantages over a memory based approach: 1) it's more useful.  you learn more than you otherwise would, because you're asking tricky questions and testing your understanding. You can apply it in a variety of contexts, not just in a test, which means you'll be able to make better use of it in real life. 2) it's much less boring. Tests stop being big scary important hurdles that take a lot of mental energy to cram for, and become guides for where you should direct your curiosity. the grades come as a by product of your interest. Its much easier to find energy to study, since its something you genuinely enjoy. 3) you become a much better thinker this way. I know people who are much more capable book learners than me,  but their problem solving skills aren't as practiced. They're much more easily stumped by a new situation, less intuitive about handling new contexts, and less comfortable picking up new skills. And that there is the real point of high school: learning to get better at learning. The actual content, you'll probably have forgotten 80% of it by age 25. But being able to quickly become effective in a situation you haven't practiced before is the highest leverage skill a person can have, and will help you succeed with whatever you decide to attempt in life. Hope you find this rant a little bit useful :-) I'm happy to discuss this stuff with anyone if they're interested, just flick me a message. Soz for any typos,  phone keyboard ain't ideal for this. ",

            "answer_text": "I know it\u2019s past the 20th, but I can give a few tips. Just saying, I am in 10th Grade, so I know what I am saying. I understand that you say that there\u2019s no reason for your bad grades, but there probably is. Diagnosing that is your first priority for getting back on your feet. First of all I\u2019m gonna say that you should stay away from drugs, alcohol, crime, etc., (yes, that\u2019s a no brainer). Second, if you have friends who are into this stuff, let them go, or drift away further from them over time, as they\u2019ll only bring you down. Also, stay away from girls. This is my personal opinion, but they bring in too much drama, make you lose too much sleep, etc. Sad but true in my case. Other people have said most of the study tips I can give you, but I\u2019ll just say ASK QUESTIONS. Teachers should be trying to help you learn (although America\u2019s public schools are losing this, sadly), so let them teach you. If they don\u2019t know that there\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t understand, then they won\u2019t bother trying to help you understand. When you are in class, class becomes you: let the knowledge flow into you, ignore distractions or people trying to talk. Take notes and most importantly listen. Don\u2019t just copy what a teacher says, just let the idea come to you and focus yourself on that. Too often people will a) zone out and not absorb the ideas, and b) try to copy the teacher verbatim, which won\u2019t let them. I find that bullet points work the best, or a simple outline (I am a bit sloppy, but my method does work). If you are in a sport, it;s your job to balance studies and athletics. If that means studying at a track meet when you aren\u2019t running, so be it, you won\u2019t die because you can\u2019t socialize with your friends. Basically, you have to remove distractions in your life and focus on school. You have time to turn this around, but you have to try to do so. School comes naturally to very few people, most have to try to succeed. Don\u2019t get caught up in failure, rise above it. School will only get harder, so set yourself up to succeed, not fail. ",

            "answer_text": "I am like electricity. I go wherever\u200b there is the least resistance. Part one, write notes. Which means I read a chapter and write notes in my notebook, short enough to remember it, long enough to understand. Ex. \u201c - 1994 Serbian Army defeated, Croatia won the war, peace signed. \u201c or \u201c- 2 chemistry processes, endothermic takes heat and is cold, and exothermic releases heat and is hot\u201d Do this for the whole lesson (everything in a test) and you will have a 70 pages textbook on a 6 page notepad. That is 64 pages less to learn. Step two, imagine you are the teacher. My favourite, imagine if you were your teacher, what would you put in a test? Is your teacher an a**hole, and requires that 1 definition\u200b of neutron that is hard to find, or a nice guy who asks you to explain with your words why did the WW2 happen? Do it right, and you have 3 points guaranteed. Step three, ask friends for information. If you missed a class, make sure you copy the notebook. Our chemistry teacher doesn\u2019t follow our textbook, so if you don\u2019t have it in your notebook, you can\u2019t learn it because you can\u2019t find it in your book. Step 4, use internet. Find funny YouTube videos. \u201cCrashcourse\u201d are awesome in my opinion. They taught\u200b me thermodyamics in 30min better than my teacher in 5h. Step 5, go study. Quite the obvious one. If you followed everything from above, go take that note book you just filled with data and learn it so you can recipher it. Do it well, and assuming the test isn\u2019t math or has no mathematical tasks, you have at least a D. If you spend enough time, you can score an A. If the test is math or requires problem solving math style (a + b = ?), complete every textbook task you can find. Every task means literally every. You can write formulas in a notebook, but you have to practise those tasks. Otherwise, an F. ",

As a high school student myself I would like to say that unless you\u2019re applying for Ivy Leagues, a 4.0 really isn\u2019t necessary. I have a 3.4 and I\u2019ve been accepted into all the schools I applied for. Another thing I notice about my peers with a 4.0 is that they tend to be stressed out a lot. If you\u2019re willing to go through that, be my guest but for me it wasn\u2019t worth it(I\u2019m a senior.) I\u2019ve been told repeatedly that I could be a 4.0 student, but it\u2019s just not worth all the stress I\u2019d have to go through. Another thing to get straight A\u2019s is to not take any advanced courses, which I don\u2019t recommend. Colleges would rather see you have a B in an advanced course than straight A\u2019s in easy courses, so I\u2019ve heard. If you get straight A\u2019s in all advanced classes, kudos to you but my guess is that\u2019s not the case. Again, a 4.0 is an admirable goal but don\u2019t stress out if you get anything in the 3.3\u2019s or above. If you have a 3.10\u20133.29, you could do better but nothing worth stressing over. 3.0\u20133.09 you definitely should do better. Anything less than a 3.0 is too low for most schools to my knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "For God\u2019s sake this is the 642th question! @User There is no point of asking the same question again and again without you putting any real effort to your studies! This reminds me of one story. A farmer wishes to be rich. He prays to the God everyday that he wanted to be rich. After 30 years he is still same old farmer. He was angry at God why he was still the same although he already prayed to Him. God said \u201cHave you tried to buy a lottery?\u201d. For you, you wanted As straight but did not bother to put any effort. Look, analyse yourself what have been doing so far that caused you to get straight Fs. As a teacher, if my students got a single digit mark (0\u20139%), I assumed that they did not bother to put any effort on their studies at all! 10\u201320 % is still ok to me. *FULL MARK IS 100% AS A REFERENCE. Your studying method is how? With TV or laptop beside your books? With mobile phone as well? Ask your parents to keep those devices away from you. Like how did you even got time to ask questions here in Quora. One of my students loved his devices so much that he MUST hold or check his phone while he is in my class. I kept all of their phones during class and gave them back after class. I would threathen that I would smash their phone with a hammer if he still texting. How long did u spend on studying compared to gaming? More gaming than studying? Ratio of 4:1 gaming to studying respectively? Think and see how gaming can help your studies! Watch this video  His story reminded of your situation. Hope the video above can motivate you. Consult with schoool counsellor with this problem of yours. Look, the main problem I see is that you are not too ambitious with your future. No goals for your future. What is your dream? What is your ambition? Do you want to end up like this forever? Make a change. Edit: If you still end up the same way, I can suggest you to look for a technical school. ",

            "answer_text": "First: Grades are arbitrary letters on a page. Beyond school, they mean very little or nothing. Are you sure that they are truly \u201cthe only thing making [you] happy?\u201d If so, what will you do when you are no longer in school and grades are no longer used to tell you how you did in a class? Very few things in life are measured in such an arbitrary way. I say arbitrary because grades do not measure intelligence or many other factors needed for success in life. They are perhaps a show of how you did in a class. However, the way grades are calculated varies wildly from class to class or professor to professor, especially in college when professors tend to have more autonomy. Grades are not everything. Do not put your heart and soul into chasing numbers for a letter. Certainly do your best to get good grades, but they are not absolute. There are plenty of other things in life which bring joy and pleasure that cannot be quantified. Not everyone needs to get an A, and not everyone can. Grade inflation is a thing. The holidays are coming up. Is there anyone or anything you\u2019d like to do that does not involve homework, school, or even gaming? Getting out and seeing some people might help. It certainly helped me with my bout of depression in high school (the majority of 2nd-4th year). My friends were the best help for me then as well. For me, people matter a lot. Please please don\u2019t chase them. You will waste a lot of your energy and life and enjoyment doing so. Working hard, more than talent, will get you grades, but there\u2019s a way to do it. You can look up study methods and such, but I would always say that you need to start with taking care of yourself. Physically taking care of yourself will help your mind be on top of its game. So if you\u2019re depressed and not happy, how can you manage that or attempt to fix it? First, recognize that your mental health and wellbeing are a priority now. You are not alone, as many your age and many older have been through this. You can get through this, and it may involve putting less time into things that are not as much of a priority as taking care of yourself. Second, find what makes you happy - that\u2019s does not involve grades because that is not one of the big things in life that will make you happy. They do not measure your intelligence, your worth, or all of your accomplishments as a person. If you love learning for learning\u2019s sake, then learn for learning\u2019s sake without worrying about the grades. You can do it. I love learning but dislike plenty of classes and grades. When I don\u2019t have to worry about a grade, it\u2019s incredible how much I\u2019ll actually enjoy taking the time to do something just because. Get involved in clubs in school or maybe things outside of school such as volunteering elsewhere. Those are things I have seen that have helped many people. There is a whole world outside your home and school. How much of it have you explored? How many people have you met? How many cool things have you experienced that are memorable? Those numbers, to me at least, are more important. \u2014 A little about me: I graduated high school not too long ago with a 3.3+ GPA and am in college now with a slightly higher GPA. I think. I cannot remember much as no one cares about your GPA once you\u2019re out of high school. No one will care about your honors or AP classes either (only useful if trying to get college credit). Often, people will not care about your college GPA after either. You can still attend great schools without a 4.0 GPA. You can still get a good job without being a superstar in the classroom all the time (in fact, experience and who you know, which cannot be measured by grades) are more important there. Know your priorities and list them, in order. For me, friends and my health are more important than any grade. Even if I had an exam the next morning, I\u2019d drop everything to go save a friend because they matter to me. I tell you all this in the hopes that I can save you from being unhappy over grades that will not give you much back - not like a good friend or taking care of yourself can do. I once cared about grades almost more than anything too. No more. I am much happier now without chasing every grade. I was also once depressed, but that was not completely as a result of grades. Usually other factors contribute to less-than-perfect grades which then starts a nasty cycle. Break it. ",

            "answer_text": "Start your day with a determination ,note down certain topics and try to finish those topics within the day itself. How should you study? Trust me,i had the same question in my mind few years back. I had read motivational books,shortcut tricks,but nothing worked then. However,one day i came across a quote that says Be the winner,lead others. Be the failure,guide others. This quote explains that whatever happens,never stop learning.Because learning is progressing,even at certain smaller way but it is a progress afterall. Follow these points ,that i have learned from my failures\u2014 1.Understand the topic(most important,thoroughly). Try to memorise it(not thoroughly). After you are done,write it down ,explaining it with your own words,and make a short note of it,such that whenever you give a glimpse of it. You remember the concept chronologically. 2. Try to complete the topics for the day.For each of the topics,follow rule no. 1 3.While you do the exercises,problems numericals,make sure you do it completely,don't leave in the middle of it. It Increases the accuracy *4.While you study the topic for the first time,follow textbook.However,after you make your own short note ,don't follow any textbook ,while you revise or repeat before exams,refer to your notes and short notes. And also refer to your numericals(do the numericals again,mostly the tough ones). 5.At the end,before you sleep,go through the short notes you made,this is how you would revise all that you studied throughout the day. 6.Next day,wake up. Refer the short notes while having your breakfast.and then start again with rule no. 1 with further topics .repeat this everyday,untill Sunday comes. And on Sunday revise what you read throughout the week,refer the short notes. Lastly i conclude ,that ,grades are important.yes they are. However give yourself some time,make the best use of that time. And ,repeat this untill you improve. It may take you a longer while than others but it surely will, trust me. My friend,some have luck with them,and some do not. And those who don't have any luck, have the strongest weapon of all.Hardwork forever pays :) ",

            "answer_text": "Not qualified to answer this question (did not get straight As myself), but I do know of some study strategies from watching smarter people. If I could distill what I've observed of these brilliant students into three best practices, it would be: DisciplineStudents that get straight As pay attention in class and take detailed notes. While taking notes, these students ask questions frequently when the teacher goes too quickly or if they don't understand the concepts. Straight A students are not afraid to ask questions because chances are that someone has the same questions. Through paying attention and asking questions, they emerge from class with organized and detailed notes that they can review later. This requires discipline. I remember skipping classes and not taking notes to \u201cabsorb\u201d material, but it didn't work out. Stay on top of your work and stay engaged in class to get good marks. BalanceIf you plot stress on an x axis and productivity on the y axis, it would resemble a bell curve.  You want to be in the middle to achieve optimal performance and you can do that by achieving balance between work and play. Make sure to take a break every now and then. Everyone has their own way of relaxing whether it be exercising, playing music, or napping. If you find this right balance, you'll be working at your optimal performance level. ResilienceChances are that you've received a lower grade than you've expected on one of your assignments. And that's ok. The important part is not lingering in the past, but reflecting on lessons learned and moving forwards with them in mind. The worst thing you can do is best yourself up for failure. Instead, talk to your teacher and devise a study strategy moving forwards for greater academic success. In grand scheme, a F on an assignment does not define you as a person. How you respond to this adversity does. RelationshipsMost students grumble after receiving bad grades and refuse to look at the feedback. Straight A students go talk to the teacher to understand what they did incorrectly so that they grow from their past mistakes. Moreover, having a strong relationship with the teacher allows you learn more and prepare better for the exam because it allows you to anticipate what your teacher may ask on an exam. Also, teachers are here to help so take the initiative and reach out if you need help. There's no shame in doing so and your teacher will respect you for this initiative. Another resource is upperclassmen or students who have taken the class before. These students understand the course material and the content is still fresh in their mind. Usually, they're willing to help out if you ask. I remember asking my senior friends to read my essays for a challenging English class and I ended up doing well in it. Seek out all the help you can get. ",

Getting straight A\u2019s is a daunting task and no doubt, it requires a lot of work. From my own experience, I think the number one factor was motivation. During freshman year, I was a slacker. I focused more on looking cool and being the kid who sits in the back and slumps in his chair while cracking jokes. It was a disaster for me academically. I earned a 3.0 GPA and I was labeled as a useless child. Only in Sophomore year did I realise what I was doing with my life. That is when I set goals for myself and began working towards them. Here is a simple list of what helped me succeed so far: SleepThere is no doubt that sleep is essential in earning all A\u2019s. In my 17 years of school education, I have never pulled an all-nighter for school. That\u2019s right, you heard me. The only time I pulled an all-nighter was to simply relax but I have never stayed up past 12AM for school and I think this played a big factor in my grades. Sleep helps you focus, period.Focus in classI can\u2019t tell you how important it is to simply listen to the teacher speak. Talk with your friends after class. Spend the class period simply listening and this will play a huge role in your grades.NotesTake good notes in class and begin going over them two to three days prior to any test. This helps get the information stuck inside your head.Set timers for homework/studyingI abide by the 45/15 rule and it helps me get a tremendous amount of work. That means I don't touch anything or get out of my seat for 45 minutes and simply commit myself to pure work. For 15 minutes, I commit myself to pure rest. Try it, it works wonders.Don\u2019t stress yourselfIn class this Friday, I saw a fellow student faint due to stressing himself excessively during finals week. It\u2019s important to keep yourself calm and motivated to achieve all A\u2019s. Believe in yourself.",

            "answer_text": "You can achieve it very easily as long as you have the right mentality. The main two things to look at is time management and focus. In class, your goal is to learn, not to socialize or goof off. There is plenty of time outside of class to do those things so when you're in class, allocate that time to focus, pay attention, and learn. Try to find things that interest you in that subject that you can relate to in your daily life. When you are passionate in something, you will inevitably succeed in it. Next, you have limited time per day to complete your assignments, or study for an assessment. The first moment of the day where you have free time, use it wisely to do what you actually need to do. Let's visualize it. Would you rather do something that isn't progressing towards your academics for hours, then wait until later/late to do your school work? No, because you might not be able to complete all of it or may be stressed in time etc. OR, would you rather knock out all the schoolwork at the first opportunity you have to do so, then have the rest of the day to do whatever you want? Obviously, you want to do this. You want and need the security of being on top of your work to achieve the grades that you want to achieve. Effort is key here. If you put in the effort, you will get the results. It doesn't get any simpler than that. You can do it. But most importantly, believe that you can do it. ",

            "answer_text": "They always find a way to get better at studying, looking for new studying strategies and making them better by applying them to their life. TIME. Learn how to manage your time, learn how to plan. However, remember this: don\u2019t only plan time to study, plan everything, including some hours as free time. To always have energy to study, you need some time to relax - both mentally and phisically. If you can, do some kind of sport, or just go for a walk (by the way, researchers have discovered that doing some kind of sport also helps your mental ability). Try also to manage your social life: going out once a week should make the job. Remember: be very strict about when you have to study, but never forget to relax, or you\u2019ll have a breakdown.STUDYING STRATEGIES. Search the Internet for studying strategies. Some people learn better by seeing, others by hearing, others by doing. Find out which one you are. Look on books or on the Internet on how the brain works, and try to find the best ways to memorize and understand concepts. After you\u2019ve done these two things, search everywhere for studying strategies. Try them all, until you find the best ones for you.PAY ATTENTION AT SCHOOL. Pay attention during lessons. You\u2019ll have 40% of your job already done.IF YOU DON\u2019T LIKE A SUBJECT, MAKE IT INTERESTING. Look at subjects with a different perspective. I didn\u2019t really like history because my teachers just wanted us to memorize dates of events, and that was all. But one day, before the school year started, I was looking at my history book with one of my friends, explaining to her that that year my class would have started studying from Alexander the Great. I looked at the page and there was a photo of a statue of him. And in that moment, I realised that he had actually been real. He had been a person, just like me, my friend, and everyone. I realised that history wasn\u2019t about dates to memorize. It was about people. About what they had done, what they loved and hated, what they wanted, what they were afraid of. So I started seeing the subject differently. I still had to memorize the dates, but everytime we started something new, I had the chance to \u201cmeet\u201d a new person. I started looking for info about those people. It was interesting to see how they thought, the causes and consequences of their actions. I started seeing History as something completely different: a chance to learn from the past. Here\u2019s an example: you can learn skills by watching how others have done it. If you wanted to learn leadership skills, who would have been the best teachers if not Alexander the Great, Pericles, Caesar, Napoleon, Washington, Gandhi, etc? Learn from their mistakes and their victories. See it as a chance for yourself.GO BEYOND SCHOOL. When you\u2019ve found what interests you about a subject, go beyond school work and research for yourself. Teachers will love it. Trust me, my history teacher was amazed by my interest for her subject.STAY CURIOUS. If there\u2019s something outside schools subjects that interests you, find a little bit of time to learn about it. It will be useful. Here\u2019s my example: I find criminology interesting, and I study it alone when I have time. But it has become incredibly useful: learning about drugs, poisons and killings has helped me both in History and Chemistry.BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. You should always believe in yourself. Here\u2019s a little story of mine as an example. I used to hate Maths. And I still do. I was good, had some of the best grades in the class, but I wasn\u2019t really \u201cshining\u201d like in the other subjects. Well, as I told you, I had my reasons: I hate Maths. But my teacher - who, by the way, is amazing, so a little bit of luck with teachers is always the best - always believed in me. He tried to convince my class to participate in two maths lectures for high schoolers held by a university. A girl and a boy from my class who are maths geniuses - especially the boy - participated, and I did as well. The girl is one of my best friends and I was the one who convinced her to go. We went and, of course, we understood nothing. They were speaking about concepts that we would have studied years later. However, I\u2019ve always liked challgenes, especially with things I don\u2019t like. So, out of the three, guess who was the one who kept writing notes down, even though she understood nothing. Yeah, me. I was a little bit curious, I have to admit it. One other time, there was a little maths contest between a lot of schools. You have to know that here in Italy high schools are very different. You study basic subjects like Maths, Italian, History, Latin in most high schools, but then it changes. There are the \u201cLicei Classici\u201d, where you study a lot more Latin + Ancient Greek, and where you don\u2019t study sciences a lot, then there are the \u201cLicei Scientifici\u201d, where they study less Latin and concentrate on sciences. And others, but that doesn\u2019t matter now. Of course, which ones do you think would perform better in a maths contest? You got it, the Licei Scientifici. Usually, you also have to prepare for this contests a few months in advance, together with your teacher and a group (they are group-based, about 10 people for every school). Well, our maths teacher had the great idea to ask as if we wanted to participate the day when they would have been held. He comes in the morning and says: \u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s this maths contest this afternoon. Would you like to participate?\u201d He had already asked me once to participate in an individual contest and I had said no, because, as I said, I hate maths, but that time I decided to say yes. He also asked two other girls of my class (not the one who is great in maths, though; she\u2019s very silent and he seems like he forgets about her, but she couldn\u2019t go anyway so it wasn\u2019t that big of a problem) and other girls from the school. We went there with no hope whatsoever because we hadn\u2019t prepared at all, since he had asked us that same morning. There were thirteen other schools, mostly Licei Scientifici. Well, we are a Liceo Classico. Basically, we were screwed. But we did it just for fun. The rules were simple: do something correctly, you get points. Do it wrong, points are taken away from you. Basically: don\u2019t make mistakes. While all my group was desperately trying to solve some of the problems, most of the things we had never heard of, I tried to solve a problem that looked like it was okay. I thought I had got a solution, but I tried it other times to be sure. In the end, we decided to take the risk. I never really thought it was correct: I hated Maths, came from a Liceo Classico and hadn\u2019t prepared at all, I had no chance at all. Well, my solution was correct. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I still hated Maths, but knowing that I had got the correct result was a great feeling. And my group was so happy! That made me feel even better, because all of them were smiling. They had regained some hope. Of course, we weren\u2019t able to solve the other problems and ended up 7th, but considering we hadn\u2019t prepared and that most of the others were scientific schools, I was happy, especially considering my little victory. However, I\u2019m the kind of person who never really talks about that. So when our teacher came to tell us that he was happy with our result, I just smiled and said nothing. Another girl started speaking about the correct solution which had given us some points, and another group from my school (but the girls were older than us) was there too. So the teacher asked her if it was her who had solved the problem, and she pointed at me. He looked at me with a look that was just saying: \u201cSee? I told you\u201d. Yeah, well, I started looking at Maths with a different perspective. At the end of the year, me and my other best friend who is great at maths were the only ones in the class having 10 (A) in Maths, which made me kind of proud of myself. So never doubt yourself. But, even though I love the challenge, I have to admit that I still don\u2019t really like the subject.",

Even if they\u2019re just five points at a time, homework grades add up. Always do what you can, and do your best to not have any missing grades. Figure out how to study in a way that\u2019s best for you. Listen to music, make flashcards, rewrite notes, use sites like Quizlet, play white noise, turn your phone off, whatever helps you be more efficient. Make sure to take breaks every once in a while to give yourself a bit of a break (it\u2019s really hard to focus for several hours straight). Pay attention in class. Don\u2019t play games on your phone or goof off on a computer. Most of what\u2019s on a test will (hopefully) be said by the teacher in class or on the whiteboard/chalkboard/projector screen. The teacher may also mention extra credit or an assignment change that you\u2019ll miss if you\u2019re not paying attention. Take every opportunity to get extra credit points. Do the final study guide, the extra worksheet, whatever the teacher puts forth for extra credit. And it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask, either! The worst they can say is \u201cno.\u201d Use the internet! Khan Academy is a wonderful resource for studying. It covers whole subjects with easy-to-understand videos. PDFs of textbooks are often online, which can allow you to have a lighter load in your backpack. Slader has answers to questions from a large number of textbooks. Use sites like Online Proofreader and Grammar Checker and Grammarly to help proofread papers and catch grammar mistakes. Good luck! ",

In my experience, studying becomes much more crucial junior and senior years than freshman and sophomore years.Take notes in class, if you don't already.Many people like the Cornell system (googling it will give you many resources for this); I find it to be too much, but for some this works well.I just use dashes like outline notes; instead of I., A., 1., etc, I just use dashes or bullet points.I'm sure there are other ways to take notes, but these two are the most popular.Write down any and all important information.Use shortened versions of words (\u201cchr\u201d for \u201cChrist, Christian, or Christianity\u201d; only use first letter or initials for names used frequently; or \u201cusu\u201d for usually)Ask questions when you don't understand the material.Get a tutor (older student who has taken the class or a pro).Use Internet resources like Khan academy for reenforcment of the lesson.Study groups are amazing if you can get in a group with students who work hard and get good grades (make sure that they not only get good grades, but work hard for them. Those people are generally best for study groups.)Take classes you're interested in, if possible. That way, you'll work harder and pay more attention in class.When you have a college major or career plan in mind, take classes in high school that will directly prepare you for your post-high school plans.This may sound dumb, but sometimes, acting like you know what you're talking about means everything.Want to know how to write an English essay on a book you didn't read or didn't understand? You make an assertive thesis and use specific quotes or events in the book to support the thesis. In English, you can say anything you want as long as your reasoning/support is good. So even if your understanding of the book is virtually nothing, you can use what you do know to make yourself sound like you know what you're talking about. I'm doing it right now in AP English, on a weekly basis.",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t tell you which way of studying is best for you, but I can give you some methods that works for a lot of people. 1. Flash cards: Everyone and their mother swears by this method. You can just cut up pieces of paper and study anything with them. This works best with vocabulary and language terms because you can reverse the cards and try to identify the term from the definition like a game. A great app for flash cards on-the-go is Quizlet, you can use the learn function on the app and type the definition over and over again until you get it right. You can also test yourself and play games with your terms. It is also important to keep motivated so rewards like candy or TV after you get a certain amount right are the best way to make sure you actually study them.2. Teaching the subject to someone/something: This is very effective with a big test in which you have a lot of information to cover. \u201cTeaching\u201d the subject helps you identify how well you know your content and gives you an idea of what you need more practice with. Putting things in your own words can also help you familiarize your brain with whatever it is you want to study and you are able to grasp concepts better. It is also a great way to help out classmates and friends while reinforcing your own knowledge. Plus who doesn\u2019t want to help out a buddy in need?3. Making your own practice test: This method is commonly used for a math test because you have to learn how to apply concepts you learn in class to problems given on the test. Creating or finding practice problems for yourself to do helps you prepare for the test. You know how the method works in a real problem and you can exercise your brain to help remember those concepts. Make sure you are reviewing in class or hw practice problems and weaving those questions into your exams. This way you know that you are directing your attention to the right topics because we all know that horrible feeling of coming to a test and realizing we have spent hours studying the wrong things!\u201cThere is no secrets to success. It is a result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.\u201d -Colin Powell ",

Also, before writing down the note, you should read it and understand it. If you understand it, just summarize it not missing a piece. On the other hand if you don't understand it then before copying it down exactly, ask the teacher to explain, if you still don't understand it, make a star beside it and ask for further clarification.

Either you suddenly were put into much tougher classes or your study habits changed, or a combination of the two, Here are some suggestions for study habits. They aren\u2019t fun, unless you like what you\u2019re studying and they do take time away from fun stuff. But that\u2019s just the way it goes if you want to succeed in school. Read the material for each class the day/night before the teacher goes over it. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand when you read it (and perhaps read it 2\u20133 times, slowly), make notes and make sure to ask the teacher if the lecture doesn\u2019t answer the question.Do all the problems at the end of each chapter, or at least make sure you know how to do them. In social studies/English classes, think about each question and make sure you have a good answer. If you\u2019re stuck on any of the problems or questions, ask the teacher the next day.If you\u2019re not doing these things, then you aren\u2019t working hard enough on school stuff. If you are doing these and not succeeding (which is unlikely) see if you can transfer to easier classes. ",

You can definitely improve your grades to A\u2019s by having great time management skills, putting in hours of hard work, and taking classes that are challenging but also interesting to you. Find a passion that you hold close to yourself and select courses in your high school that correlate with that passion and will help you grow as an individual. After doing that, make sure to take good notes during teacher lectures and proceed to ask anyone for help if you don\u2019t understand a certain concept pertaining to that lecture. Something that I find helpful in memorization classes is to summarize main points from notes on Quizlet notecards, study them, and expand on these to get every detail. For classes that require application of concepts make sure to truly understand basic knowledge of topics and do practice on helpful websites to apply this base knowledge to questions on the test. Khan Academy is a free resource that provides a lot of practice and examples of a plethora of problems that you can practice and hone your skills to perfection. Good Luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hard work, commitment, and time. Now I\u2019m not sure what grades you\u2019re currently getting, but either way, I\u2019m a firm believer that if you work hard enough, you can go from failing a class, to topping the class. I\u2019m a straight A student, except for one semester (2 terms, half a school year) where I completely disappointed myself in maths, receiving grades in the low 70%\u2019s. I was able to pull my maths grades up from the low 70\u2019s to high 90\u2019s, because it mattered to me. Hard work: nothing good will come without effort. You will have to put in hard work and dedication all the time, not just before tests or exams. Go home after school and do some extra maths or science questions, write a practice essay introduction to get better, whatever works for you, just do something. Commitment: being dedicated and willing to work hard is really important. You have to be willing to put extra effort in consistently. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t have a life, but putting effort in consistently will get you further than just working a bit harder right before a test. And something else that is really important, commitment to your teacher. Go to them, tell them you want to get better grades, ask for tips from them, ask for help when you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re doing. Show them you\u2019re willing to work, they will be more than willing to help you, because they want to see you succeed. Too many times I have seen a classmate struggling with a concept or question but refusing to ask the teacher for help and clarification and they never end up understanding said concept. Also take advantage of opportunities. Does your school or teacher offer lunch time or even after school help sessions? If it matters enough to you, then take those opportunities, they really help. Time: understand a change won\u2019t happen over night, it might not even happen by the next test. It takes time to improve yourself for even just one topic, but especially if that improvement is desired over many. Try not to be disheartened when you don\u2019t get an A on the test you have in 2 weeks, or even a month. But also don\u2019t stop working hard when you do start getting A\u2019s, because it is very easy for grades to fall again. Understanding that good grades do take time out of your life is really important. You can still have a life, but don\u2019t expect to be able to lounge around watching Netflix just because you got an A on the last test, because then you have to start focusing on the next one. It\u2019s constant, all the time, though you will start to find a balance that works for you. Good luck. I don\u2019t know you, or your current grades, but if you put in enough effort, I know you\u2019ll succeed! ",

            "answer_text": "How to get good grades is a common question asked by the students at any level of education. The reason is everyone wants to score good grades in their examinations. It just not provide mental happiness to the students but also play a crucial role in the success of the students. Get higher grades in school can be a lot easier than getting high grades in college. Getting good grades is also helpful in winning competitive scholarships. Today I am going to share with you the best and most effective tips on how to get good grades in exams. Just studying is not enough for getting good grades. You need to have a solid strategy and plan that will help you to regain your focus and help you to achieve good grades. Tips on how to get good grades 1. Motivate yourself Self-motivation is the key to success for every student. It is pretty often that the students lose their confidence when they don\u2019t get good grades. But you should not make the same mistakes as other students do. You may not get satisfied with your grades sometimes, but at that moment, you should maintain your self-confidence to be in the game of getting good grades. You should believe in yourself to stay focused on your work. The best way to motivate yourself is to create some milestones for yourself. You can create a series of milestones. When you start working to achieve those milestones than in every achievement, you will boost your self-confidence. And this confidence will lead you to get good grades in your exams. 2. Listen and participate in the class A student who does participate in the class always gets more grades than the students who don\u2019t. But listen and participate in the class is not easy for any students, especially for the shy one. But it showcases the teacher that you care about the topic and you want to score high grades. The teacher gives the grades based on various factors. Apart from that if you participate in the class, then you may get more awareness about the topic. Along with that if you listen to your mentor or teacher carefully, then you can learn a lot more than the self-study. It will help you to prepare for the exams more effectively. Thus it helps you to get good grades in your exams. Besides, if you\u2019re a weak student, then you can sit closer to the teacher so that the teacher can know more about you and find your weakness. Apart from that, you can also write down some questions before the class and then ask them to the teacher to clear your doubts. 3. Take thorough notes during a class Notes are quite helpful in getting high grades. You should make notes during the class. Notes help you to cover the important information about the topic. You can create the notes by listening to your teacher. Apart from that, you can also create the notes of the important topic with the help of some reference book of your topic. It will help you to prepare for the exams more efficiently. Sometimes the students just need to have a look at the notes, and then they prepare for the exams within a few hours. Apart from that, these notes are also helpful just before the last few minutes of the exams. 4. Do not hesitate to ask for help Majority of students does this mistake. I don\u2019t why they always have hesitation while asking the help from the teacher. The students need to take help from the teacher. Even intelligent students also look for help from the teacher. Because the students can\u2019t cover everything about the topic without taking help from the teacher. It is quite common for tough subjects. You should ask for help from your teachers and your peers in the class. It helps you to learn more about the topic and clear your doubts without much effort. Apart from that, you can also ask your parents for help if they can help you with the topic. Along with that, you can also ask them for the private tutor, who will help you to learn more about the topic. 5. Stay focused during your homework Focus is the key factor in how to get good grades. Lack of focus will not help you to good core grades; You need to be well focused during your homework. Did you know homework plays a crucial role in your academic scores? Homework helps you to get ready for the exams and learn more deeply about the topic. That\u2019s why you need to stay focused during your homework. Now the question is, how we can do that? The best answer to this question is to find a quiet place to do your homework. Remember that the place should be located in a distraction-free environment. There are some other factors too that create the distraction during your homework writing. Mobile devices are a major distraction for that. You should put your mobile phone aside. You can also put it into the silent or mute mode. Moreover, You can also use some apps that will lock your phone for a certain period. You can also do your homework with the help of some experts. Suppose that you need to have the statistics homework help. Then you can take the statistics homework help from the experts. They will help you to clear all your doubts more effectively. 6. Reward Yourself by taking the short breaks Majority of students don\u2019t give the importance to the breaks between the study. But remember that breaks work as an amplifier for your brain. If you do continuous study, then you may not get the good grades. Because continue study usually tied up the brain. That\u2019s why taking the short break always help you to refresh your body and brain. You should take a break within every 45 minutes during your study. The break should be as long as 15 minutes. During your break, you can walk around your house to get some fresh air. You should also drink some water to regain energy. Apart from that, you can also eat some snacks to fuel your body. It works as a reward for yourself and makes you more productive by doing something that you enjoy. 7. Prefer group study (If Possible) Sometimes group study works better than the self-study. The reason is in group study the members of the group help each other to motivate themselves and make them more productive. It also helps you to clear the doubts of each other if you find any trouble within the topic. Moreover, you can be sure that how much you have prepared for the exams. Because most of the time we assume that we study enough and get ready for the exams. But in reality, we may not be ready for the exams. On the other hand, in the self-study, there may not be any motivation for you. You need to motivate yourself. If the group study style suits you, then you should organize such groups. You can also do group study after class or on weekends. 8. Organize your study space In most of the cases, the students don\u2019t organize their study space. It is a common thing that perfect planning leads you to perfect achievement. You should organize your study space efficiently. You can do this manage all your books and stationery in one place. Don\u2019t you ever try to do not let your desk become cluttered with papers and stationery? Apart from that, you should also make separate notebooks for the separate subjects. Don\u2019t you ever try to make the notes on the same notebook for every topic? Because during the exam sessions, it will be overwhelming for you to study from that notebook. Also, remember that when you prepare for the exams. You should always have your notes and your books along with you at the same time. In this topic, I also talked about planning. You should plan your entire day and divided into small parts. Along with that, you can also write down the important dates for tests. 9. Develop a study schedule Scheduling your study is crucial to get good grades in your exams. Whenever you decide to study. Then you should divide your time into small chunks. Small chunks help you to prepare for the topic more effectively. Suppose that if you\u2019re preparing for the test, then you should divide your time into small chunks and put the small topic into these chunks. You should also manage the time as per the topic hardness. If the topic is hard enough, then you should give it more time, if the topic is easy enough then you should give it a little time. Majority of students were waiting for the last night to get prepared for the exams, but it is the worst strategy. Because no one can get good grades with a one-night study. 10. Take Care of Your health and stay fit Health is wealth for everyone, whether it is a student or a professional. Health is a crucial factor behind how to get good grades. You should take care of your health during the study. Don\u2019t you ever try to avoid food during the study? Because your mind and body need nutrients for study. Therefore you need to make sure that your meals are nutritious, balanced, and varied. Because It works as a fuel for your brain and makes it more productive. Never miss breakfast before school because breakfast provides you the necessary nutrients for study longer. 11. Sleep well It is often that the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep while studying for their exams. It is proven that sleep plays a crucial role in the performance of students. If the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep, then they may not be able to keep their focus during the class study and self-study. Our brain needs proper rest. Therefore sleep helps the brain to relax for a couple of hours. Moreover, it also recharges our body and makes it ready for the study. It has been proven that the students should take at least 8 hours of sleep each night. It also helps them to stay fit and active during their study. 12. Utilize Your Textbook Textbooks are quite helpful in getting good grades. Professors and teachers assign textbooks based on some reasons. The crucial reason behind this is, textbooks works as a supplement to the lectures and discussions of the class. You should buy all your textbooks to study about the topic.Read all the material of the assignment topic it will help you to get deep knowledge of the topic. You should read everything about the topic from opening vignettes to the case studies. Also, try to figure out which topic is most critical. Also, try to highlight the most important materials in the text. It will help you to prepare for the exams. Conclusion Getting good grades in exams is not an easy task. There are some other ways too that will help you to get good grades in your exams. If you will follow these tips on how to get good grades in exams. You should not only follow these tips to get good grades. But you should also try your best to get good grades. All these tips provided by the academics help experts. There are some other ways too to get good grades without studying. One of the major ways is to attend your class on a regular basis. Because if you attend your class regularly, then you may be aware of the topic more deeply. And you can also prepare for the exams during your classes. In this way, you do not need to do extra preparation for the exams. Last but not least, I would also like to mention that you should also control your stress level. Suppose that if you\u2019re not doing well during your class test, then don\u2019t lose your hope and don\u2019t get into stress. Because you still have a chance to get good grades in your exams. ",

If you need moral support and actual academic tutorship in one package I could probably help you out. I\u2019m in college as a third-year now (I\u2019m 18 though) so I know a thing or two about studying, and my greatest advice is studying with a sounding board! Without that second person, all those repeated, tiny mistakes unique to you may come back to haunt you. But with someone else you can feel more at ease and genuinely feel like you know your stuff because someone else double-checked your work. Plus it\u2019s more fun to have someone else there instead of wallowing in work alone. We could probably chat online a bit if you wanna just talk because even that will relieve stress. I can do facetime or Skype, text, voice, I\u2019m just here to help! I got a 3.86 in high school and that was while I had a 2-hour commute to school.. ",

I\u2019m a gamer, I understand the entertainment it provides and how it is a form of release for some people, but it\u2019s important to keep it seperate from work (studying). I have 2 portions of my room, seperated by a bamboo screen. One has a white board, a desk with a chair and stationery, etc. This is where I go to study. The other portion has my bed, my computer sitting on a desk, my office chair and all my posters, etc. This is where I hang out when I\u2019m not studying. Seperating myself from a distracting environment helps me focus more when studying and ultimately increases my retainment of information. That\u2019s just an idea of what you can do. Everyone performs differently academically and learns differently. I would suggest trying a few different things and figuring out what works for you. Hope this helps! ",

Participate in class to the point of understanding as much as you can by asking questions when you do not understand something.  Do this questioning right up to the point where your teacher or classmates is ready to kill you for asking so many questions ;-)  Your classmates will actually appreciate you helping them learn this way even if they don't always admit it.  If you have further questions, seek extra help during a free period or after school.  If you find a friend or two who share your goal of academic excellence, forming a study/homework team is also very beneficial.  Being able to get help after school is out, and being able to teach something to a friend are ways to maximize your success. 3.  Do your homework.  Homework is PRACTICE.  It doesn't matter how good a coach I am if you do not put in the time to practice.  (Example...no matter how well I transmit to you the technique to shoot foul shots in basketball, unless you actually go and shoot them yourself, you will not get better...or as I often tell my students, \"you don't get stronger by watching me do pushups\" !!!) There it is...who ever thought that success could be so easy? Good luck :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Achieving straight A's in high school is just a question of strategy and discipline. Here's a quick roundup: 1) At the macro-cosmic level, I suggest that you take a close look at the larger scheme of things in your life. That is, sit down to explore and establish compelling, inspiring and overarching long-range goals, broken down into short-term, medium-term, and long-term perspectives, as follows: - what I want to BE; - what I want to DO; - what I want to HAVE; - what I want to IMPROVE; - what I want to CHANGE; and also considering the following major life dimensions in your life: - academic pursuit (as your top priority); - mental development; - career aspirations; - physical health; - financial wealth; - family relationships; - social networking; - recreational ventures (including hobbies, interests, sports, vacations, etc.); - spiritual development (including contributions to society, volunteering, etc.); Upon completion of reflection, contemplation and introspection, the next logical step for you is to work out a systematic game plan, whereby you need to translate all your long-range goals and objectives into specific, prioritised and executable tasks which you must do daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and even annually. GOALS, PRIORITIES, and a PLAN, set your direction and direct your focus on the things that matter to you the most. In a nut shell, GOALS, PRIORITIES and a PLAN, give your the reasons for getting out of bed quickly every morning, and for staying - and feeling - alive. To use a military analogy, GOALS, PRIORITIES and a PLAN, are like precise commands preset into the flight plan of a Tomahawk missile, homing on to a predefined long-distance target. All the strategic and tactical initiatives, as laid out in your systematic game plan, will embody the envisaged vivid image of your ultimate success achievement, which you are likely to hold in your head, thus serving as your personal driving force, keeping you inspired, motivated and focused, in the hot pursuit of your desired outcomes or cherished dreams. I have already written extensively about goal setting and goal achieving, including how to set up an systematic game plan on Quora. You can search their archives. 2) At the microcosmic level, I suggest that you to learn, acquire and practise proven efficient and effective study tools like SQ5R and Cornell Notes. i) SQ5R reading/studying strategy: It's a structured system [SQ5R is an acronym for SURVEY, QUESTIONS, READ, RECORD, RECITE, REVIEW, REFLECT], but it equips you with efficient and effective ways to flesh out key ideas and salient points quickly and systematically, thus helping you to navigate academic materials, especially the intellectually-intense ones, with ease, expediency and ace. I append herewith a nice write-up on SQ5R for your kind perusal: http://www.saddleback.edu/upload... ii) Cornell Notes: It's a far more superior system that the conventional outline method, known to most students in schools, college and universities. It's latent power comes from its simple and yet elegant three-column spatial configuration for taking notes and making notes. The \"cue\" column is the most powerful system I have ever known, as it facilitates - and expedites - your memory retention/recall via self-testing. You may want to read this nice write-up on Cornell Notes method of note-taking and note-making, in conjunction with SQ5R reading strategy: Guide to Effective Note Taking - SQ3R and Cornell - The Student Power This intellectually stimulating website belongs to fellow Quoran Joao Ramos. 3) Study the nature and structure of each of your academic subjects to determine their significance, i.e. understanding why you are studying them, and why they are important to you, in relationship to your future employability and career tracking. Remember what Leonardo da Vinci had exhorted more than five hundred years ago: \"Everything connects to everything else!\" Once you have this forward-looking gestalt perspective, your studying becomes a total breeze for you; 4) In conjunction with (2) and (3), you may want to explore the use of the seemingly popular and yet proven effective productivity tools: (i) The Eisenhower Method of time management (ii) Productivity 101: A Primer to The Pomodoro Technique; (iii) Jerry Seinfeld's Productivity Secret; You may also want to consider this practice: If something crosses your mind while your studying or working at home, and it continues to bug you, just make a quick note of that \"something\" and record it in a notebook, which you may want to designate as \"Distractions Notebook.\" This initiative helps to get that \"something\" out of your system. To me, it's excellent way to do a brain dump, so that you have a de-cluttered mind to do the more important stuff. As soon as you have done this, move on with what you have been focusing on. When you are free, then only you can decide whether you want to address those \"distractions\" in your brain dump. Oftentimes, most of them will die out on their own, without your intervention at all. According to Dr Deepak Chopra, about 70,000 thoughts run through our mind in a given day. He even says about 95% of those thoughts are the same as yesterday's. 5) Before you proceed to study/revise each academic subject, learn to categorise them into: (i) concept-based/memory-dependent, like Biology, History, Geography, etc ; [In Singapore, we call them \"mugging\" subjects, as one needs to \"mug up\" in order to master them, as there are helluva lot of stuff to remember.] (ii) problem-solving, like Math, Physics, etc.; (iii) interpretation/prediction based, e.g. English Literature; Nonetheless, some subjects may straddle more than one category, e.g. Physics, and Chemistry, which have a lot of problem solving elements, notwithstanding lab experiments; To study them, do a mix-up during lesson revision and rehearsal at home, and also to allow you to be more energy-efficient, particularly in using 25-minute revising/5-minute break over a 2-hour stretch, thus attaining more 'Primacy' and 'Recency Effects'. 6) Preview your new lesson the night before class, by preparing preliminary notes. This is because, when you are learning something new in class, your prior knowledge will always come into play to make connections and create linkages. Learning psychologists call this phenomenon, \"schema activation\". More schema, more understanding! 7) Make sure that you thoroughly understand the content of all your class lectures; if not, you have to ask for clarification or elucidation from your lecturers or professors. To me, the acid test for understanding something new is your ability to explain the new concept to someone else, like your kid brother or even your grandma. No puns intended; 8) At the end of a class lecture, always do a quick Recap, Review and Reinforce, preferably with mnemonics - I call this the 3R's strategy. Science says about 80% of your information intake is lost if you do not execute this initiative within 24 hours; 9) At least for every semester quarter, or a couple of weeks prior to your final test/exam time, spend time and effort to prepare global consolidated and summarised study notes, as part of your final test/exam prep, by incorporating: - preliminary notes from your textbook reading, the night before class; - notes taken and made during the lecture; - notes taken and made from lecture handouts, if any; - notes taken and made from class discussions or group-work, if any; - notes from lab reports and/or field work; - other notes, e.g. from research at the library, or from the Internet search; 10) Also, with the aid of your subject syllabus as well as exam syllabus, learn to identify and segregate \"core material\" from \"elaborative material\". - \"core material\" = important concepts, principles, theories, definitions, terminologies, nomenclatures, important diagrams or graphs, etc.; - \"elaborative material\" = illustrations, examples, anecdotes, etc.; Drawing on Pareto's Law: About 80% of your exam questions are likely to come from your \"core material\", and so you know what and where to focus first. This is not to say \"elaborative material\" is not important, but once you have the intellectual grasp of \"core material\" in the first instance, \"elaborative material\" will naturally falls into place - in your memory banks; Transcribe \"core material\" into 4x3 index cards for their pocket portability, using the proven Index Card Strategy, for \"learning-on-the-go\": commuting and/or waiting in queue, as this facilitates random self-quizzing; 11) Review your learned class lesson within 24 hours, and then prepare a systematic spaced and distributed practice of revision/rehearsal, next 7 days/ next 30 days/next 60 days/ next 90 days/ next 180 days, till test/exam time; This initiative helps you to beat or circumvent the deadly impact of the infamous Ebbinghaus Effect, or better known as the Forgetting Curve; 12) Master the 100+ Test Verbs, often used by examiners in test/exam questions; 13) Always remember [I hate to say this, but it's a harsh reality], tests/exams are a form of game, and you got to learn to be an excellent game player. First of all, a test/exam is always a game of PRECISION and SPEED. No matter how you look at it, examiners are only interested in your ability to answer questions PRECISELY and EXPEDIENTLY, all within the prescribed time limits. So, to beat them in the game, you got to learn to master the technique of doing a \"surgical cut\" of the exam questions at first glance, no matter how they are phrased. That's why (12) is critical here. For your strategy to win the game, learn and practice the Question Dissection Protocol (*), a powerful technique for dissecting test/exam questions, developed by award-winning educator Doug Buehl from Madison, Wisconsin; I have already written extensively about this technique on Quora. You can search their archives. 14) Spend time and make concerted effort to tackle the past exam series, under simulated test/exam conditions; 15) If you are familiar with the graphical methods of note-taking and note-making, like idea-mapping, cluster diagramming and/or graphic organising, apply what I call a 'Divide and Conquer' strategy by creating a global idea map for each of your subject matter, using the tapestry of contents of your textbook as branching ideas; alternatively, you can also use the core ideas captured in (7); 16) I have in fact written an extended piece on lesson revision and rehearsal as a prelude to final test/exam preparation, originally intended for high-school/junior college students in Singapore, entitled: THE ART & DISCIPLINE OF REVISION STRATEGY You should read it. Here's the link: Say Keng Lee's post in OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE TECHNOLOGIES 17) Last but not least, especially if you are interested, acquire a copy of Adam Robinson's 'What Smart Students Know' and Ronald Gross' 'Peak Learning', and do your best to read as well as digest them. Definitely, you will be amply rewarded! So, my end analysis: it is not studying harder, but learning smarter, with the right strategy you are likely to utilize purposefully, meaningfully and productively within academic goal. I take this chance to wish you a pleasant and effective educational trip, and can even all fondest desires be realized. [20160312_Smart Learn tips] ",

I\u2019m ashamed to say that it took 11 years of education to determine why I actually attend school. Before the start of senior year, school was a merely a place to prepare for college. College was a place to get ready for the working world. Then it hit me, like a brick in a wall. The main reason that we attend school is to learn. Though it\u2019s still hard to say this, grades should not be the priority. Focus on the the process of learning what is being taught and the grades should follow, not the other way around.Don\u2019t lose points on silly- technical things. Even if you fully understand the material, your grades can still be lower if you turn in assignments late or fail to read the rubric on assignments. Just do your due diligence and you\u2019ll be fine :)",

            "answer_text": "Here's my approach to studying:1. Start out by trying to get the main idea behind a course of study, ie. History is the study of events and changes prior to current time. How are things different then than now. How did our ancestors live? What motivated them? What things did they do or not do that resulted in conditions in today's world. What were the great inventions that we take for granted now? What wars were fought, where and why? Who were the leaders and how they were selected? 2. Listen to your parents and grandparents (great grandparents while you still have them) talk about how they lived and coped. Ask questions to encourage them to talk about their earlier lives. What was it like in any wars they fought in? How did they perceive people different from themselves?3. Keep in mind that some day, your kids and grand-kids will be asking you questions.Science? Take a similar approach to understanding what the material is all about, and how it will apply to your life.In summary, do some work (with and without help) to help you relate to the material and how it will apply to your life. By now, you have figured out that this approach will not help you to turn your grades around by the end of the semester. But next semester or next year you will be good to go.Emergency studying: 1.\tRead about the material; stay current with your reading.2.\tListen intently to your lecturer.3.\tRead what they present in writing during class.4.\tTake notes and re-read them ASAP.5.\tTalk to your classmates about the class.The main thing? Stay focused, avoid being distracted. If you find yourself in class thinking about your gf or bf, or the ballgame tonight, YOU\u2019RE NOT FOCUSING! STOP IT! ",

Learn to master your material by yourself. I don't need my teachers to teach me, I usually teach myself the material through the textbook and the internet, the teacher only supplements that knowledge. Master each concept you are trying to learn before you move on to the next. For example in math split the chapter into chunks and move from beginning to end; understand each piece of material before moving on. In the end just try your best and whatever you earn is worth more than a letter on a report card. Don't compare yourself to people that can achieve more, some people are naturally gifted and can just physically absorb more information and manage it. As long as you perform to your best potential you have done more than enough. ",

If you know tomorrow you will do, say, chemistry with different hydrocarbon unions (methane, ethane, propane, butane etc) then read up on that. Always be ahead of the teacher\u2019s lessons. That way, you will not learn new things during the lecture - but repeat things you\u2019ve already looked at, and you will be a much more alert student during class. Second, repetition really is the mother of all learning. Do note that repetition is different from rote memorization. While repeating things, ask yourself the key question why? Why are you learning this thing? Once you know that, you gain understanding. So repeat until you understand why, then you\u2019ve understood the subject. Hope that helps! ",

Ask your teacher for extra resources like study guides or old tests or quizzes (obviously not the ones that she/he are currently giving) Some teachers make study guides, and most of the time they mirror the test. Ask if you could stay after school with a teacher. There, you could go over anything you are having trouble with and maybe get some extra information. Come up with acronyms or little hints to help you. Something like how the two l\u2019s in parallel demonstrate parallel lines. Pay attention in class. Studying can only get you so far. You can't effectively study unless you have the basic knowledge in the first place. Study, study, study. Use all of the resources combined and study your butt off.

I know that this one might seem like a long shot, but there are numerous studies showing that eating a nutritious breakfast can greatly benefit you and your brain.Get sleep. Get at least 7.5 hours of sleep per night. Sometimes this one is hard to do, but it keeps you alert and awake in class.Ask questions. Asking your friends always helps, but I have found that the quickest way to learn is to ask the teacher. Don\u2019t be nervous about it either, the teachers are paid to teach you. If they refuse to answer your questions, then they are a shitty teacher.Study. If looking over your notes isn\u2019t enough, try studying with a friend. If that doesn\u2019t work, try finding practice tests online. The moral of the story here is to find the best way for you to study. Everyone learns differently, and only you can figure out how to do it right.",

            "answer_text": "Well, I had never been a straight A until I reached college, with the exception of a B+ and a D. So I guess I've never been straight A, but in college I learned that in order to keep up, you have to go to class every single day, and write ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING DOWN! always do any work assigned, and anything else you can get your hands on. Ask as many questions as you can. What did I sacrifice to achieve this? I completely gave up every little bit of social life that I had. But I accomplished 16 weeks of school, 28 credit hours,5 classes, in ten weeks. It was the hardest and most grueling thing I've ever done. But the sense of accomplishment gained was worth every stressful minute of my summer doing full time school. My biggest advice is to isolate yourself from people, and force yourself to study every day and work on any work, no matter how little it is, or how far away the due date is. Slacking for a single day can put you on a downward spiral you can't recover from. Other then that, learn how to properly manage your time, and get on your own schedule. ",

Also, it\u2019s a good idea to ask the teacher about his or her ideas on how you should study for the course. Sometimes we take things for granted and think we know what they are about, or are hesitant to ask questions because we don't want to come across as incompetent, however, it\u2019s a destructive habit. Never take anything for granted and always ask questions and discuss how you can improve your performance. Be humble and at the same time proactive. Form and/or join study groups. Again, be proactive and ask your teacher about the best tactics of studying in a study group. Never give up and remember that everything (literally everything) can be learned and understood. Anything complex can be broke down into less complex, easily digestible parts and appropriated. Assume initiative - if a teacher calls for volunteers to make a report or take on a project, do not hesitate to sign up - and do your best to perform, again - ask for requirements and for help from the teacher and your peers. Engage in extracurricular activities - doing so will broaden your outlook on life and as a result you will be better at thinking \u201coutside the box\u201d. For the same reason, never miss a chance to talk to people of cultures and backgrounds different from that of your own. Excersise regularly - physical activity is good for your health and a better health will give you endurance required for intensive studies, and it will also boost your metabolism which will benefit your brain.

Also, try not to rush on these assignments as you might make some mistakes that could be a detriment to your gradeYou may not like this one but: take a break from video games, movies/tv etc.. and start studying. I love video games too, but you have to realize that this is more important.. much more important.Take breaks while studying. My method is study for 30 minutes, and take a break for 15.Ask for help from a teacher if you don\u2019t understand something. Get a tutor if needed.Finally, pay attention in class and takes notes if needed.",

You probably don\u2019t study a lot because you\u2019ve never needed to before. Then, at some point, you hit a wall, and the assignments and tests were difficult enough that they required you to actually study for them. That or you just have crappy teachers (I\u2019ve been there and if you do have harsh teachers just know that I feel your pain). On the topic of studying, you should probably ask friends or family for help with your homework (unless you, like me, know more than your parents and they don\u2019t understand half of what you\u2019re saying when you try to explain your homework). Another method is to just ask your teacher for help with some topics you just aren\u2019t getting. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking others for help, especially when it comes to school (I, like you, had to learn this the hard way). ",

You need to articulate to your target university why your high school experience, work, and achievements make you a good applicant. Then you need to show the admitting faculty what you can contribute to their program, and your ability to complete their program. They typically want a well qualified applicant, who is capable and will excel in their academic program and related activities. This is simple enough, they should show a good graduation rate and qualify students who graduate. Then their students who graduate can go on to do their life, work, and career.

(No wishful thinking allowed!). Buy a weekly planner and use it to map out where you need to be every day with the work to complete it a couple of days early. When you begin a class, find out what the teacher expects you to read to keep up with the class and prepare for tests. Note those in your calendar. If you get a syllabus from the teach with dates read it carefully, pay attention to the requirements and tests. Now follow through with your deadlines and keep up. When you are in class, be prepared and pay attention. Turn off your phone, don\u2019t play games on your computer, and listen to the teacher. Take notes by hand. Participate. Ask questions. If you don\u2019t understand something contact your teacher and ask about it immediately. Compare what is said in class with your textbook and make notes comparing the two as you study after class. Turn in your assignments complete and on time. Do that and you won\u2019t have to worry about cramming for tests or staying up late to finish something due the next day, because you have done that already. Will that be boring sometimes? Yes. That\u2019s life. If you do approach your classes like the job that they are, you will have a lot less stress now and will have developed good study and work habits that will make your whole life much easier and ,believe it or not, leave you with a lot more time for fun stuff.

Pay attention in class, take notes where needed (but not too much). Keep up with homework / weekly studies to prevent falling behind. Ask questions!!! (most important) it is NEVER something to be ashamed of to not understand something even if it has been explained several times, perhaps you need someone else explaining it to you. Once you keep strict to these rules you will find it will be much easier to pass tests and exams. Most students (TRY to) cram all knowledge in their head days/hours before the exam, whilest having the information doesn\u2019t benefit you maximally. Understanding the matters you study will greatly benefit you as you will be able to fill in some information naturally because you know what to expect. this last part might sound vague but perhaps that is just my language barrier. I hope it helps you in your studies as it is doing for me ",

            "answer_text": "My most important piece of advice is to pay attention in class. And by pay attention I do not mean passively listening; you should be taking notes, thinking of questions to ask the teacher, and drawing connections between the material as you listen. I know many people who goof off in class and then wonder why they are struggling, and by paying attention like this your teacher will like you and you will start understanding the material better. Another piece of advice I have for you is that studying is about quality, not quantity. I'm sure that you are exhausted from studying 8 hours a day, which is not helping your performance in school. My best way of studying is explaining the material to others, as that solidifies it for myself. You have to try different methods and see what works best, but here are a few things I suggest trying. If you are a naturally antsy person, try exercising or playing around with an all when you study. If you love music and sounds, talk to yourself when you study or come up with a song to memorize notes. Reading notes over and over again does not work. Quizzing yourself is very helpful as well. Hope this helps, good luck! ",
