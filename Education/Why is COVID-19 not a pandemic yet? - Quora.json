            "answer_text": "You should know what is epidemic and pandemic first.. Epidemic : occurrence of disease in large number in a particular location \u2026 like COVID-19 in Wuhan. Pandemic : when a disease had spread across various countries and Continent like COVID-19 all over the world now.. COVID-19 was declared pandemic by WHO on MARCH 11. So it's pandemic already ,that's y countries going under lockdown to prevent it's spread ..and avoid community transmissy which is stage three of disease transmission. Stage three is preventable but if not adequate measures done to prevent it , it will spiral out like what happened in ITALY and what's happening in US. As far as INDIA is concerned, ICMR says it's still in between stage 2 & 3 \u2026. So stay home ,stay safe and practice social distancing. Be a saviour . ",
