            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s put it this way: How many hours do you use computers per day? Odds are that quite many, just for working, never mind the facebook, twitter, quora & whatnot. How many hours people used computers 20 or 30 years ago? As much? Less? More? For me the answer is \u201ca little less\u201d, because I\u2019m both a professional and a regular nerd, i.e. I do my work on computers, making it possible for other people do work on their computers easier, faster etc, plus I use computers on my free time too. Another question: What was your first computer experience like? For me it was Commodore 64, with which I played games, until it broke, then the family got a PC, and I dove right in to the MS-Dos 3.3. This was back in 1988 or 1989 or so. For my kids, well, my older one got to experience her PC through Windows XP, mouse point & click games, Thunderbird email client and so on from about the age of\u2026 4? First easy, educational games, and the sorrow was great, when one of those early games stopped working (scratch on a CD disc), and when she learned to read & write, email to other family members & so on\u2026 \u2026and relatively strict limits on what she could do online. Plus monitoring. At some point, I think she was 14 or 15, I bought & tweaked a 13\u2033 2nd hand laptop for her, which she used until it broke\u2026 but by that time she was a proficient user on her own right. My second set of kids, though, have been breaking their proverbial IT teeth with iPads. For reasons not relevant to this discussion, my son had a need for a tablet when he was very young, we got him an iPad mini when he was 3; he learned on that, then we\u2019ve been \u201crecycling\u201d iPads through the kids - when one of us adults gets a new one, one of the kids gets the \u201cold\u201d one; they\u2019re now 10, 6 and 5. Expensive? Well, yes. But consider this: Our 6yo can already read and write pretty well, has decent English language vocabulary - our native is Finnish - and 10yo has been studying English in the school for a year, but can already discuss gaming with other English-speaking gamers just fine. So\u2026 maybe to summarise: Extremely important, if you want the kids to be able to function in future society that they will be living their lives in. ",
