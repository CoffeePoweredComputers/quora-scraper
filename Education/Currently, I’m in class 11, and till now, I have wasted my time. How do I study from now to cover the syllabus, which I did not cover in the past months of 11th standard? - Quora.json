            "answer_text": "You may have wasted your time but fear not, because there's still quite a lot left. But do not get into the habit of taking it for granted. Understand that the syllabus is vast, the competition cut throat, and taking risks here may not be in your favour. See, you have 98 chapters, all included in one exam, that can change your life. So, quite frankly, even one year may be not be enough time for you considering how high the stakes really are. Now you must stop thinking about the past, stop with all the over analysing, weighing all the costs and the energy. Just start now. Try to be as consistent as you can and avoid any mental block, because at the end of your feeling is nothing, but at the end of every principle is a promise. Try to have as much fun as you can along the way, but yeah, you should prioritise it well. ",

Instead of studying for hours, cut down your hours but whenever you will study, put in your best.Give equal importance to all the subjects, and be regular.Study for 6 days a week, but keep the 7th day for revision of whatever you studied in past 6 days and for hanging out.Practice well, and understand the concepts. It will make you memorize everything for more time.For theory, understand it as well. You can write the same in your own language. The only thing you should know is - what you need to write.Thats all !! Thanks !! ",
