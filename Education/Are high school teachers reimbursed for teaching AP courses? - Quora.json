            "answer_text": "It depends upon the district. Some districts reportedly award bonuses to teachers whose students pass the test on a test by test basis. I suppose some do it in other ways. Probably the vast majority of districts do not though. Perhaps some districts also offer some kind of pay differential, but this is also probably unusual. AP courses do tend to be somewhat harder to teach well than regular classes, and require a more in depth degree of content knowledge, but again it depends on local districts as to how they allocate their human resources. Also some teachers just prefer to teach AP (I do) and don\u2019t expect to be paid more or get a bonus for it. Some districts strongly emphasize AP, some don\u2019t. Some emphasize increasing AP enrollments, but not necessarily results. Some are the opposite. There is considerable debate as to whether just taking an AP course is beneficial, even though many students do not score enough on the exam for college credit. I fall into the category of those who consider the experience beneficial, pass or not, but it really depends upon the teacher and the rigor of the course. An AP course taught by a poor or indifferent teacher is not going to do a student a lot of good. By the same token, there are some very smart kids who basically do squat in the course, then show up on exam day and score very well. They probably didn\u2019t benefit from the course either. My own district does not offer any pay differential or bonuses for teaching AP, and I don\u2019t believe any public school systems in the State of Maryland do that. What other states do, and/or what private schools may do in this situation I\u2019m sure varies considerably, but overall I think getting extra money is rare. ",

            "answer_text": "I received the amount the school was awarded for each student who passed the AP test. I taught a course that few students tested in, so I would get a few hundred dollars. Teachers in popular AP courses would often make a few thousand. The big payday are vocational certification courses. We had a drafting instructor who routinely had 60 students testing every semester. His pass rate nearly 80%, at $75 a student, he was bringing in more than $7000 a year. ",
