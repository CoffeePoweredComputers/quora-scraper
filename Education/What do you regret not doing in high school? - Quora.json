            "answer_text": "When she broke down crying in front of the entire class, that\u2019s when I realized that I had made a terrible mistake.  In high school, I was dumb and naive, so there's a lot I regret not doing. But what I regret the most is not being there enough. It was the beginning of my senior year in high school, and around this time, there was some massive drama surrounding two of my friends. I\u2019d rather not delve into details, but the girl cheated on the guy. It was a pretty ugly scene - the entire chaos of the guy finding out, telling his friends, them having to hold him back from fighting the side guy. And the bullying. The guys and his friends would plan to gang up on the girl, and yell swears at her. She would get constant calls from him, yelling about what a bitch she was. And the worst part is, I knew. I was good friends with the guy at the time, so he would tell me about how heartbroken he was, how he needed a release, and what his friends were planning to do. And I did nothing. All I could do was warn her if I knew they were planning to approach her. But that obviously wasn\u2019t enough. I knew that she was probably going through hell - as was he - and yet I did nothing to help her. And why? Because I didn't want to be awkward. The girl and I weren\u2019t as close as we were in middle school, so I didn\u2019t want her to think I was trying to force myself into her life. Dumb mistake. And I didn\u2019t realize it until much later. Our English classes were always very interactive - we\u2019d give presentations, group discussions or just have people talk individually about things they wanted to share. On our last class of high school, our teacher had us talk about our experience, and what we had learnt. And when she broke down crying in front of the entire class, that\u2019s when I realized that I had made a terrible mistake. She talked about what a terrible time she had had, how she was alone, lost a lot of friends and it quite honestly broke my heart. The amount of guilt I felt at that moment was immeasurable. I recollected a conversation with my mum that I had had, when I was just talking about my friends. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d My mum had asked. \u201cShe seems like she\u2019s depressed - or going through a tough time.\u201d I had replied with a measly, \u201cI don\u2019t know mum. We\u2019re not that close - so I can\u2019t ask.\u201d And now, seeing how a little care would\u2019ve helped, I felt terrible. Needless to say, I broke down in tears, and apologized to her after class, for knowing and yet not doing anything to help merely because \u201cwe weren\u2019t that close\u201d. When she claimed that just informing her about the guys planning to approach her was the most anyone had done at the time, I felt worse. The rest of school that day, I was an emotional mess.  I did learn a valuable lesson though. She was strong enough to get through a hard phase of her life, but everyone might not be so fortunate. It doesn\u2019t matter how close you are to someone, you will regret not doing anything later. You will regret not helping, and not being there. So why go make them, and yourself, go through that? Be there for everyone, without doubt. Don\u2019t hold back out of fear of being considered clingy. I wish I had known this in high school, and saved some people a lot of pain. ",
