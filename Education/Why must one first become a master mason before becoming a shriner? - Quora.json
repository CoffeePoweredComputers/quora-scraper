            "answer_text": "If you live in Arkansas, you don't have to be a Mason first. In fact, in Arkansas, if you're a Mason, you are prohibited from becoming a Shriner and vice versa. Although Shrinedom was created as an independent club for Masons, and it originally required its members to have gone through the degrees of one of the two major appendendant systems that operate in the United States (either they were a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason, or a Knight Templar from the York Rite). The appendant degree requirement was dropped in the late 90s (? I'm not positive on the date and can't find it quickly right now). This boosted Shrine membership but was a blow to the appendant bodies. Any organization that requires its membership to be Masons must be approved by the Masonic Grand Lodge that governs that jurisdiction. This makes sense. You don't want a group out there doing something bad and then have it come out that they're all Masons. We want to make sure that whatever activities they are doing are not harming the good reputation we want. This is why there has been trouble with some of the Masonic Motorcycle Clubs; especially if/when the members of those clubs give tribute to (or worse yet model themselves after) the dominant 1%er MC in their area. This is why in some jurisdictions these clubs are required to be 'one-patch' clubs or Riders Associations. In Arkansas the leadership of the Grand Lodge and the leadership of the Shrine had some disagreements. The result was that the Shrine was banned in Arkansas. All Shriners had to either denounce their Shrine membership or leave Freemasonry. This isn't the first (and it won't be the last) time an appendant body has been banned. The Order of the Eastern Star was banned in Pennsylvania from 1919 to 1971. ",

            "answer_text": "Why must one first become a master mason before becoming a Shriner? Ultimately, it is just a rule of the Shriner\u2019s organization. Why? First the Shrine was formed as a club for Freemasons that wanted to do a little charitable work and have some fun on the side. Ok, so why not open up the Shrine organization up now? All Freemasons take an oath to be trustworthy and honourable. It\u2019s not a 100% guarantee, but a Master Mason has taken that oath and knows how Lodges work, how to get along in a Lodge (or Lodge-like) environment, and probably knows a lot of the guys already by the time he wants to become a Shriner. A Master Mason knows to be discrete and trustworthy. He has already proved that, or he wouldn\u2019t have had the patience and taken the path to become a Master Mason. The Shriners raise and handle money used for charity. Trust is important. The Shrine is very effective, money given to them goes straight to the cause. They do all the admin and handling for the pleasure of it. They also talk to families about expenses and income. Discretion is critical. Would you want it known that you need charity? Your family income and your injured child\u2019s expenses broadcast? That won\u2019t happen if you receive help from the Shriners. People know that. That level of trust happens in the Freemason\u2019s fraternity. Freemasonry is all about trust, integrity, discretion, and bonding with good guys. It\u2019s not always 100%, but it is a good qualifier. ",
