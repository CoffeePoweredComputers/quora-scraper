            "answer_text": "I put part of the answer in this post already about my understanding of the evolution of common core. Hopefully this makes sense, I can clarify if need be. Reading the link below may help. Joshua Roberts's answer to Is common core bad or are people bad at math? The purpose behind teaching children multiple ways of solving arithmetic stems from the ideas of modern mathematical teaching concepts. As I state in the article above, Leon Henkin was a proponent for teaching number theory along with memorized arithmetic to students. This prepares young minds to tackle more complicated maths as they get older, but only if it done properly. Here I will present an example I used in the comments section of the above post to give a better example of what the ultimate goal of common core should be vs what is happening. The math Question: Can you make 10 from 8+5? This question as written makes no sense at all. The student answered No, 8+5=13 So what is the goal of the question? In Algebra and high maths it becomes important to be able to factor numbers, to be able to use concepts like the additive identity which leads to an understanding of the multiplicative identity, just to name a few. Additive identity is 8+5=13 and 5+8=13. But, why pick out the number 10? How is that related to factoring? Technically it is not, since factoring is multiplication property, however, multiplication is just a quick form of addition. 2*4 = 2+2+2+2 When we use this idea with the equation 8+5=13 we can break it down to primes if we want. That means it becomes (2+2+2+2)+(2+3)=13. If I put all the 2\u2019s together I get (2+2+2+2+2)+3 =10+3= 13. That is the same as saying 10+3=13. But, I can break it down in any number of other ways, (5+3)+(2+3) = (5+2+3)+3=(7+3)+3 = 10+3=13 Or just 8+5= 8+(2+3)= (8+2)+3= 10 + 3 = 13 We could do this for every number from 1 to 9 by restructuring the numbers, which has little practical use outside of pure number theory. What is the purpose of this? To make mental maths easier, it helps to train students to think of math problems in terms of the properties of base 10. Eventually these long exercises become straight forward shortcuts in the students mind. The mind will automatically make these decisions once the idea has been practiced enough, putting an end to students counting on their fingers (which this is analogous to) and many other bad habits that some students have. 8 is 8 ones and 5 is 5 ones. 8+5 = 13, but 13 is also 1 tens and 3 ones. What is the quickest way to make this easier to deal with without memorizing addition tables? Make the 8 into a 10, since the answer requires a 1 in the tens place. 8 +2 = 10. 5\u20132 = 3. 10+3=13. This may seem ridiculously over complicated for teaching a child, but entering high school and college and getting into high maths, it will be more important for students to be able to understand as many of the theoretical properties of numbers as possible in order to make learning more complicated maths easier. Being able to handle simple number manipulations makes concepts like factoring polynomial expressions much easier to learn. x^2+5x+6 = (x+3)(x+2). We need to be able to break down these numbers in much the same the way as we did with 8+5=10+3=13. We do this by understanding other ways of representing numbers to get the same answer, not by simply memorizing tables of answers. That was what Leon Henkin and other university professors and researchers into mathematics decided when they were learning to teach modern concepts of math to high school and college teachers in the late 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s. Teach people HOW numbers work not just ask them to memorize patterns in numbers and they will progress in mathematics farther and faster. However, common core currently has very little practical training for teachers in the number theory side. Further issues are that the publishing industry does not have a strict set of guidelines regarding what the books should contain, how to structure the books, how to present the theoretical content as compared to the traditional mechanical memorization, and many other issues. The intention is solid, the implementation leaves much to be desired. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s hard to do it well ! Few years ago, I wrote this document : making_thinkers.pdf Here is a quote from it : Student are unable to find something by themselves, they are used to function like processors. They learn a methodology and a set of standards algorithms to apply for standard situations. But world isn't build with standard and each real life case is specific. It make a big disability in professional world too and enterprises have to give some trainings to enable these new worker to be effective. The goal of education is to enable people to be efficient as soon they leave school but it fails. The modern approach is worst than the simple \u201cold school\u201d way of teaching. We reduced school time, reduced homework, there is more to learn so we ask less understanding from students. Some students can't simply use the rule of third. (You know, you need 4 eggs for 6 people, how many do you need for 9 ?) Also, we introduce some biases in their mind and student think that any problem have one solution and that it's always solvable. You can see that kind of lack in any real live situation like cooking and scheduling. In the document, I give rationals and a method to create exercises that break this scheme. I even provide an example of course. For example, I use the following problem \u201c364230 \u00f7 6\u201d to prompt long division. An astute student would notice that the number do not require long division, even if the number itself is long. (Which is a bias introduced by most teachers) If the teacher want a specific method to be used, he should state it clearly. It\u2019s that simple. It also scream at the student that this may not be the best method, but a method he is asked to know. This makes a huge difference ! Still, the best is to do like I documented. Provide exercises which are far easier to solve using appropriate methods. Done repeatedly, the student will seek for such shortcuts and learn in the process.  This doc is 7 years old ! ",
