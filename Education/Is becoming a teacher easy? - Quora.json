            "answer_text": "It depends where you look at as the start of the journey. In most cases, to become a teacher, you must first be a university graduate. I worked damn hard to get my degree. I took 3 A Levels, dropped one and failed one. I had to do an HND followed by a one-year top-up degree. The degree was incredibly challenging as it aimed to transform a diploma into the equivalent of a 3-year degree in just one year. When I got my first 3 assignments back, I discovered that I had failed 2 of them. I only passed in the end due to sheer grit, determination and hard work. After I passed my degree course, I took my CELTA. That course was 4 weeks of absolute hell and it was bearable only because of the incredibly supportive bunch of trainers and classmates that I was lucky enough to work with. I decided to go into TEFL after losing my job in 2009 in the wake of the worldwide financial crisis of 2008. Due to racism and discrimination in the TEFL industry, it took me a further 4 years of jobhunting before I was finally offered a job in a Chinese university in 2013. Only at this point could I really call myself a teacher. OK, so now that I've got my dream job, I'm a teacher, right? Wrong! When I stepped into my first classroom, it quickly dawned on me that the methods that I had busted my guts learning simply aren't going to work in China. And as a newbie teacher, I didn't know what else I could do. It took a lot more research, taking part in online discussions, trial and error etc. before I became an effective teacher. Teaching, easy? It's definitely not a walk in the park. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Becoming a teacher is not easy. Student Teaching is often rigorous, stressful, time consuming as well as an important experience to help future teachers learn how to plan and prepare classroom instruction, grade and assess student work, and how to manage and maintain an organized classroom. As a Supervising Teacher and a Classroom Teacher who has had many Student Teachers, it was evident that Student Teachers have quite a job balancing teaching two classes and keeping up with their work and study as a University Grad student. Usually the first year of teaching is the hardest and most challenging because it is a learning experience. First year teachers learn how to plan, how to modify, how to adapt to changes, how to motivate students, how to time their lessons, how to collaborate with colleagues, how to prioritize decisions, and many other teaching practices and experiences. The hardest and most important part of teaching is the countless days and hours of detailed planning and preparation including lesson and unit planning, class requirements, classroom procedures, room organization and appearance. Next hardest comes grading and assessment. With good detailed planning and preparation, the easiest part of teaching becomes being with the students and teaching in the classroom.
