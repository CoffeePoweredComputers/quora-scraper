            "answer_text": "If you look at the profile of any of the Service Academies you will note that an extremely high percentage of admitted applicants are varsity team captains and almost everyone admitted played a varsity sport. So, with this in mind I suggest you pick a sport and get started. Personally, I think running would be a good choice because you need to be able to comfortably run without falling out of formation. Cross Country or Track & Field. Sports like Football, Basketball and Baseball are also good but they may require size or natural ability while running does not. Additionally, there is a significant risk of an injury like an ACL tear that might prevent you from being admitted to a Service Academy. Otherwise, you should pursue the most academically challenging curriculum you can and do as well as you can in terms of grades. The academic standards for USAFA are quite high you need to be a good enough student to get into a top 10 LAC or the most selective Public Universities ",

            "answer_text": "Get in shape. Cultivate a sport and try out for your high school team. Letter, or better yet, be the captain of your team. Get involved in something larger than yourself, like student government, a periodical, a charitable organization, or the like. Start studying for the SAT and take the PSAT your junior year and the SAT in the fall of your senior year (so you can retake it if necessary). Take challenging courses, like AP classes, physics, and advanced math. You\u2019ll be expected to have mastered calculus, for instance. Who knows if you enjoy video games\u2026but if you do, time to stop. There are no rewards for being good at Skyrim. Sure, everyone needs to goof off sometimes, but do so in a constructive way, like crossword puzzles, reading books, or woodworking. Most of all, GET GOOD GRADES. This takes great care and hard work\u2026you\u2019ll need a 3.75 or better to be in contention. This means don\u2019t party before a big test, do all your homework, get extra credit, etc. Good luck!
