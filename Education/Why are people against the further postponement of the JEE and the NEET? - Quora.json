            "answer_text": "Pressure is most common reason. If you are eagerly waiting for an exam,for that you have been preparing since 2 years or more. You don't want postponement for 3 times,even a single time. It builds a mental pressure and you are getting frustrated. You have been told to sit in a room and study,you don't know when it comes to end. It is very easy to say why people's are against furthur postponement but think about students. They are reading same thing for almost 3-4 time,they got fed up with this. ",
