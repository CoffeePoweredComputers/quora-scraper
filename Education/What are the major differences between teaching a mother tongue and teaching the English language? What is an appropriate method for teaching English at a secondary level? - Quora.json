            "answer_text": "Oh\u2026 Man!! In which language teaching should be done? Should it be in mother tongue or not? This is such a emotive issue. Anything I am going to write is going to piss off some one. But I have a very strong opinion on this and let me not hold myself back. I personally believe, if had an option, pupils should go through at least primary and higher primary education (in India it is from 1st standard to 7th standard) in their mother tongue. Later point in time, during high school (8th standard onward) one can switch to English medium from high school. I have reasons for this and I am telling this based on personal experience. I have studied in Kannada medium (my states regional language and my mother tongue) till my 7th standard. From 8th standard on wards I switched to English medium. It was my father who decided that I should move to English medium. It was not like he just pushed me in to the well. He explained his rationale and I found it convincing enough. He was of the opinion that after 10th, all professional courses are done in English. Instead of struggling with language problem them it better to deal with it when it\u2019s not that much damaging. I would be lying if I say that I was not scared. I actually flunked one or two quarterly tests. But those were much simpler times - failing in quarterly tests were not taken seriously especially by my parents . But after six months I slowly but surely was pretty much able to grasp everything that was going on in class room - thanks to sympathetic teachers and helpful friends. By the time I reached 10th final year exam, my Kannada medium background was never ever a handicap for me. If I didn\u2019t do well in any particular subject, it was more to do with subject itself rather than language in which it was taught. I personally feel, coming from Kannada medium (you can replace this with any language that is your mother tongue) did few good things to me. Most of us in Kannada medium never did rote learning - probably except poems. Since we were being taught in our mother tongue, we pretty much wrote what we understood in our own sentences. Most of us wrote our own version of definition of Newton\u2019s laws as we understood in Kannada. If our definitions were were wrong , it was because we understood them wrong. Most of us never felt the need to write something 10 times, 20 times in practice book and homework book. I some home feel when you start learning in language that is alien to you, you try to learn it by rote rather than understand it. I have seen this happening with my own brother who attended English convent from kindergarten. Actually it became a handicap to me when I switched to English medium. I couldn\u2019t rote learn answers. If I understood I would write answers(in my own broken English grammar) but I couldn\u2019t rote learn them to save my life. But I am glad that I always wrote how I understood them rather than rote learn. In this way my teachers would at least come to know that I had got it wrong and correct me. I am not saying that every one in English medium learns by rote learning. I am not saying that rote learning is bad. It is just that since you are being taught in language that is natural to you, you never feel the need to remember it, rather you just understand it. I also feel having a grounding in your mother tongue will give you a strong foundation about your own culture and identity. I hear and see schools which impose fine on students which don\u2019t speak in English in class room. The intent might right but the way they are doing it is wrong. This will induce inferiority complex in children about ones own cultural and linguistic identity. It also induce a false sense of superiority complex just because one is able to converse in English. We should avoid raising our children with misplaced sense of their own identity.  I personally believe, if had an option, What do I mean by \u201cif had an option\u201d? There are very few good schools left which provide good education in regional language. Especially here in Bangalore I have not heard of one single private school which teaches in Kannada medium. But in Dharwad , which is my native place, and even in Mysore (where I have spent enough time) there are enough Christian missionary run schools or private schools where medium of instruction is Kannada. I feel there is a need to good quality schools in regional language. I feel this is applicable to all states of India, not just Karnataka. My daughter now studies in Kindergarten and it was impossible to find a good school which had Kannada as medium of instruction. I was very clear that Kannada had to be part of her education from beginning. Finally I was able to find a school which is even though an English medium school, it had Kannada in it\u2019s curriculum from the beginning. The reason for doing this is not because of some false sense of pride about my language. I am not a one of those who bashes everything that is English. I actually owe a lot of things I have been able to accomplish is because of my fluency with English. But based on my personal experience, I feel having basic minimum education in ones own mother tongue does good things to child\u2019s overall development. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically nobody teaches a mother tongue. It is self acquired by observing and listening to mother. English language is foreign and the most appropriate method is make it more communicative by speaking or reading loudly. The learner should read and be guided to read along with the teacher. This will reduce the level of hesitation and provoke the learner to speak quite frequently. Grammar should follow a person's assertions. Too much fixation on grammar will not be conducive for teaching English. Create situations for a person to use English language. If there is hesitation guide the learner to speak and ask him to repeat after you. Constant practice will enhance the proficiency of the learner. Read Write and Recite is the best method. ",
