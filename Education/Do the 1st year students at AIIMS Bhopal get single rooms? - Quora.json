The reasons being : As a preventive measure of ragging.Buddy formula : You learn to live together as it's a new environment your buddy will help you with day to day activities.The second person can report and take care of any mishappening with the person.The rules for first year are different from those of other batches and it's done by adminstration keeping in mind of Anti Ragging Laws. Edit: As pointed out by Shobit Jain, AIIMS Bhopal provides single occupancy rooms to girls and will soon to boys in 1st Year. Thank You \u2764\ufe0f ",

After that the first years used to get shared rooms in the faculty residential area. As far as I know, 2019 batch got shared rooms in the PG hostel. The construction work for new hostels is under progress but no one can give an accurate completion date(especially here). Also, even the shared rooms are spacious, so hostels should not be a point of worry for you. ",
