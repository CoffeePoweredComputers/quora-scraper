            "answer_text": "Bsc is a very generalised term there are many many fields in bsc like non-applied bsc - bsc zoology and applied bsc - bsc microbiology. Applied fields of bsc or more job oriented( though you can also go for research in higher studies) whereas non-applied fields of bsc are mainly if you want to go for research and teaching.(Job profile - mainly researcher/scientist) BASLP is completely different from bsc, I have written one answer regarding BASLP please check it out Rohit Goel's answer to What is BASLP? Is it in our future will be safe? What are the opportunities of job after doing BASLP? (Job profile - audiologist/speech therapist) If only money matters to you then I would say choose BASLP but you should take your interest aa first priority then other things come into play. So I would say just go to google and search syllabus of BASLP course and search more about bsc fields then see what interests you most. Thank you. ",
