            "answer_text": "It depends on your school. If the weight of each subject wasn't explained to you by a teacher or something, go and ask. In my school I had a yearly grade (which was made by exams, homework and other school activities throughout the year) and a finals grade (final exams). The yearly grade was worth 30% of my grade in my diploma and the finals grade was worth 70%. Let's say I wanted to know my math grade in my diploma. I got 85 in my yearly grade and I got 90 in my finals. So to achieve my math diploma grade I'll multiply each by its own percentage weight and add both of them up. 85*0.3 + 90*0.7 = 88.5 That means my math diploma grade is 88.5 ",
