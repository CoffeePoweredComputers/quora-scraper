            "answer_text": "I would suggest that both platforms are almost similar.But it depends on teachers. Comparison: 1.Teachers: Vedantu has lots of teachers, once you purchase some course they will allocate you in some batch, in which teachers are selected by Vedantu Team.Whereas in Unacademy there are so many batches and you can enroll in an number. (For Eg: If Namo Sir teaches Physics in Batch \u2018A\u2019 and Sameer sir teaches Maths in Batch \u2018\u2019B and not for A,Then you can enroll in both and see accordingly).Unacademy also has a separate batch which has teacher\u2019s from Kota teaching you, which makes you feel more confident about your preparation. So,Unacademy gets a point here. 2.Price: Vedantu Prices are far more costlier than Unacademy , Hence Unacademy gets a point here. EDIT 1: Here Both Vedantu and Unacademy gets a point as of 4/9/2020, as Unacademy is going with Price Hike, and Vedantu with its new Subscription Model (Vedantu Pro), has similar Pricing. 3.Free Courses: Unacademy provides complete courses for free on Youtube and is taught in detail by the greatest teachers, whereas Vedantu doesn\u2019t have dedication in giving complete content regularly.Hence again Unacademy gets a point here But, eventhough teaching is good, I faced a problem in both Platform,For a student teaching doesn\u2019t feel that mind touching because teachers don\u2019t teach on board, they write it on a Tablet/Laptop and Webcam Video of Teacher is seen on their Premium courses and I felt Unacademy JEE LIVE was better than Plus, hence I left plus and started using Unacademy JEE Live Daily EDIT 2: Due to this Coronavirus Pandemic worldwide, all teachings have shifted online, so I dont think it makes more sense now. So now offline and online coaching seems the same. 4. APP User Interface: Unacademy\u2019s app has less crashes than Vedantu, Unacademy\u2019s Plus App is more better organised than Vedantu. Eg: 1. In doubt section of Vedantu\u2019s App, after each doubt is solved it asks about \u201cWhether teacher was able to solve doubt\u201d. When you go to ask the doubt again, it asks the same again, after two- three times doing same it will allow you to ask the doubt. 2.Even Schedule part (Interface) of Unacademy looks more good than Vedantu. Both Unacademy and Vedantu has good teachers, but Unacademy has creative way of teaching. The way they teach by making you realise about the concepts through Killer Visualisation is really awesome. I don\u2019t remember any formulas now, but derive all by visualizing.(In my college they always used to say to mug-up formulas, and the examples given on board was very difficult to understand, but was made easy through graphical representation on Unacademy JEE Live Daily) Trust me UNACADEMY is comparitively better than Vedantu for both JEE and NEET.
