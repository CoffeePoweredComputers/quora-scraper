            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know how old you are but this seems rather a funny quetion to me! I doubt that an adult would ask it. However, I am assuming that you are over 13, given Quora\u2019s rules. In this case, you have probably heard every expression I am about to mention, as examples (either on TV or from your friends and, perhaps, family). Bad things happen all the time. And people use bad words when bad things happen, to express their frustration, anger, etc. All of the \u201cbad words\u201d that we use today are, in fact, words that the average person used even before the Middle Ages. Most so-called bad words represent body-functions (urination, defecation, sex, childbirth, etc. and related stuff such as STDs, body-orifices, and so on); agricultural terms (fruit of the womb is one of the more polite expressions while shoving it in or planting it is less so); family-relations (bastard, for instance); things related to intelligence and/or hard work (air-head, moron, or slug, sloth, etc.); and, of course, permutations and combinations of these things. This is, of course, not a comprehensive list. Each profession has its own insults. Then, also, there are comparsons to animals (fat as an elephant, stupid as a donkey, and so on) and also comparisons to natural events and or forces (slow as a glacier or snoring like an earthquake, for example). Insults and compliments evolve around whatever people do more or less all the time. Think of all the things that people have been doing for at least hundreds of thousands of years or perhaps even millions of years \u2014 studying, eating, growing food, gathering food, cooking, marrying, working, learning, teaching, making things (artistic and also practical), losing things, getting hurt (physically and emotionally), and so on.

The profanities they used were pretty much the same we use today, and usually connected to last phases of metabolism, first phases of human procreation, low intelligence or God\u2019s wrath. The English archers are known to have used the word \u201cgoddamn\u201d so much that they got a nickname les godons by the French. ",

Yes: their swearing was more often blasphemy than obscenity, and the use of bodily-function words seems to have been more a question of decorum than taboo. However, there are loads of preachments against swearing by God and the saints, and narratives of people doing just that (e.g. Chaucer\u2019s Pardoner\u2019s Tale). My favourite story is of a noblewoman confessing to her chaplain, who reproves her for her excessive swearing: -My lady, your swearing is a grave offense. You must cease. -By God! I will. ",
