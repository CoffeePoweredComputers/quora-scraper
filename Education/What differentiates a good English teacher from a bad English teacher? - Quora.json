            "answer_text": "There's no concise answer to this - generally a teacher with a positive stance - who enjoys teaching - who enjoys people - ultimately creates a more positive classroom environment. Students feeling discouraged, disheartened - students who are overly criticized rather than encouraged - don't do as well in a foreign language class. When we speak - in our home language - we open ourselves. Speaking up, sharing your thoughts and opinions - can make people feel vulnerable. Speaking up can feel risky - what reaction will people have to what you say? When you're speaking in a foreign language classroom - students can feel very insecure, very uncertain. Many students have the underlying fear that they will be laughed at - they'll say something in the wrong way, they'll use the wrong word and so they're reluctant to speak at all. Pouncing on students for their grammatical errors can make students feel more insecure and more uncertain. What's the teacher's attitude toward English? Toward language learning? Do they enjoy it? Do they see language as a great adventure - or is it a chore forced on them by changing global realities? The good English teacher is positive - toward learners, toward those trying to learn English, and enjoys teaching in general as well as teaching English. ",
