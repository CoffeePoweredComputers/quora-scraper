            "answer_text": "Bye(s) are given to one or more team when there are odd number of teams/ person playing a knockout tournament. Generally, if last season\u2019s semi-finalist or finalist are known, they are preferred for bye ( so that best teams will reach the finals ). The seeded team( the team with bye) doesn\u2019t play first round, rather directly gets to play from 2nd round onwards. Procedure: Suppose there are N odd number of teams. Then upper half has (N+1)/2 teams and lower half has (N-1)/2 teams. Draw a line differentiating upper and lower half. Number of byes= 2^m - N ; where m is the least integer satisfying (2^m)>N To give byes: (i) I Bye will be given to bottom most team of lower half. (ii) II Bye will be awarded to top most team of upper half. (iii) III Bye will be given to top most team of lower half. (iv) IV Bye will be awarded to bottom most team of upper half . Repeat the steps till all the byes are given. So here in 1st round, only 3 and 4 plays game and wining one goes to round 2. In round2, we have got even teams, so it is easy to draw fixture from round2.  ",

(e.g. 2,4,8,16,32 etc.) Then bye is given in the first round of the tournament in order to adjust all the teams or players for the next following rounds according to match the power of 2. bye is determined by subtracting the number of teams or players from its closest power of 2. e.g. if the number of teams are 12 then the number of bye will be \u2026 16 \u2013 12 =4 Where, 16 is the closest power of 2 of 12 12 (N) is the number of teams Separate rule for league tournament For details text me\u2026.
