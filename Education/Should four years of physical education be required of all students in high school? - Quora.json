            "answer_text": "Physical education is an attempt to get students to actually exercise, because once they reach college, god knows that\u2019s out of the door (unless you\u2019re trying to get laid). Personally, I didn\u2019t even do physical education because I went straight into marching band (don\u2019t like pointless exercises). In my 2nd year of college, I finally started going to the gym and actually exercising about 3 to 4x a week. When I joined a research lab, this went down to 2 to 3x a week, and after I got a job and have moved out, now it\u2019s struggling at 2x most of the time. Now why is this relevant? Because the purpose of the class is important. If you are trying to make exercising a habit, at high school it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. If you\u2019re trying to show the importance of exercise, I\u2019m sorry but there are things in life far more important (I.E. money, house, food, job, school, etc.). If you\u2019re trying to simply keep people healthy, congratulations, you had me exercise for 4 years, now I can finally be a slob. I started exercising because I had decided it\u2019s what I wanted to do to be healthy, not because of PE. I have decreased my exercising as time goes on because I have decided other things are more important than exercise. My point in all this is that, physical education has had zero impact on my life, other than have me take marching band (which I guess is a plus if you look at it). So should physical education be extended to 4 instead of 2? No. I don\u2019t see it accomplishing anything other than wasting time. Those that are going to be slobs, will be slobs without PE. Those that are going to exercise, will exercise regardless of PE. ",

            "answer_text": "If you cannot see the legal challenges on this one....Title 9, The Handicapped, etc. then there's the problem of insurance a school or the group that has purview over the school must carry...the liability, not the same as insurance, wild eyed parents who believe their kid is better and should be allowed to play every inning, quarter, half...not to mention the wild eyed parents who believe that their kid is in ssooooooo much danger if he/she even steps onto a court. Oh, forgot, the fights for and against, the young people who proclaim themselves as gender different which sets up another fight by, usually, parents who do/do not want their child going to school with \"someone like that\". What was your question? Oh, yeah, yes I do believe all young people should at least have access to some form of vigorous activity for their four years of High School. But I also believe they're entitled to get a more complete education that will prepare them, not just for the 'outside world' but for continuing education. Now, unless someone actively works to get into Advanced Placement-or whatever it's called wherever you are-they'll end up with an education that's, at best, mediocre taught by instructors who have a certificate or degree in education but lack any specific subject in which they're qualified to teach. More than 65 years ago my Grandfather wanted me to be a blue collar millionaire and, in retrospect, he had some good ideas. How he would've handled doctorates in two topics eludes me but, as he was prone to do, would have been proud even if quietly, he would have still thought I should have been out in a hard hat working on the rigs....
