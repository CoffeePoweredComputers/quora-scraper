            "answer_text": "Maybe, but what she thinks is not your problem. Figuring out your life and what you want to do with it is more important. Your relationship with yourself is going to last longer than any other, because it already has. You can\u2019t force yourself into something you\u2019re not sure about, or you may end up with a BA in English lit, with an unfinished credential and after an internship of teaching 8th grade for a year you might realize that you never want to teach again. So then you have student loans and no career and you\u2019re 35 now and kinda screwed. (me, and kinda my hubby too, although he actually managed to stand teaching longer than I did) Stop worrying about what she will think (or just talk to her) and choose a field that has an entry level job with advancement possibilities. Don\u2019t get into debt, you can always go to college later. My brother\u2019s work paid for him to go to college and then promoted him and now he has a stable career that he did not plan on at all. In fact I have five brothers and sisters who did this, they went into a field in one way or another and got promoted from within, got their college on the go and they all are completely successful, and seemingly happy. I, on the other hand, live in a very old mobile home on my hubby\u2019s parent\u2019s land with our two kids because we thought we were smart and we went to college on the outset but didn\u2019t choose our majors in a street-smart manner and now he\u2019s a handy man working (back breaking labor) for his dad at almost 40, and I am at home with the kids/writing books that get pirated from Amazon, which may or may not be taking from the 10 sales I have made this year, can\u2019t be sure, maybe the pirates\u2019 luck is worse, but it\u2019s surely not helping me. We thought we knew what we were doing, we had all the planning in the world, and we are here. My siblings fell into things and just made them work for them and they are where they are. How long have you even been with this girl, is marriage even on the table? Don\u2019t freak out about losing her unless she\u2019s perfect for you, and if she is that, then no, she won\u2019t think you\u2019re useless. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, wigga! At first she may be fine with it but then she is going to get really impatient and dump your butt. Why? Cuz women are hypergamous by nature and want a man who can take care of them and their offspring. You need to show ambition if you want to keep her. But think about the fact that you may be comfortable and happy in your life with her and that is not going to light the fire under your arse that you need. Time is always ticking on, so you better make continual progress or you will be old and gray and without a girlfriend. You don\u2019t need to figure out your career but you need to have a job and a hobby. Then figure out from there what will make you happy and what will make you money. Save up a whole bunch so even if she isn\u2019t happy, you can buy yourself more time by taking her out to a nice restaurant. Unfortunately that\u2019s really how it is. Money = freedom. Also, women will want what is best for them. Don\u2019t be a Cuck and do everything she wants or you will lose yourself then she will lose respect for you cuz you\u2019re doing everything she wants and that\u2019s not attractive to a woman. Be firm and tender and get that money. You\u2019re still young enough to figure it out but too old for too much time remaining to do so. Give her one pump for me. ",
