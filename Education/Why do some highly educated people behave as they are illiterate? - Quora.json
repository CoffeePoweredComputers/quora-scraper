Now I'm gonna point out some basic illiterate-types act done by most of the educated fellows...... Throwing plastic bags , bottles anywhere either on the mid of the road or just throw it anywhere else casually. Fond of or addicted of smoking & drinking alcohols even they are perfectly aware with their defects that how much these are injurious to health.Even sometimes usually we can see a good looking man with a handsome personality giving some professional look going for office but walking at the wrong side of the road , riding without helmet , driving without tiding seat belt and they intentionally break the traffic rules.They can be seen using cell phones at petrol pump while reading a  quote there \"DON'T USE CELL PHONES\" .Some of them use at least one abusive word at the beginning of the sentence and finishing it with another abusive word .

            "answer_text": "You should re-phrase your question\u2026 why do educated people behave as if they have no common sense? That\u2019s because education system does not teach common sense. When this system was invented everyone has loads of common sense. Read how Huckleberry fin and Tom sawyer could build a raft and live for couple of days on their own as kids. So, this system is not designed to impart common sense. Now it is gone. Educated seldom have common sense. They seldom have a sense of duty and responsibility (Ready Kanika Kapoor). Asides, if one has common sense, they would have figured out that \u201cbeing happy\u201d, \u201ccreating happiness\u201d as a primary goal of good life. So, if you see people who are unhappy, don\u2019t know why they are unhappy, compete with the Jones, pursue a meaningless career ladder, buy bigger and bigger cars, houses, branded cloths to seek happiness, chase likes in social media, then realize all these folks don\u2019t have common sense. And, this is quite rampant. ",
