            "answer_text": "I am assuming you are asking how to improve your grades?  Upgrade is an interesting term so I am not sure what you mean. Assuming that you mean improving grades, the obvious answers come into play.  Study more, maybe improve notetaking and study skills.  Tests are good ways to determine where you need to focus more.  After each test, go back to the section you got wrong answers in and review.  Most likely, you will be tested on it again, plus you will be strengthening you foundation.  Do a few more exercises in that area until you really feel competent.  A solid understanding of one piece of the puzzle may be key to the next part. Extra credit.  Ask your teacher if you can get assignments for this.  I have found in grade school, that teachers know what areas you need to master and are willing to give you assignments that will help you improve for credit.  Winter break is coming up, talk to your teachers now and see what they suggest. Even if they just review the grade book and suggest where you might need to study more, if you do it, extra credit or not, you may come back feeling better about your strength in that area.  Commit to working on challenging areas an hour a day over the holiday. Organization and keeping track of assignments is key.  Just because a project is due in a month, does not mean that you wait until a week before it is due to start it.  Your teacher really thinks that the deadline is realistic with you other work, if you allocate some time every day to work on it. So here are some ideas.  Wishing you great ideas with your upgrade!

            "answer_text": "You first need to build your sense of direction in your studies. That means you need to be constantly aware what are the topics you already know and what are the topics still require you to spend more time to study. In order to build your sense of direction in your studies, you need to study to understand, which provides for solid memories, rather than studying to remember/memorizing. This is what I will suggest you do On working days or any busy days, allocate a fixed time for homework and studying in each day. This will give you an idea on how much time you need each day to do both which makes you more organized.For each day, ideally before you go to bed, allocate 1 hour to finish your homework and the next hour doing some short revisions from what you learned during school.The short revisions include writing some short notes of what you know and what you still need to learn from today\u2019s lessons.In the final 5 minutes of that one hour revision session, you do a reflection on what you have learn in all your lesson today. This meaning making a summary of what you have learned today and what you still need to learn or not sure or seek help from the teacher on the next day.By doing a reflection, you get a clear idea of what you know and don\u2019t know which then gives you direction on what you need to learn in school. This will naturally give you a sense of purpose in studying as well as keeping you engaged in your study session. Thus, you will naturally have the motivation to keep learning and studying.During the weekends (or any full day), allocate for a 2 hour study session, with a 15 minutes break in between, on each weekend for a study session. The most ideal time to do this is in the morning when you just had your breakfast. In the last 15 minutes of each study session, you also do a reflection on what you have learned and what you still need to improve on. This will give you a sense of direction on what you still need to learn in class for the next week. If you repeat this step, you will realise you are studying more efficiently by constantly focus on improvement. You may add one more 3 hour study session on a full day if you do not have anything else on. All this allows you to study efficiently and still have time to work, do your fitness/exercises or whatever that is close to that, have a social life and have a good night sleep ",

The first is \u201cA taxi driver is asked \u2018how do you get to Carnegie Hall?\u2019 \u201d The answer is \u201cPractice, practice, practice. A second is \u201cA real estate agent is asked \u2018what three things determine the value of a house?\u2019 \u201d The answer is \u201cLocation, location, location.\u201d I am a retired teacher and librarian. In answer to your question about how to improve your school grade I would say \u201cRead, read, read.\u201d I would tell you to read all manner of books; fiction and non-fiction. Read history, science, memoirs, novels, romances, spy novels, Young Adult books, etc. Reading is the single best thing you can do to help you in school. There are too many books to mention here but if there is one book that I would recommend today it would be the memoir EDUCATED by Tara Westover. It is about a young woman who did not attend school at all until she stepped into a university class at Brigham Young University. It was not that she was home-schooled. It was that her fundamentalist father did not believe that women needed a formal education. He felt that they just need to learn skills for keeping a home. He felt that men also did not need an education beyond simple reading and writing. I think you will find much to think about in this book. (Westover ended up studying history at Harvard and Cambridge.) Tara Westover Turns Her Isolated Childhood into the Gripping Memoir Educated ",

            "answer_text": "It would be helpful to know a little bit more about the context of your question.  Are you asking with view of finding employment or applying to university?   Are your grades overall not very strong, or just in specific subjects?  Generally speaking, the more things we do, and other experiences, skills and accomplishments we have, the less do our school grades matter.  So although you can't 'upgrade' your school grades in the sense of improving them - unless you have a chance to retake the exams, but would that even be a viable option?  - you can definitely 'upgrade' your CV by working on your knowledge, experience and skills.
