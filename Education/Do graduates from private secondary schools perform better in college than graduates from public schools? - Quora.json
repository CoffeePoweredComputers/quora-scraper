            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. Private schools have an almost 100% university access rate whereas the more deprived the area of a state school, the less likely its students are to even get to uni. Because of this, some of the least intelligent people at university come from private schools. If you scrape in after being in class sizes of 11 and with a private tutor, uni is going to be hard. But university can also be very hard for young people who come from less privileged backgrounds or who are the first to attend further education. Some drop out or struggle because everything outside the academics is hard. But in the end, the tougher the background, the brighter the kid who makes it to a top university so as long as they don\u2019t feel excluded or bullied or overwhelmed by culture shock, then university can be their first experience of uninterrupted, focused learning in their lives. And in this environment, they can truly excel. ",

            "answer_text": "Not when you factor in income levels. Students from private schools tend to be wealthier than those from public schools and family wealth is linked to SAT scores. People with less money tend to have trouble affording college and so need to drop out or take longer to complete college because they have to get a job while going to school part time. At the elite colleges, private school graduates tend to enter better prepared, but the public school graduates catch up in the first year. ",

            "answer_text": "I have no idea about colleges in the USA. But here in Australia there are problems for privately educated students at university. Not for all of them, but private schools tend to I be more like \u201chelicopter parents.\u201d Staff will phone students to remind them to get their work in on time for instance. This does not happen at university and without the attentive care that private school can afford to give, privately educated students often flounder in their first year. ",
