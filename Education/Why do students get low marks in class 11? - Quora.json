            "answer_text": "The best part of the answer is that Iam also in class 11; and I too score low marks in 11 just 74.93%, it is low because I had scored 9.6 CGPA in 10 class And my teachers, my family are expecting more from me, that\u2019s why they think I had scored low marks But I am well satisfied with my marks. Now the answer for your question i.e,why we score low marks?? It is just the pressure of syllabus, we can't handle in class 11. If you are a CCE following pattern student, then it is obvious See\u2026 In 10 class we have just only one book of science consisting of 16\u201317 chapters, and from this you have to study only 7\u20138 chapters for your half yearly exams and then another half for yearly exams. And, Now in 11 class, if we take a Biology book, it consists of 21\u201322 chapters and for your half yearly u have to study atleast 11chapters, And believe me those 7\u20138 chapters of 10 is equal to the just 3\u20134 chapters of 11. And we have the habit of studying chapters like ant and then suddenly we have to cope up with elephant, so disgusting ; I know But still, we have to study for going in 12class. Don't pressurise yourself Believe me, no one gonna check your 11results in the future like no-one, even u will get forgotten about your result. Follow this rule, Study smart not hard. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Thee are variety of reasons. Major jump from 10th. Class 10th to class 11th is indeed a major jump in terms of portions and time management. Till class 10th students had enough time for in depth study and preparation but it's not the case in 11th and 12th. There cannot be any procrastination happening. Only regular studies can fetch you marks.Large amount of portions. If you compare the portions of class 10 and class 11 , you can clearly see the difference. In class 10, science has 16 chaps in total whereas in class 11, each individual science subjects has nearly 16 chaps. That's 3* 10th science. ( phy-16, chem-14 and bio-22)Mental preparation: Most of my juniors have told me that they realized what science is only after coming to class 11 and many of them regret taking science. What you see till 10th is just basics and there's way beyond that in science or social or whatever subject you opt for. So the best way is to be mentally prepared but most of the students fail in this.Seriousness; Most of the students take 11th as a relaxation period. After the hectic period of preparation of class 10 boards and before the starting of class 12, it's class 11 that they choose for enjoyment as the exams are not boards. Hence most of them are carefree about class 11 marks.",
