            "answer_text": "Your choice of public or private education is going to depend on certain things. I guess the only way I can answer this best is to tell you the decisions that we made with our two kids, and show you how we came to these conclusions. We are a Christian family, and wanted a private Christian education for our kids. However, my son had special needs that were physical, and he was also learning disabled. The private school was an older building with many stairs that he could not safely climb. They did not have resources for Physical therapy and special instruction for his learning disability. We lived in an excellent school district whose public school had all those resources, so that is where he went. He was treated well, and learned appropriately so that he was able to attend college. Some of the drawbacks were semi-pornographic material was used in English class, and kids constantly used profane language everywhere in the school. These things bothered him, but he was able to opt out of the English material, and read other less offensive books. He is a very strong Christian today for having had to swim against the current in High school and college. My daughter did not have any special needs, but she tended to follow the crowd, so we enrolled her in the Christian school. She learned everything from a Christian worldview, and made great Christian friends. She also excelled in soccer, and won an Athlete of the year trophy in her senior year. When she went to college, she actively sought out Christian groups to be involved in which strengthened her faith. She went to school at at secular university, but most of her best friends were Christians. She is now planning her wedding to a wonderful man that she met at her church. So, you see, each individual is different, hence the choice is a very personal one based on your worldview, your pocketbook, and your ability to thrive in certain environments. ",

            "answer_text": "That is not a simply straight line question to answer. It all depends on what you and your family are looking for. From there fiance will play a roll in the answer. Then local public, local private day school or boarding school. Is the student in question a strong student? Are they preforming well academically? If money is an issue are scholarships possible? Do you want to live at home or ar school? Do you want a religious school or no? I'm sure I missed some in that list but once that is sorted you can figure out what will work for you. I went to public school. In the 80s finding private schools that would help/deal with a student that was not only ADHD but dyslexic as well would have been tough. I was fine in my local public school so it wasn't a problem. Now schools will work more with students with issues. I have worked at a well known private boarding school. I can say I would have failed in that school. Not because of the work, but because of the pressure cooker atmosphere. So should you go to public or private school? That's up to you and your family. No stranger here can tell you ",
