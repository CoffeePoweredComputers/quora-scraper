            "answer_text": "Human society is sexist. Teachers hopefully much less so, however there may be the idea that boys are worse behaved than girls or that boys are better in the sciences than girls, still held by some members of the profession. Personally as a teacher I have found that most of my strongest science students happened to be girls (going on both subject and overall IB score) and that behaviour issued are more commonly noticed with boys, however girls are more commonly carrying out cyber bullying now. These are my recent experiences - that although classes and schools might have patterns, overall in school boys and girls are treated the same and have an een spread of strengths and issues. Male teachers are typically very aware of sexism and watch their behaviour to avoid any bias. Female teachers are complained about sometimes for being much stricter on boys than girls. As a male teacher I try to respect all students regardless of their background, gender or race. I respect them based on how they support their classmates and how much they push themselves in my class. ",

As a whole, I think that it is safe to say that a great deal of all male teachers are sexist. However, I also feel that is a decreasing trend. Most of my co-workers are very much into macho things like football, heavy drinking, and the like, but their interaction witjh female teachers is professional and friendly. In the last 10 years I can only recall one example of a male sexist teacher. But he was an isolated case and most female teachers chose to ignore some sexist slurs he liked to make in public. ",

It is like blacks ( or other minorities ) saying they can not be racist because they are black. Women have the exact same idea- they cannot be sexist because they are women - completely idiotic and very sad... ",
