            "answer_text": "You are confusing military pay and allowances with a veterans benefit under the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill known as the military housing allowance. The MHA is a housing allowance which is credited to a member, regardless of their grade, at the sergeant/E-5 rate. Congress just chose \u201cE-5\u201d as opposed to E-1 or E-9 or E-4. So, yes, if you are a currently serving reserve member, and are using your Post-9/11 benefit, your base MHA rate \u2014 assuming you qualify to use it by attending at least some classes in person as opposed to online \u2014 will be at the E-5 rate for Basic Housing Allowance. But you are only entitled to actual \u201cBAH\u201d when under orders to active duty in your reserve status. While you are attending school on the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you will not receive the allowance known as BAH based on your true grade, you will instead receive the veterans allowance known as MHA based at the E-5 level regardless of your true grade. You cannot draw both at the same time. ",

If you are not a Marine, why do you ask ? After answering the 3 questions above . . . . go to, or call, your local USMC recruiting office and discuss your questions \u2014 if you are seriously considering enlisting or reenlisting. I am certain he can get your brain adjusted quickly.  ",
