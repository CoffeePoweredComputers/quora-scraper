            "answer_text": "I started blogging a few months back. Then I thought that I just have to write articles and publish it and my work is done! People will read it and I will earn lakhs per month. But just after a month of blogging, I realised that this is not reality. The reality is very different from what we think. Here is my data from what I have learnt from blogging after working almost 10 hours daily for 5 months:  I have not done great until now, but I am learning that you should prepare some things and skills before starting blogging. Be financially ready as if you want to rank, you must have at least a custom domain. And if you want to start blogging like professionals, then you will have to work on Wordpress then custom hosting will also be required.Learn on-page and off-page SEO.Be consistent and write great articles regularly.Get ready to work at least 5\u20136 hours a day.Learn about backlinks- this is very important.You need to have good knowledge of the subject you are writing on.You need to develop the habit of writing 1000\u20131500 words article easily.Have patience and a positive attitude. It may take even 2\u20133 months to rank an article on google.Even if your article ranks on google, it is not necessary that it will stay there for long. You need to update articles regularly.You must have the skill to properly analyse other\u2019s articles and websites to make yours better.Remember, that these will not develop in a day. It takes time and slowly things develop. Many people think that blogging is easy money. But this is not true. You need hard work to earn well in blogging. Also, note that you can\u2019t earn money by simply sleeping in blogging as many YouTubers say. You need to work hard. All the best for your blogging!
