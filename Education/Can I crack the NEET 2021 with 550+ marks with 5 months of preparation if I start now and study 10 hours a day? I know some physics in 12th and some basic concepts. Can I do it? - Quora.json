            "answer_text": "Not only 550+ marks, you can score rank holding marks in NEET 2021 but it take a little hardwork with smartness. First you have to observe your daily routine and within 15 days you have to make a proper, comfortable and user friendly shedule. After making a proper shedule you have to note down all the topics from different subjects according to there difficulty levels for you. Observe that how many topics are under difficult section ,how many topics are intermediate and how many topics are easy for you. After that continue your studies till the completion of your syllabus along with making short notes. You don't have need to focus on all difficult topics just keep revising them weekly. You have to spend more time with those topics which have high weightage and less with those that are of low weightage . Before one month of your NEET EXAMINATION just go through your short notes and revise all the important topics . You have to revise your whole syllabus atleast twice before the examination . Don't forget to revise all the topics within the gap of one or two weeks because revision is the key to success for all the NEET aspirants. Since two year's trend in NEET EXAMINATION maximum questions asked directly or indirectly based on NCERT TEXTBOOKS , so focus maximum on NCERT textbooks. There is no need to study 10 hours a day , 6 - 7 hours is maximum for a NEET aspirant but the most important thing is you have to study with full concentration in this 6 - 7 hours. ",
