            "answer_text": "Your assertion that anthropologists claim objectivity is necessary is not accurate, as there are many who claim honest and legitimate research can not be achieved without acknowledging the subjective biases and experiences of the researcher. That is, our perspective on the world around us is colored by our personalities and mindsets. Malinowski, if perceived as racist through his writing, doesn\u2019t necessarily deserve to be discarded and ignored for it. Instead, his writing would best be viewed from the standpoint of evaluating his personal and cultural context in juxtaposition with that of the people he studied. But then again, some argue that perceptions of Malinowski as racist are mere misinterpretations.[1] [2] Objectivity in Ethnography Footnotes[1] Malinowski Between Two Worlds[2] Full text of \"A Diary In The Strict Sense Of The Term\"",

            "answer_text": "No. You are confusing ethnocentric and classist with racist; and while he probably was a little, he was also those other things. So are you. So am I. A big part of social science is recognizing these things- which he did. The diary, of course, was also depicting him going through culture shock; which wasn\u2019t discussed at the time. he was also lonely, and worried about his love life. That all can bring out the worst in us. So, as I like to mention, stop judging folks solely by todays standards, especially when he was a major architect in building those standards. ",
