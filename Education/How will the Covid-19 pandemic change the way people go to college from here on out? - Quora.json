            "answer_text": "I recently received A memo from my school (as I\u2019m sure millions of other students did) that classes will be held online from now, including laboratory classes that are literally designed to be performed in person physically, their justification is that the results and our knowledge of the procedure are all that\u2019s needed, but I think that\u2019s just justification so that they don\u2019t have to refund tuition and laboratory fees. This proves that universities and the educational system, in general, have a lot of redundant parts in the curriculum purely to generate more profit. What I assume will happen to this is that a lot of students will rebel against this and demand a reduction in tuition fees and more classes converted to the online style, obviously, there will be push back from the universities but hopefully, the students will prevail.

            "answer_text": "Maybe, at least in some majors. The university where I work has gone to all on-line classes and I have heard from some of the students that they miss the immediate feedback they got from their professors. They miss the social contact they had with their peers and there are some things you have trouble doing on line (choral singing, dancing, theater). It\u2019s going to change, but exactly how is yet to be determined. ",
