            "answer_text": "I've just answered a similar question so I would like to replicate that one here. The reopening of school will be set on schedule when there is no more infectious figures or there are only figures due to the input from other countries. Take Shanghai as an example, our local infectious figures have not increased since the late March. So the reopening schedule has been raised at Apr.15. According to education bureau of Shanghai, graduating grades will first come back to school at Apr. 27 including ninth grade and twelfth grade. Other grades of junior high school will come back at May. 6. Grade 10 and 11will be back at May. 18. Graduate students and undergraduate students will come back in different groups from Apr. 27 to Jun. 10 and the specific date is decided by universities themselves. However, kindergarten and elementary school may not reopen this semester since those young kids face greater threat from the current situation. I'm a sophomore at Fudan University in Shanghai, and most of our graduate students have come back to school up to today. These two photos were taken on campus this week. The materials in the first picture are distributed to each student by our university, conpromising tissues, fruits, disinfection water, vitamin pills, face mask, and brochure containing precautious about dormitory life. The words in the second picture means \"Welcome back school!\".   ",
