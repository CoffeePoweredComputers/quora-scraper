            "answer_text": "Not in the near futuro. The School of Cardinals provides the futuro Pope and select the new Pope from their School. I do not remember how many Cardinals are black. One or two perhaps. I thing that the Catholic Church in Africa is a lot more conservative than the Rest of the world. Normally in the selection of a President ,ideally people will elect one that will benefit the whole population . ( In reality, it does not happen that way). In the selection of a Pope, the selection is more difficult because the New Pope has to please a population with different cultures, customs, needs, traditions , etc. A black Pope will note fit that model. of the Catholic Church. Latin America has been a stronghold, in recent years the Church has been losing its hold. To correct that trend a Latin American Pope was elected, One that has an European ancestry. ",

            "answer_text": "I have no idea what the chances are, but I would love it if Cardinal Robert Sarah (accent on the second syllable) became Pope next (however soon or distant the \u201cnear future\u201d is). He and Cardinal Francis Arinze (both black) were considered Papabile in Pope Benedict\u2019s election, which had maybe a dozen seriously considered candidates. Cardinal Arinze was in the one before that (he\u2019s in his 80s now), and Cardinal Sarah still is. They aren\u2019t the only recent African Papabili either. There has definitely been a trend toward electing non-Italian Popes, and non-European Popes with Pope Francis, so the chances aren\u2019t bad. I don\u2019t know the percentage of Black Cardinal Electors, but about 13% of the Cardinal Electors are African. ",
