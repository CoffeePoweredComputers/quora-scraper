Being in that position of trust, to provide opportunities for learning and bonding with the little ones are part of his job description. He teaches them English once a week both classes. Seeing them mature and develop is part of the territory as well. Every year some end up in his first grade classes. They\u2019re energetic and young and passionate to learn additionally. A change of clothing is not a option. ",
