            "answer_text": "The SAT(and SAT math specifically) appears easy to good students who have done their schooling in Asia(India, Korea, Taiwan, China, Singapore, etc.) mostly because the math content in high schools in US has been diluted over the years, and this is reflected in the SAT. Of course, it also depends on what kind of a student is looking at the exam, the poor student in India who lives in a slum and has never been to a proper school would not do well at all. But in general, an average student from a Chinese high school would do significantly better than an average American student on the SAT math, provided they expended the same amount of effort. It is hard to overcome years of basic math training in a short amount of time.  In my opinion, students are not being sufficiently challenged at a higher level. I am sure they will excel if the system is structured properly. For example, if you look at the New York Regents Math exams from 1940s and compare it to the same exam in 2000s, there is a shocking difference. The 1940s NY Regents exams are fairly challenging, and in my opinion at the same level where the rest of the world's math education currently stands. This was also the era that produced most of the top science/engineering faculty in US universities, and I can tell you from my experience that they are amazing and have a very solid math background. However, in the last 50 years there has been a gradual dilution in the content of the math curriculum in US, both in terms of breadth and difficulty.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll take a different tack from the other respondents: the SAT is easy because it\u2019s not intended to be a hard test. The SAT was designed to be administered to every high school student in the country. Not every high achiever who wants to go to Harvard, but all of the 10 million odd students who graduate high school each year. The purpose of the SAT is not to \u201cmax out\u201d a student\u2019s knowledge or tell which students will succeed at Ivy League schools (though sadly it\u2019s perceived to serve both functions) but simply to establish a low baseline of whether a student is ready for college-level coursework. The idea is that even an average (college-bound) high school student should be conversant with all the topics on the SAT before proceeding to college. ",
