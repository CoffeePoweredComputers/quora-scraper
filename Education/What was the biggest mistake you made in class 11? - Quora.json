            "answer_text": "I have made lots of mistake in class 11th. So I would like to share one of them. As always we had summer holidays for 15 days, so four of my friends and I decided to spend 5 days in Delhi. In Delhi, my elder sister and her friends were there. They were very kind enough that they always used to take us to a different place to visit in Delhi like the Lotus temple, big malls, Akshadam was my favourite. As we had only five days to spend in Delhi so, we used to visit two places in one day. One day we decided to go to club dance as my sister-friends always used to go there. That was my first time in the club. As my friends and myself are below 18 so, we were not allowed inside. So we wear heavy makeup and short dresses so that we look like mature(we just when there, so to see how the club actually look like) Luckily they allowed us to enter. Although that was the first time , as didn't like the disco light and loud music. I thought myself why I'm here?? that was my first mistake. Later around 12 clock lots of people gather there. They all were drunk, my all friends including my sister and her friend I myself sit alone in the corner and stare at people. It's like I'm in hell I saw something very weird that I never think of. Unlikely we saw our senior brothers. We felt so humiliated, one of my friends is totally drunk and she falls in front of them. They ask why we were there. At that time we felt so guilty because we used to be somewhat good students in school. After that, I never went to club\u2026 ",
