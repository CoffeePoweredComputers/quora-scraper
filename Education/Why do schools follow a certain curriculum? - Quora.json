            "answer_text": "Mostly because they are required to by the federal/state government. But besides that it is very useful for schools to have a set curriculum for classes because it makes sure each class gets the same material. If there are two or more teachers teaching the same subject in a school, the school needs to make sure that the classes taught by those different teachers get the same material. I think that it has become a certain norm that schools cannot get away from nowadays. ",

            "answer_text": "It is important to note that while curriculum encompasses a wide variety of potential educational and instructional practices, educators often have a very precise, technical meaning in mind when they use the term. Most teachers spend a lot of time thinking about, studying, discussing, and analyzing curriculum, and many educators have acquired a specialist\u2019s expertise in curriculum development\u2014i.e., they know how to structure, organize, and deliver lessons in ways that facilitate or accelerate student learning. To noneducators, some curriculum materials may seem simple or straightforward (such as a list of required reading, for example), but they may reflect a deep and sophisticated understanding of an academic discipline and of the most effective strategies for learning acquisition and classroom management.
