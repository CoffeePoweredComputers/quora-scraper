            "answer_text": "The question has enlightened my memories when I was struggling with Mechanics in first semester. Mechanics was a nightmare in those days, And seen many Non-Mech inclined student choosing Diploma way to engineering just to bypass Mechanics. ( You can get direct second year admission by completing diploma in that stream) I asked same question to one of my friend who did a summer crash course in mechanics before joining college. He showed me a mobile tower.  and asked me do you no all cross frames in this structure, their angle, the force that come at each point etc.. everything is calculated. Its called truss. Then he showed me a railway track  and asked being the smooth why trains are not sliding on track, because frictional force is directly proportional to mass (F = ma) Its just blown my mind, I had gone through many times in book and read these topics but my mind was not relating it with any of the practical application. and I was finding it difficult. But after that incident I started relating Mechanics with practical application and gain interest. You can not study Mechanics if : Your concepts are not clearYou don\u2019t know where its applied in practicalYou just want to pass the subject.And I think it applies to every subject. Best of Luck.

            "answer_text": "This used to happen with me also, but trust me, there's no harm in being an average learner! Infact, I've seen average people working hard and moving way ahead than the lazy , intelligent ones! The key is simple: practice and revision! Revise in the morning what you read the previous day and then start off with fresh topics. This really helps. And at times, while revising, you may get to understand that topic from a different perspective which you hadn't been able to before! So, don't worry, keep practising, keep revising! Happy studies  ",
