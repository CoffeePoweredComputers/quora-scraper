            "answer_text": "Question answered: Is it possible to be admitted to US universities without ACTs and SATs? Yes, it is. However, it may not be possible to be admitted to your preferred US university without ACTs or SATs. Every university or university system (university systems typically include all public universities in a particular state) sets its own admissions process. Some require particular test scores. Some do not. Some require certain test scores from some students, but not others. The fact that you specified \u201cUS\u201d in your question, suggests that you may not be a US citizen or a US resident. Most universities have DIFFERENT applications processes for students applying from outside the country. Some schools require an SAT or ACT score for domestic applicants, but not foreign applicants. For other schools it is the other way around. It is important that you carefully meet the admissions requirements for any school to which you apply. These will usually be spelled out on the school\u2019s website. Please check the website for each school. Do not rely on a compiled list. First, the list may be out of date. Second, a school may be included on the list because some subgroup of students (ex: students who graduated high school in that state with at least a B average and who are not applying to the College of Engineering) do not need to submit a test score, even though most applicants would need a score.

            "answer_text": "Depends on the school. Some schools, such as the University of Chicago, have stopped 'requiring' SAT and ACT scores because they disagree with the idea of standardized testing essentially deciding a student's collegiate future and make these scores optional in order to look beyond a test score to determine whether a student is suit for a particular school. Typically, you hear people recommend you submit your standardized testing scores, as a good score is still positive in the eyes of any admissions counselor. Most (if not all) states require either of these tests in order to graduate high school, so unless your standardized testing score is really low in comparison to the level of your other grades, merits, achievements, and extracurriculars that colleges factor into their admissions process, putting your score on your application (to a school that doesn't require these scores) is typically recommended. With schools that do require an SAT or ACT standardized testing score, it would be pretty hard to get admitted, as this score is required on your application in order for it to be submitted to the university. If you have further questions about this topic itself, contact your own counselor or an admissions counselor of colleges you are interested in, ad they will be familiar with the requirements of their respective university. Check their websites first, as these questions are often answered there in advance. I hope I've helped answer your question. ",
