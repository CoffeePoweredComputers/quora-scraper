            "answer_text": "Development studies is a multidimensional discipline that has a core focus on the betterment of the state of individuals and nations. It is difficult to sum up development studies because of its multidimensional nature, however core issues include Gender, the environment, social change, economic growth. Development studies requires one to identify these and the many other issues in their local and national society and encourages its students to get to the root cause of the issues and offer evidence based recommendations to these problems. Is any course really good these days? Life is about what you make it. It is the same with any career path, you must be ruthless and enthusiastic in the creation of opportunities. Development Studies is a great course for the curious, one who loves to read, question and make inferences. One must be confident in their world view because as with any course in the social sciences you are dealing with many new rising opinions and there will always be people to counter your views. ",
