Frank Whittle and Christopher Cockerell as alumni. A jet engine in the junior common room. It really depends on what your priorities are! But seriously, unless you want to learn from specific academics in a very narrow field (and you\u2019re confident they\u2019ll stay at a specific college for the 4 years you\u2019ll be undergrad-ing or PhD-ing, i.e. they\u2019re not a visiting fellow), and unless you\u2019re looking for a niche subject and don\u2019t want to be the only student in the college on that course (e.g. Anglo Saxon, Norse and Celtic), your subject is fairly low on the considerations for college selection. Try to understand the college \u2018feel\u2019 or culture, visit if you can, understand the accomodation available (is it on site? for all years?), check out the bursaries and student support available, sports, social, other activities that match your interests. Studying at Cambridge is hard work, and you need a college that fits with your character to find like-minded people to support you through it. This is not a \u2018best-worst\u2019 scale. Assuming you\u2019re looking at undergrad, do look at the subject specific entry requirements - these do vary by college, and a good strategy is simply to look for the requirements that best match what you\u2019ve already done. Are you going beyond further maths already and have passed STEP papers? Great, look for colleges that stipulate those. Prefer to do projects rather than exams? Some look for written work to be submitted in advance. Perform better in person than on paper? Look for ones with lots of interviews rather than additional exams. Whatever you choose, you\u2019ll have a great time. And of course, though it seems unlikely now, once in your college you\u2019ll develop a healthy contempt for all other students who made different choices to you! That\u2019s just the way collegiate universities work. ",

            "answer_text": "I really don\u2019t think the choice of college plays too critical a role in your performance at the Cambridge University Engineering Department. Whichever college you attend, you\u2019ll attend the same lectures, do the same lab sessions and be set the same examples papers. Your supervisors will vary depending on college but I don\u2019t think any one college offers significantly superior options in that regard. The choice of college will mainly affect your non-academic life: student body, accommodation options, sports facilities and proximity to city centre etc. I know that, when I was a student of the Cambridge University Engineering Tripos, I was jealous of the Peterhouse students as they were literally a 1 minute walk from the department but it really doesn\u2019t matter. There are plenty of people receiving Firsts, 2.1s and 2.2s regardless of the college they attend. Have a look around and pick one that you think seems like the best fit. ",
