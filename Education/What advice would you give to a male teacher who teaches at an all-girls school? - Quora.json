            "answer_text": "One word: boundaries.  You need to be particularly careful with middle-school aged girls (12-14).  Since they are just beginning to discover themselves as creatures separate and apart from boys and because their bodies are starting to develop, they want to focus on those changes.  Many of them will begin to wear clothing that flatters certain aspects of their physical appearance, while others will attempt to hide the changes that are going on with their bodies.  Any undue attention that a male in a position of leadership/power pays to girls that age can easily be misinterpreted to be more than it is.  Trust me, their parents are also watching you as well.  In this day and age, people are extremely sensitive to the role that an adult male plays in the role of their pubescent and post-pubescent daughters.   Putting aside the concerns about the young ladies' burgeoning sexuality and awareness, there are also concerns about properly motivating girls of that age to perform scholastically.  In mixed-gender schools, girls tend to get \"lost\" among the sea of boys, especially in science, math and physical education classes.  It is important to recognize that knowledge can be held by anyone of either gender around a particular subject.  The problem is, of course, the dance - inspiring them to try harder and focus on their studies and the talents they are developing while not crossing any lines of proper decorum. I wish you luck.  I have worked in church settings, both as a volunteer and as a paid staff person and I have actually had people ask me why I want to work with kids that age, especially girls.  I have had parents and other leaders automatically assume that I had some kind of ulterior motive.  Adopting the age-old \"avoidance of the appearance of evil\" standard is best. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a Sir This depends on the grades that you are going to teach.  If it's the elementary classes , I would primarily say that you should develop a lot of patience. Kids are always boisterous and hyper. Treat and handle them with patience. Never bully them or show your anger on them. Talk to them as if he/she is your child and listen to their stories. Don't rule them , instead tell them what ought to be corrected if they go wrong. If it's the high school or secondary , then a lot of things are to be taken care of : 1. Firstly , your image counts. You should never portray a bad image of yourself. What you wear is important. So dress formally and carry yourself steady. 2. Stay relaxed and be the approachable type. Male teachers are not always mistaken. Give students the freedom to approach you if in case they have problems/doubts. Precisely be as a fatherly/brotherly type for each girl. 3. Wear a smile. Don't be furious and cantankerous. They should feel comfortable with you and not get scared by your behavior. Even when you are extremely stressed don't show your out burst to the students. 4. Know your limits. Yeah , every move of yours is important Your intentions too. Don't cross your limits with over inquisitiveness. Remember , you work in a girls school. So don't enquire too much about the family/personal feelings of each student.  5. You must act as a bridge to solve and sort out issues- not create some more. Always take a decision after thorough investigation. Never show partiality. Remember , it may damage your image very badly. Hope this helps. All the best !  ",
