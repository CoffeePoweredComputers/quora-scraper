            "answer_text": "TL:DR: Yes, on ALL courses (free too). It is a certificate of completion, It will show you were there, not how well you understand the materials. Having said that, an applicant who shows continual improvement in the field they are applying for jobs are a lot more interesting than someone who doesn\u2019t. When I have hired people continual learners are a lot higher on my list than people who are not continual learners. You will look more interesting to HR/Recruiters, but only include a few and only include ones relevant to the job you are applying for. Honestly it is very unlikely recruiters/HR/Managers will know if course was free or paid, it just shows you as proactive and someone who is interested in the field. ",
