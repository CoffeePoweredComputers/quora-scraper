            "answer_text": "Question as answered: I have arrived with a CELTA qualification, work experience but no TEFL experience. I am looking to find a good place to start. Any recommendations? I am a US expat who has lived and taught in Shanghai for nearly four years now, and while I only taught ESL for my first year here, I do have a decent amount of knowledge about the local ESL scene. The following recommendations come from either my limited personal experience or from conversations I have had with other expats. It is limited by its nature, so take it with a grain of salt. Also, there are several details missing from your question that that would greatly help to answer your question. For this answer I am going to assume that you have a legitimate, but unexceptional, college degree and two years of legitimate, but unexceptional, post-college work experience. If not, it is not legal for any company to hire you. That said, many teachers do work here illegally, but you will likely be limited to the tier three options below. First tier options: Without teaching experience, it is unlikely that you will be able to get either of the following types of jobs; however, it does depend somewhat on the details of your degree and work experience. Even if they are not stellar, you might get lucky, so I would say it is at least worth applying to both of the following. International divisions of local schools: These jobs are a little hard to find without connections or going through a recruiter (see warning about this below), but they tend to pay better and have better working hours than most teaching jobs. Expect: legal paperwork, normal school teacher hours, and a salary in the 15,000 - 20,000+ R.M.B. range.*University jobs (with few office hours) and private tutoring route: Universities generally don\u2019t pay much, but tend to have short working hours and do not really care if you teach privately outside of you working hours. Furthermore, they generally offer housing benefits of some kind. Because of the reduced working hours, after a few months, you should be able to find private students willing to pay between 150 - 200 R.M.B. per hour - more if you have special skills. As long as you are not dead broke on arrival, this is probably the best option in my opinion. Expect: legal paperwork, roughly half-time working hours, and a salary in the 5,000 - 10,000 R.M.B. range in addition to the other benefits.Second tier options (big name English schools): For all of the following companies, expect to teach between 20 - 30 hours per week, not including prep time or various other office duties. Furthermore, expect working hours to include late evenings and weekends. I would highly recommend that you try to get a job teaching adult students. I have nothing against teaching children, but you will likely have higher quality coworkers and be treated better in an adult teaching center. Wall Street English: I have heard mostly good things about them. They probably have the most stringent hiring requirements for any of the big name companies and are known for overworking their teachers, but they generally pay better than the competition. This would be my first option for big name ESL schools. Salary estimate: 15,000 - 18,000 R.M.B.English First: I worked for English First my first year in Shanghai. They pay less than Wall Street and also tend to overwork their teachers; however, I was fairly satisfied with my time there. The reason I chose to work for them was that the company was extremely professional in its recruitment process and did everything legally. Basically, they have their act together and it was an easy, legal way to come to Shanghai - for those out there that have not worked in China, this is far more valuable than it sounds. Salary estimate: 12,000 - 14,000 R.M.B.Web English: From what I hear, they are a lot like English First, but pay a bit more. I turned down a job offer from them, though, after the recruiter attempted to convince me that I did not need a legal Z visa to work at their school. I have heard from other teachers that they did not have this experience, so I might apply and see what they have to say now. Salary estimate: 14,000 - 15,000 R.M.B.Shane English: I have heard mixed things about this company. I have known several person who really liked working for them, but I have also heard a lot of, mostly second hand, negative things about this company. From what I have heard, it sounds like how you are treated is highly dependent on which center you work for. I would probably stay away for this company unless you personally know someone at the center in which you will be working. Salary estimate: 9,000 -12,000 R.M.B.Disney English: Last time I checked, Disney only had children\u2019s centers, but if you want to teach kids, this is the first place I would look. They pay fairly well, have a decent reputation, and seem to do everything legally. (They are actually somehow part of the Disney Corporation - not just a stolen name). Salary estimate: 12,000 - 14,000 R.M.B.Other private schools owned by foreigners: This is really hit or miss. Some of the best and worst English schools to work for fall under this category. I would be a little wary of pursuing this option. Unless your degree or work experience is exceptional, it is unlikely that you will find a job at a good one.Third tier: This category is for everything else. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other ESL companies in the city. I am sure there are many wonderful companies out there, but most are not. Here are a few things to look out for: Do not work with recruiters that are not directly tied to the company to which you are applying. These are invariably middle men that simply take a cut of your salary and will provide you with zero benefit. Most of the time they simply re-post job offering and take a cut. On rare occasions they might have something worthwhile - such as the odd international school division position mentioned above. Be careful here, and try to find anything they are offering on other sites. Any company that, for any reason, claims that they cannot provide you with a proper Z-visa and residency permit should be avoided. These companies cannot legally employ you and do not have the Guanxi (connections/influence type of thing) to get around the legal requirements. Rather, they will circumvent the law by sending you off to Hong Kong every couple of months to renew either a tourist or business visa. Many such companies are notorious for ripping teachers off, knowing that such teachers have little to no recourse due to their illegal status. That said, plenty of people do this and it is likely the only option open to you if you do not have a degree or the requisite work experience. Any salary less than 10,000 R.M.B. unless the teaching load is considerably lower than average (say, less than 20 hours per week) and requires few office hours, or there are other substantial benefits such as a generous housing stipend. Any company that will not directly tell you the salary when asked. People are very open about money here. I hope that I have been able to help. This is a broad topic; if you have any questions please do ask. Good luck to you. * All salary figures are approximations; your mileage may vary. ",

            "answer_text": "As a college student in Shanghai , generally speaking, I think there are mainly two choices. The first is to be admitted to a university as a member of faculty. In fact, not only you can choose a university but also some international high schools or even middle schools. Of course the entrance to a university could be more difficult than to a high school or a middle one. The avantage for this choice is that your salary as well as your career as a teacher can be quite consolidate, (by saying this I mean you won\u2019t easily loose it\u2026), and also as I inspect the education situation in Shanghai, it could be found that there is a a great neche for foreign teachers and the universities tend to offer a quite decent (I mean better than those native teachers) salary for foreign teachers and maybe some bonus as well. But also it seems that these years the universities set more and more strict criteria for the recruitment of teachers, and you should obey all the rules in the school which can be different from the country you come from. (My teacher said she has to get up early at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning to give us morning classes) But you can consider some English training centers like EF or New Oriental. They also need a number of foreign teachers and they are much easier to get access. And your work time will be flexible. But as the salaries tend to be related to the performance\uff0cso it depend whether you can get a well wage. Maybe that's all Hope my answer will help you! ",
