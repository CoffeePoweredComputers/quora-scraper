            "answer_text": "Boy that\u2019s a mighty big \u2018if\u2019. Since I lack a belief in God or gods, I will treat this as a hypothetical question.In my opinion, any question beginning with \u2018If God\u2026\u2019 is a hypothetical question. So I will suspend my disbelief and accept the premise.The answer is Yes. This is a variation on the myriad of questions on Quora all concerning the dichotomy of an omniscient God vs. humans\u2019 free will.The answer to all of them is\u2026.Yes. We have free will to choose among a plethora of options. Just because \u2018God\u2019 knows every choice that we make, does not mean that we do not make those choices out of our own free will. We do. \u2018God\u2019 is not forcing us to make these choices. \u2018God\u2019 is only aware that we will do so.Being aware of our choices and forcing us to choose them against our free will are two separate things altogether. In this hypothetical situation \u2018God\u2019 is a mere observer, not an actor on the stage of this human drama. Of course, our choices are limited, but still we are free to choose among those limited options. \u2018God\u2019 knows what those choices will be but chooses not to interfere. Interference may prevent us from hitting rock bottom or causing suffering to others, but then that would eliminate our free will. Being \u2018God\u2019 would seem the ultimate in boredom. Knowing all ahead of time, for all eternity\u2026what a lousy position to be in. A much superior position would be that of a human. After all, not knowing, or\u2026ignorance is indeed bliss. ",

            "answer_text": "I often read of this dichotomy and will try to weigh in on the issue as I view it. It is clear in the Bible that we have a free will. At the same time the Bible\u2019s teachings of believers having been elected, chosen by Him to draw them to Christ Jesus, is also clear. Clear also is that believers are \u2018saved\u2019 by God, that is, if you will, \u2018plucked\u2019 from the state of alienation from God to the Life that is in Jesus: Romans 9:16 - \u201cSo then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.\u201d The answer to the question here resides in the composition/state of the natural man. While by our free will many in the various religions of the world chose a god, by our fallen nature we never can/will chose the living God. He has to choose us; \u2026has to reveal Himself to us. Until regenerated (ie. God uniting our spirit with His (there in the very definition of Life) ) the spirit of man is \u2018dead\u2019 to God; unable to know Him, and that is where the kingdom of God is experienced. No exertion of man\u2019s native free will can bring about a relationship with Him via their unregenerated spirit, any more than any other of our native abilities can do things beyond their capacities. Aside from His revelation of Himself to an individual there is no ability to \u2018know\u2019 Him, as it were. Having a native free will doesn\u2019t mean God is necessarily going to accommodate our choices, as He explained in Rom 9:16. Without the indwelling of the Holy Spirit man can only pursue gods, which are no gods, but cannot know the living God. Some day those of us that know Jesus will appreciate more fully the great gift God has bestowed upon us! ",
