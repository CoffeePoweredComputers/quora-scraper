            "answer_text": "There are a few sides to this. On the one hand, oils have certainly gotten better over the years, but mechanics do tend to stick to the things they learned way back. Just like how pretty much every mechanic will tell you that synthetic will destroy the engine in an old car (which is not true, but there were issues with older types of synthetics). On the other hand, you have manufacturers who push the maintenance intervals. This serves two purposes. First, it makes the car appear cheaper to own, as you end up servicing it less often. Second, it also reduces the lifespan of the car (more on that in a bit), meaning you\u2019ll buy a new car more often. BMW is one of those brands that are notorious for their insane service intervals. When they started their extended service intervals (looks like the early ones were around 15\u201320k km depending on driving style), it seemed great. But after the car passed its warranty, sludge buildup would start to become a problem, and engine components would suffer. Those same engines if given proper maintenance can do three times as much mileage wise, and still keep going strong. Nowadays BMW has an interval of something like 30k km. The 3k miles rule is an ancient one, from MANY decades back when oils were nowhere near as good as today and cars contaminated the oil much more. My suggestion is to do an oil service every 10k km (roughly 6k miles) or one year, which ever comes first. Sure it may sound like overkill and it probably is a bit, but in the long term the engine will stay cleaner, and it\u2019ll have less wear. And then you\u2019ll end up having to replace (or repair) your car less often. This assumes a naturally aspirated engine, with a turbo more often (some turbo BMW owners swear by 6k km) could be prudent as the turbo generates extreme heat that breaks the oil down. ",

            "answer_text": "Part of the reason mechanics recommend oil changes every 3,000 miles is that most owners won\u2019t do it nearly that often to begin with! Having that little nag sticker in the window to remind you that it should have been done 5,000 miles or 3 months ago. Newer and upscale cars have electronic reminder systems. Frequent oil changes do several things for cars. Notably, while we name the service and \u201doil change\u201d most of the time that service also includes (or should include) an oil filter change. Clean oil reduces friction and ensures proper functioning of engine parts. Draining old oil can reveal issues that are developing and need attention. People bring their cars for oil change service at a dealership (not just the quickie oil change places) and will get a multi-point checklist inspection. This includes battery, other fluids, hoses and connections, etc. Getting a once-over 3 or 4 times a year is not such a bad idea. In particular, depending on how many miles you drive and under what conditions, a vehicle owner needs to be aware that extremes of heat or cold, dusty or polluted skies, lots of stop and go traffic can all take a toll on an engine. Some are using environmental issues as reasons to not a change oil more frequently. This article also supports the fact that consumers do not thoroughly read and abide by the owner\u2019s manual recommendations. No wonder! They are as thick as a Bible and full of all sorts of warnings and caveats and frankly confusing. It is probably more convenient to have a rule of thumb, such as every 3,000 miles, that can be somewhat safely ignored for a cycle or 2 than to have a hard and fast rule such that if you do not perform the service at that interval you might damage your vehicle. Stop Changing Your Oil! | Edmunds.com Then, not everyone is driving a new, upscale, or technologically advanced vehicle. A couple of the following articles are older, but the trend is obvious. People are driving cars longer. This trend, that has intensified during the pandemic, results in used car prices skyrocketing, and people choosing to squeeze a few more miles out of the old buggy. Old cars everywhere: Average vehicle age hits all-time high Old Clunkers Rule the Roads: Americans Are Driving Cars Longer Average age of vehicles on road hits 11.6 years Some critics blame the quick change oil industry, and perhaps they did start the trend. Again, dealers have capitalized on the more frequent oil change routines to provide these multipoint inspections and vehicle health checkup services during oil change visits. Preventive maintenance is the best way to treat our ever-more-costly cars. Two USA domestic manufacturers have similar recommendations\u2026or new cars.
