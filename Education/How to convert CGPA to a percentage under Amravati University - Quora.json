            "answer_text": "A2A. Recently I had been to University for the conversion of CGPA to percentage. For the sake of conversion, you need to write a letter addressing to Assistant Register Exam SGBAU, followed by the Subject: Conversion of CGPA to an equivalent Percentage and finally the content stating your name, passing year and reason for the conversion of CGPA to percentage. Along with this letter you need to attach the xerox copy of marksheet of last year i.e. of sem 7 and 8. You need to submit this document in \u2018Exam Section\u2019 where Engineering related documents are accepted. You will get the conversion certificate by the end of day. Thanks. Edit: Please note below calculation: [Actual (7th sem marks + 8th sem marks)/ Total (7th sem marks + 8th sem marks)] x 100 e.g. marks in 7th sem = 650 out of 750 marks in 8th sem = 670 out of 800 Percentage marks = [(650 + 670)/ (750 + 800)] x 100 For the same calculated percentage, university provides a certificate.
