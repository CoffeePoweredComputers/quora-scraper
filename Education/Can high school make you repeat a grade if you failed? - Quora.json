            "answer_text": "I see. That complicates things. Especially with online schools there are not many teachers can do even if they wanted to (they probably do). The trouble with an online school is that everything is run by the algorithm. Teachers have just glorified button pushers. But that\u2019s not really helpful. If I understand your question correctly you need help figuring out if you\u2019re going to pass for the semester? To help you I\u2019m going to assume that your semester grade is averaged between your two-quarter grades. Let\u2019s assume that passing is 60%. That\u2019s what it is at most schools yours might be different. Let\u2019s say you failed 3rd quarter history with 50% and you want to know your minimum grade for the fourth quarter. If your final grade is an average then (50 + x)/2 = 60 50 + x = 120 x= 70. You need a 70% this quarter to pass for the semester. It\u2019s the same calculation if you passed last quarter but want to know what your minimum grade for this quarter is. What happens if you totally bomb your elective? I have no idea. Typically if you have enough credits it won\u2019t matter outside your GPA and you\u2019ll graduate. If not they\u2019ll ask you to retake some courses. Similarly with history. If it\u2019s required and you\u2019ve really truly failed then they might make you retake it. It depends on what credits you have/need. Maybe there\u2019s some sort of summer school option? Every program is a little different. There should definitely be a handbook that will tell you some of this.  source google.com ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. If you fail a class, let\u2019s say Algebra I, that is a graduation requirement then you HAVE to pass that class (or some equivalent credit) in order to graduate. If you fail all of your courses Freshman year, some of them might not be graduation requirements but any that are you will have to take again. If you continue failing Algebra I every year, they will not magically let you take Geometry unless someone in the registrar\u2019s office makes a mistake. Some schools require a certain number of credits completed before they call you an advanced name such as Sophomore or Junior. Most don\u2019t, so you may still be called a Sophomore after failing all your classes. But unless you make up credits (not all schools have options for doing this) then you will just get to be a Senior multiple times. Ultimately, if you don\u2019t complete sufficient credits before you turn 21, then they stop having you repeat grades. You simply get to pay for a G.E.D. test if you want a High School Equivalent diploma. ",

            "answer_text": "Indonesian High Schools from elementary, middle school and high school will make you repeat grade if you fail in the final exam. Let\u2019s say you are student of middle school first year grade in Indonesia ( 7th class ) and you fail in the final exam to continue to the second year grade ( 8th class ) . If that happens, you will stay in your 7th Class and you have to take another year to repeat your 7th Class and will take the same final exam again to continue to 8th class. You will spend your days with your junior at 7th class while other friends of yours have taken 8th class. This applies to elementary school including high school, except at 12th class ( the third year grade of high school ) where you have to take special C package class program if you fail the final exam. Passing system in Indonesian high school is quite challenging, if you get A for math and science test during final test, but you get E or D for Bahasa Indonesia or Civic subjects then you likely to fail the whole final test and you will not progress to the next grade. You have to take the same grade again for another year and repeat all the lessons with your new junior friends. ",

If you are on a credit system then there are no grades that you repeat it is a subject that your repeat. But if you take 8 courses in Gr 9 and you fail all 8 courses then you have to repeat each course so essentially you are repeating the whole grade. If your school district is set up in compulsory grades 8 courses in Gr. 9 and all subjects must be passed and you fail one course then you will end up repeating the entire grade. That kind of system is more than 40 yr old and hasn\u2019t been used in North America. ",

For one thing, there are many people stay in high school as a super senior. If you wanna be a super senior in high school, talk to your counselor and have him/her a discussion. In my opinion, I would suggest you not to be a super senior because it will waste your life and you should work as hard as you can. ",
