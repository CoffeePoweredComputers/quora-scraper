            "answer_text": "I believe that that classroom teaching is much more effective than online teaching.  I taught in a classroom for many years myself, and understand the frustration of  dealing with classroom management issues--issues that can consume instructional time.  From the serious student's point of view, I realize how intimidating and annoying certain school settings might appear.   However, I really believe that nothing can replace the dynamics of a \"live\"classroom discussion or group activities.  I'm able to see student work and talk to them as individuals and as a group about it. A class can almost have a \"physical chemistry\" (when you're very lucky) that I'm certain it would be impossible to achieve online--I doubt there could be the same sense of  \"group\"online, which is helpful the less comfortable one is with the material,  Recently, I took an excellent writing class online about learning how to write the so-called \"personal essay.\"  The instructor was a kind, smart woman who wrote very well herself; she was obviously literate; her curriculum was thoughtful and interesting, and her assignments appropriate.  The problem was that the technology was somewhat unreliable in terms of facilitating discussion--especially for people like myself, who are totally utilitarian when it comes to using  IT:  by the time I realized how to join the discussion, it was over. And I wanted to swear a lot--I mean, by that point, I'd totally lost my reason for being there in the first place. The long and short of it is that these sort of goofy problems of access resulted in me never participating in the online class discussions, never speaking directly to my instructor (\"directly\" meaning in this case via Face Time), and never sharing my work.  Partly this was my lameness, but she had one \"office hour\" a week\"--I never would have been able to have seen here.  I would have liked to have asked her some questions in person. Teaching is not a remote human exchange--at least not in my opinion.   ",

            "answer_text": "  I think it depends on the type of person that is taking the class, actually. Some people are very introverted and do better by themselves. They don't like the group interaction, or they may be physically unable to participate in a class setting. These may be reasons why online learning is better for some people.   If you have to argue the point of classroom learning being better, I would explain why it is more engaging and what you mean by that. Use examples. Explain why the classroom would have fewer distractions. The advantage to classroom learning in addition to your other points could be that in a group setting in person, there is more opportunity for group interaction that is immediate and more spontaneous than it would be even if several people were on a virtual classroom site, skyping for example, at the same time. The edge over virtual classrooms that in-person classrooms will always have is the ability for more immediate kinesthetic learning and assistance. What I mean by that is that say you are working on building a model, following the teacher's step-by-step instructions in a classroom with other people. You can't get your part to fit into the place the teacher says to put it. In a regular classroom, someone could jump up and help you, briefly explain what you were doing wrong, and then you get it. Not so in a virtual classroom. Hope this helps.  ",
