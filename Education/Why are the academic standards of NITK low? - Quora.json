            "answer_text": "NITK is autonomous academically and that is all the trouble. Autonomy, if not handled properly will have serious consequences. The Institute has given freedom to individual departments to handle the academics. In fact, academic standard is the responsibility of the Institute and has to be centrally monitored. That is the reason why you have a Dean(Academic) to monitor and decide about the academic activities of the Institute. Unfortunately, this is not happening at NITK. It is important to consider the following points seriously and address the issues at the institute level rather than decentralize academic activities. The faculty accountability is the most important factor deciding the academics of an institution. Following points need to be addressed to maintain the standard as an institutional responsibility. \u2022\tAcademics at NITK is in a very bad shape. \u2022\tTeaching \u2013 learning process has taken a back seat at the Institute. \u2022\tThere is no accountability for any activity. \u2022\tThere is no record of the presence or absence of the faculty at the Institute. \u2022\tThere is no record as to whether a teacher engages a class or not. \u2022\tThere is no blow up for the syllabus of many courses. \u2022\tThere is no lesson plan \u2013 describing what is to be covered in each class. \u2022\tThere is no teacher\u2019s dairy indicating the record of teaching done each period. \u2022\tThe syllabus of many courses are below standard. \u2022\tNo check on whether the syllabus is taught completely or not. \u2022\tFaculty teaching a course is the examiner, paper setter and evaluator. No external valuation. \u2022\tNo standard for passing. Even 20% is enough for pass grade. \u2022\tFaculty members offload their teaching work to the PG Students or Research students for class room teaching, lab work and also evaluation. The argument that the teachers at the institute are of high academic achievements will not be a justification if they are not performing their duties sincerely. Monitoring is essential and cannot be presumed. ",
