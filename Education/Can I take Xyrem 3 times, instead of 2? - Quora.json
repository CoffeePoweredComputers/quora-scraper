            "answer_text": "Please do not experiment too much on your own, but ask your doctor. Xyrem is potent medication and not to be messed with. Do you ask because the duration of action is too short, and you don't get the promised 3\u20134 hours of sleep from each dose? In principle, going from two to three doses, thus 3 sleep periods, should be possible. But it hasn't been described in any clinical tests which I know of, so side effects are unpredictable. Some people react quite strongly to just small adjustments of the dose. I don't think a doctor is likely to let you do it, because of the lack of data. It's his responsibility if he deviates from the guidelines. Xyrem is known to have some rebound effect or slightly diminished effect after longer use. If that happens, a 'drug holiday\u2019 might help \u2014 that means to stop the medication for some time to hope that it will impact with the usual strength when started again. Many people can be helped fine from Xyrem even if it doesn\u2019t give them the standardized hours of sleep. The quality of sleep (deep sleep) is more important than the length. So 2 x 1.5 hours of deep sleep may be enough, not everybody will get 2 x 3 hours. To estimate whether you get enough quality sleep, not the length of sleep, but your daytime well-being is the important point. Another issue is the cost. It is already prohibitively expensive, and 3 doses are a 50 percent extra expense. ",
