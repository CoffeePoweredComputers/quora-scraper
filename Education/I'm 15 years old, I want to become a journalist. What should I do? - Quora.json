Initially write once a week. Try for a theme. Use a nomme de plume, so that your kid writings of today don\u2019t come back to haunt you in 15 years. Your journal may be a source of ideas for this.Read about propaganda. Read about spin. Read about how to be objective.Let that affect your writing.

            "answer_text": "Do you want to be one of the journalists at a major publications (WSJ, NY Times, Financial Times) or do you just want to investigate news, write about it and get the information out there? If its the former, then what I would suggest is getting into the absolute best journalism school you can (or as an English major at a top school like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc if they don\u2019t offer journalism). Here is more information on that: How can I get into an Ivy League college? During school make sure to get internships and be very active in the college newspaper. This will be important when you\u2019re applying for jobs and need copies of work you\u2019ve produced or need to validate your time at an internship. Also look at Linkedin at companies where you\u2019d like to work and see how they achieved it. For example, if you wanted to write about Venture Capital for the WSJ here is a person who is currently doing that, Patience Haggin. Learn from their example, but know that today is different and it might take a different path. Now even if your goal is to just investigate and be a journalist, like a rogue journalist, the best advice is to do the same thing as if you wanted to work for WSJ as an on staff journalist. The knowledge you\u2019d learn in those programs are worth their weight in gold (more so the connections, but knowledge too). Or, you can learn how to investigate news topics (here are a couple Quora questions which can help): What makes a good and valuable news story? How do I write a good crime investigation story? And there are tons of resources out there. Maybe speaking with current journalists about how they go about it. Or taking courses, or any way to learn. Then find the news. If you hit a huge story (like if you were the first person to report on Zenefits\u2019 problems) you now have some credibility to build off of. Every story you come up with, submit to the top publications in that realm (think Thought Catalog, BuzzFeed, Business Insider, Forbes, Fortune) and while getting your name out there you might also get paid. Also I would suggest being extremely active in Quora. It can help you build your credibility and even give you the place where you can share your findings. Hope this helps! I wish I would\u2019ve had Quora as a 15 year old. ",
