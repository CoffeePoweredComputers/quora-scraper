            "answer_text": "There are few organisations that provide DoE trainings. I have had one from a Montreal based cunsultancy agency as part of Quality by design course work. In US there are plenty of training providers. A quick google sesrch gave few options- one of them was the following DOE Training & Design Of Experiments Courses Except one answere above by Berker, no one even understood your question actually. To learn design space creation and over all design of experiment, you also need some knowledge of Risk assessment and critical parameter assessment. There are plenty of books available for this topic but its better to go through research papers related to specific field of interest. That will give you a better perspective of it. Alos there are plenty of softwares like JMP and sigma plot which offer a free trial where you can learn to creat Design space with simple clicks. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of books. You can look Montgomery's \"design and analysis of experiments\". It is like a reference book. Also \"DOE Simplified\" by Anderson and Whitcomb is a nice introductory book. Also you can check \"Statistics for Experimenters: Design, Innovation, and Discovery\" By Hunter and Box. There are lots of instructional videos on you tube. But i think the most important tool is to have a basic statistics knowledge. So you can check any introductory statistics books before diving into DOE courses.  ",

It takes you from the very beginning and no need to know complicated maths and statistics (however you you are good at maths and statistics it will be useful for more advanced topics).According to the teacher they intended to run the course again in 2015.
