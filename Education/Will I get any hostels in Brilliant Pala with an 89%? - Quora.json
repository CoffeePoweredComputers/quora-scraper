            "answer_text": "Hello, I\u2019m not sure if u have given your 12th aggregate or PCB/PCM marks. Assuming its not your aggregeate, I\u2019d say you may get a brilliant hostel which is a bit distant from the campus. All hostels near the campuses would require a 90+ average in your 3 subjects (P,C, B/M). you can surely get any privately owned hostels near the campus easily beacuse you have 85+ % marks.but just let me say that the type of hostel will not influence you than your attitute towards a drop year. Cheers, and All The Best. :P ",
