            "answer_text": "Every complex idea can be simplified by illustrations. This is the main reason why whiteboard videos are so effective. A research by Dr. Richard Wiseman confirmed to this. According to Dr.Wiseman \u201cwhiteboard videos has a 15 percent more recall than an ordinary video.\u201d The research goes like this: Two videos were made. One video shows him talking about something and another video is the scribed version of the first video with exactly the same audio. He called 2000 people online and randomly assigned the two videos to two groups. He tested their memory in both the cases. Overall, there was a 15% rise in recall across the memory questions for those who had watched the scribe video and 66% of the people were willing to share the scribe video. And on one of the questions in Dr Wiseman's research, 92% scribe viewers recalled the answer correctly \u2013 22% more than those who had watched the ordinary video. The reason he says for such a massive level of recall is 'Simply because people are more engaged in the process\u2019. Whiteboard videos are so effective because the strokes stimulate something called Viewer anticipation. The viewer's mind is inflicted to anticipate what the scribes transform into. And when the drawing finally comes to life, the brain experiences a surprise. That is why people are hooked until the end of the video. When Dr. Wiseman conducted the research, he was astounded by the fact that a whiteboard video can achieve 15 percent retention rate. This is what he says: \u201cAnyone involved in education or research will know that it is absolutely massive. Normally you have to work incredibly hard to get 5, maybe 10 percent increase in any kind of behavioral measure like that. Simply by animation you\u2019re seeing a 15 percent increase.\u201d Whiteboard animation are slowly deviating from its traditional style, for good reasons. Now you could see new versions of whiteboard video, where the elements animate after coming to life. Make Whiteboard Videos in 5 Styles for Free | Animaker ",

They are also one of the more interesting ways to create videos online, while also keeping the attention of your audience as well. There is just something about those black and white animation videos that make people not be able to look away. Instead of making their employees sit through another Powerpoint Presentation or read a bunch of documents and emails, a company can use a video to get the message out. That doesn\u2019t mean a company should forsake all other mediums for content. If you do that, you leave out a section of your workforce who may not learn best from a video. Instead, you put an overview of information in the whiteboard video and use other mediums for expanding the details of that content.
