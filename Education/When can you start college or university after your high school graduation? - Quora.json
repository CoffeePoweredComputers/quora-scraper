If you don't have a good academic background from high school you need and have to have it in college or university. College is only a four year school and university is a four year school plus a graduate school. You'll need and have to have a good academic background in grad school. Glad to see you're asking about your four college degree! ",

            "answer_text": "The difference between a university and a college has nothing to do with an undergraduate\u2019s opportunity. So, of course, the answer is yes! The term \u201ccollege\u201d refers to undergraduate programs that provide a B.A. or B.S. degree. All universities provide undergraduate programs (i.e. a college degree). If a post-secondary school is labeled a \u201ccollege\u201d it just means that they do not offer post-graduate degrees! So one can attend/be admitted to a university or a college after graduating high school. Their curriculum will be just about the same\u2026though the undergraduate requirements may differ slightly.
