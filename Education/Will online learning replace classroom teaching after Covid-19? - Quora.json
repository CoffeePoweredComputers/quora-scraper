            "answer_text": "Online learning, while potentially a great addition to classroom instruction, won\u2019t replace classroom teaching anytime soon and here\u2019s why: As numerous school districts in WA state have found, not all students have access to technology, WiFi, and a home situation that allows them to study.Students that are not at grade level, which depending on the state, the school district, or the school can be either a majority or a significant minority of a classroom\u2019s students. Are Too Many Students Working Below Grade Level?Not being able to offer appropriate online instruction to students in Special Education, to students learning English, or to students that are in school districts providing education services to children from lower socio/economic groups has become an issue of equity. (Seattle Times, Education Lab, Section C 1, Sunday, April 12, 2020)Students that are working below grade level can be brought up to grade level by using effective classroom interventions like tutoring, small group instruction, co-operative learning, providing feedback, and progress monitoring. Effective Ways of Improving Achievement by Low SES StudentsNot all students are in home situations where an adult, older sibling, or even a peer can supply the structure necessary for many students to stay motivated to learn.Finally, as I have observed during school holidays, school in-service days, or on snow days; many parents rely on schools for what are basically child care services. These parents either cannot afford childcare or would find good child care situations difficult to find.This doesn\u2019t mean that in the future online learning cannot become an important part of a student\u2019s academic program. But planning, access to technology and WiFi by all students, and a safe place for children to learn (particularly in the elementary grades) would have to be considered. That will take some time to accomplish. Like many things during this pandemic, online education has been shown to not be quite ready for use at this time. ",
