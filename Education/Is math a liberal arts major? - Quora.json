            "answer_text": "It depends. Many universities offer it as either a liberal arts degree or a science degree (do you get a B.A. or B. S.). In my schooling, I emphasized liberal arts with my math degree and loved it that way. At the same time, most of my contemporaries in math spent their time non-math time in engineering, organic chemistry and physics courses. Me? I would run off to Soviet Science Fiction and as many history courses as I could take. Truth is that allowing either is entirely appropriate. However, those who complement it with engineering and sciences probably have the longest careers in mathematics as they have more useful training. For me, it was great study. Now I\u2019ve owned a national TV ad agency and am teaching marketing in the local business school while reading extensively, marketing artist friends, and exploring the connections of complexity science with marketing.

But they have no answer to the observation that the experimental method is central to the sciences, but absent from mathematics. Yes. Mathematics is one of the liberal arts\u2014-and has been since the liberal arts were invented during the Middle Ages. ",
