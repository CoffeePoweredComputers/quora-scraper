            "answer_text": "I think moving is mire than just the physical act . While packing you must look through things you haven't looked at in years . You must throw away or give away stuff to make room for what you need . There is a sense of the unknown looking . Even if you hate where you live , you're losing something . I lost my house and knew I needed to get out of LA so I didn't scramble to save it or take the crao I collected while we lived there . People were crawling through my dog door to rob me in the middle of the night . I had to sleep with a butcher knife and when I packed all I could into my little car I wasn't as far as Ventur when they squatted in there . The  thing is I didn't care . I went north and moved in with Akan I had been seeing for a decade . This worked out even though it was his house and I was kind of a mess from an awful situation with my job and this malignant stalker . Yeah, it's a sordid drama that crippled me in many ways , but I was able to get over it an my kid was very happy . I was glad I did what I did l when we git married everything g went to poopoo . I should have realized that would happen because he has a habit of freaking out when intimacy gets to intimate . He decided to divorce me and told me by way of a status update on Facebook in March . We were married in Late July .mi was devastated and what has cine out since made me realize the stalker was laying in wait that whole time and dividing and conquering . He sees that too . But he has his own place now and u get to have his house unto June 2016 . So it looks like I will be moving too. I guess I wanted to avoid the upheaval and save the great way things were , but at some point I realized it wasn't going to work . I can not get past his betrayal and the cheating as discovered via the stalker who hacked his accounts to expose him in every way possible . I forgive him. I can even get past the cheating which is kinda funny since it wasn't all that successful . But he didn't treat me well, he lied and was disloyal I want to be his friend but I can't be his wife. I am not sure wife is a title I can live up to . But now my life is open and at loose ends. I need to find work and I can look wherever I wish . I really feel like Portland is good bet . There is a lot of work for me there and it is the vibe I like ,  maybe I will stay here or go to Frahce where I have literary friends and some nite as a writer . I have accumulated more junk now but have no Athens to it or this place . I used to want a home to keep . That's why I bought my house . Now I am thinking Winabago ! Houseboat! Life is an adventure and adventures are messy and unplanned . Roll with it . You'll land on your feet  and you'll feel great when you put the things you keep in their place . You will nit miss what you left behind . Not for long . You'll be so busy enjoying what you're gaining instead . ",
