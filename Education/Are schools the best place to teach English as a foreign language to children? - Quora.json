            "answer_text": "Given that English is the absolute mess of a language, schools \u2014all things being equal\u2014 would not be the best way to learn English. One-on-one tutoring would be. However, it is expensive. Maybe a combination might be best. I highly recommend Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards as it is based on sound university research, but with languages it is important to practice in a natural setting, which you could do by joining or creating your own discussion groups in cafes and such. I can watch all of the Youtube videos of how to play tennis, I will not be a good player. Being surrounded by English media would enhance learning as well as travelling to places where it is used. Of course, we could dethrone English and learn Esperanto, which is much easier to learn. I offer a compelling case on how this could be achieved here: John Katt's answer to What annoys you about English? ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to learn English is to learn in a comprehensive way, which means you have to learn it both formally or informally. School is one of the channels where you can find someone to guide you and correct your mistakes when you\u2019re learning a new language. Academic English plays a very important role if you are planning to study abroad or going to the academic field someday. But if you\u2019re talking about conversational English, school itself may not be effective enough given that English may not be the major medium of instruction at your school. Some informal ways may help more, such as reading magazines, fictions, or watching movies. If you\u2019re financially available, try go to an English-speaking country for a short-term exchange program or school class. My friend\u2019s English improved a lot after she joined a summer English program and lived in a host family in the UK. ",

            "answer_text": "Listening and hearing is only one aspect of learning a language. It takes a lot of active involvement, and motivation, to learn a language. It\u2019s a myth that babies learn language easily, just by being exposed. They learn through a massive amount of repetition, a lot of practice and mistakes, and are highly motivated because they want things. Validating a language is really important - making it seem important to the young learner. That\u2019s where the cartoons would be fantastic - and books, and games etc - seeing the language around in things the child is interested in. So broadcasting cartoons would be an excellent tool to add. However, since cartoons are a passive activity, they are a limited if they stand alone. That\u2019s where a formal learning environment such as schools (depending on the quality of teaching) is a more central tool - with interactive activities where the children are motivated to use the language, guidance when mistakes are made, and development of the more formal writing skills to go together with the spoken skills.
