            "answer_text": "Absolutely, YES! One of the reasons we find ourselves so deeply divided as a country and so unwilling to consider the opinions and positions different from the tribe to which we belong can be laid at the feet of curriculum writers who have removed the serious study of history and civics from our schools, substituting them with what\u2019s called \u201cSocial Studies.\u201d Who ever majored in social studies? Our ability, as individuals and as groups, to function within a civil society depends on our having a clear understanding on the founding documents of our country and the situations which caused us to separate from England, form a country of our own, and continue our own development. Without a thorough knowledge of these stories and these documents, we lose track of who we are and what it means to be an American. Part of the reason we no longer study the Constitution in high school is that most students do not read well enough to understand what it says, so we\u2019ve dumbed down the curriculum rather than working to create more literate and analytical students. Since the Constitution doesn\u2019t fit well into a cartoon or a three minute song, we no longer teach students how to read and understand it. American History is the key to understanding who we are and how to contribute in this multi-racial, multi-ethnic society which is capable of such wonderful creative effort. Studying history is the key to learning how to be who we are. ",

            "answer_text": "NO\u2026Absolutely Not. Let\u2019s face it. History as a subject isn't much of utility when you\u2019re trying to get a job that pays reasonably well. School teachers worldwide are grossly underpaid even in the United States of America. Presumably, if you study history throughout grad school, your career paths become very limited. If a student is very smart analytically, they will survive and get into a position which pays well, unfortunately not everyone is in the top 20% of intellectual bracket. But I digress. The job of schools today is not to teach what\u2019s already happened. NO!! The main job of schools from elementary till high school is to prepare students to discover more about things that are happening today. Replace History with Logic and Philosophy. Even Philosophy as a major is somewhat questionable in college, but it teaches students how to think\u2026..A Way of thinking\u2026\u2026 Logic and Philosophy enable students to discover more about what\u2019s happening and apply their skills more effectively. I don\u2019t care about: Who won which war and implemented racial hierarchiesWho built which building for his wife or parentsWho wrote a particular work of literature - Somewhat useful in the name of culture. Again, these can be studied on one\u2019s own leisure time.Who killed whom over what\u2026History can be studied on one\u2019s leisure time. I\u2019d argue that reading history as a hobby can be done better with the skills acquired from the subjects I spoke of. ",
