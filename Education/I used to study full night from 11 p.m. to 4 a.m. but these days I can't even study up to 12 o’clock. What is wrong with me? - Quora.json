            "answer_text": "Your body and brain need to rest at least minimum of 5 to 6 hours in a day and more over if you are over worked during the day being fully exhausted due to your routine hetic school hours and if you go to classes that too adds to your stress and strain. Under such circumstances it's natural for you to fall asleep by 12 o clock. Hence if this is the prevailing situation then I would rather suggest you to take rest when you are not able to study and after a break of around 4 to 5 hours you can get up early in the morning by 3 or 4 a.m and then continue with your studies and I am sure by going so you will be able to study and concentrate more in your studies. When you are stressed out during the day and when you are not able to study take rest and then continue after rest because to function efficiently your brain and body need quality rest. By doing so you will maintain your health as well as your studies. So don't worry it's absolutely normal. ",
