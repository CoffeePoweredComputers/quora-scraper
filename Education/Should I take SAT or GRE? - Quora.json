            "answer_text": "Tom is correct. The only reason you might get a choice between the two tests would be if you are an older student applying for an undergraduate degree.  Some colleges and universities will accept the GRE instead of the SAT for applicants over the age of say 18 or 21, though some won't require these tests at all if you have some college coursework done and are trying to transfer.   This is not necessarily common, but I have seen it before. For a graduate degree you must take the GRE for many programs, and the SAT is irrelevant.  For high school students, you should take the ACT or the SAT.  Maybe that's what you meant? If you want help deciding between those, I have a blog here that might help:\u201cShould I take the new SAT or ACT?\u201d  Check with the individual programs you are applying to, and find out what they accept.  If you have a choice, check out each of the tests and the expected score ranges the schools you want to go to require.  Take a sample test and see how you do.  Then you can make an informed decision.

            "answer_text": "Neither is \u201cbetter.\u201d They are different tests taken by different people for different reasons. The SAT (or, similarly, the ACT) is taken towards the end of high school by teenagers to test readiness and ability to begin a course of college study. Colleges sometimes use the SAT or ACT to predict whether a student is likely to succeed and finish a bachelors degree, and may admit students based on that. The GRE (Graduate Record Exam) is taken by adults towards the end or after earning their bachelors degree in college, and it tests readiness and ability to begin a graduate school course of study\u2014 that is, a masters or doctoral program. Graduate admissions departments may use GRE scores to weed out applicants with weaker reasoning or language skills. The GRE is \u201charder\u201d and more complex because you are supposed to be older and more educated when you take it. The SAT is more stressful for some people because they have test anxiety or lower self-confidence. It's like asking which is better, 2nd grade or 6th grade\u2014 2nd grade is hard but fun for most 2nd grade children, and 6th grade is way harder still but doable for most 6th grade children. They are different levels entirely. ",
