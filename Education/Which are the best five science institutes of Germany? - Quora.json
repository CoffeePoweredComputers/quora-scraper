For the physics of shooting hydrogen atoms at each other, Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching would be your best choice, for shooting subatomic particles against each other DESY in Hamburg, for the physics of shooting subatomic particles on different materials Hahn-Meitner Institute in Berlin, for the physics of shooting atomic particles on materials GSI in Darmstadt, and for shooting large objects into space DLR in Cologne. And that's just the five best institutes for the physics of shooting things somewhere, each the top institute in its own line. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi I'm hoping you meant the top 5 universities with the best Science departments. In Germany, rankings don't play an important role maybe because almost all universities in Germany offer a high quality of education and there isn't much difference between let's just say No. 1 ranked public University and an average University. However, Germany recognizes 9 universities called \u201cTU 9\u201d as their most elite universities. You can't go wrong with any of these prestigious universities but according to me, the top 5 among the TU9 should be the following: TUMLMUTU DarmstadtRWTHUniversity of Bonn",
