            "answer_text": "What is the difference between ethnology and social anthropology? As other answers have stated, they are mostly synonymous. To the extent the words are both used at the same time by the same person, they may show a slight difference in emphasis. \u201cEthnology\u201d is simetimes used to describe the process of conducting anthropological fieldwork \u2014 that is, gathering data \u2014 and then writing up studies of the particular ethnic group or other culture or subculture that the fieldworker studied to learn about their culture. The end product of such work, the written study, is called an \u201cethnography.\u201d \u201cSocial anthropology\u201d is the broader term and \u201cethnology\u201d could be considered a completely included subset of social anthropology. The broader term also includes the comparative analysis of different cultures, and the development and testing of various hypotheses and theories of social organization and culture. ",

            "answer_text": "Arguably, none. This is a regional terminology difference for the branches of anthropology. They are: ArchaeologyLinguisticsEthnology (or \u201cCultural Anthropology\u201d; \u201cSocial Anthropology.\u201d The term \u201cSocial Anthropology\u201d is used mostly in the UK curriculum.)Physical Anthropology (or \u201cBiological Anthropology,\u201d again a term more commonly used in the UK.)Applied AnthropologyThe terms \u201cethnology,\u201d \u201csocial-\u201d and \u201ccultural anthropology\u201d are widely and interchangeably used in referring to the study of ways of life. Anthropologists may then specialize in sub-branches within a respective branch, such as ethnography, wherein an extensive ethnographic study for a focus area is completed. Within \u201cphysical-\u201d or \u201cbiological anthropology,\u201d there are sub-branches such as forensic anthropology, and so on. So you see, both \u201cethnology\u201d and \u201csocial anthropology\u201d are equally-weighted terms for anthropological branches. ",
