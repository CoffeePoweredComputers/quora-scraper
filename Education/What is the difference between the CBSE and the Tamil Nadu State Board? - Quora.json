            "answer_text": "CBSE & TN State Board have drifted much. Tamil Nadu follows Two Language Formula , only Tamil and English whereas CBSE imparts education through English and Hindi medium. Tamil Nadu keeps distance wherever Hindi is and hence could not take good points from CBSE pattern unlike other South Indian Counterparts Like Karnataka, A.P. & Kerala. Further keeping in mind rural students also, the standard of syllabus has been made comparatively easy which becomes a handicap for stidents while preparing for IIT JEE exam etc. Now good things are going to happen, TN State Syllabus is going to be fortified and there will be more coaching classes for additional knowledge to face exams like NEET.

In history cbse don\u2019t talk about regional kings of southern india. CBSE don\u2019t teach the regional languages and their culture results a social animal without cultural identity TN state board: more theory less practical. TN boards 11 and 12 th std books covers all the basics of science. if u got the intellegence to convert the theory into practical then TN board syllabus is precious gift. TN board is open to all economic sectors of society ",
