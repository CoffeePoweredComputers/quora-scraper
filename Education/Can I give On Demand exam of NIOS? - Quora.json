            "answer_text": "Yes of course! NIOS stands for National Institute Of Open Schooling which offers on demand exam on the request of students. Let's make some quick calculations like if someone fails in one exam in 12 boards then you can give supplementary but in two subjects you will have to repeat 12. And say the result comes in Month of May then you fill the form of NIOS in Month of June precisely in first week of June and you can take exams in July. Your results will be displayed in Month of August and admission in colleges are taken till September. So you could easily get an admission and save your one year of repeating class 12. Also remember NIOS is a recognised board all over India. So don't worry and also you don't need to give exam in all five subjects you just need to give test in which you were failed rest the marks of other subjects will be transferred to NIOS from your board. Good luck!! ",
