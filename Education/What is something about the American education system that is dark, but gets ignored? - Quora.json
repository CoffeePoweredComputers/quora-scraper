            "answer_text": "One thing? Hmm. \u201cDark\u201d. How dark? Okay. Kids need to play and explore. We put 3\u20134 years old in a public school under the guise of education. But that has no long-term education benefits. We use preschools and kindergarten schools as de facto daycare centers. Very, very expensive daycare. (i.e. it would be much-much less expensive to give parents daycare subsidies than to send their kids to preschool and kindergarten.) And when kids should be trying to explore the world around them and form good social relationships and attachments with people in their lives, we put them in places where they cannot do that. Placing 30 four-year olds in a room and expecting them to understand how to behave is really bizarre. That is not how human beings learn, play, socialize, or emulate behavior. That is an intentional recipe for poor socialization, misbehavior, and emotional trauma. That\u2019s pretty dark. It\u2019s borderline abusive. But, we treat it as totally normal. Many places are still pushing for mandatory, public pre-school. The argument for it? \u201cWell, parents have to work.\u201d Again, it\u2019s daycare. That\u2019s dark and crazy. Something else that I think is pretty dark? There is always a clamoring for school funding. There is never enough money for schools! \u2026 Even though, in most states, it is an absolutely mind-boggling amount of money goes to schools. I mean, it is HUGE. And public teachers are always at the forefront, saying how they need more school funding. Because teachers are consistently underpaid. So, that's what more funding will do! YEAH! (Dramatic pause) But the truth is, teacher salaries have remained pretty stagnant. Arguably, total compensation is decreasing with revisions to retirement plans. Because nearly all of that new money that is collected from the helpless property owners in that school district goes into school facilities, administrator pay, support personnel, and compliance costs. Very little actually goes to teachers. It's heartbreaking really. It\u2019s a cruel bait-and-switch. It really does seem that teachers have not caught on that they\u2019re just pawns in a game to get more money\u2026 for other people. And that their pay is never going to substantially increase. Because they keep doing what they\u2019ve been doing. And rewarding other people for doing it. I once proposed a state-level trial program, in which a voucher for 80% of the money ear-marked to each student would be paid directly to the teachers. Whew! Guess who hated that? Teachers. I mean, do you really want someone from this group \u201ceducating\u201d your kids? Not I. And no offense to you, dear reader, if you\u2019re a public school teacher. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re one of the good ones. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not ignoring it, I talk about it all the time. The darkest thing in American education is that a bogus instructional method has rendered millions of children semi-literate. (That method is variously called Whole Word, sight-words, Dolch words, etc.) Almost as extraordinary is that this hoax continues. Why aren't the American people screaming? Why are we such patsies? Flesch explained the whole thing in 1955. Virtually all the research supports phonics. The score is something like 98 to 2. To be fair, the ideologues assembled against us are well-organized, hard-working, seemingly tireless. If they can destroy the America they don't like, they will do it and celebrate over our dead bodies. There is nothing abstract about this conflict. Anybody who would make a child illiterate is vicious. To be fair, these ideologues could not do this dirty job without the help of the media, who are almost universally silent about what is being done to children in our schools. I have to assume the parents are waiting patiently for their daily newspaper to tell them what's going on. Hasn't happened. I hope everyone will communicate vigorously with their media. Tell them you can handle the truth, they should deliver it to you. Sight-words don't work. Virtually everyone knows this. But just by stubborn, stupid perversity, the Education Establishment digs in, won't budge, pretends not to hear anything you say. All children are different\u2026.there is no one best method. These people have a sophistry and a lie for every situation. Please get involved in the Reading War. That is the only way we win. We as in We The People. Understand why phonics is necessary, and then explain that to as many people as possible. ",
