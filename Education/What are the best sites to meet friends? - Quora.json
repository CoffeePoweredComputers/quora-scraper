There are a lot of well none online platforms to make and meet your long lost pals (grins). Popular ones are Instagram, Facebook, bumble, amidst other host of sites. My favourite and used sites are as follows. INTERPALS (InterPals Penpals)Interpals (More of an online penpal platform) is a fairly known online for making friends and getting to know a whole range of folks from around the world. With well over 2000 daily subscribers makes the use of this sites fun. In addition it serves as a platform for language -study, from learning of Spanish to learning of Twi from real people online. The home page provides you with tons of profiles, click read if you click, (literally) then you message them. Then you take it up from there. With settings embedded, you have the opportuinity to restrict specific countries, age range, and gender from contacting you. This feature makes you narrow down pretty seamlessly the wonderful people you wish to make friends with. Personally, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet wonderful people there who constantly shape my life adding value to me, through meaningful chats and paradigm shifts. And oh, if you are lucky you can find your soul mate too :). With it\u2019s web version and mobile apps for android and iPhones (iOS) everything is made super duper easy.  credit : INTERPALS.NET[1] 2.
