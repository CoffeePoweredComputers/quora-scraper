Anyways I also feel the same way most of the times and here is what I do to help myself. 1. Validate your understanding, when professor is repeating something. 2. Think or read about something related to the topic. If internet is available, you can search about the topic on internet. Otherwise you can just think of some application of the topic.3. While you are in your own world, keep checking that professor is still talking about the same topic and hasn't moved to the next one.4. Avoid thinking about completely unrelated stuff mean while. That can make it hard for you to rejoin the current lecture. Good Luck! ",

Or privately let them know that it would be cool if they went a little faster. But you are not the only person in the class, so it's unreasonable to expect the professor to cater to your individual preferences ",
