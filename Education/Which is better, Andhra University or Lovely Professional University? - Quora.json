If you you are going to give your carrier on the hands of a businessman than you are idiot. LPU will treat you like animals. First two days of mess will be good but once you have paid money there food will not be good. They have security. But all the guards in security are idiots and sometimes they will beat as well. One of my friend was going to other hostle and he got caught by guards and they beat him badly. ",
