            "answer_text": "American Exceptionalism is equal rights and opportunity and responsibility for every citizen and our country, and the same for every other country. The highest standards for ourselves and each other and our country. No limits. One nation under the principles of God, or whatever a perfect God would be, made of people made in a perfect God\u2019s image, whether they believe in a god or not, it doesn\u2019t matter. We treat everyone as equals of the highest caliber. We are the USA, the greatest nation ever on earth, and the example to all. This was taught at home in United families, in united schools and united communities in United States in a united country under god, the USA. It is the Constitution of the USA. It is who and what we are. Today our country and our people are taught this idea is evil, and that nobody is special. Aspiring to the highest power and highest standard is now evil and unfair. Everyone must be awarded a medal for doing nothing, and politics rules correctness. The fruits of individual efforts are taken away and given to others who feel they have the right to take it. Everyone and everything has to be divided by systemic whateverism with no chance of reconciliation. More government is needed to perpetuate the divide and create more problems out of nothing. Communism. Beware of communism. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018American Exceptionalism,\u2019 in the narrowest sense, is the doctrine that American society and Americans, as a people, are superior to all others. Taken to an extreme (as happens most of the time) the doctrine assures Americans that whatever they do is superior, that they can, in effect, never err. Just by being American, they have physical and mental endowments which other peoples lack. That is of course hogwash. This kind of tribalism is not uncommon around the world, most ethnicities and cultures regard outsiders as inferior and not favored by God. The belief is not taught overtly, most of the time, but heavily implied by what is stressed in school and church and everyday life. Children are led to believe that all that is good in the world has an American origin, and that our country, by divine edict, is the greatest country of all, and that all other nations envy us and fervently wish wish that they could be \u2018American.\u2019 The best antidote for this nonsense is travel abroad, where the perceptive American traveler eventually recognizes the naivete, foolishness, and shallowness of his/her chauvinistic beliefs. Unfortunately, not everyone is perceptive, and some Americans return home with their childish belief system fully intact. At the end of the day, you can\u2019t cure stupid. ",

            "answer_text": "The answers here make it clear that there\u2019s an enormous misunderstanding of the meaning of American exceptionalism. It has nothing to do with being exceptional in the sense of \u201cunusually good.\u201d It refers, rather, to the idea of being atypical. More specifically, it refers to what makes American politics and political culture different from European politics and political culture. The idea originated in Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America (1835, 1840), where he observed that the United States, unlike Europe, had no feudal past and enjoyed a high level of general prosperity.[1] The result, he said, was that American politics was not based on class conflicts and compromises, as it tends to be in Europe. In America, political conflict tends to be expressed in terms of Constitutional arguments about the requirements of justice. American exceptionalism has nothing to do with the idea that America is better than other countries, except to the extent that most Americans believe that justice-based politics is preferable to class-based politics. At its core the doctrine is merely an attempt to characterize what differentiates American from European politics. As for how it\u2019s taught, it generally comes up in American history and political science or wherever students find themselves reading Tocqueville (or later writers who developed the thesis, such as Louis Hartz[2] ). But judging from the answers I\u2019d say it isn\u2019t taught, at least not very well. Footnotes[1] Democracy in America[2] The Liberal Tradition in America",

I don\u2019t think saying American exceptionalism means other countries of people\u2019s are less, just different. Every people\u2019s have their own exceptional qualities.  I am not so much sure it is taught but not is learned. may edits more ingrained by the immersion in the culture, history, stories, etc. To me American exceptionalism is the \u201cCowboy\u201d spirit, the \u201ccan do\u201d attitude, the inventiveness, the frontier attitude that we can over come anything, the individualist and independent spirit of the individual. This is not to say other countries do not have these or parts of these attributes either. It is not mutually exclusive. ",
