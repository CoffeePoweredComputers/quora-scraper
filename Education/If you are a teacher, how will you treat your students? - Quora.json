            "answer_text": "Im never going to be A teacher im going to school for acting. But I told people if I were a teacher I would treat them like I would wanna be treated\u201d with respect and giving the same privileges as anyone else. Lots of teachers are petty and always have to threat over phones which is personal property. I say deal with it its reality and teachers can\u2019t change that either way no one\u2019s going to listen. Teachers already have their education and some students are never gonna care about graduation and I say if you really want a phone confiscated or for students to care let the parents handle that. If I were A teacher you have multiple options if you wanna play on your phone or listen to music fine just don\u2019t disturb the ones who are working. If you want to sleep have a good night rest. I would just give the work let them work at their own pace. And the cell phone part If parents see their grades and that they always on the phone most likely they will take it let the parents do their thing. And sleeping and not doing work if you want failing grades fine by me its your future eventually students will get bored and do their work. I can\u2019t force nobody to do nothing as long as you not distracting do your own routine. I had A teacher where all we did was work for 15 min and we got to play on our phones and computers for literally the whole week and got an A+. Now I switched states now Im happily getting F\u2019s and fights with handing over cell phones when that wasn\u2019t even the problem. Thanks for reading\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "When i was a child, I never wanted to be a teacher\u2026.though none of my teachers were bad!! Still I never wanted to be in this professio but when I look back in time, I owe a lot of respect and love for the things they did!! So being a teacher, I will never do partiality between students\u2026. No discrimination in my class please!!I will be friendly to students but with limits\u2026.and will also let them know their limits.As I am not a computer, my brain may be messed up with information certain times\u2026.with no ego I will accept it\u2026rather than shutting out the student!!I will never take advantage of being a teacher and demanding my students to do my personal stuff \u2026. For instance one my teacher always asked my friend to do recharges for her from her uncle's shop\u2026.and my friend cursing her had to do this cause she never wanted to be in teacher's bad books!!That's all for now\u2026..Student zone is still better than teacher's zone!!! Student mode on!! Regards. ",
