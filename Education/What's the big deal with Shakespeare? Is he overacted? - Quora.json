            "answer_text": "Why do so many of the great interpretations of Shakespeare\u2019s plays insist on showing bare female breasts? I\u2019ve always wondered that. It seems as if good (not over)acting correlates with bare chests! Why would that be? To me as an English teacher this creates a lot of headaches. Do I show a great film with great acting but edit out the boobs? I hate to alter a great work. But it\u2019s not like there isn\u2019t a precedent for that in Shakespeare\u2019s plays themselves. Most dramatists\u2019 work is \u201coveracted\u201d by amateurs \u2014 meaning that poor actors try to give it a shot and as a result viewers do not really get a good sense of how phenomenal the writing is. There are great versions (not overacted) of many of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. A few that jump to the top of my list are: Henry V (with Kenneth Branagh directing and acting as the main character). There are no bare boobs visible in this play. Some of the men do bare their chests. (Christian Bale is in this, aged 14\u201315, but he does not bare his chest. He hadn\u2019t really put on his Batman muscles yet anyways!) The Merchant of Venice (with Al Pacino as the merchant, but too many boobs visible for some conservative tastes). Macbeth (both the Polanski version and the one with Patrick Steward as Macbeth). Polanski includes a lot of boobs. Romeo and Juliet (especially the modern version with Leonardo diCaprio, but also the one with Franco Zeffirelli directing \u2014 and an actually young Juliet). Zeffirelli includes some x-rated boobs. Yes, the actor playing Juliet was under age 16! (Fun fact: Olivia Hussey was not allowed to watch the premiere of her own film because she was under age 18, and it was an x-rated film \u2014 because her one breast is visible once and she was a minor. Yes! She was not allowed to see her own breast on film!). As You Like It (with Kenneth Branagh directing). Visible penises, no boobs here. Love\u2019s Labours Lost (and with Kenneth Branash directing). No boobs that I recall. Lots of music. The play is done as a musical. Quite charming. Pericles\u2026\u2026 (why has no one as yet done a big-budget film of this most accessible of all of his plays is beyond me\u2026.). No boobs, yet! But there is incest in this play! (In Oliver Cromwell\u2019s day, the government banned the first act!).  If you watch any of these films multiple times you will gradually begin to develop a sincere appreciation for his art. As I see it, there are several reasons for this: He was writing his plays at the most seminal moment in all of history, the end of the superstitious times, start of scientifically enlightened times. Science was just in the ascendancy, as Galileo first looked at Jupiter with a telescope and everything changed. Part of the reason for science rising was the popularity of the metal, moveable-type printing press, which also allowed Galileo\u2019s discoveries to rocket around the world (Shakespeare refers to them in Cymbeline, one of his last plays). Actors then still had the ability to memorize entire plays (all parts) upon hearing them one or two times, because so many of the people then were illiterate still. The oral tradition was still strong, allowing Shakespeare to benefit from the enormous breadth of folk wisdom and memorization power. (By the way, writing was controversial in Ancient Greece because some theorists thought it would destroy the impressive memories they had back then. They were so right!)Copyright laws had not yet come into effect. Shakespeare could borrow all he wanted from any other writer. There was no downside to stealing other people\u2019s ideas, stories or anything. If Shakespeare lived today, there would be five or six names given as the authors of each of his plays, including ancient writers, contemporary professional poets, fellow dramatists, fellows actors, and whoever wanted to insert a few lines into \u201chis\u201d plays.He lived at a time of incredible political tension. But not so much tension that he couldn't write with a considerable amount of freedom, compared to the era just before and just after his. Bloody Mary preceded him, and executed people whom she disagreed with. Oliver Cromwell came a few decades later, and also executed without much hesitation his opponents. Queen Elizabeth was at first a real moderate (up until her cousin Mary Queen of Scots tried to off her), and after she died her second cousin, once removed, King James VI, was too busy having homosexual liaisons and writing scandalous books about witches, and getting the Bible translated in such a way that people would stop killing each other over it, that he let the playwrights more or less alone too. He just wanted to be butt-kissed and Macbeth (the play) ensured Shakespeare would be his best friend forever (so to speak).Shakespeare\u2019s family was torn in two. Actually both of them were. Recent evidence has come to light that Shakespeare\u2019s father may have been a closet Roman Catholic, when it was dangerous to be so, while his mother seems to have been from a well-known protestant family. We also know Shakespeare was a (unfairly?) convicted criminal (caught poaching) and thereafter moved from his home in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he left his wife and kids, to make his fortune as an actor, playwright, and theatre manager in London. He also kissed a few upper-crust butts and earned handsome pay for his sonnets and other patron-friendly poems. This helped him become wealthy. Why do I say he was rent from his kids, other than the fact that one of his son\u2019s died of the plague, which may have been hard on him as a dad? In his will, Shakespeare left his \u201csecond-best bed\u201d to his wife. This implies to people, like me who seek to spot symbolism in his plays, a subtle suggestion that there may have been some symbolism in his will too. (By the way, almost all his plays to one extent or another are about people pretending to be something they are not.)Women\u2019s roles were played by boys. This helps to make Shakespeare great on another level. When watching his plays, we know that not only are the stories about people pretending to be something they are not, the main female characters are played by boys who seem what they are not. The film Shakespeare in Love rides this train. It adds a whole different layer of irony. And Shakespeare is loaded with dramatic, situational, and verbal irony anyways. Anyone in the LGBTQ community (and who of us is NOT if we are really honest with ourselves \u2014 methinks thou dost protest too much!) can relate to these dichotomies.He was just a plain-old, unmitigated, towering, literary genius. When a genius arrives at such an opportune moment, it is something magical to behold. He writes with true insight about the human experience and condition, and it seems to translate into any language, even though he wrote in a poetic form called iambic pentameter. And it's not just his writing, since he did lots of borrowing other people\u2019s ideas, as I said earlier, from the greatest writers that he knew of who preceded him. In other words, he was a great editor too.Which leads me back to the overacting. It is so obvious, when you study him a little bit, that Shakespeare is a very special writer, many readers itch to act out the plays. The scripts were intended to be set on the stage, and not just printed on the page, after all. And since very few of us are actually great actors, most of the time the acting looks bad. Another word for bad acting is overacting. I\u2019m still trying to figure out why so much skin goes with so much great acting. My theory now centres around vulnerability. Great actors let you see their soul. Great directors might sometimes confuse that soul with boobs! ",

            "answer_text": "I suspect that your question is \u201cis he OVERRATED?\u201d When I was in graduate school, I complained loud and long about how much Shakespeare I had to study. I just despised him. However, in time\u2014 and after several courses on the subject\u2014 I came to realize that there ARE problems in the STUDY of Shakespeare, but not the bard himself. In the first place there aren\u2019t that many different Shakespearean plays that are routinely taught: MACBETH, ROMEO AND JULIET, HAMLET, THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, KING LEAR, MIDSUMMER NIGHT\u2019S DREAMS, JULIUS CAESAR, and OTELLO\u2014 the same old same old\u2026. In middle school my grandson studied MACBETH twice in 3 years. Why? Probably because it is thought to be accessible\u2014 as are all the others I mentioned, so a LOT of them are indeed taught in high school and undergrad. Everyone has studied them at one time or another. They are all accessible, and they are all also symmetrical\u2014 meaning that it is easy to write essays about them! But Shakespeare wrote a lot more. Actually, I looked at my COMPLETE WORKS OF\u2026. and was surprised to see how large his body of works is. But because he wrote a lot doesn\u2019t mean it was all good. Some of his work is very flawed. However, Shakespeare had a genius for language unequalled by anyone, before or since, and do not forget about his sonnets which for the most part were all genius. One problem for Americans with Shakespeare is that we have rarely seen his plays performed by American actors. I attended a Shakespeare festival quite a few years ago and saw CYMBELINE and TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA, two of his worst plays, as well as ROMEO AND JULIET and MERCHANT OF VENICE. They were performed by American actors and they were wonderful BECAUSE I COULD UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE! As well, unless one has studied the plays, he/she is HIGHLY unlikely to get many of the Elizabethan jokes and idiomatic phrases. It pains me to say it because I\u2019m still not a huge fan, but Shakespeare WAS a genius. It may take some work to understand him because of radical changes in the English language since he wrote. But he absolutely is NOT over-rated. And if you can\u2019t commit to his plays, commit to his sonnets. Sir Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean Luc Picard) has been reading Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets on line during the quarantine. If you don\u2019t understand a word he says, you can appreciate Shakespeare just by the sound of Stewart\u2019s voice. ",
