            "answer_text": "Question Answered: What must an employer do about employees stealing from other employees? Not talking legally here: An employer has a responsibility to their employees. At least some responsibility to keep them safe in their persons and effects. Stealing is demoralizing to a team and illegal - at least petty theft. Stealing is wrong and should be against company policy. At minimum, an employer should discipline any employee stealing at work, regardless of what they steal or whom they steal it from. Discipline could be anything from a write up to termination of their employment. In some cases, criminal charges could and may need to be considered. Just be sure to have your company policies in writing and disseminate them to all employees, then apply them fairly and evenly. ",
