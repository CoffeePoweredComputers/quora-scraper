            "answer_text": "It could be suggested that aspects of alchemical practice led to a way of thinking that gave birth to scientific method\u2026 In the same way astrology may been seen as the mother of astronomy\u2026 It is likely that early observations in these areas led to less and less magical thinking and more and more empiricism. Remember that many of the people we hail as scientific thinkers, were \u2018natural philosophers\u2019 so the demarkation between \u2018science\u2019 and \u2018magic\u2019 may not have been that clear. John Dee, the mathematician and translator or Euclid\u2019s geometry, was a practicing occultist, astrologer and sought to connect with angelic entities. Issac Newton was interested in and explored Alchemy Carl Linnaeus was what would be called today, a crypto-zoologist and wrote on numerous mythical creatures. To be fair whist he did write about the Satyr, the Pheonix and Manticore, he also worked to \u2018debunk\u2019 hoaxes. William Crookes was a spiritualist, but to be fair so were a great number of 19th and early 20th Century scientists. (for example Alfred Russel Wallace, Oliver Lodge, Charles Richet, Pierre Curie) The point \u2026 Well before science there was \u2018magic\u2019 and it was \u2018magic\u2019 that inspired questions about the nature of the Universe. As science started to offer not only answers but ways of questioning ideas and creating formalised experiments, the magical side of things was replaced by empiricism. An interest in those topics outside the remit of reductionist and/or scientific method continued (and does continue) but eventually falling into the realm of metaphysics, philosophy and (perhaps) psychology. We need to consider the \u2018researches\u2019 of The Magi in the context of their cultures and appreciate that they created a foundation for questioning and exploration. Alan /|\\ ",

The idea that similarity of characteristics (taking rhino horn can improve your erectile function or taking small amounts of a poison can make you immune to the poison) provides a basis for science was wrong then, and continues to be wrong today. At least alchemy has disappeared. The others continue on. ",
