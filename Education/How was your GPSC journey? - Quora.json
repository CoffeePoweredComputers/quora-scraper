            "answer_text": "Short but exhausting; exciting at times, but mostly boring. I have spent a total of three years (2017\u201319) preparing for civil services exams. Within these years, I have written two mains (2017 & 19) , and appeared for one interview (2019). I am a typical \u2018by-chance-always-regretting-Mechanical engineer\u2019 (Nirma, 2014) by profession, who always wanted to work with anything else but engineering. And, as it happens with most Indian youth, I too fell in this trap of never ending \u2018..\u2026-prelims-mains-interview-prelims-\u2026... \u2018 cycle. Nirvana, however, came relatively early for me in my second cycle only, with 77th rank and STO (class 2) as service preference. Excitement was at its peak during my first attempt (121/2017\u201318). Easily cleared prelims. But casual attitude towards Language papers and overconfidence on my strengths in GS easily knocked me out of the race. So, here is lesson no. 1 for future GPSC aspirants: \u201cdo not take language papers in Mains lightly, no way you can cover the shortfall in GS(unless you are an absolute genius) \u201d Few months after the mains result went into a lot of retrospection and introspection, which continued until the notification for next exam came out (in June\u201918 I guess). After the notification, I expected to start the preparation with new vigor, tried to revive the excitement levels of the first attempt, did a small tour with friends to instill some fresh energy, watched \u2018n\u2019 number of success stories and toppers\u2019 talks for motivation\u2026..BUT all these hardly made any difference. So, here is lesson no. 2 for future GPSC aspirants: \u201cyour first attempt is your best attempt, prepare well and use it wisely, convert the charm of \u2018cracking it in the 1st attempt\u2019 into your motivation, you\u2019ll never get the same motivation in your upcoming attempts\u201d The next few months (July-Oct 2018) after the notification passed pretty fast. Revised the same old Laxmikanth, Spectrum,NCERTs. Revision was the most boring thing I found throughout the preparation. The most dreaded portion in the prelims for me was Gujarat Art & Culture, which I confidently ignored since prelims has 400 total questions and not knowing 20-30 questions hardly make any difference. I managed prelims pretty well and got 186/400. The best thing with the GPSC is that it provides ample amount of time between prelims and mains, hence even if you have to start mains-specific preparation from the scratch, it won\u2019t be an impossible task to do. I started serious preparation for the mains in December 2018. This time,having resigned from the job, I covered most of the syllabus pretty well. I practiced 3\u20134 essays, dedicated 15\u201320 days for language papers only and utilized rest of free time watching RSTV shows. I did not take any test series. Next came the Mains (Feb-March 2019). Most of Mains questions were on expected lines. little difficult than the previous year though, but did not require any special kind of preparation\u2026..except few questions in GS 3 and GS 1- which were completely factual in nature and were beyond my expectations. I had no idea about \u201cthe lady lauded by UN chief\u201d or \u201cBrihad sampark yojna\u201d or \u201cmission PARIVESH\u201d or \u201cSaurashtra ni Rasdhar\u201d or \u201cSAint poetees of India\u201d and few others. I completely screwed up GS 3 and GS 1. So, here is lesson no. 3 for future GPSC aspirants: \u201cpay attention to trivia, GPSC is no UPSC. Schemes and portals are not only important for the prelims,they can haunt you in Mains as well \u201d The months after mains were the most difficult to pass. You think it\u2019s all over now and lets chill but in a split second you realize that perhaps you will be writing the next prelims in 4 months as well. Should I explore my hobbies or stick to the preparation?. Like all times, these time passed too and then came the Mains result. Process after Mains result was pretty fast. Within 20 days of Mains result was my interview. I appeared for two mock interviews. On the interview day, GPSC in my opinion did a fantastic job. Entire interview experience was seamless. My interview lasted for around 20 minutes. Entire interview revolved around my work experience only, there was no current affairs, no situational test,almost nothing about hobbies, no politics\u2026nothing but my Work ex. It happened with most candidates with wok-ex. So, here is lesson no. 4 for future GPSC aspirants: \u201cIf you have work-ex, prepare everything even remotely related to your company- (e.g I had worked with Reliance and I got question about movie \u2018GURU\u2019-which is loosely based on the life of Dhirubhai) \u201d Within 15 days of my interview, came the final result. I got 77th rank. Family was happy. Friends were happy. I was not sure whether I was happy. A mixed feeling of \u2018not getting class 1\u2019 AND \u2018atleast getting into the list\u2019 was there in my mind. \u201cBut there are thousands of deserving candidates who are yet to see their name on the list, many deserving friends I personally knew could not make it even in their 3rd-4th attempt.\u201d with these thoughts I too accepted the outcome. However, I do not think life dramatically changes for anyone after this exam. My mother still scold me for waking up late in the morning. Father still shout at me for not going to temple. Neighbors still yell at me for playing loud music. Relatives still frown at me for being \u201926 & unmarried\u2019. Friends still complain for not planning a Ladakh trip and so on\u2026. ..So, here is the last lesson for future GPSC aspirants: \u201cthis exam merely changes your profession, you remain the same person you were before cracking this exam\u201d Last but not the least: I must thank Sh. Hiren Dave ( Lakshya Academy)- who conducted free mock interview after mains. I found his interview style to be quite similar to that of GPSC interview and attending that mock interview proved beneficial for me.I took one more mock interview at Chahal Academy, A\u2019bad.I did not join any coaching neither did i take any test series. I prepared on my own at my home only.I found entire selection process efficient and transparent. Exam stages get completed as per schedule, and this is very important factor.I have deliberately avoided mentioning book-list and sources, since they are well known to most candidates, still if you want to know about any specific topic/subject\u2014 let me know in the commentGood luck, Praxal Gandhi ",

            "answer_text": "Well! I have not attended any GPSC GAS class 1\u20132 or other administrative examinations. But, I have attended 6 exams of Technical Post (Mechanical Engineering) and Reached at Interview Every time. Out of 6, I have been in Waiting list in 5 times. In recent, I have missed out selection list just due to age preference (Due to equal marks preference was given to elder candidate and I pushed out in first place of Waiting List). But, Overall happy with the Selection Process. One things to be notice that, All Interviews which i have been faced, Selection was solely based on Interview. No written Marks have been Counted in final selection. I had cleared one gpsc class -3 exam (AIMV) in which selection was only based on written Marks. In 2016, I had filed RTI & based on that I has made complaint to Hon. Chairman regarding to consider Written Marks also in Direct Selection Process. Hon. Chairman Shree Dinesh Dasa sir has accepted that request (Not give any written confirmation, but new policy was published within 1 month. Hence, I think like that) and Implemented New Examination Policy of 50+ 50% weightage from Aug - 2016. But, unfortunately, they have not implemented it for advertisement which have been already published. I was little upset as it could be implemented for Larger public interest. But, It is ok. Overall, Happy with working pattern of Hon. shree Dinesh Dasa. Always thankful to him for considering my request. This was not helpful to me, but this will definitely help to Candidate who will not suffer due to just one bad day. Conclusion: \u201cA person who never made a mistake never tried anything\u201d. ",
