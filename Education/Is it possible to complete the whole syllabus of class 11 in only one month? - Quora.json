Once you have a clear vision how you wish to see your reports and knowledge armoury. Schedule your reading time and stick to your plan. I do not deny the fact that task is going to be a hard one. You got to work hard but more importantly you need to work smarter. Tips: \u2206 Make small goals but be very particular about achieving them. \u2206 Focus on the parts which can give you maximum returns (marks). Be sure about the marks distribution part. \u2206 Do not hesitate in taking help from batch mates who study on regular basis. Pull up your pants, Tighten up your belt, Put up your armour, Hit the bull's eye. Best of Luck. Hope, it helps! ",
