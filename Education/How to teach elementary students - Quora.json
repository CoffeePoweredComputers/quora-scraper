            "answer_text": "I have, at one time, taught all levels from nursery school through college. There are unique differences in approach and methodology. Nursery, everything must be short termed and playful. Now. your question was about primary. Primary students are all about getting noticed. They are totally eager to please you. You are the parent figure. You must heap a great deal of praise on them!! They eat that up!! They want to be noticed and recognized. Positive reinforcement is the key at primary grades. \u201cWho is going to be good for me today?\u201d \u201cLook at Susie, sitting straight and paying attention. \u201c \u201cSee how nicely Bobby is walking in the hallway?\u201d There is a guide entitled \u201c100 Ways To Say Good Job.\u201d I suggest you find that online and use every one of those phrases. Use little rewards. Stickers, play money, etc. Some teachers have \u201cteacher money\u201d for good behavior. Earn so much and you get a reward from the \u201ctreasure Box.\u201d Some schools even have \u201cschool money\u201d and a school store. Circulate around the room. look students in the eye. Kneel or sit on their level. Have stations for 30 minutes or so. Above all, praise, praise, praise!! At a high school level, the dynamic is almost reversed. The kids want to fit in with their unit. Most do not want to be noticed. They would rather fit in with peers than please you. The best thing you can do is NOT call them out. Let them blend in and assimilate as part of the \u201cpack.\u201d The little kids strive to be \u201cteacher\u2019s helper/pet.\u201d The high school kids avoid it like the plagued!! With high school kids, you appeal to \u201cmaturity\u201d and cooperation, not control. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank you allowing me to teach you today and I\u2019d like to thank you, in advance for your cooperation.\u201d OR \u201cYou know why I\u2019m here. I have a job to do. You have a job to do. Let\u2019s do our jobs.\u201d \u201cYou know how to act by now.\u201d In high school, don\u2019t use the term \u201crules\u201d. Use \u201csocial contract.\u201d Don\u2019t mandate. Discuss. Get input, but you make final decisions. So, primary, circulate, notice, praise, reward!! (Notice I did not mention middle school, grades 7\u20138. They are the most difficult to teach.) ",

            "answer_text": "Play way method is the best method. Use daily life examples that would interest them most to explain the concept. E. g. Some cartoon character of their interest or say their favourite food like pizza for explaining fraction etc. Activity based learning is permanent. At the same time, as a teacher keep in mind that activities should be small and precise. Otherwise completing syllabus can be a headache. E.g. for factors affecting evaporation just ask for 3 handkerchiefs. Let them dry one spread completely the other kept folded third kept in front of a fan level and then explain it depends on surface area, wind speed etc. See to it that the basic concepts of the topic, may be grammar, basic maths concepts\u2026 are made clear. Usually if the children like the way you teach a particular subject, they start loving that subject forever. And vice versa\u2026 D on't be very strict but at the same time let them know that no nonsense is tolerated. Let discipline and live go hand in hand and you will definitely can win their hearts\u2026. Fir whole of your life\u2026 The love that you get from primary children, you might not get it from higher class students\u2026 ",
