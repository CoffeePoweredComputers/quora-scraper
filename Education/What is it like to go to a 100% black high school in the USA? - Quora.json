            "answer_text": "I don't remember it that way but..... I went to a junior high school 7-9th grade.  It had a reputation for a large black population and just a bad education reputation in general.  I would have guessed it was 70 or 80% but web shows it to be 50% today.  I went their 30+ years ago and have no idea the true makeup back then.  I wouldn't say it was horribly run down.  There were lots of fights, racial discrimination and bullying.  I assume the typical amount for a high school.  The school my kids have attended has a much lower tolerance for this today than I remember back then.  I had several advanced classes.  I played baseball and ran track.  I would say in general it seems my children's junior school was better funded and they were challenged more.     Oddly enough looking the two up on zillow ratings Mine 50%black,30%white/20%his,asian,other rating 2/10 My kids 3% black, 79%white, 18% his,asian,other rating 9/10 I should note one of the reasons we choose to live here was the schools ratings.  This is the first time I have compared them to my own. ",

            "answer_text": "I went to a high school that was 98% black and in a largely middle-class town. I'm not sure what you are looking for in this question - \"what is it like\" is ridiculously broad. Largely, it was like attending a high school of any other type. I took AP classes and honors classes; I participated in some extracurricular activities like marching band and literary magazine; I volunteered; I hung out with my friends. We had a prom and a regular graduation. There are some cultural aspects to attending a predominantly black school - it's kind of like attending an HBCU, in that your culture is shared - but otherwise it's pretty normal. And no, there weren't any insufficient facilities; it was a regular middle-class high school. A bit underfunded (as is normal), but nothing crumbling or falling apart. ",
