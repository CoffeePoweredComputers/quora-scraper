            "answer_text": "Should the government? No\u2026 If you allow the government the power to develop a test which will determine whether or not a person is qualified for office, what is to stop them from designing a test which only allows the incumbents and their chosen people to qualify for office? Could you write a test which realistically only you and a very select group of people would pass? I am pretty sure I could. Here are four questions from mine and I doubt that very few people could pass this unique combination without help. I am sure you could write a similar test using your knowledge. 1) What was the denomination of the first Canadian postage stamp and what is the image on the third Canadian postage stamp? I put this question on because history is important and the post office is a government institution which a leader should understand. 2) Implement a linked list. This question is on here because technology is the way of the future and leaders need to know about its potential. 3) What was the name of the ship which fired the first shots of WW2? Leaders, particularly federal ones, are responsible for international relations and national defence. The Second World War was the worst conflict in history and something of which our leaders should have knowledge. 4) What is the 5th Nobel Gas? A leader should have a basic knowledge of the sciences. I justified every question and I am sure that I could get many people to agree that the questions are \u201csomething a leaders should know.\u201d But were I to write 60 questions like this, I could likely come up with a combination only I could pass. The problem with having a test is that the person writing it can determine who passes. Having a competency test just means that the test writer could be deciding the government, not the people. And if we trust someone enough to let them write such a test that would be in the interests of the people, why not just elect that person to office? ",

            "answer_text": "The competency of a political candidate is judged by the competency of the electorate. With the election and reelection of Barack Obama I knew that the American people had lost all competency and that this incompetence was reflected in the democratic voting process. With reference to competency; competency to do what? For the Obama elections it was felt that the majority was electing someone to give them what they had not earned or to provide that promise of a promised land of milk and honey and, as a Messiah coronation with Greek columns, peace and good will would now descend upon humanity. Sadly, the majority, as that majority who believed the earth was flat, was wrong or that majority who voted for Hitler. Perhaps, it would be a good idea, if we want a competent politician, to have a competency requirement for the voter. ",
