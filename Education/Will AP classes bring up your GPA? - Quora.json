            "answer_text": "Short answer is yes, and here is a longer version: It depends on your school. Most schools have an unweighted GPA and a weighted GPA. Some schools grade on a 5.0 instead of 4.0 for AP course, some do that for both honors and AP courses, and some, like my son\u2019s school, will grade every course the same way but add 0.0225 points per AP class to the combined unweighted GPA. Most schools use the weighted GPA to select their valedictorians and to determine class rank. Because each high school differs in how they calculate their GPAs, each college has its own way of converting your transcript into their own rating system. So it is hard to predict the effect of taking on each additional AP course. Some colleges will like to see their applicants take as many AP, IB, or honors courses they can, while some cap it off at certain number. So it is safe to say that taking more AP courses, provided that you can keep your grades up, will benefit you to a certain degree. The bottom line is that the colleges will be looking at the strength of your transcript that includes your UW GPA, difficulty of classes, whether you met the required course load, your grades in intended major, and your trend. So if you are worried about getting into your dream school, your first priority is to go to the school\u2019s admissions website and find out what courses are required (4 years of math, 4 years of English, 2 years of foreign language, etc.). Challenge yourself without wearing yourself out. Do not bite off more than you can chew, especially during your fresh/soph years. ",

            "answer_text": "Any class can bring up your GPA, but AP classes can have an extra benefit on your weighted GPA. It\u2019s calculated differently at every high school, but here\u2019s a pretty standard way(also the one done at my school). On the unweighted scale, your GPA does not differentiate between AP, honors, or regular. Therefore, an A in a regular class is 4.0, and an A in an AP/Honors class is also 4.0.(Our school doesn\u2019t differentiate between +/-) However, your weighted GPA is different. A 4.0 in a regular class is 4.0 on the weighted scale. However, an A in an AP/Honors class is a 5.0 on the weighted scale. TLDR: AP classes bring up GPA, but have a more pronounced effect on the weighted GPA. ",
