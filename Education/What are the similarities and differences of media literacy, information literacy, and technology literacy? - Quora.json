            "answer_text": "Literacy to me is an understanding of something. In the case of reading literacy, your comprehension level, understanding of the material read and the level at which you read; i.e. a transitional level versus an advanced level, etc. In relation to your three specific literacy types, this is how I see it: Media literacy - Your understanding of the media, how it works, the way it\u2019s presented and the understanding that it is not all objective or accurate all the time. Much of it can be misinformed or biased. Information literacy - I would couple this with reading literacy in the sense that it\u2019s your understanding/comprehension of the information presented to you, in any format, whether it\u2019s reading, television, audio, etc. Technology literacy - Your understanding of technology, how well you use it and can apply it to your every day life or job, etc. Like in my instance, I can usually figure out most electronics without a manual. My mom is a wizard with a spreadsheet and my dad can do just about anything with a PowerPoint presentation. Those are our technological literacy strengths, but I can only do basic functions in a spreadsheet and my mom still doesn\u2019t understand how Facebook and Snapchat work. Those would be our technological weaknesses or illiteracy, if you will. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, here\u2019s the cynical answer. We hear an awful lot of talk these days about various literacies. More or less obvious stuff, not much different from sports literacy, fashion literacy, weather literacy, and shoe literacy. In other words, you know something about the subjects. But why, today, do we hear so much about these new literacies? Could it be that somebody wants to distract us from the gloomy fact that many children today do not know very much about the fundamental literacy, that is, reading. What we really need is literacy literacy! But when millions of young people do not know how to read, and millions of not so young people read only in a limited sense, I would suggest that our Education Establishment is very eager to change the subject. And keep changing it with ever more weird new kinds of literacy. If you discuss these topics, you encourage our commissars. There are now schools in America where they have classes in financial literacy. Maybe everybody needs an hour of that when they are 16. But not much more. Always ask yourself, what is being displaced for all the new gimmicks? Oh, nothing important, our experts will tell us. American History, Literature, Algebra, Biology, all that junk. Who needs it? Keep asking the administrators what percentage of their children are proficient in reading? How many are below proficient? How many have been taught to read with sight-words so they never actually learn to read? The hoax that Rudolf Flesch explained in 1955 (in his book titled \u201cWhy Johnny can\u2019t read\u201d) is with us still, haunting every classroom in this country.
