            "answer_text": "IAT consists of four sections: Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Math. All four subjects have equal weightage and marks scored in each section are counted in total. But it is not compulsory if you choose not to attempt it. I myself being a PCB student earlier didn\u2019t attempt a single question from the math section, but then you need to make sure that the number of questions you attempt from the other three sections is more and most of them are right. Good Luck! ",

But attempting more subjects ensures you a better rank and the IISER of your choice. I will strongly recommend you to study a little bit of biology after JEE advanced for IAT as it is extremely scoring. Cheers!!! ",
