            "answer_text": "let\u2019s not talk about the negatives of things! I\u2019m saying this because there are pros and cons of everything in this world. Therefore, focus on the pros of things available to help us achieve our goals will be a better thing to do. Without a doubt, they charge high amount of fee in exchange of the quality of education they offer. Private schools offer some pros also. For example: Holy child school tuition.Better facility for sports.Offer better quality of facilities and advantageous of private school.COED K-6 School Program for kids.All girls\u2019 7-12 School Programs for girls.Some private schools in NJ offer financial aid to the qualified students. But one private school that I know about offers affordable tuition and transportation facility as well. I think you just need to figure out your educational needs and talk to the management of Oak. Therefore, I advise you to not to focus on only the disadvantageous private schools. ",
