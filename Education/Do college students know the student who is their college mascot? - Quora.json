            "answer_text": "That\u2019s going to depend a lot on the size of the college in question. When I went to FSU, it had around 20,000 undergraduate students, and more than 10,000 graduate students attending. With that many people, there\u2019s no way for anyone to know more than a small fraction of the other students personally, so most people didn\u2019t know who the mascot was. I know I definitely didn\u2019t. ",
