            "answer_text": "It depends. Each prison is different. Assuming your in the US for discussion purposes, once your settled in, go talk to the education office or program coordinator and ask. While may systems offer job training and education programs, it depends on staffing, custody level, funding and related. Absent workable programs at the prison, check into prison education programs from state and community colleges as many offer low or reduced tuition programs where you can complete everything from a GED to a degree via correspondence.
