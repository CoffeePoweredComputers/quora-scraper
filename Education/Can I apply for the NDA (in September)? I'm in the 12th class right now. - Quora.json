            "answer_text": "Yes my friend you are eligible for NDA 2 2018. Start studying properly the concepts of class 11th and study all the maths portion properly what you have been taught in 12th. If you qualify the written exams , start preparing well for the SSB , as it would be your first SSB and the highest probability of qualification is in the first attempt. Don't worry too much about written , when i was in your condition even i didin't knew about the NDA, it was my friends who forcefully made me fill the form. And guess what, i was the only one out of many of us to qualify the writtens and SSB. Atleast you are curious and willing towards NDA, you stand a great chance. Use quora efficiently for its preparations and feel free to ask me anything . Best of luck !! ",
