            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Varun. For Online MBA degrees, that is distance learning that does not have an on-campus module component, there has been significant growth in recent years, most due to the lower cost compared to on campus programs, even at 3rd tier schools. Also, recruiter activity has increased and so ranking organizations like QS, for me one of the most transparent of such organizations, includes their input on its own rankings. I call QS \u2018transparent\u2019 because they don\u2019t have to sell newspapers and aren\u2019t in cahoots with top schools to swing ratings. That said, the variables that go into ranking should be considered as some of them are weird. Here is the QS top ranked schools for online MBAs in 2017 #1 IE Buiness School Global MBA, based in Spain tuition: $46,600 #2 Warwick Business School, U of Warwick, UK, Warwick MBA by Distance Learning tuition: $36,780 #3 Kelley School of business, US, Keley Direct Programs Online MBA tuition: $66,300 #4 Hough Graduate School of Business, US, Online MBA tuition: $53,242 #5 Alliance Manchester Business School, U of Manchester, UK, Manchester Part-Time MBA tuition: $41,761 #6 Thunderbird School of Global Management, US, Online Master of Global Management tuition: $39,000 #7 Durham University Business School, UK, The Durham Online MBA tuition: $23,590 #8 Fox School of Business, Temple University , US, Fox Online MBA tuition: $59,750 #9 Oxford Brookes University Business School, UK, Oxford Brooks Global MBA tuition: $26,861 #10 University of Strathclyde Business School, UK, Master of Business Administration, tuition: $25, 158 It is worth noting that #11 is The Open University in the UK and after that all the names of all schools blend into a mix of unrecognizable names and locations. The first 3 schools on the top 10 list are also schools in the 2nd tier rankings for on campus MBA - so you know thee schools already have a real brick and mortar program and that the online version most likely has some relations. The Thunderbird School has been around for generations and was absorbed by the University of Arizona in Phoenix in 2015. It is an older, no nonsense program than has always been under the radar of brand snobs because of its military vocational origins but the program will likely be phased out / merged with UofA\u2019s Carey School of Business. Kelly has a very good MBA program than never quite makes it into the US top 10, but it remains a good school. IE Business School is highly ranked in Europe, but it is known as an incredibly easy school to get into - which means that the peer situation is not very intense. But for an online school, obviously, peer relations are not a top priority. As always, candidates need to do the research to find out what is best for them. ",
