            "answer_text": "You do not say which country you are from. If you are in the United States. YES! In fact there have been compulsory attendance acts in all states of the United States for many generations. The penalty for not going to school varies from state to state. In Texas you can not drop out until the age of 17 years of age. Since many people graduate when they are 18 years old, then you might as well go for the High School degree. In Texas your parent(s) or legal guardian can ALSO end up in jail if you do not attend school plus a heavy fine. If you are homeschooled, you have to prove it and demonstrate your curriculum. There are truancy officers in districts (the term is different for different states). Many of those officers are policemen who can enforce the law. In most states of the United States you have to go to school through the age 16, but like I said that age varies from state to state. I will tell you that in all the years I\u2019ve been teaching (and I\u2019ve been teaching school since 1975), EVERY student that dropped out of school that I know of has ended up living in poverty. Is that the life you want? Education is your chance for success. Please don\u2019t waste it! And many of us did struggle through school. By the way, the federal government in what we call the \u201cLeave no child behind Act\u201d confirmed the compulsory education within that document. If you go to my page to look at the questions I\u2019ve answered, I\u2019ve provided some history in a couple of questions regarding when the compulsory attendance law was first enacted. I should mention that in Europe as well as in the Orient and all across the world, there are compulsory attendance laws. ",

            "answer_text": "In the US, that decision is largely left to the individual states, but I believe all states require students under age 16 to be enrolled in school. When I was very young, there were still truant officers, sort of like school cops, who could go to your house and drag you to school. I don\u2019t think they exist much anymore. If you don\u2019t go to school, you won\u2019t get a degree (although in some places\u2026), but whether you or your parents will be in legal trouble depends on many factors. However, you can change all of this! That\u2019s the beauty of a democracy. All you have to do is run in and win an election to your state\u2019s legislature, and then convince sufficient numbers of legislators to remove this legal requirement. The best place to prepare for a future in politics is high school, so if you want to free the youth from the chains of school, you have to go to school. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the laws of the country you live in. In Estonia, children are obligated by law to attend school either until finishing nine years of basic education or until they reach the age of 17 (whichever happens first, eh?). Students usually begin school at age 7 (sometimes 8). If I remember correctly, they changed the law a bit a few years ago and that now, in addition to that, you have to choose either high school or vocational school (it also comes with a high school education package, so it doesn\u2019t really matter which you choose, you get three years of secondary education). The correction was made to avoid the situation of kids simply choosing to not choose what to do with their lives and living on their parents\u2019 dime, which is not what the country or government want. So, if you lived in Estonia, then yes, you would be legally required to attend school. Your parents wouldn\u2019t be allowed to hinder you and if you were a chronic skipper, then there are measures in place for that, too. But I don\u2019t know what the situation is like in other countries, European or otherwise, although I think basic education is compulsory in most other European countries (correct me if I\u2019m mistaken, after all, it\u2019s an assumption).
