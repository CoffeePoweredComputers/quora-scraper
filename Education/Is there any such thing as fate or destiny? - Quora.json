            "answer_text": "Let's think about the question together.  Is this question asking whether there is some external force with its hand on the choices we make and the behavior we feel we are shaping ourselves? In other words, are we deceiving ourselves when we think we are in control of our lives and their evolution? If agency or self-control is a myth, then our answers to this question would be simply the latest fling in our misguided understanding of what it means to be human. Our answers would be shaped by that external force, and therefore not really our answers at all. Furthermore, to contend that this force has us in its grasp puts an unbearable burden of proof on whomever is so bold as to claim knowledge of the external force. How indeed would we be able to substantiate such a claim?  Would it be probable that this external force would make itself known to us such that we could say to skeptical others: \"See, there it is, that grand wizard, the source who pilots our ship.\" But perhaps this question is asking a different question: Do we have any ability to redirect what seems to be the pattern of our lives, or are we inextricably trapped in a theatrical production where the script is predetermined and we are allowed to play only a specific role? This question need not assume a Grand Director, as was implied in the first potential version of the question. This form of the question may derive from a materialist understanding of what it means to be human.  Material forces, in this perspective, serve as external factors pushing us in a probabilistic manner toward specific options.  This approach to the question is consistent with the Sociological worldview. It is also consistent with many of the social justice arguments flowing from left-wing thought.  In that external factors are overwhelming influences on our life and in that race, class, genetic predispositions, personalities, and dumb luck are not distributed in any manner that we shape, it follows that sharing and generosity of spirit are sensible responses to the injustice in the distribution of these external factors. If we push against this perspective of material shaping of our lives, we can find useful resources in the orthodox economist's worldview. No Principles of Economics book seems capable of coherent expression without the frequent use of \"the chooser\" as a surrogate actor standing in place of the consumer, the businessperson, the worker, and even the governmental leader. Humans as economists view them are fate-resistant in the main. In fact the human in an economist's worldview is a mocker of fate, a Miss America victor whose victory speech is full of testament to hard work, careful planning and a litany of individualistic platitudes that in the end shout FATE????  Are you kidding me? Neither the Sociological nor the Economic worldview is so naive as to think that external factors and human choice do not share responsibility for whatever befalls us.  Their perspectives rather refer to the primary shaper--external factors (fate perhaps) for sociologists and calculating rationality for economists. That last paragraph provides us with the suggestion that we have reason to have at least a modicum of hope that even for those who most revere the effect of fate on our lives, each of us still has or at least needs to assume we have some ability to fight probabilities provided by a world we personally did not create. Even is fate refers to huge and foreboding material forces, we can resist and on occasion conquer what appears to be our fate. We can wrestle with fate in this sense of the world, and pin her on occasion. Final thought: Maybe thinking about fate is most productive when we see it as just the most likely shaper, not some all-powerful ruler of who we are and will become. In this regard, consider the useful analysis of economic fate by Gregory Clark 18 months ago in the NYT: Your Ancestors, Your Fate. The thrust of his and his colleagues' research is that who your parents are and are not has a huge impact on your later economic status. In that sense, fate has us in her grasp. BUT, the good news is that fate has moments of weakness. Some people escape what seems to be their economic destiny. ",

            "answer_text": "I've always been a firm believer of fate. It's been 13 days since my mit baba died. Long story short he was my brother's best friend's dad. My brother had been best friends with his son long before I was born. But that relationship goes so much deep that my brother would have burned his body in case his son wouldn't have been able to do so. In Nepal, we call it \"mit laune.\"  Let me tell you his story. He had gone to his relative's grandchild's rice feeding ceremony a few hours away from his place. He didn't really attend such events but around that time, he decided to go. The next day, he decided to come home immediately. His children told him to stay there for a few more days and also said they'd take care of the business (hotel) but he said he'd come back immediately. It was so unlike him. On the day the accident happened, he left without having lunch. That relative told him to have dinner and go numerous times, but he refused even after them telling him that they'd bring fish from somewhere famous that was one hour away. Again, it was unlike him since he never really refused and on top of that, it was food. Food was everything to him. He was fond of cooking, eating and feeding others. His nephew told him that he would leave Mit Baba home in the motorbike. Again, he refused. He said he'd go in the bus. He hated riding on buses. Most of the times, he didn't attend events if anyone didn't come to take him in their private vehicle. And his sister told me he always made a \"disliking\" face every time she told him she came in the bus. He got on the third bus. Again, the two buses before that had many empty seats. And the bus he got on put other passengers. 75 people. Too much overload for a bus where only 27 people would fit (cause of accident). He was sitting in a seat though. Yes, it happens in Nepal. On top of that, Dashain (our main festival) was starting. Mit Baba always called his son/daughter/wife right after getting on the bus, but that day he didn't. And his daughter told me he had been bringing up his death many times the past few months. For him to leave that house without eating, refuse the \"private vehicle\" offer and get on the third bus and die in an accident where 3 people died out of 75 people, it was meant to be. Let that be. The fact that he went on a rice feeding ceremony itself was meant to be. He was someone who didn't leave the hotel unless there was some big occasion or unless he had to go to the capital city. It was meant to be. Rest in peace Mit Baba ",
