            "answer_text": "First of all, stop thinking too much about marks. When you play football, you focus more on ball than the goalpost. Obsession with marks will neither help you to concentrate on learning nor to score high.  For the concept clarity, just one word \u2014VISUALISATION. Remember this scene of Super 30?  When you start picturising the concept in front of your eyes, be assure that you got that. Our mind is such that the things we read and hear (in lectures) get into conscious mind, means you may forget that when you need that most. But what we imagine and visualise get into our sub-conscious mind, you will find that when you need that most, like a reflex action. How to do that? Simple. All you need to do is, feel not memorise; see not read; relate to real life not in bookish numericals. Start imagining film of formulas on the wall like you imagine the charming face of your crush. See Newton\u2019s second law not like this \u2014 [math]F = m*a [/math] but like this \u2014  Don't learn oxidation by this \u2014 [math]2Mg + O\u2082 \u2192 2MgO [/math] but by explaining phenomenons like this  Don't memorise photosynthesis by this equation [math]6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082[/math] but by this equation of life   Once you master this art, everything will make sense. Your boring books and notebooks will look like fantasy novels. The tests and exams which give you stress will give you thrills of playing video games. Beyond all of this, you will start learning language of nature.  Image sources: Google Images mpuneet \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc ",

Try solving problems which are essentially the application of concepts. If you get stuck, look at a few solved examples and try to figure out the logic behind the solution and solve more and more problems. Get expert help from tutorials if you are aiming particular exams to practice problems in the particular format of the exams. ",
