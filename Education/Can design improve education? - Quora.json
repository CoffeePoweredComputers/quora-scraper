            "answer_text": "Every learning situation is unique. The content being presented, the learners, the environment, and the instructors all contribute to both the teaching and learning experience, as they are all factors that help to determine appropriate instructional design models.  Because of the range of potential learning situations, the instructor must create a plan that is clear, purposeful, and appropriate to the environment.   They must manufacture a learning experience that engages the learner and uses clear instructions with purposeful, relevant content. The designer must examine various design theories that might be chosen and what should be made explicit when using them so that the design can be effective.  Various instructional theories use different methods to attaincustomized outcomes under unique conditions and based on different values.  Knowing as much as we can about the contributing variables and context in which the instruction will be taught is ideal when choosing a model, but many times it is the exception rather than the rule.  The learner(s) should be addressed optimally in order to achieve the best possible result.  Regardless of theory used, the designer must make their instructions explicit to the teacher of the lesson in order to achieve its proper implementation. At some point it becomes the teachers job to vary the model based on the feedback during the instruction.  If they plan to use Second Life as a tool, for example, and find that learning to use Second Life provides a barrier to learning the content, they need to be prepared with a \"plan B.\"  If they anchor their instruction or try to contrast cases but are met with blank looks and lack of anticipated participation, they must be ready to switch gears to convey the necessary topic.  But overall, good design is the foundation used for the teacher.  Some will execute better than others.  The designer cannot always anticipate response, but if they gather as much information as possible before the instruction, chances are better than not that the teacher will have a much easier time.

            "answer_text": "There are many interesting and potential fruitful answers here (particularly around feedback, feedback models, and personalization of the education experience.  One which I would add to the list is the issue of simplicity both for curriculum and of bureaucratic processes--which may be more \"lean\" than design thinking--but the principles seem the same).   Many of us may have grown up in semi-ideal classrooms which may not speak to what 1/3rd or more of students and teachers live in on a daily basis.  My mother taught for more than a decade in inner city schools where drug deals were commonplace and the kids lived in projects where crime and shootings were all too common.    Applying a one size fits all solutions without taking into account these nuances and critical differences (including resources, parental support, parental education, and culture as well as in class discipline issues) is a little misguided. To me both sets of questions are vitally important to creating a sustainable solution to our nations education woes: Agent centered questions: How can design help teachers performance?How can design help students achievement & learning?How can design help parents?How can design help other agents in the process (either admin or \"experts\")?How can design help improve student motivation and passion for learning?How can design help solve deeper problems in the education process--including at risk students: Can design help inner city students?Can design help stop drop out rate?Can design help improve the quality of teacher education?Can design help improve retention of students in critical years (ie junior high, etc..)?",

            "answer_text": "I would argue that the teachers who possess great teaching skill, are, in fact, great at  redesigning lessons on the fly.  These kinds of instructors see holes or problems in the curriculum and both instinctively and by experience create better learning experiences for their students.  They incorporate data from the feedback loop on the fly, adjust the design, and re-engage.  They continually reflect on what works and what doesn't building an ever-growing designer's kit.  In the end, design strongly influences success for the classroom teacher, and some teachers become extraordinary designers. ",

            "answer_text": "The skills of the teacher are that they have a good comprehension of design principles and use those principles in their execution of training. One of the most important topics an instructor should learn about is cognitive loading.  Cognitive loading involves the processing capability of the brain.  In order to maximize learning, we have to carefully manipulate the three types of cognitive loading (intrinsic, germane, and extraneous).  We minimize the extraneous and optimize the germane by utilizing good design. ",
