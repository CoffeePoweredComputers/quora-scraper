            "answer_text": "Really, that's asking two questions at once, first how life is for an Indian med student and then how is med student life in Aiims, Bhopal. If you know the answer to the first question then it's easy to tell you about the latter. It's fun because you get to meet a lot of people and I mean it, a lot of different one's owing to it's location in central india students from all around the country come, consequently,you get to make many friends,participate in various events, and have a blast, We have \u201cRETINA\u201d an Intercollege fest,and the best elements are the live concert and DJ night, so you get to dance like hell, not to forget we even have Retina afterparty to celebrate the success of Retina(everyone works hard and as a junior you work a lot too so here's your little reward, generous seniors you see ), and if you think that's taking it too far, here's the life at AIIMS, BHOPAL for ya, fun isn't it. There is an annual sports event Pravah also,so you get to flex a bit too, \ud83d\ude04.How about a cup of noodles and cafe latte, well here you go, so we also have magee hotspots, very near to hostel, yaa like verry near, you lazyass!, just kidding \ud83d\ude02.You'll also love the hostels and even love more the hostel life, also the hostel rules here are much more relaxed , and you'll know the benefits of it when you go to live in one. Because of the recent developments in sports facilities here, it's even better. And if you are still wondering about the first question in the back of your head let me give you a brief answer - In India we have medical colleges for Mbbs that means you don't need graduation and medical schools for studying medicine, that saves a lot trouble and time, like you don't need a 3 year graduation before entering med school of 4 years,thar means same stuff less time, so if you give it a second thought medicine is rather lengthy, and yep, it's hard to remember huge stacks of conceptual as well as rote stuff in less time, your full determination and resolve is required,to push it all inside your little brain \ud83d\ude05 and yes the academics are a real pain in the ass, so you have to work hard a month or so before your exams, dah!, got scared \ud83d\ude31, chill you'll make it through just fine, though I'm not in s position to say so, but because I've seen my seniors go through, just fine. So, the latter brings the stress element in your life. So, ammm a mix of stress and fun but more of stress as you advance through in your studies, I suppose. I guess that's how the life of sacrifices for the doctor is \ud83d\ude0c. ",
