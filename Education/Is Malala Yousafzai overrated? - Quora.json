            "answer_text": "Of the 3 girls shot, Malala was the only one airlifted on a private plane for cutting edge treatment in Birmingham while the other two girls, Shazia Ramzan who was shot twice in the arm and Kainat Riaz who was shot in the hand both still continue their education in same school and didn't have any chance to get the same level of treatment as Malala got. Malala has been residing in UK since her treatment, she never publicly acknowledged her home city \"SWAT Valley\" and neither speaks of the army doctors who saved her life. The questions which raise doubt about Malala : How can you get a nobel peace prize for promoting girls education in a country you no longer live in?How do the celebrities only support the cause of Malala ? She has been meeting up and getting support from celebrities like Madonna, Justin Biber, Jon Strwet, Irana Shyk etc. She even gets chance to meet Obama, Justin Trudeau, Hillary Clinton etcShe never speaks for the children in Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and neither gives them any support. Thousands of children have been killed in the recent war against ISIS and Israel led war in Gaza.She never speaks against the drone war in Pakistani tribal region, there are reports that over 160 children have been killed since the start of the drone attacks.Abdul Sattar Edhi contributed to the Pakistani society throughout his life. He along with his wife established free hospitals and free schools but did not get any Nobel Price or ever was nominated for it.This one is bit hard to say but how can\u2019t we see any gun shot injury ? Also her recovery was so fast it casts doubt about the whole story of Taliban shooting her.Thousands of other women in Pakistan are doing even greater work for humanity and even dying for their causes, so why Malala?There seems to be greater conspiracy in Malala story or it might be that the West is obsessed with Malala as she stood up against Taliban. What about thousands or millions of children who died in recent US led wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Vietnam \u2026. don\u2019t they deserve the same prestige ? ",
