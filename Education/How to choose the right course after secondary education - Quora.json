            "answer_text": "What is your aim in life? \u201cWhat is it that you want to see yourself doing in the future.\u201d Read the above again. It's different from want you want to do in life. It says what do you want to see yourself doing in the future. If you're confused and not sure, look at what your father does. Ask what he does. Are you excited to work like that? If yes, pick up that he says. If not your dad, then some role model, or someone from your friends, family or something or someone you saw on TV. Something is there that excites you. That's enough for you to filter your options. Don't think if things like sports abd cricketer etc. Let me give an eg. Assume you're sure from a long time that you want a govt job only then ask some senior guy as to what qualifications or branches have most application. By application I mean what all qualifications are usually asked by govt exams. Like usually they ask graduation in any field. Few specifically ask engineering i.e., BE/BTech. Then it's better to take engineering as engineering is a subset of Graduation and you'll be eligible for both grad and engg jobs. You'll have more chances. You get the point right? Then you can decide what exam to write. Usually people do engg as it's the most versatile and common branch eligible everywhere.! You can go to IT, govt, defence, administrative, banking everywhere. What you want to do is usually always related by some way or other to your filtered options. Assuming you want to be a scientist in ISRO, now you can try to know what type of jobs does ISRO offer or what are the different types of career options available in ISRO provided you're ready to work in any Dept it work but your condition is that the firm should be ISRO only. So you let's say take up engg and you get selected as a scientist. But assuming you don't but still want to work in ISRO only then since you have engg degree, look if option what ISRO offers to engineers. Like you can be a mechanical engineer there, or computer science Dept, or research team, or manufacturing Dept. So many. I hope you get the point! But if you take up a specific course like BSc Agri, or law something like that, be sure that the chances are limited for those fields as you've already taken up a specialization from the beginning. Nobody but only you will know what you want to do in life. Even if you're not clear now, best thing is to take a versatile stream it field and then when you are clear as to what you wanna do, you'll automatically start finding routes. ",
