            "answer_text": "That is called \u201cgrading on a curve\u201d. The highest grouping of scores gets A, usually only a handful. The next highest grouping of scores gets B and most of the scores get C. A few, about the same number as the A\u2019s get a D. Some teachers instead just move the highest score to 100. Say the highest score was 81, that score must have 19 points added to make 100%. Thus, all the scores must have 19 points added, and then the groupings are graded. The Problem: The scores imply that some students understood all of the important materials. (Important beCAUSE it was in the test!) When in actuality, the teacher did a very poor job of communicating the material since only 81% was learned by the brightest students. The teacher should get a B- for teaching, and it should be retaught to the students. (This actually happened, and I was considered the worst teacher because my students' highest scores were 93% & 95%, not 100% like these other two teachers claimed!) Second problem: In my accounting class, we (groups of 3 people) got 93% but the next closest score was very low . IF she had moved us to 100%, then next score would not even be 90% and the rest of the class would Cs. Yes, no B\u2019s! So the professor gave us 110%, so two groups got A\u2019s of 90% and 91%. She moved on, leaving this very important material NOT understood, guaranteeing more and more future failures on the next tests. ",
