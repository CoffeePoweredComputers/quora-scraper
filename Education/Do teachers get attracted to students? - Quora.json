            "answer_text": "They sure do! How can you not? They can be so very, very funny, kind, responsive, and everything. Sometimes they would play tricks on me. Should I get angry? I tried my best to be angry, but oftentimes the trick was so funny, I\u2019d burst out laughing. Once when I teaching sentence structure and the logic of it, the brightest kid in the classroom brought in one of the thickest, fattest books I\u2019d ever seen. He raised his hand and asked innocently, \u201cMrs. T, didn\u2019t you say we could diagram in class any sentence we wanted on the checkboard?\u201d I replied, \u201cYep, Jason, I sure did!\u201d He turned around an winked at his classmates. \u201cOkay, can we do this one?\u201d He handed me a book. The book was a med book, There was underlined sentence. The sentence was over a page long. Truly it was! I told him, \u201cOkay, would you like to do it for homework?\u201d Pure silence fell in the classroom. There was another time when I returned to from lunch and found a beautifully wrapped box on my desk. I was just gorgeous. I opened the package and found a box of sand and dirt! The kids were looking at me expectantly. At first, I was going to yell and then just plain laughed. The list of things they did, their earnestness, their incredible kindness, their sense of logic, their sense of right and wrong hit me always. They were there to learn. But they always reach into my heart. Sometimes one or two would wait until everyone gone and then tell a sad story looking for help. Sometimes they just want to share something that had happened at home. How can you not develop feelings for them? ",

They are students, meaning they are not peers, not friends, and especially not someone I want to date. They are students and I want them to learn what I have to teach them and to be successful in life. On the other hand, teachers are not blind. Someone is basically attractive or they are not, although beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Since I am heterosexual, I see the college age young women I teach and think, \u201cI am sure she has lots of boyfriends.\u201d I am the youngest of 6 in my family and I have many nieces. Can I acknowledge that my niece is attractive? Sure . Do I want to have a relationship with my niece? Hell, no. Having taught for almost 30 years I have always had a professional detachment from my students. Friendly but not friends. A professional detachment is equally applied whether the student is attractive or not. ",

            "answer_text": "I will say eagerness to learn and discipline. No matter what students is like, his/her learning attitude and good personal disposition is what i like the most in them as student. As per my belief, teaching and learning is not a profession with certain probation period but a process. Sometimes we teachers learn from students and most of the time we share what we have as academic content. I am teaching grade 11, 12 and bachelors students of computer science right now. I sometimes get chance to learn from my students. They teach the lesson of friendship and happiness occasionally. We teachers forget sometimes to smile and being teacher they become the reason for us to carry smile everyday where ever we go. Being good or even excellent in academics is not the only thing that makes our life meaningful. Let me share an experience why student's personal disposition is important. In one of the college that i\u2019m engaged with, i use to teach a student whose academic result came to be excellent in every test that i take. He used to score not less than 90% in my subject i.e. computer science in every test and use to enjoy my class. But his personal disposition in class was like he treat himself as a super fellow in class. He used to hold attitude that was like very disturbing for other students in class. He was from a Rana family which is treated as high class in Nepal (I\u2019m not trying to indicate all Ranas\u2019 over here as scenario is somehow different in reality). FYI, Rana dynasty ruled the Kingdom of Nepal autocratically from 1846 A.D until 1951 A.D. and is treated as high class in general. He used to hold that kinda kingly attitude and turn his back to the college rules and regulations - misbehaving female students and even teachers. I don\u2019t know why but he was a good students to me. College administration did talked with his parents and we all tried to keep him in track. But no any methods worked. Though being a talented student he was given Transfer Certificate from college. This is the first time i\u2019m giving his example in public. I sometime regret for not being able to find the root of his attitude problem and help him. I feel so sad to know later-on that he was into some sort of addiction and that very reason took his life in an road accident in 2016. Every teachers like students who are eager to learn and disciplined as well. They need to upgrade themselves and be better version everyday. To be a student disciplined, he/she need to pose good attitude as well. Talented students may not always be good. What makes student a good student is eagerness toward learning and how they behave with teachers, parents and external stimuli that they face in everyday life. #geeksagar ",

I count myself very lucky that I don\u2019t actually find people as young as my students attractive. I mean, many of them are lovely\u2014I\u2019m not blind. But if I think of the women in my life about whom I actually think \u201cIf I weren\u2019t happily married, I\u2019d ask her out,\u201d they\u2019re all at least 30 years old. I\u2019ve taught junior-high, too, for two years, about 20 years ago. Now those students were children. Again, I could appreciate their cuteness, but no, not the slightest bit of attraction. Again, I am thankful that this is the case. I am sure some teachers are not so lucky. I also remember when I first started teaching, when I was barely older than the college students I was teaching. Yes, I was attracted to some of them. Age-wise, there would have been nothing very unusual about us dating. But I was their teacher. Romance and sex have no place in a teacher-student relationship. Even in my early 20s I knew that. Teachers who can\u2019t figure this out shouldn\u2019t be teachers. ",

The even smaller minority who lapse are the ones you sometimes hear about in the news, and not in a good way. Most students are fortunate enough never to meet one of those. They\u2019re few and far between, and the profession works to keep it that way. ",

My mind is focused on the content and on how the students are doing intellectually. Of course I also care about their personal lives as it relates to class, such as if a health issue makes it hard to concentrate or an additional disability makes it hard to retain new material, but other than that, I really am not thinking about anything personal.

It doesn't matter what students are like as they can all do that. It's perhaps more rewarding if I find it particularly hard to find the right way of engaging a student and then find something that works. Anything that impedes that process is a challenge especially when it is tied to political or bureaucratic agendas. Helping students learn is something I enjoy and I have respect for all students and in that sense - they are all amazing and I like all of them without exception. ",

When groups of teachers do this you may have to ask why this is allowed and then you understand why complaints never get taken seriously. Someone might be protecting them\u2026.. It is quite common and schools cover it up. The teachers are often serial offenders. In some cases it has been harmless admiration. Generally I think it is bad form to discuss students in this way and it will attract negative attention from colleagues. I ignore it, it is offensive and students need to be viewed respectfully. Leering gets noticed. ",
