            "answer_text": "In the UK an employer of more than 5 persons has an obligation to inform and educate, That is not to say an employer has no obligation to protect people (employed or not) from any dangers arising out of their actions/activities. One of the best statutes to come out of Parliament is the 1974 Health & Safety Act, it is not a long document and the structure of it makes it easy to understand and implement. In my opinion most (if not all) of the negative stories about Health & Safety come from people using the Act to obstruct an activity they don\u2019t like or want, or have for their own benefit misinterpreted the ACT due to a failure to understand it.
