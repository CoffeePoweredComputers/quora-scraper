            "answer_text": "Definitely yes. 1. Everyone should engage in some form of physical activity during the day, even if it's just stretching for 15 minutes.  The image of obesity in America is a serious issue and we should be teaching kids to be active as early as possible. 2. In elementary school, PE was our only source of human anatomy education.  Mostly it's the perfect class that should teach kids what and what not to do to their bodies. 3. A lot of students get super restless into the day which can easily turn into constant fidgeting or even pent up aggression.  Moving around even for a little bit can loosen up stress, promote socializing and teamwork, and help students pay more attention in class. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. A thorough understanding how your body moves and functions is fundamental to your day to day life, as is how to condition it and use it effectively.  PE also aids in developing a basic understanding of teamwork and group tactics both planned and improvised, which can be extrapolated to social and business situations.  The addition of physical stimuli also serves to enhance cognitive function under forms of duress, which is also of great value. ",
