            "answer_text": "Yes, kiddo. Yes, it is, but if it wasn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t feel warmth in my heart every time I remember I made it. Now I\u2019ve seen many people say it\u2019s the workload itself that\u2019s demanding and not the subjects, but I\u2019d like to refute that. Sometimes the curriculum is hard too. It depends on your strengths and weaknesses, and most importantly, your determination. What do you want and how badly do you want it? Those are all things that affect your experience whether you want it to or not. For example, I was one of those students that wanted to avoid maths and sciences as much as possible. Yes, I know it sounds silly, but newsflash: it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re dumb. I know, shocking. Not that I\u2019m saying I\u2019m intelligent, far from it; just determined. At the time I dreamt of studying English literature and then cinematography in college, so I chose math studies and biology because I didn\u2019t require exact sciences. But it was obligatory for IB so I chose the two I thought would be easier. I was so wrong. Now, I used to be really good at math somehow, could do big equations in my head without trouble, but I still didn\u2019t like it. All up until 7th grade when I argued with a teacher who told me never to question how it works and just learn it. So I started hating it and became absolutely terrible at it all of a sudden (seriously, I have trouble with counting change nowadays). I preferred interpretative subjects. And math studies and biology, ladies and gents, unlike popular belief are actually challenging. That\u2019s because math studies is designed for people who aren\u2019t going to pursue further subjects in higher education that require more advanced maths. So what do they do? Make it simpler? No, they just teach you pretty much everything one needs to know about maths if they need to encounter it in college or work. And we do go through a lot, from the chi-squared test to all types of functions. Meanwhile the higher level maths kids who made fun of us were focusing intently on very specific topics one at a time, and so had a hard workload, but a less dense one than ours. And when I asked them for help with my homework and exam practice they often couldn\u2019t solve my exercises either. That made them realise neither of us had the harder time. They were both hard in different ways. Biology is the same. I liked physics back in 8th and 9th grade, but had far too little of it to be comfortable doing solely that for 2 years. And chemistry was my nemesis that I luckily did not need for college. So biology it was. And let me tell you, it was hell. I do not know why people say biology is the easiest of the three. In physics you have complicated calculations, in chemistry there\u2019s some witchcraft going on and in biology there\u2019s thousands of words and numbers you need to know. There is an astounding amount of detail to memorise, from the classification of a random bug, to every single detail of a bunch of human organs, to the contents of every single vitamin to the precise time periods of every single human evolution. And due to my school having both the IB and the Norwegian curriculum we also had to do flora classification which was another headache. I did not give two shits for having to memorise super long scientific names of flowers, let me tell you. Now here\u2019s where strengths and weaknesses come into play. I have a hard time memorising things I\u2019m not interested in, which turns disinterest to hatred, which is a dangerous area to be in at school. But I forced myself to anyway, because I knew once done I\u2019d never need it again in my life (despite what teachers tell you about \u201creal life\u201d). Meanwhile, there was always a group of people that excelled in said subjects, but because they liked it and they wanted to learn it. It was people who wanted to be doctors, veterinarians, etc. To them it mattered. Now for me? Some hipster with no talents other than writing and editing film? I excelled in the languages and arts. And yes, that\u2019s more subjective, but I was the one people ran to so I could help them interpret literature, edit essays or structure research. And it took me a while of hating how much I was struggling with subjects I didn\u2019t like to realise it was ok, because I was good at other things. Everyone is different. In the end? I worked hard, specially with the subjects I hated, and I passed. Not all were grades I wanted, I admit, but frankly my situation was so specific and with many personal and academic problems along the way. And for what it\u2019s worth, my maths and biology grades were actually alright. Good even, for someone who was so sure I\u2019d fail. Trust me, in all likelihood, if you work hard you can pass with average or higher grades. You learn that above the curriculum there\u2019s the essential competence of being able to deal with anything. That\u2019s the power you teach yourself, not IB. IB only gives you the challenge and you take the opportunity. In the end, even though I have and still am pursuing different studies, I don\u2019t regret taking it. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Is IB hard? YES. Although it\u2019s notorious for being hard, I sometimes feel that people tend to under-estimate it\u2019s workload and believe such rumours and memes of IB to be exaggeration. I believe it to be hard for it\u2019s insane workload and the number of things that it asks us students to do. To start off, it requires you to study not only the core 6 subjects (Maths, sciences, language etc.), but also a mandatory course called TOK (theory of knowledge), an epistemology course.Out of these subjects, 3 or 4 of them will be at Higher Level, so the workload will be comparable to A-levels or AP. Not only does one do daily HW, weekly quizzes and presentations, but also has to finish an IA(individual assessment) for each subject. IAs are 1500\u20132000 word individual research paper written on any topic of our choice from the subject, meeting all the criteria of the IB, while studying for other subjects. Roughly, it should take a student between 5\u201310 hours in total to come up with a solid first draft, and extra 1\u20132 hours for revisions and polishing before submitting it to your teacher and later to IB for evaluation.Along with IAs, there is the EE(extended essay), the nightmare of everyone. The individually written research paper of about 4000 words. Combine that with mandatory CAS (creative, action and service) activities and you get an incredibly hard subjects. On top of this, there is orals for languages, internal quizzes, tests and presentations. The constant bombarding of these means that any student is continuously kept busy and working. You can\u2019t just slack off or the holistic attitude of IB will come to haunt you. Once done with all of that (and hopefully college applications), you will face the the dreaded finals. Final months of IB life is spent in a limbo of either being happy that you are almost there or being sad about the finals. Final exams are unusually long, most SL subjects have 2 parts while HL ones have 3. Each part being of 2 hours, meaning that you spent an incredible 4\u20136 hours per subject or approx. a day giving exams! The exams are obviously made tough as even a raw score of 70\u201375% usually result in a 7. Hence, in conclusion, we can agree that IB is hard but not because of it\u2019s nature and subject matter, but due to it\u2019s workload. Thus, if you are resourceful, hard working and dedicated you will do well in IB. ",
