In a real lecture, I can judge that by expressions and questions. I would very much appreciate it if a student told me those things, and especially if they told me what things I can improve. (Yes, I did ask, several times.) ",

You have to work out if the quality of the resource is poor because of a lack of technical skill, or if the lecturer is just as bad in face-to-face. As we say in IT, garbage in, garbage out. Sometimes there are better resources online to learn the skills you are attempting to acquire. If there is a way to let your lecturer know how the quality of the lectures could be improved, then by all means, tell them. After all, most of them are human. ",

Being able to understand what is written is an essential skill in life. So do develop the discipline to focus rather than drifting thru a paragraph. Ask yourself at the start of each paragraph: \u201cWhy is this being written?\u201d, and at the end of it: \u201cWhat did I learn?\u201d. Since you apparently are more adept in being able to learn interactively, and there are no tutorials or teaching assistants, try to form a study group to meet on Zoom, or Google Meet, etc., and discuss things AFTER you have understood enough to contribute. Good Luck, -bcc ",
