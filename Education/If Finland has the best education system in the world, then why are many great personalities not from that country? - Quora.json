            "answer_text": "If you are ahead of the class in Finland.. too bad for you. If you are behind the class in Finland - the chances are the teacher is going to slow down and try to help you. Most of the time it however goes by the bell curve. This has caused a lot of anxiety and criticism. The most gifted are simply frustrated and can start to do badly as they are not challenged. For me personally, maths weren\u2019t even remotely challenging at grades 1 through 9, then all of a sudden at high school the advanced maths had completely different expectations from students and the jump was difficult to make. Since you are ignored and left to your own devices when you do above average, parents thinking about the best of their children are demanding for ranking of schools. These rankings are based not on the internally used grade system but on performance at national level standardized testing. And it turns out that once your school starts to do well at the tests parents want their kids to go to that school - raising the bar for entry and thus separating the chaff, meaning the school tends to do even better in the future. Meanwhile these highly performing students are away from other schools that do similarly poorer. This however has not created a system of heightened learning at the well to do schools. Instead the schools thrive on their performance at a specific test and entire focus at these \u2018elite\u2019 schools is to teach students how to answer well and perform at the specific standardized test. So the focus is not really in learning but in algorithms or the sport of winning at a test. I studied myself at one time in a school that was ranked nationally #6, I moved there from an \u201cinferior\u201d school. The teachers were better and the students were better but the focus was not on education. The focus was on this big national sports event known as matriculation examination and \u201cbeating the crap out of everyone else\u201d. In fact the school was abysmal and I\u2019ve never before or since seen such a level of pampering of students. For instance a student came to the school, broke furniture and caused property damage to the school and then stole a vehicle. Surely a case for the police, right? But not at the elite school. The school was contacted by lawyers the same day representing the young criminal and threatening the school staff from talking of \u201cgrand theft auto\u201d and insisting that the term \u201ctaking possession without permission\u201d to be used etc. The kid was let off the hook entirely. But all was good, the school did well at the tests and kept receiving bribes.. I mean, funding from the parents. Essentially, some problems with our education system: Everyone passes, always. It is impossible not to graduate once enrolled to a school. While an appearance of having to make an effort is kept, we regularly graduate students who haven\u2019t even visited the school building for the last two years. If need be a special treatment \u2018exam day\u2019 is arranged and the student will attend it and pass a dozen exams during a single day regardless of what he or she scores. Just so the staff can mark \u2018passed\u2019 to the remaining mandatory courses and get the trouble kid to graduate.If you do above average then the teacher has to ignore you. The problem for the teacher is to try to get everyone to pass and there are 35 students in a class. That means there are at least 8 kids per class who don\u2019t pass the course but you have to pass them even if it means that they retake the same exam 5 times with the last 3 times using the same form. This takes all the effort from teachers.No one is ever kicked out under any circumstances. This means that some of our graduates haven\u2019t literally been to the school.No one asks the teachers and everyone\u2019s a winner. They just receive unending amounts of reforms passed down from above, things like direct orders to pass everyone so that no one fails or increasing the number of courses that aren\u2019t even graded anymore, meaning the kid who didn\u2019t even attend gets the same \u2018passed\u2019 mark as the best kid in the class.There is no reward for hard work. Once you hit the top grade, which can be exceedingly easy since some schools give the top grades way too easily there is no need to push yourself or go the extra mile. Sometimes the best grade can be earned consistently without doing any homework or participating in the coursework. It\u2019s all capped and people will rarely on their own volition try harder than they have to.Schools often cheat. At a high school I was in the school was breaking openly it\u2019s requirements to arrange specific level of education for students. Essentially, they claimed to be providing language education on certain level but weren\u2019t. One of the students wrote to a newspaper complaining about it and the staff were mostly annoyed that it went public rather than being sorry about having lied to the students and having failed as a school.Don\u2019t talk about the problems - it\u2019s forbidden. I was at one university of applied science\u2019s summer course where we had a foreign professor. The school was literally one of the worst in the country and in Finland we don\u2019t regard it as a university at all, \u201cuniversity of applied sciences\u201d literally means here that it\u2019s a completely different thing, similar to first degree vocational education - pre bachelor level rather than on par with bachelor level degrees. Faculty member was boasting to the professor that the school is one of the best universities in the country, I pointed out that it\u2019s not even a university and the faculty member asked for my name and wrote it up on her notebook for future repraisal. Yes, I know that I\u2019m annoying and all that with my desire for honesty and transparency, so annoying in fact that I openly also disclose threats issued against me for stating obvious commonly known facts.Finland isn\u2019t a country that produces Nobel winners. It\u2019s a country that produces a lot of Masters and Bachelors, even a lot of Doctors but to what end? Eventually Nobels may be awarded to people who\u2019ve been educated in Finland but it isn\u2019t strictly a result of having a great system that produces innovative minds. It would be that person\u2019s own achievement, not that of the education system here. Even as I\u2019m writing this a lot of companies are complaining about how graduated professionals from many schools don\u2019t know anything about the field they\u2019ve studied a degree in. Imagine a construction worker who doesn\u2019t know what concrete is. My both parents are teachers and I know a bunch of teachers in my family circle. I have also studied in 7 different schools of various types and forms in Finland, including three different high schools - my family moved around a lot. I left out a ton of specific examples so as to not cause any undue revenge for the teachers that I know. The first thing you are taught in Finnish school is how great Finnish school system is. The indoctrination to this system of belief starts immediately. Later at high school level your essay can be literally torn apart by the teacher if you criticize Finnish school system or social democracy. Write in favor of our school system and social democracy and it will help you get a better grade however. Every sentence begins with \u201cour school system is great\u201d and ends with \u201cour school system is the best in the world\u201d. This is closely related to the Finnish propaganda campaign for convincing both Finns and foreigners that Santa Claus lives in Finland and that there is no corruption in Finland.  Edit, addition Since Finland scored high at PISA, which itself represents a tiny fraction of Finnish students and is hardly applicable to be viewed as a good representation of the school system as a whole, ever since those great results Finnish education system has been in a steady state of budget cut after budget cut with politicians arguing that \u201csince it\u2019s the best a little cut won\u2019t hurt much\u201d. Now we\u2019ve had 20+ years of budget cuts and also completely impractical and destructive policy changes forced down from the top and once the children impacted by these policies start showing up at PISA Finland\u2019s rank will plummet. The most ironic thing is that foreigners coming to see what our education system is like are not seeing the education system that produced the great PISA results; they are seeing what it has become since they occurred.

            "answer_text": "Do you REALLY want to know why? Because I can tell you but it won\u2019t be pleaseant Here goes\u2026 In order to be a great academic personality or a academic leader of some sort, someone truly groudbreaking like Einstein or someone you need something special.  You need hunger and a drive for success You need motivation, or as my Dad taught me \u201cfire in the belly.\u201d The northern europeans like the Swedish or Finnish don\u2019t have this. They are happy go lucky people perfectly fine with living an average life getting a bachelors and masters and living an ordinary life. They are not successful because they don\u2019t work hard for success, there is no motivation. The Finnish school system is built to make learning fun and painless and thats the problem. Learning has to hurt, and school has to hurt\u2026 a LOT in order to increase chances of extraordinary success. This adversity experienced by students in learning builds mental toughness/ persistence/determination and grit which are all huge indicators of big success. Finland has none of this, no adversity, everything is easy so the students stay weak and are therefore content with mediocre jobs, there is not hunger to be #1, why to be because after all the world is a dainty little place with no challenges? Isn\u2019t it? There is no strive for greatness but rather a culture of complacency, creating many average workers but not many greats. The work ethic and grind is simply not there in Finland because the system is designed to be easy an fun not challenging or cutthroat. You wanted the real reason? Well this is the one, and I\u2019am surprised no one wants to talk about it. It why India, China,Singapore,Russia all lead and its why America\u2019s \u201cpainful\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d educational system creates so many noble prize winners and great scientists, authors and businessmen.
