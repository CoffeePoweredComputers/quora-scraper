At the end of the day you will find that they are just beating about the bush. For instance, Unacademy it provides and has provided free classes but you will see that most of them are of no use. I have also used online platform for study but for selective chapters. And I scored a decent mark. In math 153 in English 177. But i had taken the help of online coaching for maths. I will tell you chapter-wise which coaching is best. For CI & SI and PERCENTAGE just watch the videos of RAKESH YADAV. I can vouch for that you will get no better video on internet for these two chapter than this. TAKSHZILA ACADEMY. this is mainly for CAT . There are some video of arithmetic that has been given on this site. they are excellent. ABHINAV MATH. this is also a good site. you can watch arithmetic as well as advance portion on this. this is also very qualitative video. I am telling you this from my perspective. This might or might not work for you. ",

But, that can be worked, when you already aware of whole the syllabus and you already know that what you need to study. Because. those free classes will not provide you whole the content you want. They provide online videos for few topics only. If you want the whole syllabus classes, then you need to pay for that. If you are beginner then do not go with the free classes. Just buy some online coaching for whole SSC course. Where you will get the books, classes and other study stuff as well. I took coaching from Vidya Guru coaching center. Which was proven good decision of mine. I have studied at home only and still taking help from those content. So, buy some professional coaching instead of looking for free classes. ",

I would like to add some more things here that you know we are also run as a company and definitely we also work for profit but as marketing this time we are running this course absolutely free. this is another discussion here I can say only one thing that you will get the complete course absolutely free on our official youtube channel. thanks.

There are no hidden charges and afterwards you can continue at very affordable cost. There are many online classes available in the market which are sworn upon to be free but with all the hidden costs and amount asked later (during or after enrolling) makes them nowhere close of even being affordable leave alone the term \u201cfree\u201d. So in my personal view you should go for the online classes that give you the option to at least get a free access for a long time somewhere around a month or so just like Topline Coaching, so that you can decide how effective it is for your preparation. Best of Luck! ",
