            "answer_text": "Force is a strange word. You can force yourself to do anything if you really want to. I can give a few suggestions, but I can\u2019t force you to do anything. The first thing you should do is pick the time you want to go to sleep and the time you want to wake up and try to keep it consistent every night. Then once you determine the time you want to sleep, count back 90 minutes. The best way to make sure you feel like going to sleep at the time you want to is to make yourself as sleepy as possible before bedtime, so you need to start making yourself tired at least 90 minutes before bed. The best ways to make yourself tired, is to keep the house as dark as possible and try to avoid computer screens and electronic devices. Screens give off blue light which makes your body produce less melatonin and make it hard for you to sleep. If you really need to use one close to bed time, try and get some blue light blocking glasses. They have orange lenses that neutralize blue light and keep it from interfering with sleep. I will send you a link to them. But the best thing to do is focus on relaxing, which means you should probably not be using electronic devices close to bedtime at all. Try reading a book, or listening to a podcast, or doing some meditation. You might also want to try downloading some subliminal sounds to help you relax. Make sure your room is dark and at a comfortable temperature and avoid stimulating activity. Also, consider taking a melatonin supplement to help you. Here is the link to the blue light blocking glasses. There are also some other cool sleep products and hypnotherapy tapes that might be worth checking out. Good luck and enjoy! All Products  ",

            "answer_text": "The time that we fall asleep is completely dependent on the time we wake up in the morning, not the other way around. Example: Folks that wake up at 4:00am every morning are highly unlikely to be able to stay up past midnight on most nights. Alternatively, folks that wake up at 9:00am every morning are unlikely to be able to consistently fall asleep at say, 10:00pm every night. If your rise time in the mornings is maintained solidly seven days a week, 365 days a year, you are likely to experience predictable signs of sleepiness at a reliable time on the clock in the evening. Patients ask me all the time \u201cWhat\u2019s the best time to go to sleep?\u201d The only correct answer to that is \u201cwhen you are sleepy\u201d. It sounds like a riddle, but it is not. Rise time in the morning set all endogenous circadian functioning (i.e. internal sleep clock) including sleep-wake process. Rise time also is the primary physiological marker for: hormonal functioning, neurotransmitter release, etc. Pretty much everything. There is likely to be no need to \u201cforce yourself\u201d to go to bed on time if your sleep-wake rhythm is highly regulated by a stable rise time. The effort just causes folks to have anxiety and is really an unnecessary worry. Stay up until sleepy, but be sure to get out of bed at the same time no matter what time you feel asleep.

            "answer_text": "Set alarms on your phone. For example, if you normally going to bed at one am and usually wake up at 10 am, and you want to go to bed earlier than that, set an alarm for 12 am and 9 am so you go to bed and wake up at those times. Have this one hour adjustment for maybe 3 days and then adjust it by another hour or half hour until you get to the time you wish to wake up and go to sleep. Depending on how old you are you should plan to sleep the amount of time that is suggested for your age group. For example teenagers should get about 9 hours of sleep so a reasonable time would be go to sleep at 11 and wake up at 7 or 8. I personally go to sleep around 12 am and wake up at around 9. The key to this practice is to actaully stick to the schedule for a a good 2 weeks untill your body gets used to a new schedule. You may need to continue to have alarms but someone's your body will just naturally follow the schedule. ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty much the same way as you get up in the morning. Keep an eye on the clock/watch and if you need to set an alarm to go to bed. As you can see from my Credential, I am epileptic so need a regular sleep pattern. My medication has to be taken at pretty much the same time day and night. To that end I have two alarms in the day, one to wake me up and remember to take my day medication, and another to remind me to take my overnight medication. In the case of my night medication, I know that is about 1 1/2 hours before I actually get in to bed. This is not so much forcing, but getting in to a pattern for you sleep. In my case the sleep pattern is important to me as if I get out of the pattern to much it can make me sensitive to taking an attack. This is actually one of the reasons why I cannot deal with shift work, where I could be working at different times of the day in any given week, and therefore my sleep pattern broken. So in your case, I would suggest the two alarm clock system. ",

It might be hard in the beginning, but once you get used to doing certain things at a certain time before going to bed, your body will know that it is time to sleep, producing melatonin more actively. If I know I need to go to sleep at 11 pm, at 10 pm latest I have all my electronic devices set aside, I go to take a hot shower for 15\u201320 minutes, then apply night cream and handcream, make some herbal tea, and read a book or listen to soothing music for the next half an hour. I hope you can create a bedtime routine that will help You. For more sleep-related information please visit our Healthblog. ",

What I recommend would be to set reasonable goals and do something that makes you tired. At first, I set goals to sleep at 2 AM or earlier. Try to read a book or do something boring, it helps with making you sleepier. Then once you achieve that, try aiming for earlier than midnight, and so on. Exercising during the days and having a balanced diet will help too. ",
