            "answer_text": "Well there are not much differences between Indian and Japanese education system because both countries adopted foreign education system which are somewhat similar to each other. Japan adopted French education system while India adopted English education system. Now the point to note here that Britain and France from where India and Japanese adopted the learning system have implemented new methods and effective learning techniques over the course of time while India and Japan are stuck with same old system which Britain and France followed few decades back - This is where I think both countries are falling back. We need to change things as time progress. Change is necessay. One benefit which Japanese education system has over India is that Japanese are well versed with their culture and rituals. Now how this is related to education? Well,education is not only related to academics. You may find very few people in China as well in Japan who speaks English. Majority of the people in Japan converse daily in Japanese and they are proud of it. Not knowing any foreign language is not a barrier for them to succeed in life. This also reduces inequality and sense of complex. This is possible in Japan as Japan did not face any foreign invasion and has a single race of people. While on the other hand India faced many foreign invasion and we don't have a single race of people. Indians need to be proud about their culture, not knowing English should not be a barrier, languages like Sanskrit should be give greater importance. How can we believe in Mahabharata and Ramayana if they are called \u201cMythological stories\u201d which consist the word myth which itself means false! Something to think upon! So leaving the above two points I don't think our education system differ much than that of Japanese education system. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe the movie 3 idiots depicted the right picture of our education system. We value the marks and bookish knowledge. Mugging up and Memorising the content is being given importance. So we have engineering graduates but not the engineers similarly the other professions. The sickening other factor is our reservation system depriving the right of education to the most eligibles and in the name of social justice, a third grade student is being given seats in Universities. They are being provided free accommodation, food and even pocket money. Communist parties backed student organisations organise protest programmes asking for more comforts and increase of pocket money. These idiotic organisations never care for the improvement of education system. They back beef parties in Universities instead of education activities. Even after attaining the age of 40, these students don't leave the university campuses because they got free accommodation, free food pocket money what not many such comforts what is the need for them to do a job. Untrained teachers are being given govt.teacher jobs. I am surprised what they could contribute for the improvement of education. A ridiculous social justice system prevailed. Doing injustice to someone to do justice to some most ineligible. Sickening. A big drawback in our system. Even IITs not able to produce great engineers. Our Universities not find place in the list of 500 renowned universities on the globe. God save the country. Research has no place in the education system. We have great number of Ph.D holders but their contribution to the nation is abysmal. Lack research pushing us to import from pin to pistol from other countries even after 70yrs.of Independence. The education system any other country is better than India. Coming to the system of education in Japan, they value the values, ethics, practicality. We preach these to others but never care for it in practice. Research is their backbone so they are technologically at the forefront. They build their nation from scratch. I think I am wondering somewhere leaving the subject. ",
