            "answer_text": "The Bachelor of Audiology Speech Language Pathology (BASLP) is a 4-year degree course which includes the core subjects like Audiology, language, speech pathology and allied subjects as acoustics, psychology, linguistics etc. Students can work as speech language pathologists and audiologists. The Bachelor of Naturopathy and Yogic Science (BNYS) is a 4.5 years long medical degree which includes the study of Naturopathy and modern medicine. Having a BNYS degree enables the student to practice medicine as a General Practitioner (GP). Both are good career options, it really depends on your area of interest as they both differ very much from each other and will present you with different prospects afterwards. ",
