            "answer_text": "India is a land of coaching centers. You need coaching to get into any top college or University in India like IITs or IIMs, AIIMS or for getting jobs like IAS, IPS, IRS, IES, Railways etc. Students in India have lost trust over the education imparted in the schools and colleges and they would often join a coaching institute to supplement their learning for making their career. Many top schools today have direct collaboration from top coaching center who come and teach the students in the school itself and charge hefty amount of fee over and above the school fee. Just like coaching centers have become the learning center for admission to prestigious college, most top Indian universities and colleges in India have become glorified coaching centers. They coach the students for getting jobs, instead of developing in them the sense of learning, innovation and research. However, we can\u2019t blame even Indian universities for it, because Indian companies or Governments in India (who finally provide employment to Indian youth) don\u2019t need innovators and creative minds, because they themselves are hardly doing anything creative or innovative. They would rather prefer to import the technology from abroad than developing in house using their own people. Indian industries and Indian government need only clerks and managers, who have to manage people and not to do anything new. You will find almost all top universities in the world in the countries which are also the land of innovators and creator of knowledge. [1]  You can\u2019t have world class universities in India unless you have world class corporate and a world class government system in your country. If India wants world class universities, it must develop world class governance and world class home grown corporations. Footnotes[1] QS Have Released the World University Rankings 2019",
