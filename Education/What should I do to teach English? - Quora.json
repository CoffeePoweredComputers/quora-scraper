            "answer_text": "The global market for teaching English is very big. The demand for English language teachers around the globe is high with new positions popping up on a daily basis. However, not everyone can apply for a position in teaching English abroad and you can increase your chances of getting hired by a renowned employer with a good salary by following a couple of tips. #1 Get TEFL Certified A TEFL or TESOL certification is the first step towards a successful teaching career. If you possess a TEFL/TESOL qualification, your employer knows that you are qualified to teach and know what you are talking about. At the same time, the employer can be sure that you are serious about teaching and aren\u2019t only looking for a fun time abroad. I taught English in China and South Korea and took my TEFL with International TEFL and TESOL Training (ITTT). I recommend their 120-hour online courseas most employers worldwide require their teachers to possess a certificate of at least 100 hours of study. The course also comes with tutor support and videos and you\u2019ll have access to thousands of job offers worldwide after graduating. #2 Specializations While your basic 120-hour TEFL/TESOL certificate is the first step towards your ESL adventure abroad, you should consider adding specialized qualifications onto it. The reason for this is that the competition for well-paid positions in competitive teaching regions is incredibly high. That\u2019s why I took the 50-hour teaching English to young learners certificate and the 50-hour teaching Business English courses from ITTT as well. #3 Apply to multiple schools Once you have passed your course and have your certificate in hand, you can start applying. Be sure to apply to as many job offers as possible to be able to choose the best ones once they offer you a job. Also make sure that you look professional during the interview, e.g. dress up for a Skype interview and do research about the region and school if possible. #4 Be flexible Being flexible will get you a long way in the world of teaching English abroad. That means, get your paperwork and passport ready to be able to start a job as early as next month. At the same time, don\u2019t be set on a particular city or country but branch out and be open to other opportunities. Have fun teaching abroad! ",

            "answer_text": "I have taught ESL English to classes of teenagers, using a multi-sensory approach, woven into their areas of interest. I have taught personal, one to one English, 1-2 hours per week. Here we focused on the students particular needs, maybe related to their work. By far, the most effective method of learning English was having each student to stay in my home. Total immersion teaches a language in its cultural context, in individual lessons (3\u20135 hours per day). In addition to these formal lessons, the student has plenty of practice in speaking their mind, during breakfast, reading a daily newspaper, lunch, dinner, shopping, ordering food in a restaurant, on visits to local sights of interest, conversation with other members of the family. Sadly, not many students can afford the time or money to take advantage of this method. However, even one week of total immersion is very worthwhile. ",
