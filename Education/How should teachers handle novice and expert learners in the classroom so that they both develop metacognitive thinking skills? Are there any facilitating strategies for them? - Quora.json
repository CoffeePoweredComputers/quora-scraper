            "answer_text": "Sure: There are learning strategies which synthesize the talents of novice learners and expert learners. Step #1 Regarding the specific subject being studied, assign students to either write one sentence about the subject, and if they have trouble doing that, have the student find and copy some sentence about that subject as found on the Internet or in some book. (If a student is a novice learner, and becomes completely lost, have that student just do something simple like copy the dictionary definition or description for the subject. Eventually, that novice learner will gain the knowledge that they need. Whatever subject is studied, any Taxonomical System of Classification for the subject will be identified by the teacher and explained to the students as a category of knowledge. Step #2 Have all the sentences submitted by the students printed out on paper. Give each student a copy of this paper with the list of all of the sentences. Read the sentences aloud in class, and have the students also read the sentences aloud in class. Step #3 Assign the students to identify all of the Verbs in the list of sentences and identity all of the Nouns in the sentences. Assign the students to find 1 or 2 Synonyms if possible for the Verbs and Noun and also assign the students to find 1 or 2 Antonyms for the Verbs and Nouns. (At the beginning stages of this method of collective research and study, the teacher can contribute also to the efforts of the students. As the students share their knowledge, all will grow together and develop faster. Step #4 Assign the students to make lists of all of the Synonyms and all of the Antonyms which correspond with the Verbs and Nouns that they have identified in their common list of sentences about the subject being studied. The lists of these words are to be shared with the entire class. Step #5 Assign the students the task of writing another sentence about the subject being studied. Collect all of these sentences and print them also on paper and give all students a copy of the sentences. What does this accomplish? (a) All students will know and understand a common vocabulary. (b) All students will be familiar with the same basic concepts. (c) All students will recognize and be conversant concerning the same idea. (d) The novice learners can be guided in their development by the learners and moreover, the novices can begin to contribute to the efforts of the expert learners rather than simply being lost. Communal efforts like this rapidly accelerate all learning. Moreover, the same vocabulary and sentences used in one specific assignment, can be adapted and applied in the next assignment. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t studied metacognition in formal courses, so I will go with what background I have in areas related to the mind and the dictionary sense at face value. You are asking about a highly developed cognition, which has reached the end and final stages of its development, or what mental process is beyond or past cognition. Insofar as learners have to apply cognition to work through problems and learn, and intelligence tests examine this mental function for qualifying gifted programs, you want students to be developing skills that at least show the behaviors and habits of good students. While some may have natural abilities and advantages in the language and school, some may have to work harder and be taught and instill their own methods for performing in school. An expert learner and novice learner when in the same class, is not as likely because the more advanced students are often placed into such classes ahead of their same age peers. And students who have a higher learning curve, will usually proceed faster and more comprehensively, when learning a subject in the academic ladder. Those who become experts as in the classroom, should be teaching the novices and helping them, as they will become the same experts in occupation or academics, who are leading the learning in the classrooms later on. Novice learners in this sense, may be able to develop learning skills and natural aptitudes for learning while in the same school, however, they have to overcome that curve in developing a methodology for learning, acquisition of knowledge, and sharing that with people in their class.
