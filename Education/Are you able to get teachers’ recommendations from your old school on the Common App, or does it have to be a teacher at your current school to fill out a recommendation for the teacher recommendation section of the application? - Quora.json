Here\u2019s how - download Mascot, search the college you\u2019re applying for and join the groups! Current college students: welcome to start your own group and help answer questions about your college! - Yes, you are able to invite your old teachers because the Commonapp does not verify if they are old/current teachers for you. Simply input their name and official school email to invite them. However, it is recommended that you invite teachers from your current school for the two academic references. This is because they are probably more familiar with your current performance. Their title/email will also match your transcript, which will make your application package look more coherent and up to date. Another idea is you can choose to invite teachers from your old school as supplemental references. Most colleges allow one additional reference, some allow up to three. You can easily check that in the recommendation sections of each school. Hope this helps - good luck! ",
