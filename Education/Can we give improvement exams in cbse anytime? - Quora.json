After filling the form,you will have to wait for a year(which is like preparation period for exam) and in march you will receive your admit card at your mentioned address,(in case you didn't get it by post in reasonable time say before 2 weeks of exam you should visit cbse office along with your acknowledgment receipt.) you will be allotted with a center school where your will give your exam same as regular student and your result will also be declared on the same date as of regular so there is nothing like you can give improvement at anytime.
