            "answer_text": "Hmm, isn't that strange. If being outside was so enjoyable to the members of Generation X, than why in the hell did they condition their children to stay inside and give them all the luxuries of living in a first-world country? Air-conditioning, video games, cell phones, what's the point in going outside when the life inside is so much better?! These technologies and products were considered expensive during their time, but with innovation these products became inexpensive and available for nearly every household in America, even the supposedly poor and impoverished! It's not like Generation Y or Generation Z don't enjoy playing outside. I remember a few years ago before my teen years I was always outside. I played with some of the local kids and went out in the snow. I played video games here and there, but you'd find me outside on my own accord multiple times throughout the month. But things change. Now, I rarely ever go outside. I moved from a neighborhood that I decently enjoyed into a neighborhood where all the families live down a hill. And it was too late. I became more anti-social. More of an introvert. I loved Call of Duty, Gears of War, Halo, all my PC games. To hell with stretching my comfort zone and making conversation with the other highschool kids down the hill! Besides, I've never much enjoyed talking to other teenagers. I was never on the same level with them. To me, I was always one step ahead. Thinking of the future. Personally, I bet most of these kids don't care what happens now or forever. Generation X wasn't the last to enjoy playing outside, but they were the first to ruin the enjoyment of the outside world. And not even them, I place more blame on the Boomers. I enjoy playing outside when I do go out of my comfort zone. I've been to a park in another town with a friend and we enjoyed several hours of playing in the open field, playing kickball with a basketball, playing in the jungle gym, playing on the merry-go-round! You can\u2019t find those anymore! Too dangerous for the kids! Yet, we enjoy those damn things\u2026. I've noticed this often. Parents overreact when their children get hurt. And yes, children get hurt. They bawl. They cry. And for some damn reason, we rub off our tears, we brush off the pain, and again, for some damn reason, we go out to play again! And we play the same thing that caused us injury in the first place! For example, a child will play on a jungle gym. He eventually gets to the top. He cheers. He gasps. And than he falls and hits the ground. He cries. He rubs his head. He rubs his knees. Mom begins consoling the child. Mom sits him on a bench. She begins calling the mayor of town to complain and bring an end to jungle gyms locally, no, nationally! And here's this kid, with red eyes from crying and two dirty knees, getting off the bench and running towards the jungle gym again. And getting to the top, again! And than he loses balance, again, and says, \u201cNo!\u201d He holds on and regains balance and screams, \u201cYes!\u201d He looks over to his Mom, but she doesn't notice. She's too busy talking to the United States Department of Wussification. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think I would say that. As a Gen Xer I enjoyed playing outside a lot, but I had younger friends who\u2019d be classified as older Millennials who also enjoyed it as well. I still see young kids in my neighborhoods seeming to enjoy playing outside. I know with the advent of social media and portable video games, it seems that kids would rather stay inside. And yes, it is a bit disappointing to see this.. but one of the above commenters (William Harrison?) had some good points toward the end of his answer about people worrying that the simple pleasures of playing outside seem to be endangered nowadays.
