Here a sample of the torture millions of kids experience each day: Every student is expected to meet a defined \u201cstandard.\u201d Like machines!The grading system is a top-down grading system. Like a machine, you\u2019re expected to perform at peak performance.Such 100% performance was somehow, someday, someplace, determined possibly 100 years ago by some disrupted Industrial Age \u201ctest-god.\u201dThis grading system kills all natural talents of the kids. What this system is teaching them is to comply and submit themselves to the determined \u201cstandard.\u201dLike a machine; performance is pre-established and must be met.Anything under the pre-established standards you are considered an \u201cUNDER PERFORMER.\u201dThis is a depressing push-down torture!The current system KILLS ALL CREATIVITY and diversity of thought.The standards are pre-set!You must obey the pre-established standards just to get by.Kids are constantly stressed and worried to satisfy the \u201ctest-gods\u201d instead of helping them thrive on their God given talents.Kids and teenagers are at a critical developing stage in life.Their grades is what the world is telling them who they are in the world.Do good \u2014 Kids are being told they are super-human. - (False!)Do bad \u2014 Kids are being told they\u2019re losers and \u201cworthless.\u201d (Also false!)This fear-based system also affect kids social groups.You either belong to the top-class.Or you belong to the \u201clow-class\u201d demotivated losers! You tell me\u2026 ARE THEY HAVING ANY FUN? ",
