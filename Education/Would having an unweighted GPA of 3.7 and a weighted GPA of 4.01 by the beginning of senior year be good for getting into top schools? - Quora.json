            "answer_text": "Short Answer: Should be good, and those are the scores I had when I went to UC Berkeley.  Long Answer\u2026. Getting into top schools is about more than just grades, it is the entire picture that you present to the admissions committee. That being said a lot of people will try and tell you that this GPA isn\u2019t all that great, but 3.7 (unweighted) and 4.0 (weighted) are exactly the scores that landed me admissions to top schools like the Ivy League & UC Berkeley. I would have to say though that I am sure it was not just my scores that got me into the Universities, but instead was my entire application. If you want to go to a good TOP university you need to put a lot of effort into your application. Just as you put effort into getting good grades, you need to take a moment and put that same amount of hard work into your application. Start with the personal statement. This is by far the most important portion of your application because it tells the schools the type of person you are and what you want to do with your education. Show them how you are a good student, but also why you deserve to go there. What makes you special and how will you make the school better.Make sure your application is whole and not fragmented. Lots of people think that the application is a bunch of sections, but the truth is that the application is more than just sections. You need to treat each part as though it is the personal statement. Use your activities, volunteer work, and experience in life to finish the personal statement story and build on it. Help them arrive at the entire picture of you.Those are just a couple quick and important tips to get into the Ivy League and Top Universities. Lastly, don\u2019t stress too much about what college you go to because in the end it is what you do that matters not where you go. Like the answer give it an UPVOTE! You can see me walk you through how I did it HERE if you want. ",
