            "answer_text": "My first thought is no. People are too stupid for that. If such a system were put in place, it would need to be like unemployment counseling. They ask what you want to go to school for and if it\u2019s not a growth industry, you're told try again. There would need to be stiff penalties for non -payment. Prison style. People would treat it as a gift and not pay it back otherwise. Would said loans also cover vocational training? Either way. Our current situation is ridiculous. Back in the day, before you decided what to do with your life, you learned about life first. You did research. You investigated. Is my desired area of study realistically going to be there and be able to support me, or is this a \u2018status' degree. Of course back in the day, people appreciated money and would never knowingly waste hundreds of thousands of dollars, and years of our lives, just to show someone we're the \u2018right' kind of person (unless the \u2018right' kind of person happens to be the one with real world knowledge that will help my employer). College is to learn something that will pay you. Go ahead and learn all this crap you perhaps want to know, but nobody will pay you. Learn something people need, actually need. Don't go for anything with no practical application. Have \u2018social justice' concerns? Fine. But get your degree in something practical or you'll starve. You can't help the weak and oppressed by being weak and oppressed. ",

            "answer_text": "No For two reasons: First, the feds pumping extra money into the system to allow people to go to school has an inflationary aspect. That is the schools are not the ones on the hook to pay the loans back and thus they can raise their prices and charge exhorbitant amounts for people to get degrees that will never be able to pay back the loans Second, the taxpayers should not be on the hook for bad decisions made by students. If they want to get a degree in Gender Studies and pay $200K for it, that\u2019s their business. But asking the taxpayer, who will likely never get paid back, to pay for that indulgence is a bad idea ",
