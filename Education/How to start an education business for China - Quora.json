THE CHINESE EDUCATION MARKET IS PROJECTED TO DOUBLE TO $450 BILLION BY 2020 The Chinese education market is projected to double to $450 billion by 2020 - Marketing China FAMILIES PRIORITIZE EDUCATION Surveys regularly show that Chinese families prioritize spending on education ahead of any other area, even above real estate and retirement savings. The McKinsey Global Institute projects the country to spend 12.5 percent of its overall consumption growth on education for those under 30 over the next 15 years. Chinese culture is now incredibly results driven so consumption growth in this area is based on improved labour and innovation fueled by the Chinese state. In addition to these figures according to ICEF Monitor, almost half of a Chinese 20 year old\u2019s per capita consumption is spent on education, to put this into perspective for an American this is less than a quarter. These expenditures are significant and set to continue to rise with the burgeoning Chinese middle class, particularly on the east coast of the country. FOREIGN INVESTORS FACE CHALLENGES IN CHINA Despite the keenness of Chinese consumers to spend on education, foreign investors face a number of challenges when entering the market: \u2013 The Chinese government are suspicious of foreign activity when it comes to education, they strictly control the curriculum and laws and regulations can change to the detriment of foreign investment. \u2013 Foreign participation is not allowed in compulsory education spanning ages 6-15, and most types of educational facilities require establishing a joint venture with a Chinese partner. This is a necessity but it can be costly and difficult to find a trustworthy partner. \u2013 The Chinese education system\u2019s fixation on standardized examinations restrict what forms of education are in demand for students below the tertiary level. There is arguably less space for innovation. Despite these limitations, there is still a significant demand for foreign education services as highly competitive consumers value the quality of overseas expertise, western institutes are highly respected and admired. With the right business strategy in China educational investment can be facilitated, state laws are also relaxing in recent years making collaboration increasingly easier. ",
