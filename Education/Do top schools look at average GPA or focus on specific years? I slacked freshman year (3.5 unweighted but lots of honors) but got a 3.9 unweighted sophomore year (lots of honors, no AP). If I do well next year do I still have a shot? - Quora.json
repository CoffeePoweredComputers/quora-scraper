Although an increasing trend in grades is more favorable than a declining trend in grades, in terms of GPA, you still won\u2019t be able to compete with the many 4.0 applicants that apply to top schools. The good thing is grades aren\u2019t everything. There are other parts of your application that are arguably more important than a perfect 4.0. Academic RigorIntellectual CuriosityDemonstrated commitment to a passionLeadership experienceEtcHowever, you will need to do exceptionally well in other parts of your application to make up for your \u201csub-standard\u201d GPA. It\u2019s not the time to slack off on your grades. You still have a chance, but realize that your GPA won\u2019t be doing you any favors. So you\u2019ll just need to let yourself shine somewhere else. ",

All schools that use holistic review to select their freshmen evaluate the high school transcript for academic readiness, the ability to take college courses. The evaluation includes GPAs, how the GPAs were calculated, the classes taken, and the high school attended. GPA alone never determines admittance. ",
