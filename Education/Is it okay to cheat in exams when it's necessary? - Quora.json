            "answer_text": "Generally, I agree with the other answers - it's never necessary, full stop. That includes immediate necessity. Yes, maybe you could have sought more help earlier, or studied harder, but now it's too late (or maybe you did all that, and feel it's not enough) - your score will be horrible unless you cheat. It's still not necessary. However, you're probably feeling a lot of pressure, which might redefine \"necessary\" from necessary for survival (or some similar extreme) to necessary for some lessor goal you really care about. Perhaps it's \"necessary\" in order to stay on the dean's list, or graduate summa cum laude. All the students below you would find that a pretty weak excuse (and probably those above as well - but thinking that only highest honors count for anything is demeaning for all those who worked hard but weren't as successful). Missing out on some honor isn't nearly the big deal you think it is. My undergraduate GPA was pretty good, but I took it off my resume for every job I applied for after college. Most employers really don't care. Perhaps it's \"necessary\" to maintain a scholarship you \"need\" in order to stay in school. Most likely you can get other aid, though it might be very costly for you. It might all be loans, that you'll be paying off for years. I would urge you to consider the potential costs, though - you might be kicked out of school with all the loans you've already accrued, and no degree to help you pay them off. If your family has co-signed your loans they'll also be on the hook if you can't pay - potentially causing even more damage. It might hurt to lose your scholarship, but it isn't nearly the big deal you think it is (despite all those headlines about crazy student loan debt - most who graduate are well able to pay it off with their increased earnings, while most defaults are for smaller loans because the student dropped out and couldn't even make payments on those). Maybe it's \"necessary\" to not get put on academic probation, or be kicked out of school. This is getting progressively harder, but I'd still argue it's not necessary to cheat. You'll survive either way, and you are already on the brink and you may actually be better off getting kicked out and going somewhere else you can be more successful. I've known students who struggled at one school, been put on probation or suspended for academic reasons, and then went on to be much more successful at another school. The school was a bit lower in the rankings, but doing very well in a \"worse\" school is nearly always way better than doing very poorly at a \"better\" school. Not just in terms of your appeal to recruiters (doing on campus recruiting will be much easier with the former), but also in how much information you're able to retain (hard to synthesize knowledge when you feel like you're drowning) and how much interaction you can get with those around you (a huge part of the value of an education is the socialization, and it's hard to get that if you need to work 24x7 just to stay in the environment). As with grades, most employers don't really care too much where your degree is from - and they care even less the more you advance in your career (plus you suddenly have two networks of friends - it's not like your friends quit caring about you if you need to transfer). It can be helpful to think about your counterfactual outcomes. If you don't cheat, how bad will the outcome be if you fail to achieve your goal, and how will you respond to that? Every time I've gone through that thought exercise I've realized that what I'm afraid of isn't nearly as scary as I think it is (that goes for trying new things, taking risks, and all kinds of other things besides cheating). Try not to think of it as just above or just below some imaginary line (which probably barely matters anyway), which can make the effect seem enormous compared to what the effect really is. If you're hoping for a B-, a C+ can seem devastating - but the effect on a GPA is virtually unnoticeable (it may not even change your GPA at the 0.01 level). Even an F will have a very small effect on your GPA - much smaller than you probably realize. If you have straight As, and a single F, your GPA drops less than 0.03 (assuming typical course loads and credit requirements) - and if you have fewer As the effect is smaller (if you have a B average, an F drops it by a bit over 0.02). And the effect on your life will be even smaller than that!  If that isn't enough to realize that missing your goal isn't such a big deal, think about the outcome if you cheat, and how much harder it would be to respond to that. The immediate outcome is much worse, and you have fewer resources to respond to it (much harder to transfer, for example). ",

            "answer_text": "Cheating in Exams or test and with regard to any level (school or college)can either be wrong or be correct. It all depends on the situation and character of the person who is doing so. And life is too big, you cannot limit it to only morals and values and neglect the realistic approach and practicality of things and also the vice versa. There is a need to balance both the ends and one should not blindly believe what others say. We have our minds, we can analyze the situation ourselves, we can figure out what will harm us and what will benefit us. I have realized after going through many comments on the topic that most of the people are just seeing the matter like it is right or wrong matter but An act in itself isn't wrong or right, the circumstances prevailing such an act and the character of the person committing such an act determines the nature of that act I.e. it is right or wrong. I do believe that it is not wrong to cheat in exams or test if you have studied for the examination hard and well and just for the sake of confirmation you ask someone whether what you are thinking is right or just confirming the answer of an MCQ question if it is somewhat ambiguous. In this case I do not believe that the person doing so have done something wrong. And if due to some unavoidable circumstances one is not able to study for a particular examination there is nothing wrong here to cheat because if u will not do such, you will score low Marks or u may even fail. But if u cheat u can save that day, Now a question may arise that,you can pass that examination with the help of cheating but what about the knowledge you missed? This is where the character of the person comes in play. One can simply complete the syllabus of that examination later on, and this way he can acquire knowledge also and he is also saved from the failure in the examination. It is a win-win situation,there is no loss in this situation. But yes, you should posses such self discipline and wisdom. What would have happened if one had not cheated on that day, maybe he could have got low Marks or maybe he could have even failed the examination and as a result he would have to study that subject again wasting time and energy. But remember, this situation is applicable only in case of utmost urgency and unavoidable circumstances of the student due to which he was not able to study. Cheating is wrong when you had the time for studying and no emergency was there but out of laziness you didn't study at all and Now you are entirely relying on your friend that he will help you. In this situation it is wrong If this is your tendency because you didn't put any efforts at all and you are wasting your time in silly things. But these things are just the scratch of surface. From our birth we all are taught that cheating is wrong, lying is wrong etc etc. But these things are just textual or spoken and nobody including our teachers do so. Most of the schools give the students good Marks in internals in 10th and 12th boards just to get the better results so that their school is being recognized after the results of their students. Is this not cheating? Where are the morals now? And see yourself that education system particularly in India value your Marks and not Your knowledge, and is any teacher, institution ready to give you extra Marks for your Honesty and ready to deduct Marks for the dishonesty of others. The answer is No, but why No? If morals are of such immense importance then act accordingly, why they do not reward the honest man and why the institutions and universities depict themselves as the best even when everyone knows about the statements to be false and misleading. Is this not cheating? Where are morals now? There are many useless and irrelevant subjects which a student is taught which is not even concerned with his field and adds the burden of students especially in colleges and universities. But a student cannot do anything. He has to study them all to complete his degree course. One may ask if they are useless then why one is concerned about Marks in that subject, The Answer is because this system value Marks because they will be shown in CV but the knowledge of that subject is useless and irrelevant in one's professional life. What about the wrong which happens with an honest student if he do not cheat, majority of the people will always cheat no matter you are doing it or not. It may happen that the honest guy may score low but the dishonest ones pass with flying colors. Moreover,that examination and subject will never come again, it is gone now and the subject is irrelevant in the professional life of both the honest and dishonest guy. Who is in advantage here? The answer is The dishonest guy.And who will care about it in the long run? Nobody. It is to be noted that it is not necessary that the person who cheat in exams is dishonest and selfish and the person who do not cheat is an honest and virtuous man. It is just \u201cone act\u201d and that one act will not define you, what is your behavior generally will define you as a good or bad person . One can always make the things correct which is seen as cheating by others by adopting a right mindset and attitude about things. I urge the reader to see anything in its totality and not just the act. Dear Reader, please think and reflect. ",
