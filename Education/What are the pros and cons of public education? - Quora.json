            "answer_text": "Public education simply means that children can get a basic education regardless of the situation at home. That is the main benefit. Our economy demands a certain level of basic skills and public education means each child can obtain those skills regardless of the economics of their parents. The cons or as I would define it as the complications to public education is that all children, regardless of their attributes, IQ, and readiness for learning, have to be accepted into the public school. This can create complications for teachers, can slow down the progress of gifted students, and even cause behavior issues in the classroom. Most teachers realize this complication and have developed strategies to compensate. Another complication is the lack of parental involvement in their children's education. If parents are not motivated to want their children to learn, this can hamper the child's progress. This is especially true in public schools because, since the parent has no \u201cskin in the game\u201d so to speak, their attitude can become one of entitlement instead of concern for their child's progress. We see this sense of entitlement in the government housing projects, those living there allow the buildings and grounds to deteriorate due to this entitlement syndrome. It's one thing for physical structures to be ignored, it is much worse when children's education suffers. ",

            "answer_text": "Public education has somehow become a euphemism for dysfunction, which is a decidedly one-sided perspective. Since the topic of education has so many points where we could potentially begin and end, understand that I have opted for the most abbreviated response so that we can all get back to our day. I think these folks show us the beneficence (pros) that a public education can provide -  Jennifer Aniston graduated from New York City's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School;  Warren Buffet graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C.;  Larry King New York City's Lafayette High School;  Oprah Winfrey went to two different high schools in Wisconsin\u2014Lincoln High School and Nicolet High School; Now, for the \u201ccons:\u201d Chronic under-funding - Too often, low-income students end up in schools with the lowest funding, fewest supplies, the least rigorous curriculum, and the oldest facilities and equipment, according to the U.S. Commission on Civil RightsBesieged with pressures from all quarters - Schools Look to Parents and Communities To Help Reduce Student StressPrivatization - https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Murray_Privatization%20Caucus%20Memo.pdfThe bounds of this issue seem limitless, but I hope the above framing helps to shift one\u2019s focus away from the deficit perspective which is often inspired by the very forces that conspire to undermine the potential of a great public education.
