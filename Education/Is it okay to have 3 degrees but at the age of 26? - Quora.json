            "answer_text": "Yeah! It's completely fine as far as you are dedicated to your work. Otherwise there's no meaning in being jack of all and master of none. If you have three degrees it's well and good but choose any one profession, that's what I would prefer. Because having too many egss in one basket may result in damage to all the eggs. So better not to handle too many professions at the same time but to concentrate on any one career. Having multiple degrees will help you out in many ways. For example if you have pursued MBA and you are planning to start a business of your own then it's perfect. But if you also have any other degree, for example - a certificate in any health course, you can implement that knowledge in your business by relating the business to health sector, for eg: you can start a wellness centre where you can implement both your MBA and health sector skills. Which will make your wellness business different from others and will also help in cost cutting. ",
