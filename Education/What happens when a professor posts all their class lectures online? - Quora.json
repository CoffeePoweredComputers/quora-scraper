            "answer_text": "Basically, when I post lectures, it further dampens participation in class.    Students will either not attend class, or sit in class to make attendance, and then pay no attention in class.  Even if I tell students that the PowerPoint lecture is just an outline and to get the full meaning of the topic they need to come to class and be involved, they still do this.   I came to realize that most students are not interested in the knowledge per se, and instead with getting a grade for the class.  If the lecture notes get them to their bottom line, they would prefer to skip all the niceties of sitting in class. ",
