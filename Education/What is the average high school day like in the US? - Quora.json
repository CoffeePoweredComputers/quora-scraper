            "answer_text": "I get up at around six thirty, and get dressed, eat breakfast, and get ready. At 7:20 I leave the house and drive to school which is about thirty minutes away. My school starts at eight so I wait ten or so minutes for it to start. My periods are an hour long and I have eight of them, in this order (this is my Monday schedule.) AP Geometry (8\u20139)French II (9\u201310)Art (10\u201311English (11\u201312)Lunch (11\u201312)Biology (12\u20131)Free period (1\u20132)Health (2\u20133)Then I get home at around three thirty. I go on social media for a bit, eat a quick snack, and then start my homework at four. Homework varies a lot so some days I\u2019ll have an hour, and some days I\u2019ll have three hours. On Mondays I usually only have an hour and a half, so I finish at about 5:30. Then I usually watch YouTube or a TV show while painting or drawing until dinner at around seven. Then after dinner I do whatever, or on heavier homework days I finish up homework after dinner, and then I go to bed at ten or eleven. Note: Monday is my easiest day, so on Wednesday and Thursday I often find myself going to bed at midnight or one and waking up late, and then doing homework for hours, sometimes even four hours. ",

            "answer_text": "This is what my typical day looks like : 6:00 AM : I'll wake up and start getting ready to go to school 6:45 AM : Off to school 7:00 AM : Gym class. One hour of weight training 5 days a week 8:00 AM : A 'zero' period of sorts. This is when attendance is taken and important stuff is announced 8:40 AM : First period starts. Each period is 40 mins long and there is a 5 min passing period in between each period to allow everyone to get to whatever class they want to. My first 4 periods are science on Mondays and Wednesdays. On other days I have my first science class during the first period and the second one during the third period. Period 2 and 4 are free on those days. 11:40 AM - 12:25 PM : My lunchtime can vary from 40 mins to 80 mins depending on the day. This is when I hangout with friends, catch up on some homework, study or even occasionally work out some more. 12:30 PM : History class. Boring material but great teacher.  1:15 PM : Another free period (seven). I typically take a nap during this period 1:55 PM - 3:25 PM : My last 2 periods of the day are Math and English. I'm exhausted by the end of English class and generally head home but on some days I have clubs I go to. This is my typical day in high school. I can't speak for the rest of the country, but this is what high school in Illinois looks like for me.  ",
