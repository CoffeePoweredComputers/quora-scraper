            "answer_text": "You cannot earn a degree in aerospace engineering at USAFA. You\u2019ll have to choose between aeronautical and astronautical engineering. This distinction alone is an indicator of the extra depth you\u2019ll get in your chosen discipline compared to many other programs. I graduated (barely) with an Astro degree in 2004. I took a few Masters level Astro classes at CSULB while I was working in El Segundo, and I was shocked at what I experienced. The undergraduate Astro program at USAFA was basically the same material as the 500 courses at Long Beach, but the Long. Each program was inferior in every aspect (professors, class size, labs, intelligence of classmates, etc\u2026). The USAFA program is world class. Ten years ago, the USAFA Astro degree was more unique than it is today. There are other equally strong programs at USC, UT, Georgia Tech, and I assume others. Don\u2019t go to USAFA for the degree. Go there if you\u2019re called to serve and get the amazing degree while you\u2019re at it (and for free) ",

The US Air Force is the absolute pinnacle of the craft. At some point you may want a graduate degree, which is where those second tier schools like MIT and Cal Tech might come in. Good luck!
