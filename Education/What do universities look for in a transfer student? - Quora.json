            "answer_text": "There are three types of transfers: Transferring down. A friend of mine was a freshman at MIT and doing well in all of his courses. However, he was disillusioned with the career opportunities. He easily transferred to a \u201csafety college\u201d near his home town and was the valedictorian for his graduating class and then went on for a PhD in a top research university and a long career in clinical psychology (e.g. why MIT didn\u2019t fit\u2026..)Therefore, if you are real Catch, then the colleges will go out of their way to help you transfer. Being a top athlete who is disillusioned with her/his NCAA D-1 college and wants to help another college to a national championship is another good attribute to haveTransferring laterallyYou couldn\u2019t get into your state\u2019s top public university, and attend a near-by out-of-state public university. You buckle-down get all A grades and then become a sophomore at your state\u2019s college, because a lot of drunk and drugged freshmen dropped out and the college needs more bodies. Win-win-win, as you pay less for a good education and have maturedTransferring UpYou are at a community college on Long Island, have completed two years and want to be a junior at a nice university like Cornell: Bruce Arena - Wikipedia e.g. you are a sports super-star who was a gem in the rough when you started college but are now a precious commodityYou have a Unique reason for being at the college where you currently are, and for wanting to transfer up to that better collegeAnd you need a Team that will include at least one if not two of your professors who will state that you almost walk-on-water at your current college and need to try deeper water.In each of those scenarios you will find what the colleges are looking for: A great student who will bring something Extra to that college. Easy. ",

            "answer_text": "The accepting university looks for transfers when their own matriculants take unexpected leaves of absence (or so I gather). While the university will not know who these people will be in advance, but they must \u201cknow\u201d through experience they can usually expect \u201cx\u201d number of transfers. I would hope they expect at least competancy and hope for additions that will improve the school. Transfers bring enthusiasm and many positive qualities (like perseverence). Some 4 year programs have relationships with community colleges that feed into their undergraduate pool. An example of this situation is Orange County Community College, where young me and women apply to in order to get an Associate\u2019s degree. This sometimes serve as a jumping point for students whose high school performance in high school were less than spectacular, and only improved once they understood the value of doing well in school. So, once these poor scoring individuals got \u201cserious\u201d they want to get a 4 yr Bachelor\u2019s degree. They can apply to finish the last 2 years in say Cal State Fullerton. It\u2019s an affordable way of accomplishing one\u2019s goal of obtaining a Bachelor\u2019s if you factor that CCs are bargains compared to private alternatives. Hope this helps. ",
