            "answer_text": "It is, if you think it is. Depends on whether you feel Called. Otherwise you\u2019ll be griping and moaning that you never get any interesting cases, all you see are little kids coming in with otitis media, hear patients grouching that they have to wait too long for their appointment, while you\u2019re still tired because you went to surgery with an emergency gallbladder surgery after the patient wouldn\u2019t schedule it in a non-emergent time after the gallstones were found on a scan. Whew. Makes me tired just thinking about it. Emotionally, was medicine worth it for you, you ask? As you see from my bio, I\u2019m not a doctor, but let me say this. you can make a difference in people\u2019s lives and probably save some lives, depending on what kind of doctor you become. My daughter knew a young man I\u2019ll call Jim who worked for his uncle and didn\u2019t have health insurance. When Jim began having abdominal pain and stomach trouble, he didn\u2019t see a doctor coz he couldn\u2019t afford it. This kept getting worse. Finally, in awful pain and unable to keep food down several days, he let his dad talk him into going to the E.R. They did labs and scans, and poor Jim was found to have Crohn\u2019s disease with a section of necrotic intestine. He was so dehydrated that they had to push fluids on him for 24 hours before they could do surgery. The surgeon\u2019s op report stated how copiously they irrigated his bowels with warm saline after the operation to try to avoid infection. Here\u2019s where I come into the picture, transcribing the surgeon\u2019s notes at the first checkup following surgery. As he described how Much Better young Jim looked, I could hear the happiness and pride in his voice, beyond the words he used. He saved that kid, and he might have gone unpaid for his work except that the kid\u2019s father signed the paperwork and promised he would see to it. I\u2019ve no doubt that the surgeon and O.R. team will never forget the case, and of course Jim and his parents will remember this forever. So, yeah, sometimes a big emotional payoff comes in. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite the knowledge, the status, and the service to mankind\u2026my favorite part of my medical career is the involvement with people\u2019s lives. It is an involvement that is earned. The depth is contingent upon the effort exerted. Recognition of your position in a process that helps the patient happens when it's ready to happen. The reward of belonging to their family, at some level, was a salve to my own emptiness that was a persisting feeling in my own character. Once the rigors of training are all over, you'll gain a perspective you will use to reflect upon your training and agree you chose wisely. Now let me share a story. When I was a fourth-year medical student, I did an elective rotation in oncology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, in Denver. My father had a friend and colleague, William Robinson, who ran a clinic for the treatment, and research of Melanoma. This doctor had a son who was my age, John, also in medical school. In return for the favor of teaching me, the son, his girlfriend(soon to be wife) and her sister(all three medical students) came to my father's office in Boulder, for a month of training in Internal Medicine. Incidentally, the four of us became fast friends. My father had done his residency in 1959-1961 at UCHSC, and I had read a commentary he wrote and had published in a medical journal several years after his residency ended. It was in the vein of, the ivory tower of academia misses the point of taking care of people, and that is why he had opted for starting a private practice instead of staying in the hospital/research setting. Now, with that as a background, I had an amazing experience at my time in the tower of white...the doctor was well-published and I was about to learn the secret to the huge list of published articles that some doctors produce on their resume. Me and the other student on the service, were each given the assignment of producing a piece of original research, and getting it published by a journal. Considering the fact that his name would be the lead investigator on whatever I discovered as worthy of publishing, he was getting a pretty good deal. In my zeal for doing a good job, I had conjured up an idea, in a dream I had, believe it or not. My paper was to test the hypothesis that melanoma, a skin cancer influenced by hormones such as melatonin, estrogen and prolactin, would have a better outcome in women who got pregnant. If this turned out to be true, what a blessing would come from conception. I would be the savior of dejected woman, blessing their lives with the wonderful news of their imminent improvement at the hands of a man's wonderful care and physiologic panacea. A little absurd. Hey, it was a dream. The basis of my scientific theory, was a piece of information I had learned in an undergraduate endocrinology course at Colorado State University. Evidently, there is a prohormone in our body, that is cleaved by proteolytic enzymes into two active hormones. One acts like an anti-prolactin to suppress lactation and is chemically simillar to dopamine. It is produced by pharmaceutical companies to suppress lactation, in various clinical situations. Bromocriptine is the product for the mass market, aka Parlodel. Dopamine stimulation is a pretty interesting topic, but for some other time. The other is melatonin, the hormone that influences the color in our skin. It was my understanding of pregnant women's skin changes that started me to wonder. We all know a pregnant woman glows, but really there is a melasma, or mask of pregnancy, that is a darkening of the skin across the cheeks, sometimes like a dark rouge application, sometimes a burst of dark freckles. But, also, the areolas of the nipples darken. And the line of skin from the naval to the pubic symphisis becomes dark, the linea negra. Since these two hormones are linked, could the suppression of anti-prolactin hormone caused by pregnancy, simultaneously suppress melatonin production and reduce melanocyte stimulation in melanoma? After I told Dr. Robinson what I planned to research, he revealed that there was a cancer registry. This was a list of patients that the clinic had treated that I could tap into to review different characteristics and create a sample size of patients to support my hypothesis with real cases. Unfortunately, after reviewing the women who had got pregnant after being previously diagnosed with melanoma, about one-third got worse, one-third got better, and one-third had not change. Tommy Rot! But, as an incidental finding, one of the woman's name was a little too familliar to me. And there it was...the wife of my friend at medical school back in Iowa. We had met as partners of the same cadaver in the anatomy lab in my first-year of medical school. I had been to his house and met his wife, and his cute daughter. There were times when I had asked if they were ever going to have any more kids, and the only answer I got was, \"no, we're done\". Which never really made me think of anything, until I learned about her melanoma. The amazing thing about finding her was...I was in Denver, and they lived in Des Moines. So, I felt a little eerie about stumbling on this secret. And I have kept it to myself, until today. ",
