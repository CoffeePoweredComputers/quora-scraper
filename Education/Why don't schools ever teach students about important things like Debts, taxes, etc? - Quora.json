            "answer_text": "It depends on the country and culture. In the United States we used to do this until the No Child Left Behind Act was passed. Actually knowledge keeps redoubling so often that non-essentials are not taught. What is taught are things that the states dictate as required as does the national and local requirements. These areas are not considered to be important enough anymore as stress needs to be on the four core classes and college prep classes. Family and Consumer Science classes (home economics) is one of the several courses which used to be offered which taught these concepts. But changes because of legislation and court cases have resulted in a lot of local budgets having to spend more money in areas such as special education as well. So non-essential classes have been cut and unfortunately the life skills we used to teach are non-essentials. This even included things like accounting, bookkeeping, banking, income taxes, and what you included above. Laws keep changing as well, so what we teach at certain ages is no longer applicable 4 years from now. So those classes are sometimes deemed non-essential and axed from the curriculum. A teacher tries their best though, but sometimes you are also battling a culture. There are two cultures that are huge in the United States which consider entertainment more important than meeting one\u2019s debts (including paying your rent!). A lot of this has actually come from individuals who have lived in poverty. I suggest you consider reading some of Ruby Payne\u2019s books about Children in Poverty (I don\u2019t recall the exact titles but you can google the information on the internet.) But remember that teachers are bound by regulations and laws which can be changed. ",

            "answer_text": "Some schools do. Some schools teach voluntary economics courses but the thing with economics is that to a large extent, for a large amount of people, it\u2019s boring and incredibly difficult to make interesting. We were taught about the Estonian tax system, what tax revenue is used for, who pays what etc. So, if I wanted to, I could calculate how much I can expect from my tax return, but I\u2019m fortunate enough to live in a country where I don\u2019t have to. Sales tax is already in the price, all taxes are deduced prior to me getting my pay, so I don\u2019t have to do my taxes myself, but they are handled by my employer\u2019s bookkeeper - which is kind of what they\u2019re for, if I\u2019m honest. There\u2019s no point in having everyone do it themselves if there\u2019s professionals who can do it way more efficiently and get paid for it. This is why there\u2019s garbage disposal companies, hairdressers, teachers or gardeners etc - so people can have someone else, a professional, do it. So, while I agree that schools should teach it, to an extent, I much prefer Estonia\u2019s tax system where you, for the most part, don\u2019t have to do anything yourself (unless you\u2019re an entrepreneur, that\u2019s different, but I\u2019m not exactly familiar how and don\u2019t really care to find out). If you want your child to learn about it, then simply check which schools teach basic economics and money management and sign them up. There will always be some schools that teach it. ",
