            "answer_text": " Watching Kalpit Veerwal or Sachin Rana for motivation instead of studying.Reading on Quora how peopled cracked jee in very less time.Searching like - \u201cCan I be successful if I don't cracked JEE\u201d.Using a smartphone in the last phase of my prep when I returned home from coaching after Jee Mains.Thinking Jee Mains rank is directly linked to Jee advanced. Due to this fact, I got overconfidence and I screwed up Jee Advanced.Leaving the hostel and coming home to do self-study. Hostlers cant do that as they have lived in a very different environment for so much time but for those who are doing self-study at home from the very beginning for them is fine.Not using tricks to solve MCQ due to my over honesty with myself and not guessing in those questions which have no negative marking.Being confused about 2\u20133 books which to study for a particular subject and end up doing none of them.So it is a humble request to everyone to follow only one book and don't change it in between.Not giving sufficient time to maths.Taking Ques on ego if I was not able to solve.Being greedy of marks in multiple correct and in this getting (-2) is even worse. Due to that, I lost 15 marks as I ticked one option more which was incorrect.Predicting your rank even before giving JEE.Continued\u2026\u2026 14. Overstrenghthening your strong subject and weakening your weak subject. In my case Physics was strongest and maths was weakest. I generally used to do Physics much more than maths. But I improved my habit after 11th class. 15. If you believe then you will surely win. Don't underestimate yourself, I used to underestimate myself during JEE. 16. Skipping HC Verma (though i didn't do that but many people do) 17. Not preparing for KVPY and Olympiads. 18. Checking other's periodic test results. 19. Underestimating NCERT especially for inorganic (though i didn't do that but many people do). 20. Sleeping for more than 8 hours (Sleep is my weakness till now). 7 hours sleep is sufficient but don't cut it down further. 21. Learn to say NO! I wasted a lot of my time solving others doubts. 22. Overthinking about a concept and more dangerously applying your wrong abstract thinking and making your own thesis. Teachers that teach are expert in their subject so ask them before making a wrong concept in your mind. That's it but besides these setbacks i got selected with AIR 1726 because people around me underestimated me and i wanted to prove them i am not less than anyone else. This is the Power of self motivation that a person who was not believing to be among top 10,000 in class 10th got selected in IIT. So be self motivated and don't depend on others for motivation. Wishing you all the best dear aspirants for your upcoming JEE Mains and Advanced. P.S - A very important point which i forgot to mention that I don't used to complete my homework in time. It is very crucial to complete your assignments on time to get a good grasp of the subject. ",

            "answer_text": "Worried about the batches and facultyI was admitted to a south-Indian JEE institute. The best batch in my institute was given the best faculty, attention, and all the facilities. Only one student per bench. Regular doubt classes. Revision classes. Test analysis. Etcetera. I think I spent roughly two hours every day regretting screwing up the batch shuffling test and worrying about the chaos in my class and thinking how insignificantly I was treated compared to my roommate. Then there was one guy in my class who once sat by me and told me that teachers, institutes, batches, mentors \u2014 none of them matter as much as we think. He never cared about the batches. Nor the faculty. He planned his way and made sure he accomplished his daily tasks jotted down the previous night. Today he is in the final year of IIT-G Maths and Computing. Well, I want you to know that the students that have the potential to get into IIT, have the potential of learning the subject on their own. Their attitude takes them to IIT. Their attitude of being positive in every situation, and their attitude of keeping a laser focus on their aim \u2014 ignoring everything else that comes in their way. Teachers and institutes and batches don\u2019t matter. Just think about the 24 hours in front of you, and do whatever you can, with whatever you have, to get closer to your dream 2. Didn\u2019t take the material/sheets seriously Don\u2019t get confused. In south-Indian institutes like Narayana and Chaitanya, the revising and solving booklet is called Material. In the North, the same thing is called Sheets. The sheets are updated, improved, and very well-curated pieces of JEE preparations syllabus material. They are enough. You should trust them and solve them thoroughly without diving into some other books written by foreign authors. 3. Read too many books This really is one of the biggest mistakes that you\u2019ll do. For looking cool, you\u2019ll find your friends bringing in thicker and thicker books month by month. Krotov, Irodov, Feynmann\u2019s lectures, Piskunov, etc. After a year, you\u2019ll find these Piskunov students slipping under the extreme burden of revising. One day, around a month before the big exam, they will suddenly start talking about how IIT is not the end of the world. Those students might have a lot more knowledge in certain topics, but you\u2019ll still find them struggling to score well. As absurd as it sounds, having knowledge and scoring marks are two different things. Scoring well requires a strategical study. My learnings: When you have joined a coaching center that gives you material/sheets, NCERT is enough for inorganic. Arihant is enough for maths. HCV and D.C Pandey are enough for Physics. And any \u2018one\u2019 book you understand is enough for the remaining subjects. 4. Didn\u2019t revise simultaneously The syllabus of JEE is vast. The burden of revision in the last two months will make you talk about how IIT is not the end of the world. If you study only for the upcoming test that contains a 70% syllabus of the present week, you will screw up big time. Study for that test, but dedicate at least 2 hours for revision of the old syllabus, every day. It\u2019s okay to lose \u2018a few\u2019 battles (weekly tests) while preparing/couping for the war (The JEE) 5. Cut down sleep and lunch for dedicating that time for studying Your digestive system is linked firmly to your nervous system. Whatever you eat will have a direct impact on your thinking and executing ability. Eat more proteins and less carbs, more sprouts and less sugar. Bath with cold water. Google for more help. Exercise/Play for at least half an hour daily. And make sure you get 7 hours of sleep every day.  The rest of the points are covered in the novel \u2018One step short to the moon: IIT vs LOVE\u2019 The phenomenal two years preparation journey of a determined Kota student who falls in love on the way to his ultimate dream.
