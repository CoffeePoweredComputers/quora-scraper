            "answer_text": "Excellent question! It has three main answers: One of the problems students often have is that they see their classes as solely a means of content mastery. That is, they think that they go to English to learn English, and as long as they learn the content, what difference does it make if they participate in class? Some students even take this to the next level: \u201cI know that I know this stuff, so why should I have to prove it by doing these pointless assignments?\u201d Those are the really book-smart students who end up getting low grades anyway because they lack common sense. They get to feel superior, thinking that they\u2019re smarter than their classmates or teachers, but their attitude usually leads to a rough road for them in school and life beyond. They\u2019re the \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t the world recognize my intelligence and reward me with a better job\u201d kind of adults. This may come as a shock for some people, particularly students, but classes aren\u2019t just about content mastery. There are other forms of learning going on at the same time: social learning, working in groups, paying attention, etc\u2026 And participating is one of those \u201cother things\u201d that you\u2019re also learning: How to engage with others in a meaningful way, even if you\u2019d rather not. How to prove to the people in charge (your teachers now, your bosses in the future) that you give a damn about what\u2019s happening. Another reason teachers require/grade students on participation is because, for some students, that may be all that they are capable of doing or willing to do. This is sometimes the case for students with learning disabilities or cognitive issues who, in the past, would have been in isolated classrooms, but now are fully included in regular classrooms whenever possible. The final reason is that meaningful participation from students just helps the class run smoother and helps the time go by faster. As a teacher, nothing sucks quite as much as a classroom full of half-asleep, refusing-to-engage students. It\u2019s something most adults eventually learn when they get out into the \u201creal world:\u201d Time flies when you\u2019re busy. When I worked in retail, I hated \u201cslow\u201d days. A ten-hour shift seems like a 20-hour shift when you\u2019re bored, but like a five-hour shift when it\u2019s really busy. I used to love the feeling of my boss reminding me that it was time for me to leave, because I\u2019d been so busy that I hadn\u2019t even noticed. ",

            "answer_text": "The loudest students and those most inclined to participate aren\u2019t always the smartest or most insightful. Many shy students go unnoticed or unrewarded but they have much to contribute. Teachers grade students on participation as a way of encouraging / requiring / justifying their role in asking the quiet students to contribute. Classes learn much faster and better when many students participate and students learn much better when their smart peers show insights. Also, it is a social necessity to sometimes express yourself in public despite a quiet personality. I say to my students that someday they will be the best person to speak at a friend\u2019s wedding or at a family funeral or at a political event because they will have the most authentic thing to say and they need to be heard. They must practice speaking out in class if they are to do it as adults and citizens. ",
