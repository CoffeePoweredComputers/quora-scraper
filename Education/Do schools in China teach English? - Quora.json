            "answer_text": "Yes, from primary/elementary school and right through Highschool and university. You may wonder why so few Chinese speak English. There are a few reasons. Generally, the language is not seen as being particularly useful for a lot of people. While some parents do encourage their children to do well in English, unless they have some use for it language skills can degrade quickly once they leave school. I learned German in Highschool, but I can barely introduce myself these days. Secondly, the exams are mostly written with little or no emphasis on speaking and listening, so people can generally read and write in English better than they can speak it. ",
