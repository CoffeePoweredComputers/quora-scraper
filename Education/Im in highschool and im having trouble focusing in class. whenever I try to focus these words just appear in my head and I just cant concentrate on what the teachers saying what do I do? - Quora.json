            "answer_text": "Hi there, I am sorry that your having a difficult time concentrating in class. I believe writing things down - taking the words you can see in your head and on to paper. Often when somethings keep appearing, it means it needs your attention. I find writing often helps sort out what thought we are having and find out what they mean - whether its something you need to address right now or later. Hopefully, it works for you ",
