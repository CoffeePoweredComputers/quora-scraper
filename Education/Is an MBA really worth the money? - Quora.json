            "answer_text": "I originally wrote this here: Should you go to business school? The only reason that matters  TL;DR: You should go to business school if you want to go --------------  A common question I hear is, \u201cShould I go to Business School?\u201d My answer is always the same, half cynical and half serious: \u201cYou should go to business school if you want to go to business school\u201d Simple, but I really do believe this. Advice from other people can be valuable, but most people tend to tell you to do what they did. If you\u2019re confident that business school is the next step for you, you will always have that thought lingering in the back of your mind. Go do it! There are two questions I ask everyone who solicits my advice: What do you want to do after business school?Why don\u2019t you do that now?Even if you know what you want to do, there are still a number of benefits of going to business school (which I will get to). I was always impressed by my classmates who knew exactly what they wanted to do\u200a\u2014\u200athey were able to take advantage of every resource, connection, class, and project to help them build their skills. For people that are less sure, like I was, business school can be a confusing place. Many prestigious jobs instantly become more attainable. For those that have been crushing it in their life, it is incredibly hard to not pursue those paths, whether it is working at Google, McKinsey, Goldman, or the hottest startup. I\u2019ve been having a lot of conversations with classmates three years after graduation who are all facing the same issue: they are in a great job, but something is missing. I have a friend at Google who loved his job, but when a few things changed\u200a\u2014\u200aa new manager and position, he realized he didn\u2019t care where he worked\u200a\u2014\u200ahe just wanted to work on a great team. That same friend recognizes now that business school may have delayed him coming to this realization. All the things that made the two year experience exceptional (exposure to diverse perspective and time to reflect) also made career planning more confusing. Business school is an option multiplying machine. Of course, this is one thing I found attractive\u200a\u2014\u200ait expands your pool of opportunities. Since I didn\u2019t have a clear understanding of what I wanted to do when entering business school, expanding my options seemed like the best idea. But expanding my options did not solve the age old question of \u201cWhat do I want to do?\u201d My one caveat about business school is always: You may figure it out during the two years of conversations, classes, and projects but I don\u2019t think business school is well suited to answer this question\u200a\u2014\u200aand it shouldn\u2019t be! The burden is on you. Like me, a lot of people go to business school because they want to go to business school\u200a\u2014\u200aand I think that is fine! So for these people, I offer what I consider the six best things about going to business school: The life-long friends: A lot of people talk about \u201cthe network.\u201d This is definitely real. My classmates are doing incredible things in their career and every one of them will pick up the phone to have a conversation or help me in my career. That support system is invaluable. However, the real power comes from the friends you make from spending 12 hours a day together, struggling through the same assignments or choreographing a dance for an upcoming cultural event. I will guarantee that you leave school with at least one or two life-long friends. These are people that will be in your wedding party, take vacations with you or offer a place to crash when you visit a new city. This paid off for me when I faced some health challenges after graduation. The unexpected love and support of my classmates was amazing. I had life-long friends, not a networShrinking the world: It is very easy to expose yourself to different industries and perspectives during the two years you spend at business school. Whether through clubs, classes, speakers or just conversations with classmates, you will likely learn about industries you never knew anything about and jobs you never heard of. At MIT Sloan, almost half of my class was international. Beyond the obvious benefits of travel recommendations for life and inside food knowledge, working with diverse groups broadened my perspective. One of my groups composed peolpe from the US, Mexico, Israel, and Korea\u200a\u2014\u200awhich made the world seem a lot smaller and the world\u2019s challenges a lot more solvableThe ability to take a step out from the \u201chustle\u201d:Business school is certainly fast paced, but it\u2019s also a step out of the increasingly complex and competitive working world. I am a big fan of taking breaks or walks during the day to increase my productivity and creativity: the benefits of this are well known. I haven\u2019t found any research on the impact of a two year break during your career, but my hypothesis is the benefits are profound. I like to think of business school as a two year walk, where I had time to reflect, think, learn, dream and wonderEliminating stories of why you can\u2019t do something: Being surrounded by such successful people can be a double edged sword. If you start comparing yourself to your classmates, you will always find someone more accomplished or impressive. However, the fact that you share a beer or lunch with them makes you realize they don\u2019t have superpowers, they just don\u2019t spend any time creating excuses. It made me realize that the only thing that will hold me back from what I want to accomplish is my own beliefs. Everyone, including me, is capable of greatnessThinking like a leader: Being accepted into an amazing business school gave me a lot of pride. It also gave me the self-imposed pressure that I need to embrace this opportunity and do something with it. Prior to business school, my definition of a \u201cleader\u201d was something defined by a title or number of direct reports. During a leadership class I took, this idea was destroyed, as I realized these people haven\u2019t cornered the market on leadership. I was filled with the anxiety and excitement that anyone could be a leader. I embraced this mindset and try to ask myself \u201cHow should I act in this situation, as a leader?\u201d For me this comes out by having integrity and being authentic to who I am. I\u2019m passionate about building positive and meaningful work environments where people can flourish\u200a\u2014\u200aso I try to embrace this spirit in every interaction I have in and out of work. I\u2019m grateful that I literally had a class to think about leadership and what it means to meAn experimental lab: I looked at everything as a new learning opportunity. The improvisational leadership class that made me dance around in front of my classmates taught me how to be more fearless. The healthcare project I did made me realize I didn\u2019t want to go work in healthcare. The choreographed dances I did with my classmates for the New England Cultural Function (yes, really) made me realize I love making a fool of myself for the sake of having a good time. Finally, the many hours I spent helping others with their job searches and interviews made me realize I love helping others achieve their dreamsGoing to business school was not a rational decision for me. I didn\u2019t calculate two years of lost salary and factor in the ROI of tuition payments and future salaries. It was just something I had always wanted to do, a dream that I had. I went to business school because I wanted to go to business school. Why do you want to go?   ",

            "answer_text": "I have an MBA, and while I'm happy to have one, I think I got it for the wrong reasons. If I had to do it again, I would have gotten something in the hard sciences like cryptography or mathematics (just my personal choice). In the late 1990's and early 2000's, MBA's were something of a fad, simply everyone was getting one. Coupled at the time was the fact I was working for IBM, and could not conceive the possibility of working anywhere else. I loved working there and was really proud of being an IBMer. I was going to work there forever! Then the layoffs and offshoring of IBM jobs started happening, and in one meeting my then PDM (personnel development manager) made an offhand remark that everyone except the MBA's were getting laid off. While that alone didn't set me off, it was the spark to apply for business school that very day. I got into a reputable one (although not Harvard or Kellogg, just a established accredited school with good rankings), did fairly well, and got laid off from IBM anyway. My last few months at IBM was me scrambling away from technology and into sales, which I didn't like much after all, but if it kept me at IBM, maybe I could learn to like it. A moot point, I was terminated with some 10,000 other people at the same time. The MBA did help me find new work though, and helped me with my career and the ability to evaluate new projects and work better with people, and made me comfortable with leadership. I don't necessarily like being in management, but given the choice between me and someone else with little experience, I can step up. So to answer your question, since it seems you want a yes or no answer, I would say no, the MBA is not worth getting. To qualify this 'no': 1) The MBA program is something you can learn on your own. Subscribe to the Harvard Business Journal, read the classic MBA textbooks, and there just might be a free MBA type course you can take online. This assumes you are interested in knowledge and not just the credentials. 2) The MBA program is a lot about networking. If you get to a top ranking program like Kellogg or Harvard, you will make excellent connections, and that alone can be worth the money. Going to a good ranking but otherwise unremarkable school like I did got me some new friends, but not make connections that would be invaluable. I have connections with very nice people working as middle managers for Fortune 500 and small companies, not future presidents of the United States. 3) If credentials are important, I would strongly recommend you get a 'hard' credential in science or mathematics, the kind of skill that products are built on. You can still learn the soft MBA skills on your own on top of that. So that's my take on it. Your mileage may vary! Derrick ",
