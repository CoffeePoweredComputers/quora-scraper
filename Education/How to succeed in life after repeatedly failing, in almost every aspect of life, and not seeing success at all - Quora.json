            "answer_text": "That\u2019s such a difficult question to answer without knowing more about you. So without this knowledge, I can only give you general advice. And that advice really depends on what you see as success. I heard a story once about a fisherman who had his family around him, had enough food to feed his family, enough money to get by. A merchant offered him fame and fortune to which the fisherman replied he had everything he could ever need or want. What do you consider important to be a success? Money, family, love, knowledge, academic success. You have to decide what you want out of life before you can start attaining that goal. It could be that simply adjusting your perspective will be enough for you to consider yourself a success. Whatever your circumstances, I promise there are people in worse situations than you. Comparing yourself to other people may be what you need to think more of your situation or could act as inspiration to make you ensure you never end up like that. Conversely, comparing yourself to other people who are better of than you may kill your confidence or act as inspiration to help you improve things. I hope you can see that it\u2019s about attitude, perspective, looking at things in the right way.  I\u2019ve been in situations that were so desperate I wonder what I ever did wrong for life to be so cruel. They were literally sink or swim situations and I had to change my life drastically. This is what I did. I decided to build a new me. I changed my appearance, I changed my attitude to work. I decided that I would never get anywhere in life unless I had my own home, a decent income and financial backup in case things went wrong again. I was a taxi driver at the time, my car had broken down, I had no way of fixing it and no money. I was lucky enough to loan a car from a friend, walked away from my rented home (I couldn\u2019t pay the bills) and worked non-stop, living in my car and having no expenses except the fuel I need to work and food. People don\u2019t believe me now when I tell them I worked for 16 hours a day, non-stop for 462 days. Nothing was going to stop me getting the things I wanted. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone with such determination. I worked christmas day, holidays, every single day without a single day off. On my worst day I worked for 14 hours. For a year and a half the number of jobs I covered was double that of any other taxi driver within the company I worked for. At the end of it, I had a fantastic new car, was renting a lovely home (I was too old to get a mortgage by then), met the woman of my dreams (I think the nice home and car helped) and we had two wonderful daughters together. For me, that was success. I could take things easy for a while. But I didn\u2019t - I changed my career and became self employed and that determination was still within me - I didn\u2019t know how to do things differently it had become a part of me.  For me, it worked, temporarily. I didn\u2019t waste time reading books, watching movies, having hobbies. I put life on hold until I was in a better position to take the time out to do those things. Every day, all I could see was the future. A better future. And that drove me beyond my limits - pushed me past any barriers I\u2019d ever had before. I watched the rest of the world enjoying life and envied them. I\u2019ve been homeless three times and can\u2019t possibly explain what that feels like. I eventually stopped from mental exhaustion - it still affects me to this day. I can\u2019t hand answers to you on a plate and solve all of your problems for you. Only you can do that by working out what\u2019s best for you. I didn\u2019t become a millionaire, have lots of people working for me, and in the end things went wrong again. But for a while I knew what I had to do and let nothing stand in my way. That\u2019s my story (or a part of it). I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to decide your own path. What you want, what career you want, when will enough be enough? Take time out and decide what things are stopping you getting what you want. Are you drinking too much, being lazy, with the wrong partner, wrong attitude? Only by looking at what\u2019s going wrong can you find a way to put things right. And having a hell of a lot of determination. ",

            "answer_text": "Just keep one thing in mind,\u201cYou never lose, either you win, or you learn\u201d Trust me, it has not been much long since i have learnt the same thing. And at this point, i believe it\u2019s better if you fail, you will learn a hell lot of things. Every fall of yours, be it huge or negligible, changes apart of you and gives a new YOU to YOU. 2. What doesn't kills you, makes you stronger. Who among us would not be familiar with this phrase? But hey, wait; read it again, and again, and again. Read it until your inner-self starts shouting right in your head that, you have become the one who is far more stronger than the one you were at a time. All thanks to those lessons (failures). 3. Its not your surroundings which control your mind, but it\u2019s you yourself who can do stuff. okay so, lets get it straight, you are the super master of your mind, your thoughts, and your actions. Don\u2019t ever let your failure stumble your steps towards your path to success, rather be the one who becomes finer and even more finer with every failure that comes up. 4. Don\u2019t let the fire inside you get low. \u201cA highly motivated man can conquer the world, and even the moon and the stars\u201d said my biology teacher once. This is your utmost weapon, don\u2019t let your fire go away, these little failure should only make this fire burn even more brighter. Trust me, a man who can do this, can never be defeated,NEVER. 5. Success stories are not the best seller ones. Be it APJ Abdul Kalam or JK Rowling or Steve Jobs, all these legendary people have a strong story to share. Ask yourself, are your failures that big? The more you suffer, the more you learn and the higher you rise. keep going. :)  ",

Failures can be your best friend if you use it that way. Else, it can be your worst enemy as well. Every coin consists of two sides. So do the failures, hence, if you learn from them and evolve and move forward. Then, believe me, failures can make you learn the best lessons of your life. Also, your definition of failure makes a lot of difference. Some people see things go out of their control as a failure, which is not always true as I believe. Well, if you are going through continuous failures in your life, then always remember, there will be a sunny day one day. So, don't lose hope. Keep doing what you love and feel right. However, self-realization of your mistakes can turn things for the better. As sometimes, we feel what we are doing is right. But in reality, it's not. So, always reach out to people you believe are honest with you when it comes to constructive criticism. Let's face failures with bravery, power, and wisdom:) ",
