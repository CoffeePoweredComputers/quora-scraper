            "answer_text": "1. Get rid of distractions First things first: You need to eliminate distractions. While you can\u2019t do away with everything, you can make an effort to reduce or get rid of as many distractions as possible. Start with the simple things like: moving to a quiet areaturning off notifications on your phone or turning your phone off altogetherclosing the door to your officetelling those around you not to distract you for a period of timeclosing out of programs or apps that aren\u2019t essential on your computer2. Coffee in small doses Drinking coffee, or other caffeinated beverages, in small doses may have a positive impact on your ability to focus, according to a 2010. The key to taking advantage of caffeine\u2019s cognitive-enhancing properties is to consume it in moderation. If you drink too much of it, you may end up feeling anxious or nervous, which generally reduces your ability to stay focused. 3. Practice the Pomodoro technique Staying focused helps you get more done in less time. While that sounds simple enough, it\u2019s not always easy to put into practice. So, the next time you\u2019re wrestling with your attention span, try the Pomodoro technique. This timing method helps you train your brain to stay on task for short periods of time. Here\u2019s how it works: Set your timer for 25 minutes and get to work.When you the buzzer sounds, take a 5-minute break.Then, set the timer again and get back to work.Once you\u2019ve done four rounds of this, you can take a longer break, approximately 20 to 30 minutes.4. Put a lock on social media If your idea of a break from work is checking Facebook or Instagram every 5 minutes, you may want to consider an app that blocks social media. There are several apps that work for your phone, tablet, or computer. In addition to social media, some of these distraction-busting programs also allow you to block online games, as well as apps and sites like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, text messages, and even emails. Some of the most popular social media blockers include Freedom, AppBlock, FocusMe, and Focus. 5. Fuel your body We all know what happens when \u201changer\u201d strikes. This dreaded combination of hunger and anger is a major focus fail. So, to keep your brain focused, your energy levels up, and your emotions on an even keel, make sure you don\u2019t delay or skip meals. Try to balance lean protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats to stay fueled. Snack on fresh fruit, veggies, nuts, or seeds if you get hungry between meals, and be sure to keep yourself hydrated with plenty of water. And, for an extra boost, Harvard Medical School says to include a few of these \u201cbest brain foods\u201d in your day: green, leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, and broccolifatty fish such as salmonberries, like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, or blackberrieswalnutstea and coffee for the caffeine, in moderation6. Get enough sleep It\u2019s no secret that the majority of Americans are lacking in the sleep department. While a few nights of minimal sleep is okay, not getting enough sleep most nights of the week can negatively impact both your short and long-term memory, as well as your ability to concentrate. The recommended amount of sleepTrusted Source for adults aged 18 to 60 years old is 7 or more hours a night. Older adults may need up to 9 hours per night. To boost your sleep health, try to: Avoid caffeinated beverages after lunchtime.Switch off all electronic devices an hour before bedtime. The light from these devices can stimulate your brain and prevent you from feeling sleepy.Take time to wind down. Read a book, take a warm bath, listen to soothing music.Keep your bedroom cool and quiet. According to the Cleveland Clinic, an ideal temperature is between 60 and 67\u00b0F (15.6 and 19.4\u00b0C).7. Set a SMART goal If your lack of focus is a result of feeling overwhelmed by a complex project, try breaking it down into smaller parts and plugging the smaller steps into the SMART formula. SMART stands for: Specific. What exactly needs to be done?Measurable. How will you track your progress?Achievable. Is it realistic? Can it be done by the deadline?Relevant. How does it fit with the overall plan or bigger goal?Timely. When does it need to be done?When you take a large, complex project and break it down into smaller, bite-size tasks, you can boost your ability to concentrate and focus on specific tasks. That\u2019s because you end up with goals that you actually feel like you can accomplish. 8. Be more mindful Does your mind tend to wander away from where it\u2019s supposed to be? Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re definitely not alone. Distracted thinking is common, and something we all experience. However, these short mental vacations often make it harder to focus on the task in front of you. That\u2019s where mindfulness comes in. According to the Mayo Clinic, being mindful means you can maintain moment-to-moment awareness of where you are and what you\u2019re doing \u2014 which is great news when you\u2019re trying to stay focused. By being mindful and recognizing when your attention starts to drift, you can quickly bring your focus back to where it needs to be. Plus, you can actually train your brain to be more mindful by practicing breathing techniques, meditation, and mindful movement, such as yoga. 9. Make a to-do list Let\u2019s face it. The items on a to-do list can add up quickly. And, it can be challenging to find the motivation to accomplish everything you set out to do. The good news? StudiesTrusted Source show that having a written plan of action can increase productivity. After you make your list, choose two or three key tasks and put them at the top. Then rank the rest of the items in order of importance. This allows you to tackle urgent tasks when your brain is fresh and your energy levels are high. 10. Focus on similar tasks Tired of jumping from one type of thinking to another (aka \u201cmultitasking\u201d)? Then pick tasks that are similar, group them together, and do one at a time. This makes transitions smoother, and you may find that you get a lot more done by not jumping from one type of task to another. Despite what you may think, multitasking is not more effective or efficient, especially when you\u2019re struggling with staying focused. In fact, the American Psychological Association reports that multitasking may reduce productivity by as much as 40 percent. ",

            "answer_text": "Your ability to focus is just like any other muscle in your body. It must be developed through repetition, time, and progressively more challenging tasks. I was never the smartest kid in highschool or college\u2026 Far from it. In fact, my ability to focus was similar to that of an ADD Golden Retriever\u2019s (Squirrel!) It wasn\u2019t until about 4 years ago when I realized that I needed to strengthen my focus. And when I did? The results were phenomenal. Today, I run a 7-figure business doing what I love, live by the beach, and have a thriving social life. But achieving these results required me to completely change how I approached focus and concentration. It wasn\u2019t easy\u2026 But the results speak for themselves. If you want to strengthen your ability to focus, there are several actionable habits and actions that you can take today. Here are a few of my favorites.  1. Eradicate the Silent Focus Killers One of the primary reasons that people lack the ability to focus today is because our brains have been trained from a very early age to crave novel and exciting stimulus. Whether it\u2019s video games, porn, TV, or Angry Birds, 90% of our daily activities are hyper stimulating and release a plethora of pleasure chemicals each time we engage in them. This makes it exponentially harder to focus on the relatively dull tasks required to build a successful life. Think about it like this\u2026 Imagine if you spent every single day playing the latest Call of Duty for 90 minutes. You level up your character, become an exceptional quick scoper, and have an absolute blast. Now, after a month or so of playing CoD daily, you are instructed to switch to playing Pong\u2026 Yes, that pong.  Now\u2026 You tell me. Do you think that you will enjoy playing pong the same way you enjoyed Call of Duty? Will you be able to focus on the game for the same length of time without getting frustrated or bored? Of course not! And this is how these activities affect our ability to focus in everyday life. When you become accustomed to hyper stimulating and rewarding activities that provide you with an immediate hit of dopamine, it\u2019s much harder to engage in more arduous tasks like writing, reading, or exercising because the neurochemical reward takes much longer to achieve. So\u2026 What do we do about this? Well, if you\u2019re serious about increasing your focus then I want you to do something that\u2019s going to sound crazy\u2026 I want you to open up your phone and DELETE every social media app, game, and other time waster that you have installed. Then I want you to go into your living room, unplug the television, and hide the cord in the trunk of your car. Yes\u2026 I\u2019m serious. For the next 30 days, you are going to engage in a \u201cFocus Reset\u201d. This means that you will completely eliminate all hyper stimulating (but ultimately unfulfilling) activities from day. TV? Gone! Video games? Bye bye! Porn? DEFINITELY has to go! This will NOT be easy. And it\u2019s not supposed to be. Retraining your brain to focus will take time and effort, but if you\u2019re serious about it, you will take action and eliminate all of the focus killers from your life. This isn\u2019t permanent. But it is necessary. Only once you\u2019ve eliminated these stimulus from your daily routine can you truly regain your ability to focus and concentrate for extended periods of time. 2. Eat a \u2018Focus Friendly\u2019 Diet Your diet has a HUGE impact on your ability to focus and concentrate for extended periods of time. If you aren\u2019t providing your brain with the right types and quantities of nutrients, then you won\u2019t be able to focus\u2026 Period. So what is the ideal diet for focus? It\u2019s actually pretty simple. To improve your focus you must avoid: SugarsAlcoholHeavily processed carbs (white bread, pasta, etc.)Pesticides (non-organic produce)Trans fats and hydrogenated oils On the flip side, you want to consume plenty of the following: Organic meats (especially grass fed red meats)Vegetables (particularly kale, spinach, peppers, and cauliflower)Fruits (in moderation)Healthy fats (avocados, grass fed butter, olive oil, etc.)And carbs after 4 p.m. (think rice and whole grain products).I also recommend that you practice intermittent fasting by skipping breakfast and eating all of your food between 1 p.m. and 9 p.m. Drink a cup of black coffee with coconut oil in the mornings and I promise you will feel an immediate increase in your ability to focus. 3. Meditate Daily Nothing builds focus like daily meditation. Sitting with your eyes closed and forcing yourself to think only about your breath and body isn\u2019t easy\u2026 Actually, it can seem darn near impossible for a beginner. I\u2019ve been meditating for almost 5 years and I can vouch for this practice firsthand.  On the days where I meditate, I\u2019m able to think better, faster, and more clearly than the days where I don\u2019t. Start with 5 minutes every morning and work up to two 20 minute sessions a day. If you can do this, you will become a KING (or queen) of focus in no time. 4. Play Brain Training Games to Increase Focus The only exception to the \u201cNo Video Game\u201d rule above are games that are specifically designed to increase your ability to focus. Some of my favorites are: Dual N BackSudokuChessLumosityI also recommend that you regularly practice memorizing quotes, poetry, and impactful sayings as a way to increase focus and memory retention. Practicing these games for only 15\u201320 minutes a day for a few weeks will dramatically improve your focus, and your life, by leaps and bounds. 5. Exercise Daily As I mentioned in the \u2018Focus Friendly\u2019 diet point, your ability to focus is directly correlated with the health of your brain. And there\u2019s NO better way that I know of to strengthen your brain than through regular daily exercise. Although there\u2019s plenty of research showing that regular exercise improves attention span scientists are still unclear as to \u2018why\u2019. But that\u2019s beside the point. Spend at least 20 minutes a day doing some sort of physical activity and I promise your focus and concentration will measurably improve. Bonus Tip: Use these Supplements as a Shortcut to Increasing Focus After you\u2019ve taken action on the above recommendations, you can also use specific supplements to improve your brain health and increase your ability to focus. Here are a few of my favorites. Fish or Krill OilResveratrolBacopa MonieriAcetyl L-CarnitineCreatineCaffeine (be sure to use at least 3 hours after you consume caffeine)Green TeaMagnesiumL-TyrosineAs the name implies, these substances are intended to supplement an existing focus training regimen\u2026 Not to serve as the end all be all of focus enhancement. Be sure that you are exercising regularly, eating a proper diet, getting sufficient sleep, and eliminating distractions before you start using these supplements. Hope this helps.
