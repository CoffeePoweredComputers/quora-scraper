Methods like the 7 dollar secret and the ultimate supertip come to mind. Anybody can afford to invest less than 10 dollars in one of these methods but for some reason people will look at them and move on, waiting for the next idea to pop up and so on and so on. During my freshman year, I worked at a taco bell. I barely had time to work and get everything taken care of with school let alone go out and have fun (which is as big of part of college as the education). For so long I just kept skipping around on the internet hoping to find the perfect plan. Finally I just stopped looking and started doing. I realized I kept hearing about the same programs because these programs worked. So if you really want to quit that fast food job, and start making money on the internet while still in school, just do it. Find some cheap methods, utilize them, and build from there.
