The reasons mentioned (informally) include: Young teachers have a lot of energy, making them fun and dynamicMost students are young, and like teachers who are nearer their ageYoung teachers aren\u2019t set in their ways, and are open to new, creative ideas.They are more flexible in terms of timetables (because they haven\u2019t got family commitments)The reasons they don\u2019t mention, but are rumoured, are: They are better looking, because, obviously, everyone over 35 is craggy and baggy ;)They are cheaper, without family commitmentsThey are less qualified and so less likely to question the management who are set in their ways.They move on quickly, so they don\u2019t acquire legal rights",

The older ones don't appreciate being worked like dogs, where as the young ones will 'grin and bear it because they are going somewhere else after there next time off. The older ones have kids to support and they need stability which the private EFL schools don't wan to provide. They are also more likely to need sick leave etc. that the private colleges don't want to spend on. By contrast the not for profit EFL providers have plenty of over 35's. ",
