            "answer_text": "I would suggest a bunch of colleges in Hyderabad - like ASB/ Ashoka School of Business, IMT, NMIMS, SIBM, Hyderabad Business School. Amng them I would recommend ASB as it offers dual specialization aligned with industry requirements like Marketing+Business Analytics, Finance+FinTech, HR+HR Analytics, etc. They also charge very less only around INR 6.8Lacs for 2-year full time course. They also are flexible, and allows students to go home in the evening. That may be a lucrative option for the local students. They have commuting services to he prominent locations of Hyderabad. ",
