On the downside is the risk of missing learning structure, that is given in school by schedules and presence. Few people have the self discipline to learn focused and only self-organized. Most need external structure and control, at least when things get unpleasant. Even in an online meeting or school lesson, it is likely to start surfing on the internet for something interesting, instead of listening to the topic. So there should be an option to disable everything else during school hours. If somebody has the extreme self discipline skills to organize learning alone, maybe at another time, the person can be relieved of the mandatory school hours, but has to prove that he/she can do the learning alone. I know this is something I would have hated as a school student, but without mandatory school, most people would just remain stupid and completely uneducated. ",
