            "answer_text": "Naturally the answer depends on how you define \u201cworth it.\u201d Are you going to be a millionaire based on your salary and benefits? Maybe if you become director of a large library or system. Are you going to be able to travel the world on library business, at the library\u2019s expense? Probably not, at least compared to the travel experienced in some corporations. Are you going to be extremely happy with your life every single day? I\u2019d like to meet that person and see if he\u2019ll share whatever stimulants he\u2019s taking ;-) Was it worth it for me? Absolutely. I worked with a wide variety of librarians and staff over 25 years, and looking back it\u2019s amazing the lives each of them had. Working with the public was almost always great - I was even pleasantly surprised to read the lengthy bio of one of our campus\u2019 professors in an encyclopedia I recently reviewed (who knew he spent years in prison?). And working with patrons, equipment, software, and hardware over the years, I now have experience in DOS (ah, /f\u2026), can talk about ruminants and broiler marketing, know how to unjam just about any type of copier, and met folks from all over the world. It\u2019s not the life for everyone, but it was my life and worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "It can be worth it, as long as you keep your expectations reasonable. As the librarians who have answered this question have already stated, it\u2019s not a good idea to go into the profession for the money, and the library field is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be (see Kerry\u2019s answer below). If you\u2019re considering this profession, please know what you\u2019re getting into first: Matthew McNulty's answer to When should you decide to become a librarian? A lot of library jobs require a master\u2019s, but not all of them: Matthew McNulty's answer to Why do job listings for information related professions ask for an undergraduate degree in Library and Information Science when there is no such undergrad degree? If you aren\u2019t in it just for the money, and you want to sincerely help people find the information they need, whether it is a good book, or where to find a shelter for abused women, it\u2019s a wonderful profession to get into. Just keep your expectations in check. ",
