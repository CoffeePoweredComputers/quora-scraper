            "answer_text": "Because US education system is student centric. They focus on student\u2019s personal as well as social growth which ultimately leads to overall development. In US, educators give preference to vocational learning and follow practical approach. Students get projects on regular basis. To complete those projects they need to engage with all stakeholders which help them to get a holistic view of the subject. I totally agree with Georgiana Miller that US education system is willing to change. With time educators has to adapt new learning techniques to provide better outcomes. Because that\u2019s what can make any educational system great. ",
