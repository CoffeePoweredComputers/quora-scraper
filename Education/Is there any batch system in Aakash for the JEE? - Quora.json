            "answer_text": "Yes there is a batch system in Akash institute. In 11 class there are batches on the basis of your timing of joining the institute . Some batches starts in april month and some are started in may and june months .The last batch of 11 class could be in july or june. From my experience i would suggest don't join the last batches as i am one of them who joined the june batch of akash institute . I am suggesting this because in the last batches the teacher in beginning will cover your syllabus like a turtoise is running for jee or neet. Then they will run like cheetahs in november and december months to complete the syllabus. If one would not pay attention in class during november and december months. Then forget about jee or neet you will not able to qualify your boards also . I am not relating this for school students but dummy students . As they have to go to school for practicals and papers only. But one thing is sure the last batches are the unluckiest batches according to me. How one can understand the chapter in a speed of a bullet train. Then there come AIATS in the second week of October for 11 class students as well as the other exams such as smts,fortnightly,energizer are also going on . How this so called akash institute can expect a average students to focus on all the exams at one time only . Here the so called toppers of the batches use there extraordinary strengths as they have understand some 11 class concepts in their foundation classes and pave there way for topper and power batches in class 12.Yes the batches in the 12 class are based on the scores of 11 class exams. In 11 class if one scored less in exams we will be rewarded with same teachers in 12 class which were in 11 class . So study well in 11 to get the top batches in 12 class otherwise you will get trapped in low level batches where one can't understand what the teachers taught, thats why the students in low batches remains in low batches .There is a special batch for students who have come in akash through ANTHE exam . If you are in that batch you will be provided with bestest teachers so ttry to grab that batch to qualify jee or neet .Been an akashian for 1 year . This is my experience regarding batch system in akash. Sorry for any gramatical mistakes and please don't commit the mistake of choosing last batches it will give you a shock . All the best ",
