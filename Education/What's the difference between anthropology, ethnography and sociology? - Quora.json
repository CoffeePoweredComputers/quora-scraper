            "answer_text": "Anthropology is the science of what we now call humankind, including cultural, social, linguistic, archaeological (prehistoric and historic) and physical aspects. Physical anthropology includes genetics, human biology, and primate studies, including primate behavior studies. Ethnography is a methodology first associated with social or cultural anthropology but which has since spread to many other social sciences and even fields like education and management studies. It involves working within a community, learning their culture, and letting the subjects of your research, called informants in anthropology (though some have a problem with that term) present their own point of view in their own words.  The ethnographer would go around with an informant as the informant goes about his/her day, asking questions. Like if the person is going shopping, you might ask the informant, \"Why did you select that brand of detergent?\" and then the person would answer you and you'd have an unstructured interview with him or her about it.  There are all kinds of ethnography.  An entire cultural description in a monograph is also called an ethnography. As alluded to above, researchers outside anthropology, in sociology and in other fields, have moved into ethnography so it is no longer a uniquely anthropological approach. Sociology is somewhat different. It is a science of social structure and social relationships and though it goes into culture and linguistics as does anthropology it does not go into archaeology or physical anthropology. But sociology covers many subjects like demography, family issues, businesses and other organizations, legal systems, educational systems, and other things that would not be common in anthropology. And the approach of sociology to such subjects is far less ethnographic and more based on surveys and government statistics than is the case in anthropology. So an anthropologist and a sociologist could both study the same kinds of institutions: prisons, restaurants, churches.  But the anthropologist would do an ethnographic field study and try to see the \"native's point of view\" (that's a quote from Bronislaw Malinowski, seen by many as the father of modern ethnography) while the sociologist would send out surveys and get interviewers to do much of the interviewing and would try to get scores on things other than through interviews and relate his/her study to sociological questions and theories rather than those discussed by anthropologists. As you can see from my answer there could be work that falls right in the middle and covers both fields.  I can think off the top of my head of people who have been at different times professors of anthropology and of sociology. (Gail Kligman and Nancy Foner are the people I am thinking of.) ",

            "answer_text": "I may be repeating things that can be found in bits and pieces in several other answers because I have not read them, I would like to offer my take on this as a non expert with an overview. Sometimes someone outside of the problem can answer best, not sure if this might be the case here. When it comes to things such as this we often have a lot of arbitrarily defined categories. History and momentum conspire to create different sets of practices with different names investigating the exact same phenomenon, in this case human life. One simple answer might be the difference between sociology and anthropology, or the difference between sociology and social anthropology (which is a subfield of anthropology), is simply that there are different operating assumptions, different sets of dogmas and a priori beliefs. They're approaching it with different angles of view and using maybe slightly (or greatly) different tools, tools that have been used by habit in the different approaches. More and more I'm coming around to saying what I truly think is the simple answer to this question: It's arbitrary. The difference between sociology and Social Psychology and social anthropology and ethnography and the hypothetical field of \u201chuman ethology\u201d (which I made up) is 100% arbitrary, historical accident, and other trivial differences. They should in theory all be the same field, and all combined under the same rubric too since they study the same phenomena. As a value judgment I would say that diversity is so useful that's actually worthwhile to have all these different fields studying the same thing with their different tools and perspectives and judgments. But another value judgment that I would like to offer is that as I suggested a second ago there should be a field called human ethology. And that is because he thought ology is defined as the study of animal behavior. And since we Now understand that humans are animals, and ethology is a subfield of biology, I do think that a rational approach would put anthropology as a subfield of biology as well. So that whatever you call it, there's at least a field out there somewhere that tries to completely reimagine the study of human behavior as just another animal behavior study. But then again I must admit that it might be possible that the most rational approach to studying human behavior from within \u2014 being as we all are humans and can't study ourselves from the outside \u2014 would be to allow things to go on as they've been going, embrace diversity, and study it from all these different perspectives all at once. There are plenty of works like Desmond Morris's book on the human animal and The People of the Nacirema which in their attempt to be completely scientific actually end up being in some ways a bit silly. And then there's this entire field called \u201cphilosophy\u201d approaching it from outside of the anthropological and yet managers to hit on deeper truths than a scientist might, blinded as they are to their own innate morals by the distorting lense of \u201cscientific objectivity,\u201d something which turns out to be much closer to a religious belief than actual science. All of this is also to completely ignore art and literature as explorations of human nature, and therefore possible subfields of serious inquiry, which of course introduces a whole other level of complexity. What we're left with, in my opinion, is that the only simple answers you can get to this question are of the sort that come from officialdom: hierarchical answers from academia that site internal definitions without looking at what they are objectively, and just tells you Well sociology is this, that and the other, and anthropology is this other thing that defines itself as this, that and suchandforth.
