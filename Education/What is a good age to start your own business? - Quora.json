            "answer_text": "Although well writtenand based on personal experience, I do not agree with Asim Qureshi\u2019s answer, most notably: \u2018\u2019ALL the tech startups with the 40+ year old founders have done WAY better than the ones with the guys in their 20\u2019s\u2019\u2019 I don\u2019t disagree that outliers have distorted the founder perception, but this distortion should be used as a positive rather than a negative. It would be logical that founders in their 40s will be able to conceive an idea, based on longer term experience, utilise existing knowledge, skills and contacts, and therefore build and scale a business quicker than the 20 somethings. Additionally, you have to take into account that these people can often afford to work unpaid and/or can hire people from the beginning. However that is partly missing the point of how startups can work. The logic outlined above is relevant for the majority of new businesses, but is perhaps less relevant to tech startups. 6/7 years ago, to start a tech business you needed money, time and to be able to find a developer who knew what they were doing. The process was slow and often fizzled out. With the tech and skills that exist now, it is significantly easier to build and deploy websites in a matter of a few months. Now things of course go wrong and there are setbacks, but what you have going in your life, depicts how much time and energy you can put into this. Say for someone in their 20s, on the upside, they likely won\u2019t have a house, mortgage, kids or any real \u2018responsibilities\u2019. Compared to someone in their 40s who can afford to take time off, still pay the bills, maybe do some contract/part time work and leverage the things mentioned above. Does this mean that you should wait for your 40s to start a business. Absolutely not, or absolutely yes - it depends on your position, driving factors and most important whether you have any existing \u2018competitive advantage\u2019 that you can leverage. This advantage can be anything from rich friends/family, skilled friends who you can convince to work for beer money - anything you can make use of. Simple stating that all 40 year olds are more likely to \u2018succeed\u2019 is simply missing part of the startup life journey, and is not simply down to \u2018lack of conditioning in the workspace\u2019 (whatever that means)!

            "answer_text": "I think this is the wrong question. Age is just a proxy for experiences, knowledge, and maturity. It's a pretty good proxy, but many people also underestimate how quickly you can learn something if you put your mind to it. I never took a job coming out of college. I studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley and the \u201ctraditional\u201d path is going to work for a top tech company and making $120k+ right away. Instead at age 22 I started my own businesses. If I were to have asked anyone \u201cshould I start a business?\u201d, most peoples answers would probably be: \"no. Get some experience first and then once you're experienced and have made some money, then try something.\u201d I didn't know shit at age 22, but I didn't really care. I knew I would be in for rough times (although I didn't know how rough), but I also knew that I would learn a ton. I was investing in myself. I made roughly $200 in revenues in the first six months. Now, I'm doing multiples of a salaried software engineer. I spent two years learning by doing. Making \u201cmistakes\u201d (mistakes in the traditional sense), gaining experience, hiring employees, firing employees, shutting down companies. But also selling. Reaching people who I previously thought unreachable. Building products. Learning what works and what doesn't. Keeping employees motivated. I spent most of my mental energy (80%) in the past two years thinking about business. What makes a good business? How do you get your first customers? How do you get to your 100th customer? I read tons of Quora posts by many ppl including regulars by James Altucher and Jason M. Lemkin. Every time I have a 1 hr block commute I listen to Mixergy podcasts by Andrew Warner. Most of my time socializing with friends was talking about business development and the same questions \u2014 how did company X get first customers, how would you do it, oh this is an interesting idea / space and where could it lead? I\u2019ve always tried and still try to meet interesting people who would have good answers to questions like these. And now after 2 years I feel very confident that I can build a successful business. I know that there's plenty more to learn, but I also know that I can do it quickly when I need to do it. And better yet the knowledge and experiences compound. If you asked me 2 years ago what I would have projected in two years, I would have no clue. I don't think I would've imagined learning this much. So the question shouldn't really be of: \u201cwhat is a good age to start your own business\u201d. It should be \u201chow much are you willing to sacrifice to be successful\u201d and \u201chow much shit and rough times are you willing to go through\u201d and \u201chow motivated are you to devour information and learn at a rapid pace\u201d. Because there is no good age. There's only starting your business and not. ",
