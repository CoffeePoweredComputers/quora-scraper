            "answer_text": "Any number of reasons. Maybe you want to live in an Arab country, and be able to communicate with the locals. Maybe you love languages, and feel a particular attraction to Arabic. Maybe you\u2019re assigned that language to learn, as a member of the U.S. military, in a language training program. Or \u2026\u2026 maybe you\u2019re among the millions of Arabs who are Christian (Lebanon is roughly half Christian and half Muslim; many Palestinians are Christians, and we have a large expat community of Syrians - mostly Christians - in my city) \u2014 and you want to improve in speaking your native language, or the language of your native culture (if you were born, for instance, in the U.S., but are Arab by heritage). Your question is kind of like asking why a non-Hindu would want to learn Sanskrit, or a non-Jew, Hebrew - or a non-Catholic, Latin \u2014 no ancient language used as a sacred language by a given religion is only of interest because it\u2019s important to that religion.

I did so for the same reason anyone learns a language to which they have no family or ethnic tie - curiosity, and the desire to know more about the speakers of the language and their world. It was a pretty random decision to study Arabic, but it led to living in the Middle East for a dozen years and having many great experiences. ",
