            "answer_text": "I am at present persuing my engineering in instrumentation department ,if you are thinking of a college which will provide you the best atmosphere in technical ,you should not choose this as your option . although it is an autonomous college ,we are not provided enough technical teaching and even the placement record are not good(core). Speaking about the infrastructure it is not good we have most of the department shut or not in use conditions , development is a myth u will be asked 32,000 rupees as development fees and in return they provide you nothing .Hostels are well maintained and the hostel fees is quite cheaper as we open candidates need to pay 650 for a year excluding mess fees . SPORTS are conducted for just name sake no faculty is really interested in you and your participation in University competition.students having potential are not supported and the curriculum is hectic. Once you r in it will teach you a lot but my friend this is life and yes infrastructure,sports ,faculty does not make a great college ,the students are those which should acknowledge their potential and make use of the provided resources effectively.many of my friends are preparing for civil services,cat ,defence and I promise you will be surrounded by various students of near your age group which are hard-working and which will indirectly motivate you to do something great in your life .Being an open candidates I feel the fees is a bit higher for any government college bt as an autonomous we can't do anything for it . IF YOU ARE NOT SURE OF YOUR INTEREST IN TECHNICAL EDUCATION JOIN THIS INSTITUTION AS IT WILL HELP YOU TO FIND OUT WHT IS REALLY MADE FOR YOU . I have joined this institution because I was not having a good score in my jee exams and was not willing to repeat the shit again\ud83d\ude02.one thing I can make sure that you will enjoy the engineering phase a lot \ud83d\ude0e . All the best ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry for answering late. I\u2019ll answer it in response to your answer Girish Agrawal , just to make you nostalgic maybe. Forgive me for that. First of all I\u2019ll be graduating from IT in 2018. I am a T and P coordinator (Training and Placement), so I do have a little idea of placement scenario, at least of our branch. Overall status of our college, people still take admissions here, coz it\u2019s a government college. Quality of faculty again varies from department to department. Civil is still the best department in case of faculties and civil engineering students are still troubled by the faculties the same way but they do admit to learning something. ENTC is the same, according to what my friends tell me. Yes, ENTC has got internet and wifi(shockingly true) as well. Other departments still have the same buildings, more or less. The department building of Electrical was renovated recently. Everything else is the same. Talking about the placement records, there\u2019s been a recession in our field, so the placements of our previous batch were hit and we\u2019ll most probably suffer the same fate. but decent companies do come for placements for core and non-core branches alike. Prajwalan(our technical festival) is rocking, with all it\u2019s glory. There are various other events like Zenith (annual cultural gathering), Mudliyar (Oratory skills competition), Aura of art (art competition), Aagaz (hobby competition), Kalpana Chawla Trophy (annual sports competition) where students of every branch show true patriotism and Alumni meet (an event where the batch that passed out 25 years from this year, is invited again for a two day reunion to remind them of their engineering days and also to guide today\u2019s students). Talking about our department, we attend some lectures to learn, while some, for attendance. The expert faculties, however, are very supporting in case of developing project(s). One of the boys hostel buildings has been renovated in last summer. The old girls hostel is also being renovated. A new hostel is also being built as I write this answer. Some things still suck, like the internet/wifi speeds(which do work wonders sometimes), the taste of canteen food (except tea), non availability of library books at times, the paid parking, which is rented to a different dealer every time and hence is paid etc. But if you want to learn to become an engineer, it is a good place. You will find all kinds of students, not just the ones who are here to become engineers, but also aspiring singers, aspiring artists etc. My advice to you will be, if you can get admitted here, do it if you want to develop yourself on all aspects, study hard and score marks, speak confidently, participate in cultural and technical festivals, enjoy your little mischiefs around the campus and get a worthy experience of your life. Good luck\u2026!!! ",
