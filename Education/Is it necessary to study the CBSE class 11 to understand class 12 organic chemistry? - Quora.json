            "answer_text": "Hey there. Honestly speaking class 12 chemistry is quiet different from class 11 and inorganic chemistry is a vast topic in it. There's no need to study class 11 inorganic to understand class 12 inorganic but u might have to remember some names , properties l, position of some 11 class inorganic. This is it. But keep in mind chemistry is fun. Better understand and read. Focus good in organic both class 11 and 12 although both are different. Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest that you go through basic concepts of organic chemistry thats there in class XI. Resonance, conjugation, hyperconjugation, inductive effect and stuff like that. Understand it well as it is immensely useful for JEE or NEET prep. If you are someone with good understanding capacity, fore-knowledge do help you in complex reactions by doing mechanism based method. Instead of mugging up everything, try and understand logic behind the reaction. Good Luck! ",
