            "answer_text": "Naturally I\u2019m biased, but my vote is for Modern React with Redux - Udemy. I\u2019ve looked at several other courses on React (in addition to many other tech courses), and built my React courses to be the education experience that I would have wanted when I was first learning a lot of these topics. Most other courses fall into two traps: The \u201cLet me tell you about xyz\u201d course: this is the kind of course where an instructor has a lot to say about a particular topic, but not a lot of hands on coding. I don\u2019t understand this methodology for learning any technical topic at all. The only way to learn new tech is by completing hands-on projects.The \u201cLet\u2019s \u2018write\u2019 some code\u201d course: this is the kind of course where the instructor does work on projects, but most of it ends up being a lot of copy pasting of code into your editor without knowledge of what that code does.I found these two types of courses to be nearly useless when learning new concepts, so I set out to make all of my content avoid both patterns. All of my courses is strictly hands on projects where each (and I do mean each) line of code is discussed before we write it (or shortly after). In addition, I always try to avoid taking the easy way out for any particular project. By that, I mean to say that I do not teach patterns that work on some tiny example but are not applicable to larger production-scale apps. Now there are limits to this, of course, but I do my best :) If you take my course on React/Redux, you\u2019ll also be set up to get started on my follow up course Advanced React and Redux - Udem, which is, as far as I know, the only video course online that delves into complex topics like middleware and higher order components in Redux. So to me, the choice is clear, but do let me know if you have any follow up questions. Last thing- here are coupon codes to get both my starter + advanced course for $19: Modern React with Redux - UdemyAdvanced React and Redux - Udemy",

            "answer_text": "I think the best one is located right here: Getting Started | React Unlike a number of other libraries, React does a lot of the work under the hood and instead just exposes a small number of important APIs. For this reason, it\u2019s not really important to go out in search of courses, but rather just to familiarize yourself with the important APIs and build small applications. While I love the React community, I fear that many of its \u201ctutorials\u201d are too forward-leaning to really benefit anyone new to the community. Many expect you to understand their examples in ES6, assume you\u2019re running your code through a Babel plugin for Webpack, assume you\u2019re already concerned about application state and in need of Flux/Redux, etc. And god forbid hot reloading doesn\u2019t give you an awkward boner. Stick to the base tutorial, build yourself \u201csmall, shitty apps\u201d and over time it will click. Once it does, slowly introduce yourself to the variety of awesome, shiny features that the community has developed to solve your needs. ",
