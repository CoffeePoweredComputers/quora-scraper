            "answer_text": "Hey Ayush! I will recommend you to start your class-11th syllabus from the beginning of the session itself\u2026 Although class-11 grades do not matter at all.. and therefore many children end up postponing or neglecting studies for the sake of high school enjoyment\u2026 But trust me\u2026 studies of class-11th are conceptual and prepare your base for class-12th.. so if you are planning to score good in your boards next to next year.. then you should have a clarity of class-11th subjects as well as concepts too.. Since in this lockdown situation you won't be able to focus much on studies\u2026 but do believe in the power of self study.. and contribute some time daily on practical subjects\u2026. Hope this helps.. Goodluck Stay safe Stuti.. ",
