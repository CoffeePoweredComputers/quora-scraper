            "answer_text": "Great question! To find trending topics for content creation, you have three options. One is pretty simple but not very helpful, and the other two have everything to do with an amazing product called TuBeast, which I\u2019ll explain more about a little bit later. Full disclosure: I work for TuBeast, but I can honestly say that they are the best in the business. Their tools are like none others. Anyways, back to my answer. The first way you can find out what trending topics you should create content about is through YouTube\u2019s Trending Tab.  This route might not necessarily be beneficial for you, though, because it\u2019s usually full of music videos and not necessarily your \u201cregular\u201d YouTube videos. If you\u2019re not a musician, this path isn\u2019t going to lead you anywhere. The second option you have is to use TuBeast\u2019s YouTube Keyword Tool. With this tool, you can find trending searches for a given keyword of your choice, which makes finding trending topics to create videos about much, much easier. You can learn more about this tool in this video:  The third option you have is to use TuBeast\u2019s Advanced Topic Research to find what people are actually talking about if you have a topic you want to create a video about in mind. You can learn more about this tool in the following video:  Let me know if you have any further questions about this topic, I\u2019d love to help! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Reaching a hundred subscribers is arguably the most important milestone for the channel because it means that you\u2019re starting to gain some momentum. When I started my own Youtube channel there were some obstacles that were coming in my way like bad content, sound, bad traffic and not personalizing my account. Then I started to improve in these aspects and I started to improve my views but it was not enough then I heard about Instant Views and now I have more than 300,000 views. Here\u2019s how to get to that first hundred subscribers: 1.Monitor your YouTube analytics to see which videos will get you your first 100 subscribers In your YouTube analytics, you can see which videos are producing the most number of subscribers, and once you can see which types of videos are bringing you in subscribers, just keep making more videos just like that. 2. Make sure you add a YouTube Auto Subscribe Link in the description of your video I have a client who\u2019s used this technique to increase the number of subscribers by 40 percent in the past month. 3.Create a release schedule and talk about it in your weekly YouTube videos When you go to any YouTube channel, you\u2019ll see that every channel has a banner, and you want to make sure, if you\u2019re going to be releasing one video a week, make sure you choose a day of the week that you release it.
