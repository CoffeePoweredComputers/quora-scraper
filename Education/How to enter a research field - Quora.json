            "answer_text": "Can anyone become a researcher? As a career, with enough dedication and hard work, anyone with reasonable levels of intelligence should be able to become a researcher. If you want to do it as a hobby, absolutely! I began researching resilience in 1995 to answer a question I had, \u201cWhat makes some humans thrive in spite of adversity?\u201d My research included primary research where I observed people and made notes about what seemed to work and what didn\u2019t work. It also involved reading. Then, when I noticed patterns in people who thrived in spite of adversity, I began applying what they did in my own life. When it helped me, I taught friends what I was doing. Then I began a We are what we do | Meetup to teach others what I had learned. Then I wanted to know more than what was in the books so I started pulling the actual research cited in books I was reading which led to learning there is more research than one person could read in a lifetime and a switch in my reading habits from books to peer-reviewed journal articles. I still read some books but mostly I read research articles because it takes years for the information in research to become common knowledge and I want answers sooner than that. Begin with a question. Don\u2019t be afraid of a big question. I had a lot of researchers associated with Universities tell me my question was too broad to answer. They were right if I did all the research or attempted to answer it in one silo of science. They were wrong if I approached it by reading other people\u2019s research and delving into many different scientific disciplines. I\u2019d be happy to match my knowledge and the strategies I\u2019ve developed against the knowledge and strategies anyone from any University has developed. ",

            "answer_text": "The physician who sets clear objectives for his participation in a clinical trial has a greater likelihood of reaping the desired rewards of such an undertaking. There are many worthwhile reasons for entering the research field, but there is also a price for doing so. The purpose of this chapter is to outline these potential rewards and drawbacks so the prospective investigator will be better prepared to assess the scope of the responsibility he is considering. While research may seem to offer a ready solution to short-term economic or professional needs, hastily initiated protocols rarely produce the desired results for either the investigator or the sponsor. Conversely, investigators who take the opportunity to prepare their colleagues and employees for the changes that can be expected will enjoy much more cooperation when the new responsibilities and tasks must be faced. The motivation of the PI is such a critical ingredient to the success of a clinical trial that he should make the effort to define his expectations and consider their price before entering into a commitment from which he cannot withdraw easily or inexpensively. The investigator must be willing to weigh the benefits he has identified against the many personal or professional sacrifices that will be required. These considerations must be addressed at two critical points in the planning process: (1) when the possibility of entering the research field is being considered, and (2) when a specific protocol is being reviewed so the staff does not find itself saddled with a burdensome protocol not suited to the facility. If the general objectives of the endeavor have been clearly established, deciding whether a particular research protocol is an appropriate undertaking should require little effort. I would advise contacting your college professors, especially those who teach particular  courses, and see if they have any research opportunities. Sometimes, professors/instructors will be in the middle of doing a research project and would welcome assistance from students. It helps them and it helps you; it helps them because they can get their projects completed quicker, and it helps you because it gets you research experience and the opportunity to put the research on your resume.

            "answer_text": "In theory yes, however there are a lot of other factors that are important and may effectively exclude you. (a) You need to have the intellect and temperment required. Less than 1% of the population has it and the education system actually selects for the booksmart who are not necessarily very intelligent or capable of thinking for themselves. You might be seriously misled by the qualifications you seem to have that are in reality Space Cadet Academy certificates. For example, to understand modern biology you need a great deal of maths, statistics, chemistry and physics which many students take a path of least resistance to avoid. (b) I am an atheist and I have no comprehension how someone who believes in god or gods can function in a laboratory. Despite all the propaganda to the contrary I cannot see how they can function. I just cannot understand how. In my life career I have only encountered a few such people and in every case they were not religiously orthodox. (c) You may encounter heavy opposition from your family because of the obligations imposed on you by your career choice. \u201cBreadwinner\u201d obligations have a habit of destroying careers and usually end up taking the bread off the table anyway. (d) I have worked on 4 continents. Typically in a lab you find that no two people share a common first language. If you do not come from an open society the fact that no-one else in your laboratory shares your culture or cares a damn about it can be disorienting and isolating. (e) You need enough money to be financially independent and have no debt. Do not believe otherwise because you will suffer a lot of pain. (f) Science is not fully functional meritocracy, you do need some core ability but much depends on pure dumb luck and who will help you in your career and who will not (in Australian English \u201cwhose mate you are\u201d).

            "answer_text": "Much depends on what you want to research and the objective. I am just a researcher into technologies other people carry out physical research e.g chemists, computer scientists, AI researchers etc. The key is that people and companies are always happy to pay for information if it impacts their current or future earnings! For example I get paid to look at the impact of Biotechnology, Nanotechnology and Anti-Aging Medicine by some insurance, medical and pension companies, sometimes I also get enquiries from builders/planners of retirement homes etc. One said \u201cwhat happens if and when there are no longer old and infirm people to live there?\u201d I said \u201cit's not going to be a problem, the primary issue will be the transition from the old usage to the new. This is because with a bit of thought it becomes clear that retirement properties would potentially also suit young single people in their 20s, the large communal lounge would work well as a games, TV or social area as would the large outdoor spaces for barbecues, socialising etc in the summer. Also young people in common with the elderly do not need a huge amount of space or vast kitchens so the small one bedroom apartments would work very well, there is also the potential to upsize because most of the retirement communities have two bedroom apartments as well so it's just simply a question of looking at what amounts to a change of use and using a bit of imagination\u201d once all this is explained it becomes clear there is still potential to charge management fees etc because most young people in their 20s do not want to spend the whole time digging gardens and mowing lawns which is something they have in common with the elderly but for different reasons. As far as being researcher it's all about carving out a niche and being enthusiastic about a subject about which you know more than others. For me personally whilst I am not a futurologist per se I am good at looking at trends and a track record helps. A friend of mine researches availability of collectable classic cars and motorcycles, he knows the subject inside out and at 68 years old has owned, ridden and driven countless machines. When I told him that I wanted a 1968-1972 T120 Triumph Bonneville in perfect condition ready to ride and original he found it for me within the week! If I had done it personally I would've wasted a great deal of time and effort, though he didn't charge me anything for finding it if I had been an average client it would have been worth the $450 cost that he charges to find the right machine.

There are probably other careers in which people smart enough to be researchers can make a lot more money and can achieve success more quickly.You must have a certain level of talent in your area \u2014 the amount and exact requirements varies. Maybe this is something that most people can learn if they are determined enough, but maybe not.You must have certain personality traits, such as persistence and the ability to accept and learn from criticism.You need training, which (depending on your circumstances and accidents of birth) may mean that you need luck or connections or super-human determination to get that.But if you think you have all that and think you really want this, try it and see what happens. You may succeed. Or you may find that it\u2019s not the life for you after all, but there are lots of good fallback positions in most fields. ",

            "answer_text": "Different people will give you different answers, and they would all probably have very, good ideas. No one person has a correct answer, because there are so many different disciplines. One important aspect to keep in mind is that you should not have a narrow focus. Let\u2019s take a discipline like law, for instance. You might have an idea of what you would specialize in eventually, but law has such a broad scope that you really do need to research widely, not just so that you can make an informed decision further down the line, but so that you are always able to refer to references that lead to better decision-making. That is just as far as law is concerned. That does not mean that your research should end with law per se. You would make for a better researcher if you were to go beyond your discipline. It would be very useful to delve into sociology, psychology, aspects of medical practice, languages etc. I have come across quite a number of lawyers and medical doctors who have no reasonable knowledge of Fine Art or Music. Now, you might argue that it is not necessary to have such a wide/broad scope of subject knowledge for you to be a successful professional in your chosen path, but, and this is important, I\u2019ve seen the embarrassment when people come up short with very basic information. If you cast your net wider than you originally had in mind, the chances are that you would end up accumulating really interesting data, because you have included references that a lessor researcher might not have considered.

            "answer_text": "Wow, quite the question, and one that I\u2019ve asked myself. It depends if you need funding or not. If you need funding, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I am currently in the process of self-funding research that\u2019s more or less on the fringes of the mainstream for my field. I\u2019m doing it because I want to, because I think my questions are interesting. In some cases during the process, I have found others who are interested and have tentatively offered help. I will take it if they can end up offering, but otherwise I am on my own to push forward. How do I push forward? I go in phases: Observing the natural world, reflecting on observations, researching how I would model or quantify observations relating to questions I come up with.Finding out what\u2019s out there already for a given topic. You can find all sorts of published work for any field of interest via scholar.google.com, and use sci-hub.tw , or e-mail authors for full-text copies of any paper. libgen.io works for books.Work in your field of interest in some capacity that you can stomach, and eventually you are going to run into people who will support your ideas and potentially help you with permits and/or resources.Make some money that you can use during other parts of the year when you are pursuing your research.We\u2019ll see how it pans out for me and I can update by this time next year. I hope to have made a lot of money over the winter, to fund my part of a collaborative study with the people I currently work for (next March-May), then an independent study Jun-Jul. Or go to the university and find an agency or institution you can work for, write grant proposals etc., the more conventional way, with which I have very little experience. ",

You may investigate upon it and find a problem of interest.If you have found the problem the next stage is working hard to find a solution. You may talk to an expert in your field for guidance.The journey for solution is the real research. You might take months to make a small advancement. Don't feel disappointed.Record and Publish your each advancements in journals. This will provide exposure for your work and help you to make improvements.Finally you will find solution.

Usually, it takes a degree or two to give them that assurance. You probably also need some expertise in that field so that you know how to research it. Again, a degree in that field helps. If you want to work at a university, you\u2019d need to be a grad student there or have a PhD. Keep in mind that there are a lot of unemployed PhDs out there who would love to be researchers. But if you know a writer, and you can convince that writer that you will do research for them, great. Just don\u2019t expect to make a living at that. ",

Successfully Completing your Thesis under the guidance of your professor as a part of Phd Degree will give you a taste of Research. Meanwhile you will get in touch with many other scholars and researchers and all you need is their support and funding and you can start your own research. If you are a graduate or Post Graduate and already working in any company, then you can contact your seniors about the type of profile required by the Research and Development department within your organisation. But in this case, you need a lot of experience, not the Phd. ",

Answering you question exactly you need to pass your Graduate or Post graduate in intrested discipline and undergo certain exams like NET/GATE/etc. For gaining financial assistance and good research centres. You can pursue your dreams while your are still in college by just working on certain topics and making detailed assignments to submit your research work across the learning & teaching community.
