            "answer_text": "It depends a lot on your situation. I studied for a period, exclusively. Then I worked and studied. Then again I studied exclusively for a period. Then again I studied and worked. My parents decided that I should work and study. I did. For a period under them. Studying and working is harder on you. I never had pocket money. My brother did, and much more. He had more support from my parents than I did. Your situation, feeling, is important. There are people out there who started working early and have only elementary studies, who made it BIG. They\u00b4re self-made men. They went through a lot of failures (that\u00b4s how we learn), but made it. But not everybody is like them. Others become big by studying, but mostly from meeting the right people and getting the \u201cright\u201d job, through contacts with ex-mates, students. What will you do with the money? If it is just to spend it all, don\u00b4t start working. If it is to be balanced about it - saving some and investing wisely to get accruement, then why not? - When you work the whole scene changes, you tend to become more responsible, to have the real thing, live life as it is. You become more autonomous. But you also want to get a job that pays well, that you enjoy, that gives you time for yourself. You don\u00b4t want a job that is just work and no fun, there is no time for much besides work. If you manage both, good, but it won\u00b4t be easy. In the past children started working quite early. Some became very successful. But then you do not enjoy your childhood as you should, because it\u00b4s a time that will not come back, even though at heart you remain one. Money helps a lot, but is not everything. School helps a lot, but is not everything. The more studies you have, however, the big chances you have of getting better jobs, quicker promotions, etc., as a rule, although there are exceptions of success from those who had little or no schooling. It\u00b4s a big decision, that will impact your life, you should really think well over it, weighing pros and cons. ",

            "answer_text": "School work. Education is absolutely vital for a healthy, well-rounded life for thousands of reasons, and research shows time and time again that it leads to happier and more prepared individuals. Also, having more educated people in the world will make it advance exponentially. Capitalism (well, most economic systems) teach people that if they aren't making money, they're wasting time. Think about how someone taking an hour out of their day to enjoy their favorite show can be looked down upon, because they aren't making money. Yes, money is vital for survival in this cruel world, but people are allowed to actually enjoy their life as well. Especially children. They're more innocent, they have less things on their mind, they should be able to take advantage of that and have fun when they can. Plus, play and personal time are both very important for development of a well-rounded individual (along with education) as it allows them to discover who they are and what they want. There are plenty of ways to teach a child about how money works without making them sacrifice those crucial development years. Just showing them expenses like on a grocery receipt and explaining income will give them an idea, or giving them a theoretical budget and having them \u201cshop\" at the store (obviously you would be doing the actual shopping, just pretending to give them full autonomy in the situation). That can also be turned into a game, and it's very informative. ",
