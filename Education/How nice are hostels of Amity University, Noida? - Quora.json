            "answer_text": "They are the worst kind of hostels anyone can ever see that too with price too high for hostel and that too excluding mess charges. The only advantage is that being in amity you probably reach in class on time. Otherwise every thing is worst in hostel no differentiation in UG and PG students and also the environment of hostel is such that you can never study with concentration as there are so many students here (around 500 in one hostel) and that to they are doing all sorta of things in hostel and starts shouting suddenly in night time and that too whole night, from how many student you will ask to shut up but they will keep doing the same, no ambiance to study dull lights, no privacy. The rooms are basicaly designed with no particular form and shape and also not designed for 3 students in single room but they will put three students in one room.They will not give any added advantage to UG students that they are doing higher studies so they should be given more preferance and should not be disturbed, also most the time the request for changing the room is not permitted so if you are stuck with disturbing room mate you are stuck for whole year almost this is confirmed. The hostel feels like jail you are not allowed to go any where after 9PM not allowed even to roam in campus and also from one hostel to another you are not allowed to go even in day time, the water for bathing purpose is also not good and everytime there is some or other construction or repair work going on in hostel believe me this is very disturbing if are get disturbed easily hostel is not you place, so if you are looking for quite environment believe me never come in hostel, you have to sign attendance register daily at night even if you are present in hostel and you want to sleep so that you can study later when less noisy environment is there, they will put the register around 8PM at night on the ground floor table then you sign and sometime when you dont go in class in class they will ask why you are not going to class, even if you have that day off they will try to disturb you any way they like and also finds new ways to do so, just for showing that we care for you which they definetly not, and one you paid the fees for hostel you are trapped in their for one year and you cannot leave the hostel after 3 month of joining and they will deduct 6 month of hostel charge for that. Everywhere you have to go with id card and punch it which most of the time dont work but its just a showoff. Believe me taking hostel is work decision i took in Amity, also the amount which you pay them is way above what they should give you so please dont opt for hostel at least i can say that and also ask senior which you may know and ask 100 times and be sure before you come to amity and ask about the placements also.

Hostel Life\u2026\u2026Wow! Excited! I have lived in hostel and I hope this will help you get a clear picture of the kind of life a hosteller leads at the Lovely Professional University.I feel like I\u2019m fully eligible to answer this question. The major concern of the parents is the security and safety of their children and LPU is well known for its security. Turnstiles gates are there at the entry of hostels so that no other person should enter the hostel. Since LPU has this very BIG Campus So, the girls hostels are at the beginning of the Campus and ends in between the Campus and from there starts the Boys Hostel and ends at the end of the Campus and So, you will get a choice to choose your hostel near to your block. When I first entered LPU I was feeling fascinated by looking at the infrastructure of the Campus and on the other hand I was also feeling very nervous about my life at Campus Hostel but trust me I shouldn\u2019t have been because I had an awesome Hostel Life, Made so many friends, created so many memories, learned from many experiences, etc. To some people a hostel may sound like restriction but to me it never was, I always had my own enough space.I have lived in a Flat outside Campus and inside Campus hostel too. If I had to rate between the both , The Hostel life was much much better. All facilitates are provided at the Campus Hostel and you\u2019ll have the complete choice to choose the accommodation that suits you and your budget. I can tell you everything is available inside campus so you don\u2019t need to worry about anything. Uni mall is present in LPU which consists of everything whether it is clothing,cosmetics,grocery,accessories,electronics etc. Tuck shops are present within hostels from there also you can buy things of your choice like mattress, blankets etc. Canteens and food stalls are also present with all kinds of food like south indian, north indian, chinese food etc.Zero Ragging/ Zero Discrimination : Nobody is ragged at LPU, This word actually doesn\u2019t exists here. There is a complete secularism in the LPU hostel life as you will find seniors and juniors treated similarly at the Campus and even at the Hostel. So, there is no division among the students as per their academic year like other campus hostel\u2019s. Students from the various ends of the country/ neighboring countries come and join LPU and lives in the same Hostel without any discrimination.Food/ Mess : Honestly I won\u2019t lie about the mess at campus, because I myself took food for the first 6 months at the hostel mess until I explored other good places but there are so many people who actually like mess. If you\u2019r one of them very good and if not then fab you\u2019r in my gang so, you don\u2019t have to worry at all for the food at LPU because there are like 358+ shops inside the campus providing all varieties of food from continental to south Indian and that too at very mediocre rates. Some days if you don\u2019t feel like going out you can even order at Dominoes, go to CCD, Mall, etc Food is not at all a problem at LPU.Outdoor Games/ Indoor Games/Gym : There are so many places at Campus for out door games and as well as indoor games. Some are campus properties and some are vendor properties (game parlors) where you\u2019ll have to pay to play. Everything is fun wherever you fit in yourself.No outsiders are allowed in the university without a gate pass. Meaning even if parents of students come for visit, they have the access to university through gate pass only.Any publicly offensive acts are clearly not allowed in the university and strict actions are taken against such act.Other than this if any girl faces any issues regarding anything that she faces, she can file a complain of the RMS, against that particular issues or person, strict actions are taken immediately by the authorities. Other than this, in case of emotional breakdowns, there are happiness cells available in the university where anyone can go and discuss their problemsPersonal Experience: Getting bored is not an option at LPU because you\u2019ll be busy with your classes for more than half of the day and other time with habits and passion if you\u2019r a passion follower and If not you\u2019ll become one before you leave LPU. Here you\u2019ll find many like that! After getting free from all this then you\u2019ll barely have sometime with your hostel mates or roommates but still they will always remain an integral part of your life. I have learnt a lot during my days, you\u2019ll too but never let it ruin your true self. There will be times when situation will demand a change, go with your own decision(right or wrong) and never ever listen to the crowd because they\u2019ll always try to make you part of them which you aren\u2019t born to be!

            "answer_text": "In June 2015 a young guy was very excited as he was about to start his college life and for the first time in his life he was about to leave his home and was suppose to go to Noida for further studies. He took admission in Amity and opted for hostel.He was given a bunk bed room which typically means that there were two bunk beds and four people inside a tiny little room.  The picture of bunk bed might look good but the reality is not. All this was fine he thought that no problem of bunk bed I will still spend my time with my friends and will go out and explore places but then suddenly a thunder striked him and he got to know that he was not allowed to leave the campus premises from Monday to Friday and he was like  Again he thought that no problem\u2026.I would go out on weekends and would enjoy and once again Amity was like  You will have to get a day pass from your warden which would be valid till 6 PM and if you are late then you will have to face the consequences and for leaving the hostel on night you will have to get night pass which will be issued after your parents message your warden and your warden verifies the message and then he would issue it\u2026the problem is not about getting the hostel pass the problem is struggle that we have to do to get the pass it will be issued only in the morning so if by chance you slept till 11 AM on a so called pleasant weekend keep sleeping bro no chance of you getting out. Hostel gates were closed at 9 PM and after that you are stuck in your room until sun rises again. A few months passed and I was like  Everyday was important for me and all I wanted was freedom somehow a year passed and I immediately got a flat in Noida with some of my friends and I lived happily ever after and yes the story is about me. PS:Do not consider hostel life to be as bad as described in this answer I have had many memorable memories in hostel too but I thought that freedom was the most necessary thing for me. ",

For those coming to study at Amity University Noida I would recommend choosing Placio for staying which provides them professionally managed student housing facilities on co-living basis. Comfort to luxury options are available for both male and female students, separately. The compounds are guarded by security personnel 24/7. Placio also provided 24/7 SOS helpline to help student residents in case of emergencies - personal or medical. At Placio verified properties students get services like housekeeping, maintenance, buffet and lot more. There are no unnecessary curfew hours so that students can enjoy safe and independent life. Placio also provides things like pick-up and drop facility to Amity University, student cards, customer support, parking areas, gaming areas,etc. A completely unparalleled student co-living experience in Noida.

            "answer_text": "Amity University is located in Sector 125 Noida. There are two types of hostels AC and Non AC. It depends on you now which hostel ypu choose. AC hostels have single occupied rooms and a common room for 4 such rooms. Whereas Non AC are double or triple sharing. But if you are too lucky enough, you can be alloted a single room in Non AC too. They are good. Atleast better than hostels of many other private universities but yes rooms are a bit less spacy but that is okay if you are alloted single room. There are cafeterias in campus which will offer you variety of food. If you take my suggestion, spend your 1st and 2nd year in Amity hostels and then you can move out to flats. That will be best. Also keep your attendance and CGPA good. Else you may have the chance of losing hostels in the next sessions. Amity is too serious about attendance. Also, the in timings of the hostel is 10pm. ",

You will see,  your friends going in and out of college every time,  but you can't be able to go,  because you are hostlier.  (But you can always pay the guard 10-50 Rs.)  Seriously,  they can leave you,  for 10 Rs.  The only positive thing Is that....  You are safe there. ",

The AC hostels resemble a quality hotel and the Non AC ones are good and decent, with less amenties. Single room and double rooms are available. There is no mess facility as such like in other colleges. You can buy food at its price from the canteen in the Hostel Block (H-Block) or from other restaurants like Dominos , Subway, Wall Street, Bikano, Amul, Popcorns and More etc. In a nutshell, hostels are good. As a first year student, you should definitely consider the hostel if you live far away as timing of classes is from 9\u20135. As you get accustomed to college life, you can move to a Paying Guest Accommodation, though, I still recommend Hostel considering safety and convenience to attend classes on the go. ",

Yes, it won't be as close by but there are so many benefits of Stanza Living that made me choose it over the campus hostel. At Stanza Living they have many social and career-enhancement events. These are so much fun and we get to learn a lot from them as well! Of course, the basic necessities are covered too and I must say the quality of the services here are great. ",
