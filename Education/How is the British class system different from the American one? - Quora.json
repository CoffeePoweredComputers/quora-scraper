            "answer_text": "It would save a lot of time to be clear about what the class structure is, and what it\u2019s based on. Class is about a position in the institutional structure that governs the economy. That\u2019s because this is the main thing that will determine income and thus your overall life prospects. So the owners are the dominant class and that means the people at the top are the major owners of the businesses and banks. But there are degrees of size of businesses and the distinction between the capitalist elite and the small business element is a fuzzy boundary \u2014 but there is this distinction in both countries. In \u201cThe Meaning of Marxism\u201d by (non-Marxist) British socialist GDH Cole \u2014 writing in the \u201940s \u2014 he notices that the change from the old to the new middle class had advanced very far in UK. This was also occurring in USA. So what is this distinction? The old middle class were people who owned a farm or small business, like a small grocery or an owner of a small factory. As Cole points out, this class had already very greatly declined in Britain by the \u201930s and \u201840s. But he also notes that members of the families with this background often moved on to the new kind of middle class position \u2014 as salaried professionals, managers and government officials. Among professionals Cole also notes the distinction between the people in some kind of administrative power position related to other workers \u2014 like a company lawyer, or whatever \u2014 versus the lower level professionals who he calls \u201cthe black coated proletariat\u201d. I suppose this is because in the \u201940s in Britain it was standard garb back then for the lower level professionals \u2014 teachers, librarians, social workers and what not \u2014 to wear suits. I think he probably would include office clerks and sales people among the \u201cblack coated proletariat\u201d. The working class is very much the majority in both UK and USA. This class is made up of those who who have no independent source of livelihood \u2014 such as property income or owning a small business. So they must seek work from employers, and they work in subordinate positions. They do not have power to manage other workers, such as power of hiring and firing and the like. So this is the working class, and its more than 60 percent of the economically active population in USA \u2014 more if we add the lower level professionals like teachers, staff writers and the like. In that case more like three fourths. (On the size of the working class in the USA, see Michael Zweig, \u201cThe Working Class Majority\u201d.) Union membership is much higher in UK than in USA where it is now only 11 percent (less than 7 percent in the private sector \u2014 about where it was at in 1930). On the other hand, I have the impression that de-industrialization has gone farther in the UK than in the USA. I don\u2019t have the statistics on this at my fingertips but USA still produces 19 percent of total world manufactured output. Wages and the situation of the working class in general have declined in both countries but I think in different ways \u2014 workers in UK have the NHS, not the horrid health non-system we have in USA. In the USA this deterioration in the life prospects of the working class has gone very far. Wealth inequality is more extreme in the USA. Also, social mobility is actually lower in USA than in any of the countries of northern Europe. Thus the class structure of the USA has become quite rigid. Because the USA didn\u2019t inherit any European feudal structure the various effects or echoes of that in UK or other Euro countries we don\u2019t have, so this can lead to a misleading impression of the USA \u2014 in fact inequality of social circumstances between the lower working class and the upper 10 percent has gotten to be very extreme in the USA. As Irene Colthurst points out in her answer, the USA has inherited the racist legacy of the slave regime set up under the early British colonialism here. As a result of this social practices of racializing disfavored groups\u2014 especially people of African ancestry \u2014 became entrenched, and there is still both a very high level of racial inequality and also persistent patterns of race discrimination. A reason for the weaker state of unions in the USA versus UK is that racism tends to interfere with the practice of social solidarity among the working class population. Distrust of the racialized \u201cOther\u201d places bounds on solidarity. So you get this \u201cI\u2019ve got mine Jack\u201d American individualism that looks askance at any social benefits going to the racial \u201cOther\u201d. Because of high levels of immigration and racial division, it was difficult to obtain a high level of solidarity between workers in struggles against the employers and this tended to weaken the ability of the working class to build unions. The period of greatest growth of unions in the \u201930s and \u201940s was also the point of origin \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t a coincidence \u2014 for the civil rights movement of the \u201950s and \u201860s. As we see nowadays racial division is still alive and well in the ability of politicians to make gains for themselves (I\u2019m talking about the Republicans) by appeal to white identity politics. And thus working class activists (such as people who organize unions) have to work to overcome this problem. I\u2019m not saying racism doesn\u2019t exist in the UK but it has a different and probably more subtle character. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a difficult question to answer, not least because the reality of the British class system is tough to define these days, and the American one even harder. There are many similarities. Although it is extremely difficult to get people to agree on definitions of these terms, in both countries I would say the middle class is very large, encompassing many people who would once have been thought of as \u201cworking class\u201d. In both countries there is a poor underclass which again is very different from the \u201cworking class\u201d of old. In both the upper class is very small, and less obviously deferred to than it once was, though it may still retain considerable power. And in both countries social tension these days is often between the middle class and the underclass, not the working and the middle, let alone the working/middle and the upper. But there are some fairly clear differences. One of the most obvious and commonly-discussed ones is that there is more social mobility in the US than in the UK - it is easier to move up (or down) between classes. While social mobility in the UK has certainly increased a lot over the last half-century or so, I think this is still true - movement is smoother in the US. Perhaps the biggest difference concerns the upper class. In the UK membership of the true upper class (as opposed to the upper-middle class, itself also wealthy and powerful) is defined almost entirely by ancestry, not by wealth or power. A quite poor and little-known person can still very much be a member of the British upper class purely by virtue of who they are descended from. This is of course encapsulated in the system of hereditary titles. (It is worth mentioning in passing here, though, that relationship to the royal family is not a criterion - although some members of the nobility are related to the royals, many are not. At some point in the past, perhaps many centuries ago, a monarch probably gave one of their ancestors a hereditary title.) Related to this, there is a very strong association between the British upper class and land - perhaps a single county, or even a single house - which I don\u2019t think really has a parallel in the US upper class. Of course the American aristocracy has its great houses. But in the UK, the ancestral mansion and its associated land may be almost the embodiment of the upper-class family, and the thing it is most famous for. This, of course, derives from the old feudal system where lords did pretty much control - on a day-to-day basis - specific areas of land. (That continued to some extent well into the 20th century, with the \u201clord of the manor\u201d being a mini-dictator in rural areas, although of course feudalism itself had long disappeared by then.) And it is illustrated, of course, in the way that the titles of the nobility incorporate the names of towns or regions - Duke of Norfolk, for example. The upshot of all this is that membership of the British upper class is all about family history to an even greater extent than in the American case - the individual hardly matters at all - in fact, they are usually better-known by their title rather than their actual name.

            "answer_text": "Writing about \u201cclass\u201d gets my hair standing on end, so I shall be brief as possible, to save my BP from spiking! In Britain class is defined very roughly along these lines: Aristocracy - royalty on down to earls, dukes etc . Upper class - includes highly respected professionals (professors, judges, surgeons, some doctors and lawyers, some wealthy merchants.) Middle class - comfortably off well-educated groups but not considered quite as as elite as the upper class . Working class - Basically everybody else who need to work for a living. The homeless and jobless - those relying on government assistance. The USA class system. I used to be under the impression that the USA didn\u2019t deal in \u201cclass\u201d ! I\u2019m not as educated in the USA class system since I\u2019ve been here only 14 years as against 60+ in the UK - but these are the points I can come up with so far: No aristocracy in the USA, nothing quite as elegant, but in its place is an often rather ugly oligarchy. Anything close to \u201cupper class\u201d here relates more often to wealth rather than to high-class skills and talent. Working class in the UK = middle class in the USA - and that says a lot. Many Americans simply cannot bear being termed \u201cworking class\u201d for some strange reason. The homeless and jobless here are not treated with quite as much compassion as they are (for the most part) in the UK. Thanks for the A2A. ",

The problem is that while once there was a clear working class who carried out primary and secondary jobs (mainly mining and manufacturing), such jobs are much less common in the UK now. They still exist, but the majority of people do office work, retail, that sort of thing. There are still large numbers of farms in rural areas, but wages are good. It\u2019s similar to the US, really. There seems to be no clear working or middle class,because the vast majority (who once would have been working class) either do middle class jobs, or are paid higher wages for working class jobs. However, there is one key difference. Money is the bedrock of US Society, the elite are the always the richest people. On the other hand, in the UK we have an aristocracy, so this is different. Yet even the aristocracy, today, often mingle with everybody else. In UK society today there are no strict classes. ",

Upper class usually meant that they went to a good private school didn\u2019t work as they didn\u2019t need to and were landowners!

He works outside all day with his hands. He attended the private school Gordounstoun where Prince Philip, Charles and Andrew had previously been. He ticks the first and third boxes. I attended a lesser private school, university, have a profession, am a landowner and private wealth. I tick the second and third. The terms are meaningless now and people just wear them as badges.

Thus, it is reported that, when a woman called out to James I of England (James VI of Scotland), \u201cMake my son a gentleman!\u201d, he is supposed to have responded with something along the lines of, \u201cI can make him a duke, but only God can make him a gentleman.\u201d In other words, the king can grant a title of nobility, but membership in the upper classes (of which gentlemen are at the lowest rung) was by birth only. The US does not have anything similar, except for the obvious distinctions on the basis of skin color and so forth. Social position in the US is based largely on money. Note the slightly different meanings of the term \u201cmiddle\u201d class in the US and UK. In the US, \u201cmiddle\u201d class means essentially the same thing as \u201cworking\u201d class in the UK, whereas \u201cmiddle\u201d class in the UK refers (at least it did at the end of the last century) to what are referred to as \u201cupper middle\u201d class or \u201crich\u201d in the US \u2014 that is, people with a lot of money who aren't members of the \u201cupper\u201d class by birth.
