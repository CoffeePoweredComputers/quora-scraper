            "answer_text": "You need to make fractions very concrete for these kids. You can use paper, play dough, food (graham crackers are good for a start.) They need to learn the idea of equal parts. They have to experience splitting different shapes into different numbers of equal parts. Give them post-it notes and have them fold them to create equal parts as many ways as they can (works well in groups of 2\u20134). Give them play dough and craft sticks. They can make a pizza in the shape of a circle, a rectangle, a square, etc, and then cut it to share with 2\u20136 friends. You can give them paper cut outs of different 2D shapes and have them find all the ways to split them into halves, thirds, and fourths. Using these concrete tools, start to gradually introduce adding and subtracting. Don\u2019t write it down yet, just ask some mental math questions like, you have a pizza cut into 6 equal slices, what if you had 2 pizzas cut this way? What if someone ate 3 pieces? You should also ask some greater than-less than questions using different numbers of equal parts and different sized wholes. Fun times! ",
