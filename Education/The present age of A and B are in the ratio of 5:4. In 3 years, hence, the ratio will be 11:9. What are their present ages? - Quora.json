            "answer_text": "According to given data we have, Let a & b denote the present ages of A & B respectively.As per given data we have,The present ages of A and B are in the ratio of 5:4.In 3 years from the ratio will be 11:9.So we get the following relations,a/b = 5/4 \u2026\u2026 (1)(a + 3)/(b + 3) = 11/9 or 9a + 27 = 11b + 33or 9a - 11b = 6 or 9a - 44a/5 = 6 [from (1)]or a/5 = 6 or a = 30 (yrs) \u2026. (2)From (1) & (2) we get, b = 4a/5 = 4*30/5 = 24 (yrs)Therefore the present ages of A & B are 30 yrs & 24 yrs respectively. [Ans]",

            "answer_text": "For simplicity let the present age of A is 5X and so the age of B is 4X. after 3 years the age of A & B will be 5X+3 & 4X+3 and these ages should be in proportion of 11 : 9. (5X+3)/(4X+3) = 11/9 45X + 27 = 44X + 33. Or X = 6 present age of A & B are 30 yrs & 24 yrs. thanx ",
