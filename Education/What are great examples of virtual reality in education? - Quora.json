            "answer_text": "It actually depends on the subject you teach I\u2019ll give you three great examples of virtual reality in education: 1. English Class Let say, today\u2019s class is about creative writing, such as poems or short stories. We\u2019ve learned all the technical things at school, but one thing we never learn is about how to get the inspiration, how to \u201cfeel\u201d our story. Virtual reality will help us to get out of our seats at school without leaving our class. You can use Google Cardboard to show your students beautiful scenery, such as. When they take off the Google Cardboard, they\u2019ll get a new experience, and a new experience leads to a new ideas. So, there goes they\u2019re writing their best. :) This could be a great source if your students need some inspiration. 2. Science Class YouTube is a charm. You can find a lot of 360 videos related to Science Class. You can enter a human\u2019s body and learn how it\u2019s going on, watch a total eclipse (remember when we use balls and flashlight to do this in our class?), floating in space and visiting planets. 3. History Class Write \u201cPyramid 360\u201d on YouTube, and you can finally visit Pyramid with Google Cardboard. Or, if you want to teach about the history of the States, you can simply write \u201cName+of+a+City 360\u201d on YouTube. Though it doesn\u2019t show the old version of the city, well, that\u2019s the task of a teacher to explain something like, \u201cCould you please turn around? Do you see the bookstore? It was actually\u2026. where a war began\u2026 bla, bla, bla.\u201d For more great examples, read it here. This answer was inspired from that post. PS: All the examples above work with Android and iPhone. ",
