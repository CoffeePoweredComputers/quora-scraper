            "answer_text": "I\u2019m the kind of person who would be more hurt by the guilt of not telling my teacher than by the consequences of the grade. That kind of thing really eats me up. Now, I\u2019d never had to put that into practice, that I can remember, in a situation where my grade really depended on it. Usually, my final grade would not change regardless of the change, and so I felt absolutely no qualms about owning up. And teachers have always said \u201cThank you for letting me know. Will it drop your grade if I change it?\u201d I would answer no, and they would change the grade so everything was nice and honest, and everyone was happy. This wasn\u2019t usually a big deal for me. I don\u2019t give a crap about grades. In what would turn out to be my last week in an actual high school, I had a situation like this. I had not turned in an AP Literature assignment. It was a big assignment. I had pretty much resigned myself to the fact that this would mean a B in my favorite class. The teacher was a wonderful, extremely busy woman, who we will call Ms. Sanchez, because that was her name. She had entered an A into the gradebook instead of the expected Z. That gave me a 3.51 in the class \u2014 0.02 points shy of a B. Well, shit. This was the one class where I would have liked an A, just to have something to back up my reputation as the English geek. (I am the English geek, but sometimes people are like \u201coh yeah? I don\u2019t even like English, and I have a 4.0 in the class, so I guess all that reading isn\u2019t helping you, haha!\u201d And then I seethe silently, because I read instead of doing homework, because I have a horrible attention span for homework. Anyway.) But principles are principles. \u201cMs. Sanchez, you\u2019ve put in an A for the Frankenstein assignment. I haven\u2019t done the Frankenstein assignment.\u201d \u201cWell, you really should have, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d She\u2019s that kind of teacher. \u201cUm, yes?\u201d She changed it, and my grade tanked. I was now on the verge of a C. \u201cWow,\u201d said Ms. Sanchez, looking at the online gradebook. \u201cThat\u2019s not great.\u201d And then she changed it back. I must have looked surprised, probably because I was. \u201cOh, stop pretending you\u2019re surprised. You\u2019ve basically taught more than one period of this class. I know you read the book. You taught the book to all the dumbasses who didn\u2019t read the book. Now go away, I\u2019m busy.\u201d This particular teacher is both an AP English Lit teacher and the head of the Medical academy of my school. Because of this, she\u2019s both an administrator and a teacher, which means she\u2019s at least twice as busy as a teacher usually is. And since our class is right after lunch, she was often held up by administrators, sometimes for twenty or thirty minutes. I would lead a class discussion about Frankenstein in those twenty minutes, which I enjoyed immensely, because I\u2019m an English nerd, and which my classmates appreciated, because they had mostly either not read or not understood the book. The ones that had read and understood it appreciated the refresher, because Ms. Sanchez\u2019s quizzes are scary. Now, I don\u2019t consider that teaching. That is the fun and exciting part of teaching. But it had apparently given me a free pass on a long and tedious assignment, which I hadn\u2019t done because it was long and tedious, so I wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThanks. Have a good weekend.\u201d So if I were you, I would tell her. The worst that will happen, if your teacher is particularly heartless, is that you\u2019ll get a bad grade. But I think you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. ",

            "answer_text": "At this time I have 19 years teaching experience and about 3 subbing. Teachers make mistakes, they appreciate knowing where they went wrong, they might give you the credit. I have two stories. First one, a programming class, I was supposed to finish 4 projects to get an A. For each project that worked, you get your grade bumped one, so pretty straightforward. My program had no errors (Pascal or Fortran) but it would not work. I took an incomplete and worked the whole next two semesters and the teacher and I could never figure out what was wrong. He offered a C and I said no, a D was all I earned. We both agreed that while I was great at using the computer, I would not make a good programmer. The next was for machine language class. We had lunch somewhere and he passed slips of paper around telling us to put down our grade and why. I put down a B, because I knew I had not learned as much as I could of. I got a B while everyone else got an A. The second semester he didn\u2019t ask, so I got an A. Give me the right manuals and to this day I could probably make a little car go across the screen of an AppleIIe, but it would take me 5 years to do it. Just because I know how computers work, doesn\u2019t mean I can always figure them out. ",
