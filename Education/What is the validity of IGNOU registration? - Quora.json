            "answer_text": "If you are asking how long your admission in IGNOU is valid then for Bachelors it is maximum 6 years. For other programs it varies. This information is available on IGNOU\u2019s website as well as in the prospectus. If you are asking about the re registration process then it is usually valid for a year. You should re register every year (this also depends on your program). Hope this helps. ",
