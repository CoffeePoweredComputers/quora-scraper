            "answer_text": "This is a difficult question to answer in the way it has been asked, so I will assume in my answer that you want a comparison in order to make a decision for your child in an international setting where you need to choose between a British and American school. I think this is partly the wrong question.  Educational reforms take place constantly and it takes longer (10-15 years) for some of those changes to hit international schools (a good thing).  This is partly because teachers educated in a previous generation who then go overseas tend to teach more in the ways traditional for their own generation. Another problem in overseas schools is staff is constantly coming and going.  If I were a parent, and knowing what I know after teaching in these schools for many years, I would probably choose the school which had middle-aged teachers who have been around for several years (or who are living permanently in that location) rather than younger teachers who come and go every one or two years.  (Some younger teachers are absolutely wonderful, but it's hit or miss whether you get the good ones.)  I would also look for a school that has native-born Americans, OR British, OR Australians, rather than hiring teachers from Asian and other countries (because their teaching methods and ways of treating children sometimes clash with our own cultural expectations).  Teachers (from native-English-speaking cultures) who stick around for a number of years in international schools are often better at helping children succeed, are better organized in terms of the material they present, and are more clear about their outcome expectations at the end of the school year.  (Same thing back home, a few years of experience under your belt helps every teacher.  Either you get fed up and leave the profession, or you become a better teacher and manage to stay in the profession because you're good at it.) Elementary Schools:  We began to receive British students coming from Britain in the early 2000s (and ever since) whose writing skills were terrible, and heard from both parents and teachers that \"British schools don't worry about emphasizing capitalization, punctuation, etc., anymore.\"  In spite of the \"evidence\" I found this hard to believe, and still think it's probably more of a problem of the schools in Britain (like schools in America) being overwhelmed with students from problem families and large classes.  My guess is that in an upper-middle-class district, or private school, they are still paying proper attention to these things, so I assume that students we received with these problems must not have gone to good schools in good areas.   MIDDLE SCHOOL.  I do have to agree with the other respondent who said that British schools may be better at teaching science in middle school.  The British science teachers I've known do seem to be better organized in terms of what curriculum they are covering and in getting in covered.  It's probably a result of the education they received in England (last generation); we'll have to see if it's different with younger teachers. I do believe American schools (generally) are better at teaching writing and emphasize it more even in elementary school.  However, there are some basic differences between British and American writing styles.  British teachers, from what I have seen, seem to teach their students to admire the passive voice, run-on sentences, and vocabulary used to \"impress\" others with one's brilliance.  American teachers instead teach writers to communicate clearly with one's audience by using the active voice, avoiding run-on sentences, using more punctuation, and not using complicated words when simpler words will do.  However, I have heard the British comment that \"Americans are dumbing-down the language.\"  So I would say it's more a question of philosophy. If you are a parent, I think the best thing you could consider at the middle-school level is in which country you plan to send your child to university.  If it is America, definitely choose an American school.  If it is Britain, choose a British school.  If you don't have a choice, either school will work. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll take it and answer the question as Education being a Concept or Principle. It really does Not matter whether British or US Education Is \u201cRanked\u201d Higher it lower Those Numbers Mean NOTHING when it comes to the Children. Children will learn and Apply or Not Apply the learning whether from a low or high Ranked program or Country. I came to the USA from the Dominican Republic in 1973 at the 11th Grade level, not fluent in English. One would see the Dominican Republic\u2019s Educ. rated lower than USA, but when I enrolled to fishing HS, I was credited with Already completed courses in Advanced Algebra, statistics, Trigonometry, Geometry, Biology, Anatomy, Botany, Zoology, European History, History Of USA, World History, Foreign Language(French), Etc See? In the USA Nit many in HS would have had successfully completed those courses or even been exposed until Higher Educ in College and only if in Specialty studies requiring such. I graduated 8 months later with English Honors, went to College and completed an AA Degree with Deans Honors, attended Higher Ed and attained a BS In Education with Cum Laude Honors. Applying Education Headed into Civil Service and became a Police Officer and a Detective Investigator In less than 2 Years Completing 20 Years career In Law Enforcement While also Teaching and Training others applying BS Degree. Spent 5 yrs In he DHS as a Supervisor/ Trainer Of Airport Security Screeners; I\u2019m a Trained US EEO Commission Alternate Dispute Resolution Mediator, I became a Career Counselor; I\u2019m a Dignitary / VIP Protection Specialist and Supervisor Of Security. So About Educational Ranking\u2026 Spoof. IT IS UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL INFLUENCED BY PARENTS, TEACHERS, EMPLOYERS, MENTORS, FRIENDS, FAMILY AND EXPERIENCES, TO GET IT DONE!!! ",
