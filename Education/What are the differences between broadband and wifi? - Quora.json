            "answer_text": "BROADBAND: Broadband is a type of high-speed internet connection that has surpassed dial-up as the standard way to connect to the internet. Broadband packages come in all shapes and sizes, from ADSL broadband to cable broadband and 3G and 4G mobile broadband. A broadband connection, like a telephone line, is never switched off and can be accessed at any time. Broadband is the UK's most popular form of internet connection and is used by millions of people across the country. Broadband is actually a relative term because it can only be understood in context, i.e. as opposed to narrowband, which was the technology behind dial-up connections. In the days of dial-up, you had to hang up the phone to use the internet. With broadband the frequencies can be split into channels, so you can use the phone on one channel and the internet on another. If you can use your home phone while using the internet, you're already using broadband. If not, some form of broadband is almost definitely available in your area, so compare the best home broadband deals at uSwitch now and get up to speed. Broadband is most often in the form of ADSL, which means it is transmitted along BT phone lines, although there are also cable (fibre-optic) broadband connections, and 3G and 4G mobile broadband connections (which use mobile networks). WI-FI: WiFi is a technology that uses radio waves to provide network connectivity. A wi-fi connection is established using a wireless adapter to create hotspots - areas in the vicinity of a wireless router that are connected to the network and allow users to access internet services. Once configured, WiFi provides wireless connectivity to your devices by emitting frequencies between 2.4GHz - 5GHz, based on the amount of data on the network. Wireless technology has widely spread lately and you can get connected almost anywhere; at home, at work, in libraries, schools, airports, hotels and even in some restaurants. Wireless networking is known as WiFi or 802.11 networking as it covers the IEEE 802.11 technologies. The major advantage of WiFi is that it is compatible with almost every operating system, game device, and advanced printer. ",

            "answer_text": "differences between broadband and wifi. There's also confusion between broadband and mobile internet. Broadband is your home internet connection and operates over a wire, but mobile 'broadband' uses 3G, 4G, or 5G to connect directly to the internet via a mobile operator's network. Until very recently, almost every home had a router or modem which provides a so-called broadband connection to the internet. This might be over your phone line, via a cable connection or even a fiber-optic cable. A relatively new development is fixed-mobile broadband, which is where a modem or router uses a 4G or 5G wireless connection to provide an internet connection. In rural areas, broadband can be delivered via satellite. But your phone, tablet, or laptop - when used at home - will connect to that router via Wi-Fi. Only if you have a PC, a games console, or set-top box without Wi-Fi will it connect to that router or modem using a network cable. Wi-Fi is essentially a wireless replacement for the traditional Ethernet network cable using radio waves. And most people think of it as a wireless internet connection, but it's simply a way to connect two devices over a network without a cable. Wi-Fi then is not internet, and merely allows internet traffic to travel wirelessly to your phone or another device. It doesn't stand for Wireless Fidelity - that's a misconception - but is just a brand name used instead of the official name of IEEE 802.11x. The 'x' suffix there is a wildcard that covers all Wi-Fi standards, the latest being 802.11ax. Because that's too confusing and long-winded, the Wi-Fi alliance has now come up with a new naming system that's easier to understand, so the new brand for 802.11ax is Wi-Fi 6 ",
