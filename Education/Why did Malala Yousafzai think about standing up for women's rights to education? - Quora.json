            "answer_text": "According to what I have heard through media sources, Malala started writing an online blog, with an alias to hide her identity, when her area was under Taliban influence. Her blog was about right to education for everyone especially for those women who were not allowed to go to school under Taliban rule. When the military took over the area, the girls started going to school and her dream was realized. She even got coverage over the media inside Pakistan as a symbol of standing against the oppressors for individual rights.At this particular point in time, she was contended with what she had achieved - the right to education. However, when she was shot by Taliban, she got enormous media coverage from all over the world and people started seeing her as an iconic figure who stood for equal right to education for women for which she was punished. It was more of how the masses wanted to see her than what she actually wanted. Therefore, upon recovery, she saw in this fame, an opportunity to actually do what the people wanted her to i.e. standing up for the right to education for women. In this way, not only did she comply to the will of the masses, but also opened a lot of prospects for herself and her family. It is still possible that even prior to all this, she had a vision to do all of this in future. But my point here is that between her being shot by Taliban to her standing up for women's right to education as a whole, some authority was there who presented her the way people wanted. Since this ambition of hers lacks natural evolutionary process, some people find her arguments and speeches as scripted or fake. ",

            "answer_text": "She lived in a society where many girls do not have a father like hers, who encouraged her to get an education.  Most teachers want to see their students grow and develop all their unique gifts and abilities, and most parents do too. Her father was both a teacher and a loving parent.   Malala saw this pressure against education not only in girls being kept home from school, but in girls given substandard education or demeaned in the classroom to discourage them from continuing to attend school. When she spoke out against this publically, asking only for girls to have the opportunity to learn, she was shot in the head by a member of the Taliban.  Later she said \"Extremist have shown what frightens them most: a girl with a book.\" Luckily for our world, this did not kill her, it did not silence her eloquent voice, and it did not stop her desire to help other girls become educated, and it did not make her bitter or angry at those who are against education. It only brought her story and her goal to the attention of more people.  In a Daily Show interview. Yousafzai's comments left Jon Stewart speechless, and prompted him to ask if he could adopt her. \"If he [the Talib] comes, what would you do Malala? \u2026If you hit a Talib  with your shoe, then there will be no difference between you and the  Talib. You must not treat others\u2026with cruelty...you must fight others  but through peace, through dialogue and through education\u2026then I'll tell  him [the Talib] how important education is and that I even want  education for your children as well\u2026 that's what I want to tell you, now  do what you want.\" ",
