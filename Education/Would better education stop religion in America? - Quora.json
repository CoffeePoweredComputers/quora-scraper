            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you mean by stopping religion. If you mean end faith all together then no. The major religions have existed for thousands of years and will keep existing or evolve over time like they always do. I grew up in the deep south and went to a pretty prestigious religious school in Atlanta. I was not very devout or bought most of what the pastors would say but the majority did by into it. We were taught evolution but by the end of my AP biology course still more than 2/3 of the class believed in creationism. The point I am trying to make is that when people believe something it\u2019s very hard to move them. If we taught evolution sooner in life like elementary school then I think there would be a better shot at believing in facts and not fairy tales but that\u2019s hard to swing by parents.  ",

            "answer_text": "Where is it written that just because you believe in God that your an idiot? There are a few billion Muslims who may disagree with that idea. I would describe myself as a lapse catholic. I only go to church for Funerals and weddings and a few communions or baptisms. However most of the people I know are not getting married in a church anymore. Many of my friends are not very religious and a few are atheists. I also know a few who happen to be Jewish, Hindus and a Muslim. Religion is not the problem. The problem is the people who use it as an excuse to do and say whatever they want. My parents went to Catholic school. They had mass and said prayers. They also learned that the Earth is actually billions of years old and humans evolved from primates. Would the Middle East be better served without religion? Would Indonesia? ",
