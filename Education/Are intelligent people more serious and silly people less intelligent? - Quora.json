            "answer_text": "You are asking two different questions really: Are intelligent people more serious? Being intelligent how? To what point? I\u2019ll assume you mean high IQ individuals, because I know plenty of people who are funny or silly and very intelligent. Or totally irresponsible but still intelligent. Would high IQ people tend to appear more serious? Maybe. Considering it is somewhat of a handicap in social interactions (the feeling of not fitting in, that people don\u2019t understand you, that others judge you, that everybody doesn\u2019t share your concerns); then maybe yes, maybe highly intelligent people could appear to be more serious. Maybe there is generally just a lot going on in their heads and they forget to smile. Maybe they feel lonely and shy.  And maybe intelligent people just don\u2019t look serious after all. Then again, I don\u2019t remember seeing stats that would prove this. I hope I answered what you were wondering. Is being silly a sign of lesser intelligence? I don\u2019t know where this comes from. I do know, however, that some highly intelligent people often use sarcasm, or master the art of being funny in their social interactions. Being able to laugh genuinely at anything, having fun, playing and kiddding around, making jokes\u2026 You are suggesting this is a sign one is less intelligent? I think someone who manages to fit in without taking oneself too seriously and having fun all along has already accomplished a lot. And it could even be somewhat of a measure of how \u201cstreet smart\u201d one is. Don\u2019t judge people based on what you see, and do not assume things based on silly observations.  ",
