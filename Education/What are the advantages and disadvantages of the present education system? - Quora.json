            "answer_text": "If you compare the present indian education system than advance countries education system then you will find more cons than its pros. Pros : i.) Indians mind are phenomenal in all over the world. From doctors to programmers, from scientists to engineers, from economists to physicsts indians get acknowledged in every field just because to this education system. In silicon valley(USA) people afraid from indian programmers because they might loose their jobs because of their(indians) phenomenal skills and mind. ii.) Indian education system exerts large pressure on children which make them good to do more work in less time, increase their productivity and develop great skills which makes them different than other. Large pressure is one of the cons but this has adverse effect on students that's why i am also including this into pros. As i mentioned that there is more cons than pros so Cons : i.) Indian system do not focus on practical knowledge instead of this it focus on theoretical knowledge. ii.)As i mentioned above it exerts large pressure on students because in india they take more assessment . For e.g : If i talk about only engineering there are 8 semesters , each year have 2 semesters and each semesters have sessionals, theory, viva, practical, assignment, majors, minors, projects , midterm, endterm etc. So here you can see how much pressure do a engineering student have\u2026 iii.) Indian education system do not focus more on co-curricular activities . As we all know importance of art and craft , dance, music, cooking , debate and many more activities in growth or development of students . Instead of this they more focus on studies. iv.) Indian education system less focus on sports. A well known example of this is india's performance in olympics. v.)Indian education system less focus on mental growth of students. vi.) Indian education system emphasize students to become job seeker rather than job providers. It do not focus on entrepreneurship or startups. ",

They play around, chat, prod their phones, annoy serious students and the teacher and generally waste taxpayers' money. ",
