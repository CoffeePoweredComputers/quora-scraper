            "answer_text": "It depends on the status of the family to which they belong to. Its not similar for all teenagers in India. Following is the things they do depending on their family: If they belong to a rich buisness house- They study in schools for ultra rich and go for hugher studies, usually a buisnness degree from Ivy league university in USA. There life is easy and everyone envy themIf they belong to politician family- Some of them will study to make their own life while majority of them will be spoiled brat with the intention to succed their parents in politics. They will be prepared to take any degree from a third class foreign university and join politics.If they belong to film/tv industry- They ll study till high school and then start finding ways to get into entertainment industry.If they belong to upper middle class to lower class- They ll aim for some exam in life like IIT, IIM or IAS. So theyll spend their teens preparing for it and their subsequent success or failure in it will decide their future.If they are a street kid, orphans or child labour- They ll spend their teen doing heavy work. Some of them will be sold as labour and die early due to poor health. Other will become criminals to get a life which they have always dreamt of but do not have the leagal means to acheive it.So there is no single answer. It all depends on how blessed you were when you were born. Very few of them will be able to change the course of their life. The rest will just follow it as the soceity wants them to be. ",

            "answer_text": "From my perspective, I'll categories people in 2 categories: 1) FOCUSED. 2) NON FOCUSED FOCUSED: who are doing maximum things right and are focused and working to build their career. a) Focused on career and studies.  b) Good peer group: they have a good friend circle who are away from drugs and alcohol until they cross the age limit.  C) Social Work: they are contributing to the society simultaneously. Eg teaching underprivileged children in any NGO. P.S: the second guy in first picture is me ;)  D) Respecting Women and Elders : taking blessings from elder and giving respect to them. Treating women with respect and equality.  . . Now Talking about the other category NON FOCUSED: who are not focused towards their career. They are ruining their and their families future. They are wasting their families money, Disrespecting parents members and women, Doing drugs and stuff. A) Alcohol: Western culture has effected India badly in this field. They find this \u201cCool\u201d. Drinking alcohol before crossing the age limit.  B) Cigarettes: They do smoke cigarettes and also hide it from parents because they know it's wrong but they still do it coz they want to look \u201cCOOL\u201d.  C) Drugs: some students have extremely bad peer group and their life is at stake because of such drugs they are doing.  E) Eve teasing: such people don't Know that they should respect women.  F) Fighting: they get offended even on things which are extremely small and don't lead to fights but they just provoke the other person and end up fighting. Many fights are due to relationship issues or both the boys want to be in relationship with the same girl.  Hope you like it! Do teach your brothers/ sisters/ children/cousins/friends how to be in the focused category. Thank you! Krish. :) ",
