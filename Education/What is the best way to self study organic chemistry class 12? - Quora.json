            "answer_text": "Well hello . I would like to answer your query. Organic chemistry is an art . The more you look at it more you get attracted . Basic principle is to study with interest . Once you have interest Congo you have first step. Next step is choosing a good book . If you are a CBSE alite , NCERT is very best. But if you are from any other board done worry you can study your course book too. Actually I'm from CBSE that's why and a good reference book. Learn with heart , everything will be fine. Practise exercise daily. Well you should not only be sticking to NCERT if you want to clear mains. For beginners NCERT is best with a little look of reference book. If u don't understand with book , try setting online tutorial. Commitment and hardworking is a key. You should pay attention to understand. Once you have it ,you have everything ",

            "answer_text": "Organic chemistry is something about mugging too. My chemistry teacher at school taught us this method. When you're learning conversions, and teacher had taught you the conversions from methane. Then go home and practice the same conversions with next 3 compounds,i.e. ethane propane butane. Try to link all the conversions with each other and derive a larger compound from a smaller one yourself. After reading theory and doing derivations, do the solved examples. If unable to solve, see the solution and do it again, but don't skip. Then move on to unsolved questions. In case of IIT level problems too, do the solved examples with your own hands (don't laugh) and then proceed to unsolved ones. ",
