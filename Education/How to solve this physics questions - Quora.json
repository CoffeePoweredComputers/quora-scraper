            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming the question is A car and a motorcycle both leave the starting position at the same time.The car\u2019s acceleration is 5,6m/s\u00b2, but has a max speed of 106m/s.The bike\u2019s acceleration is 8,4m/s\u00b2, but has a max speed of 58,8m/s.At what time t, in seconds, does the car catch up to the bike? In order to solve it, you want to think about the fact that there are two really important moments where the kinematic equations change, but once you figure out those points you can solve for their positions. Let\u2019s start out by building kinematics for both the car and bike initially. First the bike. a (b) = 8.4 m/s/s v (b) = 8.4 m/s/s * t s (b) = 4.2 m/s/s * t^2 BUT - the bike stops accelerating when it hits a speed of 58.8 m/s. Plugging that into our velocity equation, we can determine when that happens. 58.8 m/s = 8.4 m/s/s * t t = 7 seconds At that time, the position of the bike was 205.8 m So we can now model the position of the bike as being 4.2 t^2 before seven seconds, and\u2026 something after. I sort of make a policy of not answering questions that are clearly homework questions, but I think you should be able to see the method employed here. I\u2019ll tell you this about the bike position equation afterwards, it should have in it a factor not of t but of (t-7), since it\u2019s translated seven units to the right. Also, it should have a starting position value which you should be able to determine. Remember, both the car and bike are going to have position graphs which begin quadratically and then become diagonal lines. Those two diagonal lines are what will actually converge, so if you can figure out what the equation is for both the car and bike after they stop accelerating (use the same method I used for the bike for the car) and set those equations equal to each other, you should find the time you\u2019re looking for. I will tell you this too: they catch up to each other about 1.6 km after they both leave the starting position. ",

Now, [math]1 KW=1000 Js^{-1}[/math]. So, the number of [math]U^{235}[/math] nuclei required every second is [math]\\frac{1000}{200\\times 10^{6}\\times 1.6\\times 10^{-19}}\\approx 3\\times 10^{13} [/math]nuclei.Total energy of an electron = its rest energy+its kinetic energy. Its rest energy=[math]m_{0}c^{2}[/math], [math]m_{0}[/math] being the electron\u2019s rest mass which is [math]9.11\\times 10^{-31}[/math] kg. So, the rest mass of the electron is [math]9.11\\times 10^{-31}\\times (3\\times 10^{8})^{2} J=\\frac{9.11\\times 10^{-31}\\times (3\\times 10^{8})^{2}}{1.6\\times 10^{-19}} eV\\approx 0.51[/math] MeV. So, from the above equation, the kinetic energy of the electron is [math](3.555\u20130.51) MeV=3.045 MeV[/math].Since the half-life of the radio-active substance is 5 years, the probability that a nucleus will disintegrate in the first half-life(in 5 years) is 0.5. So, the probability that it will not decay in the first half-life is (1\u20130.5)=0.5. The probability that it will decay in the second half-life is (the probability that it will not decay in the first half-life)[math]\\times[/math] (the probability that it will decay in the second half-life)=0.5[math]\\times[/math] 0.5=0.25. So, the probability that a nucleus will decay in 10 years=the probability that it will decay in two half-lives=[math]0.5+0.25=0.75[/math].",
