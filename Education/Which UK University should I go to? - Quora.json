            "answer_text": "All UK medical schools have very high entrance requirements and maintain high standards. Admission requires not only very high academic ability but also evidence of the personal qualities required to be a good doctor, so as well as studying you should also do some voluntary work that would enable you to demonstrate this. Your precise choice of medical school may depend on other factors that could emerge over the next few years: I think that since you are 14 you can postpone the decision for a while. A couple of points: Facilities at Oxford and Cambridge are extremely modern: these universities have more money available than most others and so can invest in equipment as needed;Tuition fees are virtually the same at all UK universities so that is not a factor. The cost of living is higher in London than in somewhere like Leeds, but that should not be a decisive factor when choosing where to study.",
