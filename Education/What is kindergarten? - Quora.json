            "answer_text": "Kindergarten is one grade below first grade and one grade above pre-school. Kids usually start with pre-school but I started in kindergarten. That grade was the grade where I learned to put on my own snow pants and boots with accuracy. Where I learned what friendship was. And probably where I learned to tie my shoes. I say kindergarten is where things happen because to me, kindergarten was the room where I was raised. Where the sandbox and the building block station were across the room from each other. Where the dress up station was located right next to the painting station (which I may add was ALWAYS the popular station). Yet many people see kindergarten as a when. In my grade, it was not a when for I had no sense of time. High school was a when. Puberty was a when. But Kindergarten is a where. A place where memories started and my life... began. ",

            "answer_text": "Kindergarten is a school or class for young children, usually four to six years old that prepares for first grade and develops basic skills and social behavior by games, exercise, music, handcrafts, etc. In addition to balancing these new trials, each child is asked to put aside some individuality to become part of a cohesive group and build a learning community. It is a hard task. It is hard for the individual children, for their families making adjustments and turning their babies over to new caretakers, for the teachers and aids charged with guiding and coaxing the brood for much of the day, and for the larger established school community welcoming the new clutch of chicks into its fold.
