            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A and let me tell you first hand its not cheap. During my admissions the tution fee alone was about 50+ k or something. Since I was a student of their long term coaching and as I had a certain cut off my fees came down finally to about 40k. Coming to hostels, Brilliant hostels have a single fee system so whichever hostel you choose the fee will be 5600 per month. And then you have stationery, snacks, canteen food on fridays (believe me.. fridays are the worst days in Brilliant in terms of food) and occassional whatnots. So 40k+45k(hostels)+5k for whatnots brings the grand total to about 1 lac rupees for your bery brief but vitally important stay at Brilliant. But let me warn you things will get way out of hand after you start buying extra study material. hoep this helps.. happy to help.. :) ",
