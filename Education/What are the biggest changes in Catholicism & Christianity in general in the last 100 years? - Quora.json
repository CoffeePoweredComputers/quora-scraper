            "answer_text": "The biggest change to the Roman Catholic Church in the past century was Vatican II. This shift in Church doctrine took place between 1962 and 1965. The Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican began under Pope John XXIII and ended under Pope Paul VI. It brought the Church into the modern world by creating Four Constitutions, Three Declarations and Nine Decrees. Outside observers were invited from the Eastern Orthodox and Protestant churches, as well. The Council rewrote the Catechism, but the main changes to the Church were: The emphasis of the Paschal Mystery (Christ\u2019s sacrifice, death and resurrection) as the center of the Church Life.The shift away from Latin to local language for the Mass. People were encouraged to have a Bible in their native language for home study and prayer.It changed the Mass itself. Worshippers became part of the Mass, instead of observers. The obstacles were removed and the priest now faced the parishioners.The clergy were encouraged to practice holiness in the world, which led to increased activism by priests, monks and nuns. They protested Wars, abortion and the death penalty, and fought for civil rights.It removed the stigma from other religions. By practicing a culture of openness and focusing on shared ideals and a shared G-d, Vatican II opened the dialogue with other faiths. It washed away centuries of bigotry in practice by the Church itself.Not everyone agreed with the Council, even today. There are several groups that broke off from the Church and still practice according to the doctrine of the early 20th century. However, Vatican II modernized the Roman Catholic Church in an attempt to interact with a world from which she was typically isolated. ",

For Christianity in general, it was the creation and widespread adoption of an ideology called \u201cFundamentalism.\u201d Technically, this has its roots in the late 19th century, but is spread is pronounced in the 20th, as is its association with far-right politics.
