            "answer_text": "Far from a science \u2018alchemy\u2019 has become a derisory term \u2026 the very antithesis of modern science. Probably because the term was demonized in Euro-Christian culture as \u2018black magic\u2019 representative of early paganism and therefore thoroughly un-Christian. Alchemy grew out of ancient Egypt \u2026 where they believed the \u2018dead\u2019 body of Osiris could be fed with cakes and ale [or bread and wine] which enabled it to transform into an akh [akhet], translated as a \u2018being of light\u2019. [1] In earliest times that was believed to really happen via alchemy \u2026 but that process could not be understood so it was interpreted as magic \u2026 then mysticism and eventually turned into the so-called Osirian funerary ritual of later Egyptian religion. Early European explorers and a generation of Egyptologists thought all that was weird stuff \u2026 even though their own god Jesus was also a son of God manifested on Earth [like Osiris] where he had a last-supper of bread and wine, died and was interred in a stone chamber from which after three days he rose again in a blaze of light to join his father in the heavens. Somewhat parallel. Anyway, the earliest Egyptians believed the transformation was a real process which took place in the \u2018mer \u2018 [pyramid] which was literally an instrument or machine which enabled the transformation to take place. [2] The substance of the \u2018dead\u2019 body of Osiris was fed with something interpreted as \u2018cakes and ale\u2019 which enabled it to transform into light. Mass transformed into light energy. Just as later Christians adopted the doctrine of transubstantiation whereby the corporeal bread and wine became the ethereal \u2018holy spirit\u2019 of God. Ancient Egyptians believed this process was real [not mystical] and they detailed the physical mechanics in the Pyramid Texts. A plain English summary is posted elsewhere at William Gleeson's answer to Are the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts a hoax? Is there a plain English summary? The inert body [of Osiris] was a stone coffer filled with lapis lazuli spheres [eyes]; it was fed 2-3-5 meals of Tht-wtt food of \u2018efflux\u2019; which gave it power to transform into awesome, dreadful light. [3] So ancient Egyptians did accomplish \u2018alchemy\u2019 \u2026 the transformation of mass into energy. But we did not understand. {1] Lehner, 1997.
