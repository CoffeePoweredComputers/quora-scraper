            "answer_text": "JEE Mains story 2018 - 286452 Rank (46 marks)2019 - 9519 Rank (236 marks). So having improved by more than 3000% I am sharing how I learnt from my mistakes and what I did in my Jee preparation. I'll keep the answer concise, Do read this full and I am sure this will help you boost your MAINS score. Also upvote IF this helps. TIPSBe Motivated and Devoted towards JEE preparation : I wouldn't tell to study this much hours or sleep this many hours or any schedule for your preparation. Just fix your target and study accordingly. No one can understand more than yourself.Like everyone There were ups and downs in my drop year preparation too like not studying for weeks (excluding coaching hours). I lived alone in my single room pg with no one to talk. Just Wake up, go to coaching, come back to pg, have lunch, using mobile for hours, going back to dinner, think to study, but start using phone instead, realising what I am doing, sleeping with all these thoughts. Then I found a 30\u201345 minutes walk daily with my friend with a relax mind keeping me stay motivated towards my goal Find your own motivation. It could be a phone call with parents or chat with friends. . 2. SYLLABUS : NOT WHOLE SYLLABUS IS FOR YOU DEAR. Better to study 70% of whole syllabus and exclude the chapters you find boring or difficult. So take 3 pages and write all the chapters serial no. wise of PCM SEPARATELY. Then mention the No. of questions coming in previous year from those chapters in front of every chapter. Just make this like INDEX. Now choose which chapters you will prepare for exam (topics which are easy or you find interesting). I choose a target questions of around 250 marks(for april attempt) and succeeded to get 236 marks. As I love chemistry I didn't left any topic in it while I left hard topics in maths or in which I don't have command(didn't study at all those left topics) And I left many topics of 11th physics (I hate physics) and studied only the easy topics or which I found interesting. Result - JANUARY- total 166 Physics - 44 marks Chemistry- 83 marks( 100% marks in organic ) Maths - 39 marks(didn't studied much) . APRIL - 236 marks (close to Target) Physics - 50 marks Chemistry- 100 marks Maths - 86 marks . 3. BOOKS I REFERED : For CHEMISTRY: I JUST STUDIED NCERT with doing previous year questions from all the topics of chemistry only(2006\u20132018). Also I did ONLINE JEE MAINS QUESTION PAPER (2014\u20132018) for chemistry To make command on organic I solved coaching material's exercises (that too only selected questions). This is more than sufficient. As I loved chemistry NCERT was on my tips. I got a photocopy of all the topics in my mind that I know on which page the topic will be. . For MATHEMATICS : I just understand the topic from coaching notes then solve the question in notes and start solving previous years.(2013\u20132018). NO BOOK FOR THIS. NO KIDDING. I Also solved ONLINE JEE MAINS previous year (2015\u20132018) I just did this after my January attempt for maths. . For PHYSICS : Ugh! I hate this subject. Just studied what I found interesting and did those topic's previous year questions. Only coaching notes (which I prepare very good) and sometimes to understand any specific material I used coaching materials(guides). . 4. PREVIOUS YEAR QUESTIONS : If you are having less time for MAINS just start doing previous year questions of specific subject. I used to solve and learn the topics from their solutions. Initially when I started doing chemistry previous year I was barely able to solve 2\u20133 question from 30 without seeing their solutions and giving around 3\u20134 hours to 30 questions but I learnd their formulas , tricks and revised the topic side by side. This helped me to do a Short revision of whole chemistry syllabus in 3\u20134 hours ( I usually left 3\u20134 questions which were quite tough or I wasn't able to understand). After January Attempt this was the only thing I did and was then able to solve previous year 30 questions in 1 hour(with revision) and with accuracy Also, when you solve many previous year questions then it also makes your guessing power strong In april attempt I got 21 marks by guessing (though not a random guess i.e. I had some knowledge but tried my luck) and that too mainly in physics. This made a huge impact on my rank. . 5. MOCK TESTS : ACCORDING TO ME THIS HAD A GREAT IMPACT IN BOOSTING MY RANK UP. I did coaching in drop year but in my perspective It didn't helped much. But my coaching took Mock tests and this was the only thing I don't regret joining it. So better to take correspondence course with any online mock tests series. This would surely help you. DONT BE DEMOTIVATED OR DEPRESS IF YOU ARE GETTING LOW MARKS. In starting mock tests I used to get <100 marks . But after giving more mock test your confidence to give a 3 hour test would boost up and you won't feel discomfort while giving JEE MAINS in examination hall. I got 236 marks in April 2019 even though I wasn't able to manage >200 in mock tests. Also try to make schedule 1 week before exam like if you have exam in morning than give your mock tests in morning for 1 week. This makes your brain thinking power good at that time. . Feel free to message me if you have any queries.. I would be happy to clear your doubts. EDIT : Many aspirants are asking for guide to chemistry. Organic chemistry : I Studied basics from my coaching notes and then started solving coaching material(selected questions only) with some previous year questions. Also make a summary in 4\u20135 pages of name reactions, specific reagents, important reactions, some important conversions, laboratory tests. . Inorganic chemistry : Just read NCERT thoroughly and start looking previous years. Then underline the topics and lines in NCERT which gets repeated in prrvious years. No need to learn all the chemical reactions\u2026 Just look the important reactions from ehich questions are asked. . Physical chemistry : Make proper notes of chapters. Learn the formulas on tips and do solve previous years. You will realise that level of questions asked from physical is low and you can get the answer in just 2\u20133 steps by applying 1\u20132 formulas only.. . All the best for your JEE MAINS.! CHEERS\u2026! ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, so this will be specific to the Jee Main exam only. (More about scoring well than preparing well) I could myself have scored around 210 easily but ended up with 168/360. So i'd tell from my personal experience what mistakes i could have avoided, how to maximise your score. 1- Every question has equal weightage. Sounds like a stupid point but it\u2019s mostly overlooked. That lengthy integration question and that formula based statistics question carry the same marks. You get the point? During prep, You will be solving complex assignments of carbonyl compounds but the same weightage is carried by a question of environmental chemistry, which can be learnt by just going once through NCERT. 2- Every section has equal weightage 3 hours, 3 sections- 1 hour for each. common sense, right? Ok maybe math is lengthier than chem so 40 min(c)-1hr(p)-80min(m), right? Maybe not for you. During your prep, your teachers will want you to do well in their respective subject, but you dont have to do equally well in all 3. Understand this. You know which one is your strength, which isn't and have to plan accordingly. A 90 in chem+20 in math is 10 marks more than 50 in both. 3. Guessing will leave you doomed 4 options, chances of getting 1 guess right= 25% . You guess 4 questions, probability wise you should get 1 right, so +4+(-3)=+1, right? But there's a catch. Firstly, probability is taken over a very large set. Chances are those few questions there, probabilty is gonna screw you. Secondly, the time you'll take in making those guesses could have been utilised in solving an easier question. Thirdly, you'll regret a lot if in case you miss a seat by 1\u20132 marks due to those guesses. Educated guesses after eliminating 1/2 options can be recommended but dont guess blindly. I repeat, don't. 4- Revision is the key Those thermal physics numericals that you solved in 11th, it's of no use if you can't recall the methods to solve it on the exam day. However much mastery you would've attained during solving then, i bet you won't remember even 20% of that after a year and a half. So the key is to revise old chapters and concepts(read, solve selective problems again) time to time else all that effort is gonna go in vain. 5- Analysing >> Taking mock tests There is no use of taking more no. Of mock tests if you're not analysing your mistakes, questions you couldn't solve(more importantly, why you couldn't solve even when you could've). A 3 hour mock must be given atleast 2\u20133 hrs for analysing it. Dont run blindly after taking more and more tests without properly analysing the last one you took. 6- Exam temperament has to be developed You might feel comfortable solving tests now, but on the D-Day, believe me, the amount of pressure that builds up on you to perform well can't be described. So many potential toppers screw up their exam due to panicking. 1 silly mistake can lead to blunder in the whole exam. Ask anyone who took JEE and he/she will tell you that they could perform only upto 70\u201380 percent of their capability. So the ability to handle this pressure has to be developed by keeping calm, focused and a positive, confindent, warrior like mindset who's ready to solve anything put in his way. Hope these tips will be handy. May the force be with you and may you get satisfaction from your performance. All the best! ",
