            "answer_text": "I will answer assuming you live in the United States of America (USA). This answer may or may not have any validity if you live elsewhere. I will not discuss what can happen if you are below the minimum age to quit school where you live. Do you have a GED or plan on getting one? If so, future problems will be reduced. If you are in the USA, most jobs including the military will require at least a GED or high school diploma. I disagree with the necessity but that does not change the fact. The USA likes to think of itself as a merit based society. That is a lot of manure but it is how it views itself. People are viewed as more competent based on level of education. Competency is viewed in decreasing order: Doctoral degree > Masters degree > Baccalaureate degree > 2 year degree (vocational technical) > high school diploma > GED > no diploma and no GED. This view like the view of being a merit based society is giant pile of manure of the most reeking kind, but it is what exists. If you are really good at something that people want you will probably do okay. I was from that early age of computer programming before most schools taught it. I was according to multiple bosses in the highest of the elite both in quantity and quality. I never had any formal training in programming, I had a natural talent and read/used reference books for commands in the various languages. Many people excel without formal training. Let us assume you have all the skills and talent for your future desired career. By dropping out of school you will face discrimination. You violate the idea of the merit based society and therefore have no merit. You are a cheater and possibly a thief because you can do something others must train, sometimes for years, to be able to do. You will be viewed as someone to take advantage of or viewed undesirable. Let us assume you do not have the skills and talent for your future career, you can look forward to a miserable life of the lowest paying jobs. You will likely not be able to support a family and after a while probably unable to get a life partner as you offer nothing except yourself. Maybe you can become a full time house husband, washing and ironing the clothes, cleaning the house, preparing meals and doing dishes, and raising the children. Outside the home unless lucky to get a decent paying job you will probably be an economic drain (your income will have to exceed total of child care, transportation costs to/from work, additional insurance if you drive to work, higher cost meals compared to fixing something at home, increased tax liability, \u2026 or you actually will be costing household revenue to let you work). And these I have stated are the optimist futures, the probable ones include homelessness, prison, begging, \u2026 I do not agree with our societies emphasis on formal education. Among the smarter people I have know one may not have finished junior high (pregnant in early teens and forced to quit school by administration - common back then). She read. She read like a book a day. She watched the news. She watched things like Washington Report, Meet the Press, and Face the Nation. Unfortunately in our formal education attitude society she would be considered by many uneducated, politically unaware, and probably illiterate. You will face the same even if you continue your education through private study. I wish it were not so, but those are your prospects, those will be your handicaps. ",

            "answer_text": "There are already kids who don\u2019t go to school. They\u2019re called homeschoolers. Some homeschooling families recreate school at home. So that\u2019s not exactly like not going to school. But some families, unschooling families, support their children exploring their interests. It looks nothing like school. Kids who love animals are supported in exploring animals. Kids who love to write, draw, do puzzles, play sports, read, help people, sell things, build things, are all supported. Additionally the parents expose them to more of the world so they can discover new interests. Those children go onto college if they want when they\u2019re ready. The big advantage they have is they know what they love doing and have already been actively exploring it. College for them is a continuation of what they\u2019ve been doing. But if school were just removed? What would happen would totally depend on what families replaced it with. The wealthy could send their kids to private schools. Or, if there were no schools at all, hire tutors. The middle class has an expectation of learning. Without school. many homeschooling communities band together to offer classes, even creating learning centers. They aren\u2019t schools but more like drop in centers where kids can take a class or meet up with others who share an interest. If there never had been schools, society would be highly stratified. Families or segments of society that didn\u2019t value learning, their kids would likely remain stuck without the skills to move beyond what their parents know. A society can function like that if it\u2019s heavily dependent on unskilled labor. For an industrialized society, it means there are too many unskilled adults and not enough jobs for them. If, though, society in general does value learning, everything kids need in order to become functioning members of society is readily available on the internet and in most communities right now. Families can take advantage of it. All they need is to want to and to see how others successfully do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay. I\u2019ve seen a lot of replies here saying that you will be dumb, although this is incorrect since dumb means \u201cunable to speak.\u201d No, what they mean is, you will be uneducated. Stupid is a characteristic you are either born with or you aren\u2019t. But you don\u2019t have to be completely uneducated. Now if you are talking about elementary and secondary education, are you having difficulties with it? Or do you just want to quit? You will be better off if you finish and graduate as employers prefer to see at least a high school education on your job applications. You would be amazed how much that diploma helps as you start out. It won\u2019t matter much later as you get experience under your belt, but if you show up as a drop out, it could affect you a lot as it will affect the kinds of jobs you will be able to get. But if you don\u2019t think you can get the diploma, get a GED as soon as you can. It isn\u2019t as good but it could help you in the next step. Now, if you are talking about post-secondary, college, well, not everyone is suited for it. I taught high school. In Career and Technical Education classes, or what used to be know as Vocational Education. There is a valid reason for having those classes. Not everyone is suited for college. Not everyone is going to college, nor should everyone go. We have far too many jobs that need to be done by people who don\u2019t wish to get a college degree. But there are trade schools where you could learn to be a plumber or an electrician or a welder (those make good money!), or any number of other careers that require two years or less in school. And those classes are not like college. Most of the classes involve hand\u2019s-on learning. Not just sitting in a class learning from books. Think about it. Why limit yourself? I once spoke to a lawyer who said his most intelligent client was one who had worked offshore and been injured, ending that career. When he healed enough to do something else, he went to trade school and learned a new career and went back to work. Never stop learning. Never stop trying. Be the best YOU you can be. ",

This does not mean I am calling you black or brown. Access the internet enough and eventually you should figure out everything I did. I was an idiot, and am still one. Any fool can do it. Are you getting thrown down a flight of stairs and hospitalized like Musk? If you are, yikes. I am going to suggest you school yourself. Try to get to America. If you are already in America, then what the Donald? Are your parents having arguments? Being abused by your siblings or other relatives? The police can\u2019t really help you out there unless it escalated enough. It\u2019s just a brotherly/sisterly quarrel! Talk it out with someone. You\u2019ll feel ostracized further. I don\u2019t think anyone should feel this way so I have placed the weight of the world on my shoulders to defeat the final boss. You should make a friend or two, maybe 5000 (FB friend limit\u2014I did this and got spam calls and my account shut down because it was flagged as fake, which doesn\u2019t make sense because I have dozens of email addresses and fake accounts). Play video games where you can interact with others online. Mobile MOBA games such as Arena of Valor. Of course, I know the history of DOTA and Steam. Learn the history of the science and the internet and watch anime. If you know that, you are pretty much set to take on everything. lul ye tht totally works, took me 1.5 years but that\u2019s because I spent 4 years becoming the strongest swordsman in a video game and got used to hard/huge learning curves from that It is much rambling about myself. That\u2019s what you can do. Write. Drawing portraits of me and submitting them to my Fanart (F-art) page works too. Look to Jaiden Animations for guidance on grinding exp for your artistic style. Probably (more like definitely) not the best, but I get to refer you to whoever I want to. ",

            "answer_text": "Many great things. I know. I did not send my 4 kids to school, until college. My results, which were superb, are not at all uncommon. I have two Ivy League graduates, a son at the US Naval Academy and a 15 year old still being educated without going to school. My thoughts on keeping your kids out of school: They learn how to think because they are not being told what to think by school systems. They grow to love learning because they are not tested to death from a very young age. They are able to get more sleep, eat a healthier diet, and grow to be more fit because they are not sitting in stuffy classrooms all day long. They are able to participate in many different sports (all club sports are open to them) and because they have more time during the day and the ability to recover properly with true rest they can truly excel. They have fewer friendships but the ones they have are more meaningful and more real and they know it. They are closer to their siblings. They have ample opportunities to travel and see the world because they are not bound to the 9-months-in-school mentality. Their transcripts are far more interesting to competitive universities. They have huge advantages over the boiler-plate transcripts, reflecting lock-step coursework, from their brick and mortar schooled peers. Colleges love to get home educated kids! Because they spend their weeks in mixed-age groups, they grow to become better conversationalists, able to talk to those younger and much older. Many young people who spend their days in same-age groups are only comfortable communicating in a certain way and usually only with their peers. They understand that many of society\u2019s rules are false. No one ever HAS to go to school to become learned. Most of the world does not know this. Home educated kids do. And this sea-changing knowledge is transferred to other areas of life. It works. ",

The age at which school remains a requirement differs by state but in most states you must attend until you are 16, in some states it\u2019s 18 though there are exceptions, including passing a proficiency exam, once a minimum age is reached. School attendance is governed by compulsory education laws and the educational requirement can be met through public, private or home school options as long as the option is state accredited. Failure to attend school to the minimum age has punishment under each state\u2019s truancy interventions and typically involves both parents and students though by HS many students fall through the cracks if they drop out. Post the minimum age/HS there is no requirement to attend school. So if you don\u2019t that\u2019s a personal choice. At that point the question becomes what do you intend to do instead? What kind of job will you get to support yourself or do you have the independent wealth not to require a job? For most people a college degree is required as a minimum to pursue work in many fields particularly white collar work. Without a degree, most white collar professions will be closed to you or severe limitations will be placed on your career path within the field. For example you may be able to secure an administrative position but never rise or move into a managerial one. A college degree increases earnings potential and actual lifetime wealth, For trades, like plumber, mason, mechanic, pipe fitter etc., there are trade schools and apprenticeships to train for these roles. Training for and obtaining a job in a trade can be quite lucrative and many trades have severe shortages of qualified tradesmen/women driving wages up higher as demand outstrips supply. Now there are very successful billionaires that never earned their traditional college degree. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg would be two great examples alongside Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. These rare individuals founded multi billion dollar companies and dropped out to lead them. Ted Turner was kicked out of Brown, joined his father\u2019s advertising agency and ultimately turned it into a cable TV empire. These examples are not the norm for the vast majority of the population. In the arts again there are examples of very successful individuals who never attended and or never completed college as well. Their talent is their calling card. Examples include Ellen DeGeneres, Russell Simmons, Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg (completed his degree after attaining success as a director), Haim Saban, James Cameron, Rachel Ray, and Mark Burnett. So what happens if you don\u2019t go to HS? If you are under the minimum state age required under the compulsory education laws you and your parents are subject to punishment under state truancy, and a lack of at least a HS degree is severely limiting to future earning potential. Without a HS degree, or it\u2019s equivalent, you will be hard pressed to find work outside minimum wage. What happens if you don\u2019t go to college or trade school? Legally nothing. From a earning potential and career standpoint you may find it difficult to find work in many white collar fields and or find your career path is very limited within the field. Unless of course you are the exception that founds a breakthrough company or has rare talent that makes you a star in the arts then a college degree is a non-issue. ",

Or it is possible that you will just sort of melt into the background and meander from part-time low-wage job to part-time low-wage job. Or you could be full of ambitions and be one of those people who do not learn well in the classical school environment. It could be that you really do want to learn and that you will continue to put forth efforts, work hard and accomplish great things. If the latter is the case, you will come to understand that it would have been easier had you gotten some of the things that others paid for you to have at no cost to you. Beyond public high school, education comes at a cost to you in the forms of cash and time. Those who remain in public high school, only have the cost of time -get as much education as you can while you are young and someone else is paying for it. Education is designed for you to have a better quality of life and in almost all cases, it works out that way. Those who put forth no effort and who do not get an education while they are young, rarely have a good quality of life. On the other hand, those who do try and who do get an education normally have a much better quality of life. Work hard now and be a champion for the rest of your life! I am Allen Morris and I approve of this dashed off first draft complete with any errors that might have crept in\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "TLDR: Maybe you don\u2019t want anything to school now but you might in the future. By that time it\u2019ll be harder and you\u2019ll have to invest more blood, sweat and tears into getting where you want to go. The short answer is that it really depends so I\u2019ll speak from my experience as if I hadn\u2019t gone back to school. I\u2019d gotten an associate\u2019s degree in communications that I didn\u2019t end up using for work and I really wanted to study science, but hey, I\u2019d graduated and at the time that was plenty of accomplishment for my age. I could always go back later right? My pay bracket didn\u2019t increase much though so I spent a lot of time bouncing between entry-level positions trying to craft the job of my dreams (in the sciences). I did eventually find a job in healthcare with benefits but I wasn\u2019t interested in nursing or the medical field. So there I stayed in my early 20s working 60 hours a week thinking that I was filthy rich. It\u2019s a lot when you start off with a cell phone bill but then the car note comes in, and rent, and gas, and insurance, and the credit cards pile up, and water, and electric, and sewer, and trash, oh and did you want cable and internet too? What about food? See where this is going? Living expenses definitely impacted whether I though I could realistically afford to ever go back to school. The 60 hours I was working would never allow it because I wasn\u2019t actually making much to begin with. I decided then, that if I was going to be making ends meet anyways, I might as well do something I like but when I finally went back to school for my B.S. in Biology, it was so much harder as a working student. I had 2\u20135 jobs at any given time; part time, overnights, PRN, you name it. I had to piece together a living wage while taking day classes full-time. Not to mention, I felt like I had a lot of ground to cover because I still hadn\u2019t taken the basic bio classes yet like many of my peers. I did graduate and I\u2019m currently working towards my PhD. My life is finally headed in the direction that I want it to go and the pay is much better (some may disagree but I am definitely comfortable) so I don\u2019t regret going back no matter how hard it was. Still, it was a nightmare of a time and I really had to grind the second time around. I could not imagine having had children during this time though there are many who do. Imagine how much more dire such a situation can be with daycare and baby food, and clothes added to all the other expenses. I think back to the time when I first decided to go back. It was hard call to make at the time; all my friends and family lived close by and I had that 60 hour job that wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I cringe now thinking that I could still be working 60 hours a week in my hometown with no lasting passion for my work towards a promotion that might take me 5 years to get. Go to school, graduate with something, whether it\u2019s at a trade school certificate or at a community college degree. Then take some time off and live life. You will likely thank yourself later.

            "answer_text": "Daniel, If you are talking finishing whatever grade you are in? I can only answer as to what happens in Summit County Ohio where I reside. Ohio law defines truancy as an absence from school without legitimate excuse. The truancy laws apply to students between ages 6 and 18 and recognizes two types of truancy: habitual and chronic. Habitual truancy is the absence from school without a legitimate excuse for 5 or more consecutive days, 7 or more school days in one school month, or 12 or more school days in a school year. Chronic truancy is the absence from school without a legitimate excuse for 7 or more consecutive school days, 10 or more school days in one school month, or 15 or more school days in a school year. Most school attendance policies cite the following excuses for absence as legitimate (supporting documentation may be required): emergencies, funerals, illnesses, medical appointments and religious holidays. Examples of illegitimate excuses include: didn\u2019t feel like going today, had to babysit siblings, missed my ride, overslept, and parents forgot to wake me up. Schools Once a truant student is identified, school districts are required to provide a written notice, warning the student and the parents of the legal consequences and insisting that the student be compelled to attend school immediately. School officials may also request a meeting with student and parents to discuss the reasons behind the youth\u2019s truancy and to find a solution to the problem. If all other measures fail to resolve the truancy problem, school officials are required by law to file a complaint on the youth at Summit County Juvenile Court. School officials may also file failure to send complaints on parents. Parents are legally responsible for enrolling their child in school and making sure their child attends school, unless lawfully excused. Legal Consequences If the Court finds a youth or parent to be in violation of a state truancy law, the following legal consequences may be court ordered: \uf0b7 Bonds, fees and fines (up to $500); \uf0b7 Community service (up to 70 hours); \uf0b7 Counseling; \uf0b7 Electronic monitoring and house arrest; and \uf0b7 Mandatory appearance in Court, mediation or parenting classes. https://co.summitoh.net/juvenilecourt/images/stories/pdfs/Brochures/a%20guide%20to%20understanding%20truancy.pdf ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer is dependent on your age. If you are below the age of signing yourself out of the school system, you can expect Child Services to intervene and that opens a really big can of worms. If you are of age, you can leave but you will be very limited in work. Almost everything requires a GED or equivalent. Lots of jobs won't even look at your resume without it. I'm now 48 with my GED, I am very limited in future prospects as I don't have any post secondary credits or certificates or even a degree. I have basically topped out my earnings because I don't have the education to make more money. Please stay in school. If you are being bullied, talk to your councilors, teachers, parents, anyone who can help you. If you think you can make more money now and don't need a full education, think again. I worked as a contractor and tradesman for 30 years until an accident disabled me. No more physical work now as my back can't do it. Look at all the Football and Hockey players in the Big Show and you can see if they are injured beyond limits of their profession, they are no longer collecting an income (barring endorsement deals). If you are having a problem with understanding the work, talk to your teachers and councilors to see if your schedule can be modified or extra tutoring. You can do it. You have the ability. All life takes is applying yourself and you can succeed. School is the same. If you think school is too hard, please remember that life outside school is even harder. Please stay in school, it can only help you. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many realities that have occurred over the last 30 years in public education. The one thing that is clear is that High School is not the \u201cend\u201d of one\u2019s education. No matter what job that you do after high school, chances are you will need additional training. High School only guarantees that you, hopefully, can read, write, and understand enough to learn more. The opening line of the commencement speech I gave was, \u201cCongratulations, you now have the required skills to get any job that requires you to wear a paper hat.\u201d It is up to you to understand that and determine how you will determine your future. You no longer are accountable to your parents. You are accountable to you and the law. The next thing that I ask is \u201cwhy do you not want to continue?\u201d There are many reasons for this. I had friends that were so disillusioned by high school teachers that they saw graduation much like obtaining a release from prison. The one thing that you have to understand is that \u201cCOLLEGE IS NOT HIGH SCHOOL\u201d. The structure is different and the social norms that you witnessed in high school are not present in college. It also means that you do not have teachers who will seek you out when homework is not turned in on time. While this means that you are the one that is responsible, you are not alone either. Any professor worth their degree, will help you if you ask them. As for the consequences for not going to school, there is not much good news. There are jobs out there for people who have not obtained a college education, but they are getting fewer and fewer. In addition, those jobs are not paid well. Many of my friends who did not go on to college, have had to work longer and at lower positions to get anywhere near a living wage. Despite what many have hoped, the manufacturing jobs that were promised are not coming back. I know that this sounds like a tale of woe. It is a true tale for all too many. The best advice my grandfather gave me was this. \u201cif you want to be a Bum, be the best one there is. Don\u2019t be one because that is all you can do.\u201d There is nothing wrong with taking time away from school once you have graduated. You don\u2019t have to start with a full semester at a college. However, there are some things that you can do to make a better and informed decision. I would go to a guidance counsellor at a community college and discuss with them honestly what you would like to do. They can then advise you as to what kinds of possibilities there are available. In addition, you can go to a community college and take just one course. Most community colleges are open enrollment and don\u2019t require you to be admitted in a traditional manner. Take one course and see what happens. Take advantage of the resources at the college that can help guide your decisions and know that you are making an informed decision that is yours. Education is always an asset even if you don\u2019t get a degree. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, Daniel, that depends upon your age. If you\u2019re under 18 and still in high school, you won\u2019t graduate. Why should you care? Well, unless you\u2019re parents are good with you living with them until they die, you\u2019re going to have a tough time supporting yourself. You most certainly won\u2019t be getting married as most young ladies will not be impressed when you\u2019re still living at home with you parents and don\u2019t have a job because you never got a high school diploma. Now, if you\u2019ve got a high school diploma, that is a good start. If you mean you don\u2019t want to go to college, that\u2019s fine. However, you\u2019re probably going to need to either take classes for a specialized job/career such a truck driving, carpentry, plumbing, HVAC, etc. Believe it or not, all of these jobs require additional training beyond high school. I don\u2019t know about truck drivers (they make decent money) but I\u2019m pretty sure the other three will make more money than I do as a teacher. If none of these sound appealing, you\u2019re probably going to want to graduate from college if you want a more lucrative, white-collar type of job. Or you could work retail the rest of your life- that\u2019s not easy, either. Trust me- I\u2019ve done it. ",

One of the most famous is Steve Jobs.  [1] It is important not to go to school if you don\u2019t want to. You will just be unhappy, and it will be a waste of money. The thing is about college is that it will always be there. I went to college when I was younger, but I honestly can\u2019t say that going ever impacted my life or my work in any way. I did, however, go back to school as an adult. What a difference! I was thrilled to be learning, worked really hard and the experience changed my life. I found it so valuable that I am actually going back to school again for an MFA. More and more, undergraduate degrees don\u2019t seem to be enough anymore for certain types of jobs. Then again, more and more, degrees seem to be irrelevant. There are so many people creating their own work and way of life. For these people, college would have been a waste of time. One option you can consider is taking a gap year. You could take classes, travel, spend time in nature, start a business-whatever you want to do. At the years end, you can take another look at how you feel. If you decide school is for you, then you already have a great story to share for your application-you can talk all about your gap year. If you decide that you had made the right decision, you can move forward. Good luck! I wish you all the best I posted an article in the footnotes if you are interested.

If you are under 16, for example, an officer may come to your door eventually and compel you to go to school. There may be penalties for your parents and yourself. Otherwise, really, nothing happens. That\u2019s right: Nothing. But then, the consequences are that nothing happens, too. There will come a time when you will need to find a job, earn a salary, pay for food and shelter, and so on. Your earlier choice will dictate the opportunities you can pursue for employment, and those opportunities are likely to be few in number. You will not be able to aspire to higher positions until you can show some educational achievements, such as a high school diploma (or GED), a trade school certificate, associate degree, bachelor\u2019s degree, master\u2019s degree\u2026 Your life path and career path are up to you. What do you want to do? What do you want to be? Your choice to attend school will influence what opportunities are available to you. ",

But if you ask: \u201cWhat happens to me if I don\u2019t go to school?\u201d Then the answer will be different: Recently (I currently happen to be residing in one of the developing countries) I acquired a piece of land up in the mountain. It is a beautiful place and the climate is very comfortable. I would go there for the weekend just to get away from the city. I hired a local young man to tend the land and to grow whatever without doing something serious. After several months, I thought of starting a hydroponic farm on that land, and so I talked to the young man about my plan. I told him that he would manage the operation, and he would have to keep meticulous records of the operation and everything, and that he would get a share of the profits in addition to his meager pay. I was surprised when he replied, \u201cSir, if you want me to do that, I am going to have to quit\u2026\u201d When I asked why, he proceeded to tell me that he only had a third grade education, and that he could not really read or write, and that it would be way over his capabilities. I felt sorry for him. He is a very industrious young man and I like how he works. But apparently he has risen to the level of his competence. ",

            "answer_text": "I wish I knew how old your child was as it would help to answer this question more appropriately. If you have a young child, try sitting down with him or her and finding out why they don\u2019t want to go to school. Have they already been to school and something happened that distressed them? Are they afraid of going because they\u2019ve never been to school before? Is there an issue with a child or teacher? Explain to your child that it is your intention to help them \u2013 and in order to do that, you need to know what the problem is. Assuming there is no significant issue and your child is just trying to assert themselves and dig their heels in, I would tell them that going to school is actually not a choice. If your child is older, you can tell them that it is required by law to attend school. You can give your child a picture of you or a little keychain or small object of yours. Ask them to take care of it for you so that they can give it back to you when you come to pick them up. I\u2019m sure your child that you ALWAYS come back. Be sure to be on time, or even a little bit early when picking your child up from school. You can try giving your child some incentive by telling them that when you pick them up from school, you can go and do something special on their first day. You can also ask your child if they would prefer to be brought to school by mommy or daddy. Sometimes, a child has an easier time separating from one parent over the other. Can you arrange for a play date with a child that you know is in your son\u2019s / daughter\u2019s class? Maybe, this could alleviate some fear or apprehension. I would suggest that you just keep talking to your child. If you ask a lot of specific questions, you may be able to get to the root of the problem. Then, it is much easier to proceed once you know what you were dealing with. ",

Because college is over-glorified secondary school except with ashtrays. There is less margin for error in the real world, college or university is not the real world. You will still learn life lessons, that many of your college or university peers will not learn until they leave school. The school of hard knocks is a tough teacher. You\u2019ll be better prepared for life I assure you, and you won\u2019t be indoctrinated by some college prof that has spent the majority of their life in academia hiding away from the real world. I have also seen others claim claim, you\u2019ll be dumb.

But, the funny thing is, those college grads wouldn\u2019t have the infrastructure they take for granted to do their work if it wasn\u2019t for the tradesmen.

First, just because someone doesn\u2019t have an education doesn\u2019t mean they are stupid and can\u2019t learn anything. It just means there ability has never been tested or measure to the standards set in the country you live in, This measurement of education allows you get a good trade or to be a Doctor. These profession are a proven standard of education that started at grade one. It\u2019s good thing our government is obligated to provide everyone with an education in public school system in Canada. If you go from grade one to grade twelve, the government pays for all your expenses of learning for one hundred and eighty days a year.And two thousand and sixty days from grade one to grade twelve.That\u2019s a big government expense. So, why wouldn\u2019t you want to go to school? In many countries their governments don\u2019t provide any eduction for their people. In those country you would have lots of friends to play with, but in industrial countries you would have fewer friends. Without communications you will become very \u201clonely\u201d. ",

Assuming you will be independent, you will need income. To have a decent existence, you\u2019d need employable skills or to start your own business. Coding/tech comes to mind. You could also learn a trade, some of which pay pretty well. Low wage work is also an obvious choice, though it\u2019s not an ideal choice for longterm career prospects. Wages can remain low even after many years. Knowledge-wise, you could definitely still be well-informed. If you wanted, you could learn stuff on your own, topics that interested you. You might end up being more knowledgeable than most college-grads, who forget most of what they were taught. The big thing you would lack in all of this is a credential, either high school or more likely, college. I\u2019m not huge fan of school but the credential is definitely important, to the point I still recommend people to get a 4 year degree, if it can be done cheaply, is in a good major, and they\u2019ll be sure to finish it.

I had a 5 year old pupil who obstinately refused to dress for school where there were no obvious other issues. After one week of refusal and in parent /school consultation he was brought up to school in his pac man pyjamas with a bag containing school clothes, parents leaving immediately . He dressed himself in the class storage room in 5 min flat and there were no more issues! Another 5 year old was so anxious when left at school that in consultation it was decided to try again next year at 6 years. She is a happy 8 year old now. At 5 she simply wasn't emotionally ready. A child who has recently been bereaved sometimes has understandable issues reentering school. This is often anxiety related to fear of losing the remaining carer or family members. On balance it is my experience that most kids are better to get back to school with appropriate support after an appropriate break otherwise it can be harder to return. A practical mix of school /home communication, sensitivity and a certain measured hard headedness is required. This is not the approach to use with adolescents, where professional assistance can be employed in addition to negotiation and addressing any issues that the school refusing student has. Principals and staff are familiar with school refusal and will have many good suggestions. Remember to team up with the school and work together, listening carefully to your child in an age appropriate fashion. ",

Many undeveloped countries lack this opportunity for many children and adults. We should be considering ourselves blessed that we have the chance to do so in this country. Second, education opens up the mind to new knowledge that can be used later down the road. With knowledge, it opens many doors for you to the enter. Many careers require knowledge in doing some tasks, depending what your degree is. With the access to education, you can do what passion is. If you live music and want to teach others, you can get a music degree and teach others. However, skipping school or education is like picking a piece of wood instead of a diamond. One might say, \u201cSchool isn\u2019t for everyone\u201d. And this is true. But we must not take risky jabs at our future, when we don\u2019t know what is ahead of us. It\u2019s always good to have education as a fall back plan when all other plans don\u2019t work out.

In the US your parents can declare you are being home schooled. There is usually some paperwork or requirements for that but generally people who want to do it are allowed. Then nothing will happen. Some states also have on-line schools so you never have to leave your house. Now the other issue is whether you actually learn anything. If you just stay at home and play computer games, or whatever, what happens when you get old enough to have to get a job? Reading, writing, speaking, and basic math are the very least you will need to be employable. If you decide that you want a better job than minimum wage then you will require college or technical training. You have to know stuff to get into those programs and usually have either a high school diploma or the GED. Good luck not going to school. ",

Trade schools require them. Government agencies require them. If your talking about college, your life could still suck. As more college graduates flood the job market, the pickier employers can get. Employers used to think, \u201c Why should I hire a high school drop out when I can hire a high school graduate\u201d? Now they think, \u201cWhy should I hire a high school graduate when I can hire a college graduate\u201d? When I went to the Fire Academy, about 25% of us were college grads. I had a degree in business. Rangel had a degree in engineering. Jones had a teaching degree. Jongward had a degree in industrial engineering, etc. Ten of forty were college grads.

The military won\u2019t even take you. If you want a family you better marry someone earning a living wage of at least $50,000 a year. This will cover the basics. Your lifetime income will be somewhere between a few hundred thousand dollars to millions of dollars less than a person with more education and degrees.

Your friends will be talking about things you haven\u2019t even heard of and worse, you can become socially isolated. That is bad for your mental health. Missing school can be bad for your future: if you don\u2019t finish high school your work choices will be extremely limited and you may find it hard to get and keep work. If that happens, you can enter a cycle of poverty that is very difficult to escape from. So, do yourself a big favour ( even if you don\u2019t feel like this is a positive choice) and go to school, because even if the best thing about it is the sport you play at lunch, your life will be better later than you can even realise right now.

Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that every child that goes to school will become so. It is dependent on many different aspects. However, giving the child the best start to life would be to give them the opportunity to socialise with children their age, learn to collaborate and play with others, learn to respect others etc. So, not only does school help children become academically successful and in turn open up opportunities for them in the future for a career they want, it also helps develop their character and survival skills in life.

Some kids don\u2019t go to public school because their parents choose to home school. They are still getting an education, just not in the government controlled public school setting. In some cases, they get a better education, and in some cases worse, depending on the parents. Kids all need to learn how to read and write, and do math, but more importantly they need to learn how to learn, and how to think for themselves, how to reason, and how to problem solve. They also need to learn how to find resources to answer their questions. Living life is an education in itself. To function in the world today you do need some basics, and most parents that love their children will see that they get them. ",

You will be staying away from this, ruing bitterly. So the answer is \u2018that there would be LESS HAPPENINGS when you stay away from educational institutions and also do not acquire education on private basis. IF YOU MEAN YOU MAY DO IT YOURSELF WITHOUT GOING TO SCHOOL, THEN THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY. People are educated despite not attending schools/colleges, especially here in the subcontinent. We call them \u2018private students\u2019. But I do not think you meant that. Thanks for reading my answer. ",

I know Amherst has tried very hard to increase social, economic, and racial diversity of its student body, but my experience was that, at the end of the day, there are a lot of upper-middle-class students (I was one of them myself) who came from pretty privileged backgrounds. I'm not saying everyone did, but a highly visible chunk did (and probably still do). Face it, Amherst, like many small liberal arts schools in New England, is an expensive place to get an education. And, like many small liberal arts schools in New England, it attracts a lot of \"legacy\" students whose grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles and cousins and neighbors all attended Amherst. To give you an example, there was a young man in my freshman dorm who mailed his laundry home so the maid could do it. ",

However, in states in which the law reads that children only attend school until the age of 16 or 17, a parent of an 18-year-old would not be subject to punishment.

To that I say, if you aren't meeting the legal requirements for school attendance, the school to which you're currently assigned (your local public school) will most likely make various efforts to determine the reason for your missing school. They will most likely determine your parents are negligent, at which point the authorities will be notified and you parents could be arrested, you could be taken and placed in another home where you'll be required to participate in your education, etc. but basically, you'll be forced to attend school eventually. This question also could have meant just skip a day. To that, you'll have to look at your individual school's truancy policy.

As for tertiary education, it\u2019s up to you, what you want to do with your life. I definitely think that tertiary education makes you more interesting, introduces you to knowledge beyond what you learnt in high school, and teaches you to think critically about the choices you will make as an adult. It also prepares you for the world of work, gives you time to think about what you want to do in the work you\u2019ll choose, and to learn what you need to know to do it. However, it\u2019s not necessary if you already have made up your mind about how you\u2019re going to earn a living, unless you are living off your parents\u2019 money, then you should definitely leave home and go to college to battle the experience of being with people outside the wealthy ambit of your parents\u2019 circle. it\u2019s not something other people can tell you to do, but I would encourage further education even if it is only to delay having to get up every morning to go to a job you hate.

It\u2019s only normally ethical to home educate children if you can team up with other people in the same area so that your children have some friends of around the same age. It isn\u2019t necessary to have many though: even in school, children spend most of their time with just a few close friends. There can be other major problems with children who don\u2019t go to school though if they are being kept out of school in order to limit their education rather than to improve it: many of them are brought up by religious parents who don\u2019t want them to know anything that isn\u2019t in a holy text. There can also be problems if the parents have hopeless ideas about how to educate. Some of them replicate the same teaching methods as are used in schools and simply bore their children to death at home while also depriving them of friends, and that isn\u2019t useful at all. ",

This went on for about 600 years, so basically, as my geography teacher said, \u201cEveryone was stupid.\u201d If that little bit of knowledge was lost each generation, the world would eventually revert to the Middle Ages. We wouldn\u2019t have any electricity or good infrastructure because the knowledge was lost. Another thing to consider, in a world where children only know what their parents know, how would their be politicians to vote for? There are 2 options here. The pool of politicians gets smaller and smaller until they\u2019re forced to do it by family.Democracy collapses and there\u2019s just one person at the head of government who passes down the authority to their children.Either way, we still end up having a monarchy in the end.

While it isn\u2019t always true (certain industries & professions scale very differently), in general, the more educated you are the more money you will make. As to the general utility of educatin, you will likely be less aware of a lot of things that would improve your decision-making and thus make poorer decisions relative to complex issues presented before you relative to your life choices. Chains of good decision making create new opportunities, particularly when someone has a strong view of where they want to take their life that is socioeconomically and legally acceptable. The less you know, the harder (impossible) it can be to make the key choices. School teaches a lot of things that help with this and universities are much better. I personally had a few influential K-12 teachers that really \u201ckicked me in the butt\u201d to get better at certain things. I also had a really great experience academically, workwise, and socially at the University of Florida which significantly improved my life and outlook on things making aware of many more options viable. Not all of these options are great relative to how the real world works, but I have definitely figured out how it all works really well in high detail and I could not have done that with my education. Education is a great experience that can really help to remove a lot of ambiguity from decision-making in life.  ",
