            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t put too much importance on the certificate that you get when you complete a course on Udemy. The real value you get from the course is from the skills you should learn by taking the course. Anyone can create a course on Udemy, so there really isn\u2019t any governing body that sets standards for the courses or certificates. You could create a course titled \u201cBecome a Financial Analyst,\u201d just have 30 minutes of video, and then give a certificate of completion at the end of the course. It would be completely useless. But, the courses on Udemy are really helpful! I\u2019ve taken about ten courses covering topics like film scoring and web development. I used the skills that I learned in those courses to record music and build web apps. Those are things that I can show a potential employer and it would be helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience is good with Udemy courses. Only thing is that you need two or three courses to be studied of different authors. Along with the courses you need to study books on that subject. Udemy courses are economic and affordable, in career growth you can add the certification in your resume. In big competition these days having added additional skill does help. ",
