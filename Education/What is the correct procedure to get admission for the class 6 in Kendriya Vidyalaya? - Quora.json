            "answer_text": "Hey, there are some pros and cons also about the admission Pros : You have to apply online for that by visiting the official site of Kendriya Vidyalaya and about correct procedure they will take a admission test of yours and if you score a good marks n that examination then you\u2019ll get a seat there. Cons: They give a priority to those students at first who belongs to a Government Employee Child or defence employee child and after that seat persists vacant then they\u2019ll allow you a seat(A sad truth about talented students). Because it is INDIA and Reservations are the first thing everyone wants there\u2026 Now either it is reservations for SC/ST or for the Govt. Employees during admissions or at any field. But don\u2019t get demotivated by my words I\u2019ve only showed you the truth about today's scenario if you\u2019ve talent you\u2019ll surely get admitted into the School. BEST OF LUCK. ",
