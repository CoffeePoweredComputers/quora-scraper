It is to be suggest that you must have to learn the organic chemistry how to prepare the compounds and the property of the compounds. Because on solving the questions of organic chemistry it takes very less time in compare to the another type questions of the chemistry examination. You also have to learn the reasons of the elements in the periodic table that is the inorganic chemistry and the properties of the elements. In physical chemistry you try to learn the numericals of the physical chemistry that takes more part in the examination. ",
