            "answer_text": "Well, it depends. One, the U.S. is not a unitary government. The federal government doesn\u2019t write curricula. The state governments do. I\u2019m not an educator, so I\u2019m not familiar with this; it also seems to have been a point of controversy a few years ago (my memory\u2019s fuzzy) with the spotty implementation of a new set of curricula called the Common Core. Furthermore, unlike at the elementary and even middle school (or junior high, whatever\u2019s in your personal vernacular), there\u2019s flexibility in high school. Some people never get out of remedial algebra. Some people take stats or one variable calculus. Googling \u201cgraduation requirements [insert state here]\u201d should give you an idea. One I found said \u201c30 credits Math (must include Algebra 1)\u201d - but the community the school belongs to is prosperous, which means the parents can afford tutors for their kids, which means the kids do better in math and graduate knowing more than Algebra. You could also Google college entrance requirements - not every high school graduate goes to college, but colleges have to be aware of the various states high schoolers graduate in, so they\u2019re not going to set ridiculous standards.

            "answer_text": "Math Classes in High Schools have a large range. They can go anywhere from low level Algebra to Differential Equations. The average student (if they take math for 4 years) will take Geometry, Algebra 2, Pre-Calculus (includes a quarter of trigonometry), and Calculus AB or BC (Calculus 1 and 2 put together). The advanced students will take Algebra 2, Pre-Calculus, Calculus BC, Calculus 3, and Differential Equations. Lower level students will take Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and possibly Pre-Calculus.  All of these have honors, AP, and regular versions. My school is quite advanced though, so most students may be taking even lower levels than this. There are also alternate classes including Statistics and plain Trigonometry. ",
