            "answer_text": "Gosh. I wish I had the time to write the 100 page essay of the brief reasons why I love math. For your sake, I\u2019ll try and hold it to a couple examples :) Do you see this picture?  The Amputee in this picture is Dennis Aabo Sorensen. He lost his hand in a fireworks accident nearly 10 years ago. This is him, fitted with the first prosthetic hand that has been able to send sensory information to the wearers brain, via electrodes implanted beneath his hand. Not impressed? Okay, how about this one?  This is Lockheed Martin\u2019s SR-72 spy plane that is currently in the works. This beauty is a hypersonic UAV intended for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. In March of 2016, Lockheed announced they were on a verge of a technological breakthrough that would allow the plane to reach Mach 6 (~4,000 mph). That\u2019s six times the speed of sound. Alright, I might have your attention now. Meet Juno.  Juno is a NASA space probe that orbits Jupiter. While I could focus on the mathematical feat that is Juno itself, I\u2019m simply going to talk about the path it took to reach its destination. After traveling for two years in an elliptical heliocentric orbit, Juno used Earth\u2019s gravity to sling-shot itself towards the Jovian system, saving a significant amount of propellant. This boosted Juno by about 8,800 mph. It looked something like this:  Juno intersected Jupiter\u2019s orbit almost exactly when NASA planned it to intersect, more than five years prior to its arrival. It was one second off. So, what do these examples have in common? Besides brilliant engineering, they are all impressive feats that started off with a plethora of mathematical models. Literally, everything that those systems do are governed by extremely complex mathematical analysis. We are living longer, traveling faster, and exploring our solar system like never before - and it all starts with numbers. This is why I love math :) ",

            "answer_text": "First off, let me list some of the non-reasons as to why I like math: I do not like math because of its countless applications in physics, computer science, engineering, medicine, and tons of other practical stuff.I do not like math because it provides opportunity of finding a highly rewarded job in one of the aforementioned fields.I do not like math because of the beautiful patterns found in nature which are linked to mathematical concepts.And I definitely don\u2019t like math because of the way I was taught it at an early age.The first three of these are pleasant \u201ccollateral effects\u201d that, no doubt, do encourage me to pursue my passion for math, but are certainly not the cause of that passion. As for the last one, many answers to this question complain with how screwed up the way mathematics is taught in schools is. I absolutely agree with them, and I believe that changing it would drastically reduce the number of people who hate the discipline because of the subject. Yet, I\u2019m quite sure there was nothing particularly enlightening in the teaching that I received: in my experience, school has always presented math as a bunch of numbers and formulas. That said, I\u2019m not actually aware of the reason that made me like math in the first place. I can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s environmental, biological or both. Nevertheless, I can say what it is that I find so exciting about math right now: it\u2019s the underlying structure that establishes the whole mathematical universe, made up of ideas and connections between those ideas; even more than that, it\u2019s the inexplicable thrill that pervades every inch of my skin whenever I come up with a new idea, or discover a new connection. It\u2019s a very strange sensation. It\u2019s addictive. And it feels good. ",
