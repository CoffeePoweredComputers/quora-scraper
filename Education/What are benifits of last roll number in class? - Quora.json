            "answer_text": "I used to be this in school. Benefits of last roll number in class are follows: You are the default owner of the last bench during examinations, all your friends envy you here. You can cheat without worries and can effortlessly con the invigilator like a pro.Most viva questions are a replay of the earlier questions which were asked to previous students. Even if you haven't prepared at all, you can ask these people the Q&A and vomit it out when the teacher demands.By the time your chance comes to appear for the viva, the teacher is already annoyed after dealing with so many mindless numbs, known as students, who are ultimately your classmates. She would be too tired to hurl anything more two or three questions at you towards the end of the day.Nobody disturbs you while writing the examination. No-one to pat on your back and ask you to flip over the pages of the answer booklet and show the answers.",

            "answer_text": "There are many benefits being in the last of roll number and few disadvantages too but yes we'll focus on the Advantages  Viva questions in the labs are partially leaked to you.The examiner would be tired by asking same questions to your friends before you and may be if he is in hurry he will just ask questions for formality and leave. In the examinations you will be sitting in the last bench or first bench only but not somewhere in the middle.you will have few minutes of extra time to write while your friends are submitting their assignments,records etc according the roll call.whenever they call for seminars they will start from first (mostly) so you have lots of time to prepare. if your class session ends with taking the attendance all the ppl will be waiting to hear your name to be called.",
