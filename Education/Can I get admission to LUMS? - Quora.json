            "answer_text": "You can definitely get in there :) However, Your scores in Matric and Fsc aren\u2019t that good. While, they haven\u2019t mentioned anything like this in their admission criteria, they definitely give some weight to your academic performance in Matric/Fsc/O-A Levels. With your academic record, my advice will be to get least 1600 (Aim 1800) in SAT before applying to LUMS. Take some time off, keep practicing, and when you hit around 1800 in practice tests, take your exam. Best of Luck :) ",
