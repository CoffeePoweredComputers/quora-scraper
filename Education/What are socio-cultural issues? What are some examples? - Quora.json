            "answer_text": "Sociocultural factors are customs, lifestyles and values that characterize a society or group. Cultural aspects include concepts of beauty, education, language, law and politics, religion, social organizations, technology and material culture, values and attitudes. Social factors include reference groups, family, role and status in society, time and available resources. An understanding of sociocultural factors is crucial in developing marketing strategies for businesses or organizations seeking action from particular groups. The average level of education in a community shapes the interests and sophistication of consumers. A high percentage of potential customers with some college education requires more details and explanations in promotional material. A business must decide whether advertising brochures should be printed in English alone or English and a second language such as Spanish. If women are the decision makers in this pool of potential customers, marketing strategies must be adjusted to appeal to feminine values and concerns. Reference groups are family members and relatives, neighbors, friends and co-workers with whom individuals compare themselves and who serve as examples in buying habits. Awareness of the major reference groups, persons or family structures in a community is essential when targeting marketing campaigns toward them. Sociocultural factors such as disposable income are important in deciding whether potential customers are likely to buy luxury items or whether a marketing plan that emphasizes low cost and high value for necessities might be more successful. I don\u2019t know what do you need that for. If it is something for your assignment, I would recommend you to contact Supreme essay service. Those guys usually help me a lot. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The short, cheeky answer I give to my Anthropology 101 students is: everything. A better answer is that sociocultural phenomena are created by society and culture, as opposed to something that occurs \u201cnaturally\u201d in the world, like earthquakes, viruses, or acts of weather. Examples of socially constructed phenomena are: marriage rites, rituals, and practices; kinship networks; racism; behavioral norms; language; holidays; clothing styles; etc. When we are born the human brain only weighs about 25% of its adult weight - much of the rest of the physical growth of the brain occurs in the first two years of life, but our neural pathways continue to develop throughout our entire lives in relationship to our external environment (an environment which, for humans, is largely social). The environmental inputs received may come from the instruction of parents, TV and media, people watching at the mall, school curriculums, social interaction with our peers, etc., and our understandings of these inputs will change over time as we gain new and different experiences. In this way, the manner in which we think and feel about different topics and different situations (both consciously and unconsciously) is shaped by the social context in which we live. Note, that this context will vary largely according to culture - hence the \u201ccultural\u201d aspect of \u201csociocultural\u201d - so marriage practices in culture \u2018A\u2019 will be different than in culture \u2018P.\u2019 Most sociologists and anthropologists will tell you that it is impossible to completely remove a human being from his/her social context and that is why the category of sociocultural phenomena is so broad as to potentially encompass \u201ceverything.\u201d ",
