            "answer_text": "Best strategy is to find a way to reward yourself for doing the work you need to do. BF (Fred) Skinner once told me his secret to productivity. He kept a chess clock on his desk and he started it when he was working on some task and stopped it when he stopped. He would then give himself a reward (positive reinforcement in Skinnerian language) when he achieved some goal \u2014 say 5 hours working on the project. I used the same technique when I was writing books. I didn\u2019t use a physical clock but I had a page of times in 15 minute intervals from 7 am until 2 am the next morning. When I worked on writing I would write it down on the log sheet. No cheating, no day dreaming, no time logged for bathroom visits or to get coffee. Just time writing. At the end of the week if I had managed (I believe) 30 hours I got to buy a CD. Some weeks I didn\u2019t meet my goal, but most weeks I did although Sunday was often a race and up very late working. I collected a lot of CDs. I know it sounds silly, but it worked for Fred and it works for me and lots of other people. It\u2019s just a way of being disciplined. In my case it was hard because I was teaching full time, eating meals, doing family stuff. Trying to find 30 hours during the week to write meant lots of very late nights, but it worked. So find some phone gadget that clocks your time and log the time you spend on stuff you need to do. Find a reward that works when you do what you need to do. By the way many of us have problems staying focused on one thing when there are so many interesting things to explore. I probably have 10 books lying in piles beside my chair, half finished but started because I suddenly got interested in space science or some artist or a fascinating French king and then moved onto some other interesting topic before I had finished. But I\u2019m retied and don\u2019t have to accomplish much. My time is mine to waste. You need to focus so get cracking. ",

            "answer_text": "As a student, i always had the challenge of focus. My mind used to wander off into so many directions. I have always wanted to do so many things \u2026all at once. Studying with focus was my Mt Everest - aspire to climb it, but so so difficult without the right training and focus. Then i decided to check with other students in the hostel and came out with the following list of why i was unable to concentrate while studying - Studying too many hours without any breaks - Its the quality of study time that matters not the quantity. Study smart.Research also shows that taking wakeful rest between study or just sitting quietly with your eyes closed for a few minutes, just after you have learned something new has the following benefits - helps you retain more of what you have studied. This makes memories last even when you are not trying to intentionally remember the information.consolidate learning and help you remember information in the long-term and can mean the difference between being able to successfully recall what you have learnt at a later point versus forgetting it.enhances overall productivity, improves attention and retention.is very relaxing and calming to the mind. The good part is that if you have studied for 60 minutes, you don\u2019t need to take a break for 60 minutes, for most people a 5-minute break is enough to refresh the mind.One word of caution though - Downtime between study helps us remember what we have learnt as long as this downtime is not filled with distracting unrelated tasks. Checking social media etc., are distracting unrelated tasks. If you want to remember better of what you have learnt, you have to let your mind rest in between study time. Putting down that phone for a while might help you remember better. Even if it is boring. 2. Not studying as per the study style that suits me most - every person has a study style by which he/she is able to learn most. Identify your most useful study style and use it. Use the VARK model (Visual, Auditory, Reading and Kinesthetic). Visual: charts, diagrams - Learn by seeingAuditory: listen to lectures - Learn by hearingReading: interact with text - Learn by readingKinesthetic/Tactile: practicals, hands-on - Learn by doingI figured that i learnt the most when i used a combination of visual and reading. So i changed my study style to include both these styles 3. Not studying anything challenging - I realized that i was studying only things that i found easy. I was not challenging myself enough and for that reason my mind used to wander off and i had difficulty concentrating. I decided to take up topics which i found challenging first and then read up the easy bit at the end. But make sure that you don\u2019t pick up something so challenging that you lose interest. 4. Did not time-box my studies - Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. And since i did not time-box my study, i used to study hours together for something which could have been completed in a much shorter time frame. This gave my mind the time and the opportunity to wander off. If i put a time to my study: E.g. i will completed this topic in 2 hours and then test myself on it, then my mind would focus more. 5. I did not test myself after study - i realized that since there was no test after the end of my study session, i had the luxury of letting my mind wandering off. It is a good idea to test yourself after study and rate your study time. This will motivate you to concentrate and focus. The moment i told myself that i will test myself after study and if i don\u2019t get xx marks in the test, i will spend more time to study, i was able to focus much better. 6. I did not tell myself of the consequences - Nothing focuses the mind than the knowledge of negative things that may happen. So, i talked to myself and listed the consequences of not focusing on my studies. I told myself that i will be left behind in class, will not be able to get into a field of my liking in higher class, will not be a good example to my siblings etc. and this helped my mind focus like a laser beam. Many more factors which did not let me concentrate on my studies, but above are some of them\u2026 For ways to study better, connect with me on Twitter at Thepashsharma.
