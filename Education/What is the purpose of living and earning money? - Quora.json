            "answer_text": "This is a very deep question but also an exciting question, as the answer is completely up to you; you can craft the narrative of your own life to develop the answer to this. I\u2019ll start with the latter half of the question \u201cwhat is the point in earning money\u201d; my personal belief is that money is a facilitator to living the life you want to. Obviously you need to use this money to pay bills, feed, water and house yourself (and maybe a family), but the rest is up to you. I personally do not spend a lot of money on \u201cthings\u201d such as clothes, shoes, fancy dinners, cars, soft furnishings for the house etc, as I don\u2019t believe they add much enjoyment or value to life. They appear more to create a materialistic world consumed by short term pleasure. Instead I spend money on experiences that make me happy; travel, spending time with friends and family and writing. The point is though, these things make me happy which is why I invest time and my earnings into them. Other people strive for financial independence, and so place the majority of their earnings into investments which will earn them more money in the future and allow them to retire early. You need to find your own balance; putting money into investments and savings creates a strong emergency fund and future nest egg, but may detract from experiences you could enjoy now. The above is coming from the point of view that you don\u2019t sound like or enjoy your job; if you enjoy your job, then earning money is merely a by product for doing something you love day in and day out. An alternative approach is that you don\u2019t need to \u201cearn money\u201d; earning suggests that it\u2019s an activity you have to do. Instead you can read up on passive income sources such as \u201ccompound interest\u201d where interest is passively applied to your bank account year on year, dependent on the original capital in there. Additionally, investments in stocks and shares *tend* to perform best if left in there for the long term. Again this can create a passive income. The former half of the question is \u201cwhat is the purpose of living\u201d; if you haven\u2019t read Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, by Viktor E Frankl, please please please do! He describes how there are three ways to find meaning in life: 1) through another human being, 2) through a piece of work, or 3) through suffering. These three quests for meaning all change throughout ones life but are the basis for our search for meaning. For me, they interchange as well, and I\u2019m lucky enough to have never endured suffering, so they focus around the first two points. Please do buy the book on Amazon here, if you are confused as to the meaning of life. Finally, I\u2019d like to address the two parts of the question together: \u201cwhat is the purpose of living and earning money\u201d. We live in a capitalist society where money is the fundamental \u201ctoken\u201d used to compensate work, time, opinions, skills, items etc. This token is given a different weighted value dependent on what society deems a necessity or requirement in life. It's fundamentally important that find a way to make these tokens to meet your basic life requirements \u201cfood, water and shelter\u201d; in term you also need to make sure that you are meeting your \"meaning and requirements for life\". Sorry, that was a longer essay than I anticipated!! Hope it helps. ",
