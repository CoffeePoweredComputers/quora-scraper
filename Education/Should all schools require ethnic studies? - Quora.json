            "answer_text": "Who's to say? But since you're asking me, I will tell you my opinion.  My feeling is that it should not be universally required. That would probably necessitate the elimination of another core required course or the elimination of one of the few elective choices that remain for students. I do think that offering ethnic studies as an elective is a good option for some students.  I do think that it is important to help students develop an understanding of history and culture from alternative perspectives though. I think this could be better accomplished by wrapping it into the existing curriculum in classes such as history, English, and foreign language. These classes should be dedicating time to exploring some of the issues of the experience of different cultures.  What I do think is sorely lacking in our education nation wide in the USA is exposure to foreign language, particularly at the elementary and middle school levels where it is likely to do the most good. Most students only study foreign language for 2-3 years in high school. The benefits of developing proficiency in a second language are numerous and well documented. And when proficiency is developed, foreign language provides many opportunities for exploring different cultures and ethnicities from a richer perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, Learning information about a specified ethnicity allows us to have a broader understanding of another racial group that deviates from our own.  We can learn about their doctrines, ethics, rituals, and morals and determine if descendants of these racial groups have kept, or rejected mannerisms associated with their culture.  Receiving this knowledge may promote empathy and awareness of our surroundings.  Ethnic Studies specifically explores how racial identities over time have been given certain meanings and values that have shaped interactions between ethnic groups and informed different communities\u2019 access to education, safety, and economic mobility.  Ethnic Studies documents the histories of ethnic groups that were not included in the history textbooks, such as African Americans, American Indians, Asian Pacific Americans, Latinos/Latinas. Ethnic Studies  explores how different ethnic European groups historically formed a specific European American ethnic identity as well. ",
