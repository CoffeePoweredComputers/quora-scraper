            "answer_text": "It means PARENTS, are not doing their job!. It also means its nor relavent to young teens , only to the teens exiting year. Finacial education has always been a PARENT job and should stay there because of its trvance at several stages in ones life. You need maturity for this topic. Simple arithmetic for finanical lnowledge is taught in grade school , add, subtract, multiply, percent, and algerbra and probability. In high school if you opt to take accounting there is a financal education section in the courses. Having taught a unit in a compulsory course in high school about: basic budgeting, saving, compound interest as in GICs and mitual funds, reality of pensions, leaveraging summet employment and student loans, teens between 15-17 are NOT INTERESTED!! Administration slap your hands claiming its too hard for basic and applied teens and .parents complained asking why we werr teaching these concepts. So the units got withdrawn! Investing, stock market, and mortgages are advanced concepts which need to be acquired before university / college graduation. Font expect that tocome from aneducational institutions. ASK YOUR PARENTS or relative or someone you know who works in that field to teach you! Do your research on the internet or find a basic finance course offered by the banks or community interest course. Then go to a financial advisor and ask specific questions. You font have to dign on with them. Be honest and tell them up front that you have general question for claification and you are shopping to the right fit in an advisor for you. Educational institutions are not and should not be responsible for fiancial edycation other than the basic arithmatic tools by which to calculate basic shopping skills offered by a finacial institution or a hedge manager or a stock. The rest is a PARENT job. All you have to do is communicate with your parents!! ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly not much. Few parents trust kids with much money and learning about something without practicing it interests very few people. I teach financial literacy in high school and can tell you few students are ready to absorb and put into effective use even practical lessons prior to the last year or so of school. Sadly I am scheduled to teach this to freshmen (14 year olds), with a few students from other grades tossed in. The few older students do well enough, but the younger students do not see the vital difference between financial knowledge and other subjects: you might use geometry or algebra in your future life, but you will, guaranteed, use credit cards, loans, insurance, and other financial implements. Knowing how to do so wisely and how to wring the most benefits from each is worth every kid\u2019s time and efforts, but few get this. Kids see school as what they have to do, it\u2019s just what they have to put up with to socialize with their friends. The idea students approach financial literacy with more attention because adults see it as vital is sadly mistaken. Believe me, I wish this were not so, because financial literacy is vital as an adult. ",
