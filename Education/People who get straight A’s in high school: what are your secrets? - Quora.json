            "answer_text": "Hmm we're all different and what worked for me might not work for you. Let me tell you a story. I have a younger brother when i was in standard 4 he was in 2 and i repeated until he found me and i was ashamed of it. What annoyed me was that he was naturally smart i would study everynight just to be in his league and he would sleep next to me ( we slept in the same bedroom). But i would always come second to him in class. He was the first i was the second that was always annoying and depressing. I felt like he was insulting me like yeayea nomatter how hard u study you'll never get to my level\u2026. It was a rivaly and our teacher's knew it as we would compete to answer a question in class. Guess what i developed by brain during all that time i was in primary school studying. I made it easier to open my books and study in high school because of that time that i now consider a gate way to learning to study. And i have picture memory its easier for me to remember things, words and definition now and guess what? Lol when i was in high school i studied every single day ( excluding weekends and holidays) for 7 hours a day with no problem, no complains it was just natural. Opening my books was easier, since i had done it since grade 4. So where did me and my brother end up. I graduated high school with honours and became the top student in my province and got a straight A in math. My brother skipped Math and Physics but wrote everything else. Now he has a job and i don't. Which is really funny but i am going to a very good University in about 4 months from now and i am taking a short course at our community college as i am waiting to start my studies at the university ( B.A politics philosophy and Economics ) My point is people are different we have different ways of learning. You should experiment just like i did. You'd actually find it hard to believe but thats what i did every school year the first two months january and february I'd try to find a way that worked for me best and i did. My biggest regret was hating Accounting. I didnt like it one bit, i didn't find it interesting but i found other studies interesting. I was the guy who would open a math or an economic book and smile and giggle as i went through it like i was reading a novel. People are different know what u love and hate! It might not be school entirely. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m currently a successful sophomore in high school and I\u2019d like to share a couple easy tips to get straight A\u2019s in High School. (BTW, if you don\u2019t want to read this whole thing there\u2019s a quick summary at the bottom) In regards to my qualifications to answer this question, I currently take all honors classes and 1 AP (which is the max at my school for sophomores) I\u2019m self studying AP Stats as well as juggling the responsibilities of being Class President, a track athlete, managing a club I co-founded, community service, a Student Council member and other things.  1.) Life gets pretty busy which is why I always appreciate having a good agenda. This is the first thing because time slips away throughout the day very quickly. I can easily get back home and try to relax, maybe chill and watch YouTube, but next thing I know it\u2019s 7:30 and I still have 5 hours of homework and studying to do. A good planner should keep you on task so you know what you need to do. Ideally, a good planner has enough space to not only list what you need to do, but also time slots for how long each will take and when you need to do each task. For me, I like this agenda because it\u2019s simple and has a lot of lines for me to list the things I need to do and then schedule my day accordingly.  2.) Another big thing when it comes to high school is knowing what you want and where you want to be. You can easily become distracted or unmotivated during the long school year if you don\u2019t know want you want. For me, I try to reflect and set goals at the end of each quarter/semester. This is really important because a good reflection helps you understand what you\u2019re doing well in (which motivates you to keep killing it) and what you\u2019re struggling in. For example, if you look at my first quarter grades, I realized that I could do better in Algebra and Spanish. A lot of the reason my grade kept going down was because of careless mistakes on tests and projects. 2nd quarter I tried to step it up, and you\u2019ll notice that grades those 2 classes went up significantly; and in other classes. 3.) Another easy way to get straight A\u2019s is being aware of the point breakdown in each class. What percentage of each class do tests, quizzes, projects, and homework make up. This is very important because it can make or break your grade and helps with prioritizing. If I know that I have 2 tests tomorrow, one in Chemistry, and the other in Algebra but I only have one hour to study, what do I do? If 40% of my grade comes from tests in Algebra class but only 25% in Chemistry class than the decision is pretty simple. Make Algebra the priority and do your best to study in the morning, on the bus and/or at lunch for Chemistry. (A lot of factors go into decisions like this of course. Ideally, you wanna be prepared as possible for both tests but there are times that that\u2019s just not possible. You need to take into account how well you understand the material in each class, which order your classes are in- like if Chemistry is 3rd and Algebra is 5th- and stuff like that, but generally the % of your grade that each takes up should be the at the top of your list for making those type of decisions). The same reasoning can be applied for homework assignments. If you know you have 2 homework assignments but in one class it\u2019s worth 15% and in the other class it\u2019s worth 25% then you know which comes first. 4.) Do your best to surround yourself with people who get better grades than you. They don\u2019t necessarily need to be geniuses but kids who actually care about school. I go to an inner-city school and there\u2019s a lot of kids who genuinely don\u2019t give a sh*t about school because they don\u2019t see the point. It\u2019s easy to hang around them and see their point of view, but this is also where knowing what you want comes into play. You have to try to find people who know what they want and have similar goals as you. Friends like these are gold because: they can help you out with homework, help you study for tests/quizzes, clarify things that the teacher didn\u2019t do a good job of explaining, motivate you when you\u2019re not really feelin\u2019 school (or just tired of it), catch you up on stuff you missed when you were absent, and a whole lot of other things. 5.) This last one is probably the hardest cause it requires doing things before they\u2019re even due. Basically try to stay ahead of work as much as possible. I say this because the truth is that if you\u2019re not ahead, you\u2019re behind. Work piles up real quick I promise you. When a teacher assigns something due next week, my mentality is basically that I\u2019m gonna be busy next week so I have to finish it this week. I love this post because it encapsulates this perfectly:  We all have those weeks where there\u2019s just way too much work and all of it is due Friday but there\u2019s never enough time Thursday night. If you can just knock out assignments a couple days in advance of their due date, you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019ll have a lot less stress in your life and probably a lot more sleep. You can\u2019t help it if an assignment is given Thursday and due Friday, but you don\u2019t wanna be that idiot still working on a project assigned last Monday because you couldn\u2019t just finish it last week or over the weekend; you\u2019ll just end up drowning in work. Another quick tip is that if you have a teacher with a certain style or format of homework that\u2019s repetitive with each section, then just try to get ahead when you have free time. By repetitive, I mean you know that she\u2019ll ask you to do a section outline or something for Chapter 8\u20133 just like you did for the last 8 chapters so if you have free time don\u2019t wait until she assigns it (*cue Nike Ad) Just Do It. I commend anyone that actually read this whole thing and made it this far, that\u2019s pretty impressive. Here\u2019s the summary as promised: Summary- To get straight A\u2019s all you need to do is: Stay Organized, Set Goals, Know Your Classes, Hang With Kids Who Want More Out of Life, and Stay Ahead As Much As Possible. Now go kill it academically! You\u2019ve got the tools. Write down some goals, what you expect from yourself and slay anything that gets in your path. UPDATE:  I\u2019m now done with Sophomore year, and these tips helped me tremendously. My goal at the beginning of the year was to finish with a 4.75 weighted GPA for the year and I ended up with a 4.829! The 2 people I worked with the most throughout the school year are ranked 3rd and 7th respectively, and I learned so much from them. You never know what you\u2019re capable of until certain friends push you to that next level. Surround yourself with people who push you to raise your standards and I promise you\u2019ll improve! P.S. I mentioned earlier that I self-studied AP Stats. I ended up getting a 4 on it for anyone who was wondering. Not spectacular but we\u2019ll take it for sure. UPDATE #2: Valedictorian I\u2019ve finished junior year, and now as a senior I\u2019ve risen from 14th to #1 in my class. Persistence, consistency, and patience pay off.  FINAL Update: (4/3/20) It\u2019s now the Spring of my senior year. I slipped down to 2nd in my class but these study habits along with other essential factors helped me get into Princeton, Brown, Swarthmore, Emory, and Northeastern in addition to full rides from a few other schools. I only applied to 3 Ivies and Harvard was the one the third one (they waitlisted me). I received acceptances from all my other schools with Stanford being my sole rejection. ",
