            "answer_text": "It is not just not liking. I completed high school in Vietnam. Many teachers there intentionally gave bad grades for one or another reason. A biology teacher of mine made a mistake in her lecture. Basically, plants grow up from embryos within the seed of a plant. When a seed becomes a plant, they will either start with one leaf (monocots) or two leaves (dicots). And example of dicots is beans - look at the spout, they have apparently two leaves at the top. She told us that a coconut tree is dicot, but it's a monocot. My dad look through my lecture notes. Being a biology professor himself, he saw the mistake. He discussed it with some of his colleagues, who happened to be friends with the principal of the school. Eventually the story got to the point where the principal talked to my my teacher about her mistake. From then on my score suffered, even though I did very well before and I did very well after her in biology. The next story is just as bad. This woman, she taught geography in my class. That would not be a problem, except for that her two twin sons were in the same class with me. They were really very good students. And so was I. Academic competition in Vietnam is very intense, and she was set on getting the best out of her kids, even if it means that she would have to downgrade me and abuse my grades. I consistently got C for geography during those years, even though I consistently got A for everything else. Then high school came. I was transferred to a school for the gifted. I actually started scoring very high in geography when that woman was no longer grading me. I still hold grudge for this entire time. For many kids, academic achievement is so important as it determines which school they are getting into. This was particularly so when I was young and in an oppressed Vietnam. My parents checked my scores all the time, why they didn't seem to see anything wrong while it was apparent that they knew something was up? In retrospect, my parents told me that they knew that those teachers were trying to downgrade me out of the own emotional problems and out of pure vile in the case of the geography teacher above. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s wrong to do this but YES they definitely do. Your grades should be about how well you have been doing in class and through assessments not about how the teacher feels about you. I have first hand experience with a teacher that has given me a bad grade all because she doesn\u2019t like me. Here\u2019s the story why, I have a major fear of public speaking and I get anxiety, I shake, cry and feel sick from even thinking about it. For the subject English we all have to do a speech of some sort. I of course started to freak out from the hearing the word \u201cspeech\u201d, it\u2019s my worst nightmare. I felt so uncomfortable that I went to talk to my English teacher about how uncomfortable I was, I asked if I could just do it in front of her or a small group. I even asked to lose marks for the spoken part of my assessment. She wouldn't do anything. A tear fell down my face, my hands started to shake. The expression on her face was emotionless. She didn't seem to care about another persons mental health. This teacher would rather put her student through stress and completely damage her mental health than let her lose marks or even fail. I ran out the classroom crying, my heart was racing, I just wanted to go home and never return to school. The next day I sat quietly in class, not one word or one look towards the teacher. When I finally started to relax, my teacher had to volunteer me to go next for the speech. I freaked out and told her no, my eyes tearing up and then I started to cry, I felt so embarrassed. In the end I told her I would rather fail then go up and speak in front of the class. She gave me no other option but to fail. Ever since that morning she has been nothing but rude to me. From that morning I feel different, less of a human than the others. My work has been marked much harder than other students in the class, some of the comments on my work are just her being picky with things that she said that aren't true (statistics in my exam that are correct but she said they are wrong). The looks I get in class, the look disgust. Teachers should be marking students assessments on their ability of that subject. Their marks shouldn\u2019t be different because of whether you like them or not. But this does happen. Teachers are an important role in students lives. Treating certain students different because of how the teacher feels about them is wrong.  Sorry for my bad English and long answer\u2026 Has anyone else experienced a teacher give them bad grades because of them disliking you? ",

So to start off, back then I\u2019ll admit I not only never studied, but also failed to pay attention in class. Luckily, I still breezed through middle school with slightly more A\u2019s then B\u2019s, no C\u2019s, D\u2019s or F\u2019s - except for this exact instances I\u2019m going to tell you about. This teacher HATED ME. It wasn\u2019t because I was one to get in trouble, I never got in trouble. So why did he hate me? I still have no idea, FOUR YEARS LATER. No matter what I did, he would criticize me and my work, like (for lack of better words) wtf. I\u2019m also going to state he was a terrible teacher, as he was a perfect example of the schools failure in education (see my post on this topic to understand what I mean: Isaiah Tschetter's post in The Teenage Take, this gives a great idea of the failures within the educational system). He could have, practically, put a sign on the front of his door reading: \u201cI LOVE EPISODIC MEMORY!\u201d Let\u2019s just say, he was the meme of the year. As an example of criticism, I remember this situation explicitly, we were getting our tests handed back, one day. But, he decided to, specifically, chose one test and made fun of an \u201cincorrect\u201d answer (it\u2019s in quotation marks as it was actually, technically, correct). The question went something like this: \u201cwhat is something that people from the neolithic age didn\u2019t have that we now have today.\u201d Being my gamer self, I answered \u201cvideo games\u201d (yes I realize this is kinda dumb) and he went on to make fun of this answer, in front of an entire classroom - me included. You have no idea how introverted I am (lol) . . . This teacher ended up giving me a C+ one quarter for many, accumulated, stupid reasons like this. My one, and only, C or lower grade EVER. Just as the court system has impartial judges, the educational system should have impartial teachers. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Never. Not ever. 100% wrong. To be crystal clear: THEY SHOULD NEVER STOOP SO LOW AND DO SO MUCH HARM TO STUDENTS. Subtle harm, yes, but yes, harm. To student and teacher. It is absolutely against everything I believe, everything I choose to believe, want to believe, strive to believe, to judge a person based on my little, little feelings about them personally. I have never done so. I will never do so. It is wrong. There is no more to be said. Dislike someone because of their actions and attitude? Fine. But grade them on actions and attitude. Grade on the cause, not the effect. I\u2019ve been on the other end of utterly subjective \u201cI don\u2019t like you so C\u201d grading styles and it was infuriating and baffling. I truly could not understand how an ostensibly educated person could just say, \u201cWelp, feels are like real and good enough fo Teh Gradez.\u201d Even in a more subjective discipline like Art, one can observe dedication, integrity, work, talent and so on. I have strived my entire career to never let my personal feelings influence grades. Though I knw have failed, I also know it has been in small ways. Given my most recent annual performance review (where I scored perfectily in all the stuff related to students and their outcomes) I believe I have done a good job. That said, I\u2019ve met teachers who were unabashedly subjective. \u201cI dislike it; ergo, it\u2019s crap and deserves a D!\u201d I do my best to shame abd belittle them. Several times I\u2019ve talked to the students and explained the source of their lower-than-expected-grade: the teach don\u2019t like you. I hate that. I will not do it. I will swallow an ocean of bitter pride first. Of COURSE I am not perfect; the better people here to ask would of course be my students. Many times I\u2019ve been sad to give a kid I liked a poor grade, but how often we misunderstand the hidden duality of cruelty and kindness. I do them no favors by sending sugary sunshine and prancing unicorns around their weaknesses. I educate them by\u2014compassionately, effectively, tactfully, honestly\u2014telling them where they done f***ed up, how to fix it, and why my way works, then judging the results at the end and giving \u2019em feedback. If they can follow that simple model, we good. If they don\u2019t follow, I try again. And again. I have the greater agency, respnsobility and accountability thus the initiative is mine. There are very, very few bad students, though I have known my share of biters, nut-kickers, liars, cheats, snitches, bullies, thieves, and heart-breakingly damaged sons of Mafioso/daughters of prostitutes (not exaggeration.) Far more bad teachers exist than bad students, such have I observed, though *all* people have \u201cagency\u201d and we all of us must be held accountable to the very consequences of that agency. I try very hard not to remove that from students. Failure is the most coldly efficient teacher which exists. Sad, really, because we have so few good teachers (qualifications are NOT the same thing; the best teacher I know has NO qualifiications\u2026anyway, I think that because it ain\u2019t really that hard of a discipline to crack in terms of unis, degrees, pedagogy over expertise and the all-consuming noise that says if you know the right technique you can teach even things abpout which you understand less than the students\u2014like when you\u2019re nice, buff PE teacher tries to lead you on a magisterial mathematical journey into the wild world of fractions.) TL;DR: Teaching is essential, undervalued, underappreciated and dying in the USA. I teach in Vietnam\u2014and have for 8+ years for a reason because the US situation sickens my heart However, teaching at a language center, I\u2019m uniquely lucky in the degrees of freedom I have regarding how I teach, what, why and honestly to whom. My experiences in the droning, spirit-vampiring sweat-boxes this country calls Public Schools are limited. ",

            "answer_text": "Some can, but it\u2019s easier for certain teachers to make it subtle. At times, it can be obvious. My grade 12 biology teacher didn\u2019t like me because I drew on the desk. I was paying attention, and got near-perfect scores on all tests and assignments. The drawings were in pencil. But she made me stay after class and erase them one day. I erased them right when she asked, and without talking back one bit. All our marks are posted online, and updated as time goes by, assignment by assignment. So I saw it happen as she did it. First, she started marking my assignments with a zero, assignments that I handed in with the rest of the class. She never handed mine back, and played dumb when I asked where they were. So I started keeping a record of all my assignments as they went in. My grade kept slipping despite me doing the work, and I went to the principal to show her this teacher \u201closing\u201d all my homework. They took forever to get back to me, and no matter how many times I went in to ask politely for updates on how they were going to help, they never did anything. In the meantime, I went to the school swim meet, which was during school hours. I missed a unit final exam that happened to be on that particular day. I went to the teacher and asked her when I could make the test up. She said there was no test, and later updated my mark with a big fat 0%. That was it. I went back to the principal and made it clear that this was unacceptable to let my 85% turn into a 53%. She wasn\u2019t doing her job, and now she was trying to fuck my life over in the last semester of my last year of high school. I was graduating with or without that credit, but it would mess up my application to university a ton. By the time they gave in, the teacher who did this went on maternity leave (that poor baby), probably the reason they were reluctant to deal with her. They finally said I could retake the test, and refused to let me make up the assignments she lost in the first place. My grade took a huge hit, even though I managed to get back up over 60% in under a week with her replacement. Schools don\u2019t do shit around here. It\u2019s fucking sad how much they\u2019ll stand up for their teachers when the teachers are proven to be the problem. I still got into university because of my other grades though, if that says anything about them and that I\u2019m not the kind of student to just not do my homework(all about 85%-89%, and one 91%).

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, that happened to me. My 9th grade Math teacher who was kind of racist gave me a C- when it all added up to an A. I\u2019m half (South) Asian and it's obvious from my looks, I have a tan complexion, brown eyes, dark hair and most of the other students are white, blonde and blue eyed. Me and the teacher never really got along. He was never supportive to me in any way. All students in my class could tell he never liked me. He graded me lower while my friends who wrote the same stuff on a test scored much, much higher. He never helped me out when I asked a question or needed help with an assignment. When I\u2019d call his name so he can turn his attention to me when I needed help, he never did. I felt invisible in his classes. It was embarrassing. Quite a few times, he made remarks about my roots. He was never polite to me although I wasn't a misbehaving student. He\u2019d be all happy and then just go blank and expressionless once he laid his eyes on me. Before finals, he wrote \"Good luck dear students\u201d on EVERY students papers when we got the tests back, except mine. Everybody told me he might\u2019ve \u201cforgotten\u201d. Frankly, I felt that was very racist and not a good experience. I don't look bad either, even if I did he shouldn't have had a problem. Everyone else was nice but he just wasn\u2019t. Oh well, I don't have to deal with him anymore. Cheers :) ",

            "answer_text": "Its funny - I rather had the opposite situation. I was in a computer class in college, and I skipped, ahem, a lot, and was not the most scholarly student :-) But in general I was smart and always a straight A student. The professor was cool, and I had had him in a previous class. But I randomly showed up for class one day and found out we had a test the next class. I went to study but I had less than one paragraph of notes since the previous test and a lot of what was taught was not in the book. So I went and took the test - and I was never one to think I did awful when I didn\u2019t but this test had a lot of \u201cDefine this\u201d and \u201cExplain this\u2019 questions. Most of them I had never even heard of or had any clue about -so I made it up. This random math/computer term sounds like it should mean this\u2026 So I left the class going F*&^^ - and came back to class the next time truly thinking I was done for because I had BSed my way through that test. He handed out the test results and I had an A? I was truly like WTF - I knew the answer to one question out of twenty on this test! I had absolutely believed I failed. He reviewed the answers in class - and at least 3\u20134 questions he was like - this is the answer but one person had a completely different take on the answer - he completely assumed I knew what I was talking about and talking about it in a creative way - when in reality I was like \u201cwhat does that sound like it means?\u201d I got an A on that test when I really should have gotten practically a 0 on - all because my professor believed I knew what I was talking about!

            "answer_text": "So, this was a class I had in my freshman year of highschool (year 9, for those who are Australian, or any other countries who use that). My teacher, let's call him Mr. Wig, taught two subjects at the time, Health and Career Information Exploration (CIE). He also went on to teach a form of PE that I took later on, but that is just fuel to the fire. I had him teaching both of those classes stated earlier. He had done several things specifically to me that are like this, but this one just pissed me off more than anything. This was in my first class I had with him: CIE. There was a project that we were doing where we had to research and draw our family crest and give a packet talking about what each part of it was and what it represented. He stated he would not take printed pictures, they had to be drawn in marker. So, being the good student I was, followed the rules stated by him. That Friday, the project was due. As people were called up alphebetically, he would take a quick look at their posters and packets, making sure it was all there to grade later. When he finally got to me, I handed him my work. Without looking at any of it, he tossed it in the recycle bin with the words, \u201cThat is not good enough.\u201d I had worked my ass off trying to sort out which family crest was mine. I have never been much of an artist, but I had drawn it as detailed as I could. I drew every feather, every vine, made sure it all looked as close to the picture as I could get it. Then, wrote everything required by him in the packet. It is at this point that I'll also add that he was one of the football coaches (and basketball) for the school. He was also a perverted creep who was always talking up the school's cheerleaders. There were two cheerleaders and one football team member in that class. All three passed. Only one followed the assignment. Football guy printed a picture, wrote one paragraph on his crest. Cheerleader that didn't follow any rules only drew a picture with no effort. No writing whatsoever. After the end of the class period, I grabbed my work from the recycling bin, asked one more time if he'd grade it. When he replied again with it not being good enough without breaking eye contact to look at it, I brought it back home with me to keep. He barely passed me in both classes with the minimum D- requirement. So, yeah, there are some teachers like Mr. Wig who are assholes to anyone who is not a member of his football team, basketball team, or part of the cheerleading team. I'm wanting to be a teacher, but I will not be one like him. ",

            "answer_text": "I would 90% of all teachers based grades on the same things. Test scores (including projects) Class work (including positive class participation) Homework Behavior Attendance I am a teacher and I observe other teachers I have found 100% of the times when a student says \"she doesn't like me\" that same student either has does not do classwork, homework or has a behavior problem (or a combo of all three). So the first question is how are your test grades and classwork. I had a girl tell me I was mean to her because I failed her. Meanwhile she never passed a single test and had a test grade average of about 54% (passing being 65%), but I mean to her. (I even caught her cheating on a test, and even WITH cheating she did horrible, but I am mean). The second question is you behavior. I will be honest with you, this can go either way.It is possible that early in the year a student has bad behavior then they try to turn it around, but the teacher has already \"labeled\" them a bad kid so the teacher is somewhat mean to them, even when the student is trying to turn around. HOWEVER, this is just temporary, usually if the student tries to be good and the teacher does not respond right away the student reverts back to bad behavior which in turn reconfirms the teachers view. If the student could keep being good for more than a few days the teacher might turn their view around. So how does she view your behavior? Let me bottom line this for you, unless you have a 80-90 test average, all your home works handed in and you never act out in class you have zero hope. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me give you a straight, unpopular answer. From my 6 years of experience in two popular Indian institutes, I believe I am the right person to answer you. Yes. Absolutely. Very Frequently. Specifically in IITs and IIEST, a professor has absolute authority to decide to change any rules whatsoever in his subject. No HOD, Director or anybody can help you. Once you are in his bad books, he will decide to inflict his wrath on your grades. Let me pen down a few experiences. I have seen a professor intentionally inform about extra classes at the 11th hour, just because he was sure his targeted fellow (a day scholar) will not be able to attend the classes and thn did not allow him appear for the exam due to poor attendance.I have seen a professor who deliberately cancelled a class after every student had already appeared for it and refused to give attendance to them and then deregistered half of the class for low attendance.I have seen a teacher, who suddenly decided NOT to take 30% of the credit from the mid term examination but made it 10%, so that his targeted student would fail since he had done badly in the end term. I have seen a teacher who did the opposite, when that was the favoured case to fail the student.I have seen a teacher, who intentionally did not show us the copies of his paper even when repeatedly approached. Coincidentally, the student he was angry with failed in that paper. I don\u2019t believe this to be a coincidence.I did not share a good bond with some professors and I got 69/79/89 etc in total 18 papers, all throughout my B.Tech.(Since our department was new, each professor took more than 7\u20138 courses, or even more during our 4 years of B.Tech). I remember distinctly asking a professor, on what basis he had given me a 89 on a viva. Which word did I have to utter to get a 90?! This significantly reduced my GPA to below what I deserved.A senior of mine in Jadavpur University had a verbal fight with a professor in his second year. In the 3rd year, he was given a year lag by the same professor due to supplementary in his lab. Yes, it was intentional.My medical leave due to Jaundice was approved by HOD. Still a professor, who is here on Quora, decided NOT to allow me to appear for the exam in the final semester, which meant my degree would be delayed. I wrote an answer regarding how I escaped that. But he and his friend gave me a 69 and 79 in two subjects in the final semester, intentionally. I was shown the end term copy and found that I was given a zero in a mid term. But his friend refused to show me that mid term copy. Check this answer if you would wish to know how I escaped the deregistration. Samanwita Kar's answer to What is the best thing that ever happened to you for being rude?All the above experiences are mostly with IIEST but I can assure you that such incidents are common in most NITs and other government colleges where a professor has such unquestionable power. With my 2 years in IIT, I was in a very peaceful department and only once, I have seen this to happen in my department and that too was just a tampering of grade Nothing like destroying the entire career of a student. But then again, in boyfriend\u2019s department, some students were not even allowed to give their final seminar. I came to know that most of them had done quite decent work. But still, due to this, some had the probability of losing their jobs, as the company refused to delay their joining. One student among them had challenged it and taken it upto the HOD. After 2 months of our degree completion, all the students whose seminar was denied, have been allowed and they could save their job after tremendous emotional turmoil. But ONLY that one student who had taken it upto the HOD has been given an extension of 6 months, which made him lose his job. Would I try to be politically correct and add now that this is a minor percentage and most professors are decent with their grading? Hell, No! I would bet on a 50\u201350. While I survived most of this without any significant toll on my career, I have seen several careers destroyed because of such incidents. I have seen frustrated souls, who got demotivated completely due to such severe injustice. I have seen boot lickers getting excellent grades out of nowhere (this is a rare one though). If you are a student in India, you better watch how you walk, talk, behave, wear, look in front of your professor. You never know what can piss him off. EDIT: If any student from a government college (because job security in government colleges help you do whatever you like and still retain your job, promotion and reputation) in India is reading this (has to be a home university where the entire grades are in the hands of the subject teacher), please take a little time to comment and let me know if you agree with this scenario or not.

            "answer_text": "Oh, boy, do they ever! When I was in 4th grade, I got moved from regular classes to GATE classes at a different school. Before I was allowed into the program, my parents needed to meet with my teacher to go over everyone\u2019s expectations and the speed at which I\u2019d need to work in order to keep up. Standard stuff, and my parents were confident that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. One thing about this particular program, though, was that they were ahead in math by a year. That meant I\u2019d need to make up a year of math just to catch up to the core curriculum being taught. My mother was adamant that I could do it, and told my teacher that she expected straight A\u2019s from me. Teacher\u2019s response? \u201cShe won\u2019t get them.\u201d Did your jaw drop, too, reading that? Because my mom\u2019s did. My mom was NOT pleased with that answer, but we set out to prove her wrong, because I was a competitive little brat at 9 and I knew I could do it. I made up that year of math in two weeks. Aced everything after the first few quizzes when I was still cramming on my own time. I got a B. I don\u2019t know what her problem with me was, because I was a good student and never spoke out of turn or missed homework, but I did NOT get those straight A\u2019s that were expected of me. I still resent that teacher, 22 years later. (And no, my mom was not upset with me for that B\u2014she\u2019d seen how hard I worked and knew it wasn\u2019t my fault.) ",

            "answer_text": "Some do, some don't. For instance, I had a teacher in History of Technology, whom my class and I had written a formal complaint about, because he didn't actually teach us anything. When he confronted us, I was the only one who didn't back out immediately, so he was convinced it was just me who was behind it. Well, at the exam I had chosen the topic of cars, especially in relation to World War II. I present, everything is fine, I leave the room to let my teacher and censor debate my grade. I get back in, and I see censor had written a B next to my name. Not great, but not terrible. Then my teacher starts talking. He tells me I got a C because \u201cit was a bit too much history about cars\u201d. Which means he convinced censor to go down a grade, for being too on topic. Yup. The next year, I had my English exam. I'd told my friend Sune that I was kinda nervous, and his reply was \u201cI would be too, [teacher\u2019s name] hates you\u201d. I just went \u201che does?\u201d And Sune said, \u201cof course he does\u201d. Sune wasn't great at comforting me. Anyway, at the exam I talked and talked about my topic. My teacher and censor asked questions. I answered. They asked \u201care you done, or is there more you'd like to add?\u201d And I'd been told that if teachers say that, you have to add something or it's really bad. So I kept on talking. They asked three more times, and in the end I just had to say I didn't have anything else to add, because I'd pretty much used up all of my vocabulary. So I leave the room for them to discuss my grade. As I do so, a classmate asks \u201chow did it go?\u201d And before I had time to answer, I was called back in. My teacher went \u201cwell it's clearly an A+.\u201d And that was that. Do teachers give a student a bad grade if they don't like them? ",

            "answer_text": "Its called grade retribution and it could be given out for being a Trump supporter, Political and religious views etc. White males may get some of this in college since they may be considered privileged or bigots if they are supportive of Trump. Esp by the more left leaning profs. Atheolibs who would punish infidels heretics and blasphemy in their domain. Others where white males are considered privileged from the get go and dissent is construed as blasphemy. A lot of that is on account of the faculty who also may be victims. More qualified and experienced teachers do not make the cut while the young hotty fresh out of college gets to job. Think of it. If they have an opening for a first grade teacher and they have fifteen applicants then would they hire the most experienced with the best qualifications? You would think they would want the best and the brightest teachers in their schools but that is not always the case. Those who hire have different agendas and it could be both parents of the teacher hired are school teachers. So the process is not always blind or fair. How much does the interview have to do relative to the qualifications? One teacher told me she was passed up for a young gal fresh out of college. She wanted to know what if anything she did wrong. She was told the hire was a little more qualified which was a straight up lie. So all this unfairness sometimes is passed down into the classroom. If a teacher mindset has a student down as a bigot, or despicable (blasphemer) then it would not be unusual for things like grade retribution to happen and it has. Remember the Duke Lacrosse team. Keep in mind, the front line teacher in any classroom probably beat out at least ten other applicants to get the job. We would hope most of the hiring process is fair and objective for the sake of the students and their future. Do you really want Yvette Felarca teaching your child?  ",

            "answer_text": "I don't recall any stories of teachers giving me bad grades because they didn't like me, but I believe I do have a story from this year of a teacher giving me more points than I earned on a project because she did like me. In my social studies class this year, I was a great student. I turned in everything, I came in at lunch to make up what I missed when I left class early every day for my 6th period class, I participated a lot, and my positive attitude really shone. She explicitly told me on the last day of school that she \u201cIsn't supposed to have favorites\u201d, and then followed it up by winking at me. Then came the heritage project. It was a big project worth more than 100 points. I, however, hate big projects, so I didnt finish it until a month after it was due. I ended up getting a C on it, which is the highest grade late assignments can get. However, I should have lost more points than that, because it wasn\u2019t completed to the proper standard. Points were given for having a picture of yourself on the front, which I didn't have. Points were also given for making the posterboard personalized and unique, which I didn't do. It was a white posterboard with 2 graphs and 2 paragraphs written in MS Word and then printed and slapped onto the front. I think they were crooked. It just said \u201cHERITAGE\u201d at the top in big bubble letters in sharpie. I used 4 colors for the title. The board looked lazy and sloppy, and yet I got all the possible points that a late assignment could. So, do teachers give students bad grades because they like them? I can't tell you for certain. But I can tell you that teachers are biased by their opinion of a student, and being liked by your teachers can save your grade when nothing else does. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me share a story: I was a 7th and 8th grade math teacher, and had been working with the same group of four teachers in my grade level for over 20 years. My homeroom students (The principal always assigned me the top academic group) would complain that Mr. (So-in-so) didn\u2019t give them an A on their report. After reading the reports of different students, and comparing individual reports with the \u2018Criteria Chart\u2019 the teacher gave the student that would be used for assessment, I came to only one conclusion. The teacher never read the reports of the children! All he did was check the cover sheet for the paper, how many pages were included, the inclusion or absence of pictures, and read the first paragraph. Misspellings in the student\u2019s report were not noted by the teacher after the first paragraph, even if they were germane. It seemed to me that the student\u2019s comportment during class time was the determining factor in the student\u2019s grade. What to do? I wanted, and needed to protect my students! They needed outstanding grades to be accepted to private high schools, and because their parents receive state assistance, they required scholarships to do so. Grades in the 80\u2019s weren\u2019t helping them. For two weeks, every other day, I sat in the back of this teacher\u2019s classroom, observing how the students behaved and taking notes on individual students, either when I observed inappropriate behavior, or when the teacher commented on a student\u2019s behavior (good or bad). I saw a direct correlation between the student\u2019s behavior during his class and the grade received. So I gathered together the eight \u2018goodie-goods\u2019 of my homeroom, and asked them to trust me, and take a chance to help their peers. I asked them to place the following sentence in the middle of the second to last paragraph of their next report. It went, \u201cMr. (So-in-so) will never read this, he only counts the pages, and number of pictures in my report!\u201d and to allow eight other children to copy their reports, but change the title page. The student\u2019s grades were almost identical to the grades they received on the previous reports! (One child\u2019s went up a half grade, and two went down a half grade. The \u2018goodie-goods\u2019 grades were not affected). After a one-on-one meeting with the teacher, we came to a mutual agreement and the students noticed immediate changes. Some of which meant they couldn\u2019t slack off any more by Cut and Pasting information they found on the internet. I spent thirty years in a \u2018You taught there?\u2019 school. There were good teachers, great teachers, and teachers that needed adjustments. However, every professional there, was there to help the children. In my school, No teacher EVER graded a child based on liking them or disliking them! As my principal often stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not like the parents are hiding the best children at home, they are sending us their best.\u201d ",

It wasn\u2019t dependent on whom they liked, but they had already seemingly decided who got what grades.

            "answer_text": "I have had both this and the reverse happen to me. The reverse being that teachers expected more out of me than my peers and therefore graded me harder. The latter happened more often than the formerly mentioned. My first experience with a teacher not liking me was made very clear my Freshman year of high school. I was in Spanish I and was a first semester freshman. My Spanish teacher did not like chocolate, and while most were confused, I was curious so I asked her why she didn\u2019t like chocolate, because almost everyone likes chocolate. From that point forward, she would mark me tardy when I was there before the 3-minute bell rang, try to give me detention for stuff that I wasn\u2019t even doing, accuse me of cheating, and grade me harder than everyone else. Well, one day, I decided that I was not going to take it. I checked the time on my phone, like every other kid in the class did, and my teacher freaked out and said \u201cNo telefono. Detencion Carolina?\u201d My response was pure gold. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means. We never learned that word Mrs. P.\u201d Turns out, the whole class rallied behind me, so I didn\u2019t get in trouble. That was pure luck, but I made it through that semester. Having the opposite done to me was a little better, but still not fun. My sophomore and junior years, I had two English teachers who expected a lot out of me. My sophomore year, I had the highest grade in the class first semester, and then second semester, she started grading my writing differently. It was graded harder than she had in two years. Same essays, same style, same format, same writing ability, different grade. When I talked to her about it, she said \u201cThis is what they would give you in Honors Enligh, so this is what I\u2019m giving you here. I believe you should have been put in Honors English 10 instead, so that\u2019s how I grade you.\u201d The same thing repeated itself the next year with a different teacher. Also during my sophomore year, I had a physics teacher that expected greatness from me. I had friends in my class who he knew were not going to major in a STEM field like I was in college, so he graded us differently. If I did not write down the formula -1, if I did not show every step -1, if I made any tiny error -1, all of those things would not have been counted off for others. It pushed me, but I\u2019m kind of glad he did that. ",

            "answer_text": "Some *bad* teachers do and they should leave the profession if they \u201cgive\u201d students bad grades. Students EARN bad grades. I have NEVER lowered a student\u2019s grade because I don\u2019t like them. In fact, ALL students get 2 assignments dropped per quarter and have the option to do test corrections or alternate assignments among other things. However, for students that demonstrate a strong work ethic and are generally decent human beings but just aren\u2019t that great at standardized tests (which is 20% of their overall grade) I have \u201cfound\u201d missing assignments, realized I \u201cforgot\u201d to add extra credit to a test, or exempted an additional grade (I think they were actually absent that day, right?) in order to BOOST a grade\u2026typically just from an F to D. Some people may say lowering bad and raising good is essentially the same thing but I disagree. Bad decisions shouldn\u2019t be rewarded. Good decisions should. It may not always work this way in the \u201creal world\u201d but it should\u2026and it will in MY class. ",

The lowest grade I ever got on a paper was an 82. I took an anthropology class from a known Communist a while back. This woman gave me 60\u2019s on every paper that I wrote. I ended up with an F in the class when I had never even gotten a C in any class. The hardest part of this whole process was refraining from giving her a piece of my mind, which might have gotten me in trouble with the university. Some professors have huge egos. If you step on their ego in any way, they will downgrade you. If they feel insulted by anything you say, down go your grades. My first paper with said Communist was a paper that spoke against socialism, so thereafter, every paper was downgraded. I can see her rage when grading those papers. She must\u2019ve tried to justify it by scoffing to herself every time she saw my name on a paper. She probably smiled as well, with maybe an evil chuckle under her breath. ",

I\u2019ll write about two incidents that happened with me\u2026 When I was in 1st grade, my best friend (one of the top 10 students of the class) sat in front of me during a class test. She asked me for answers to a few questions and I told her, even though I wasn\u2019t sure of my answers being correct. Well, turned out they were the wrong answers and the teacher believed that I copied off my friend! So while grading the papers, she called us both to the front of the class and started scolding us, but only accused me of cheating and in turn slapped me (this was when hitting students was still allowed in India). I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve that reputation\u2026but looking back at my report cards from those early grades, I was a very bright student! LolThis happened when I was doing my MBA in Pune, Maharashtra. There was a lecturer whose last name I couldn\u2019t pronounce properly and he made an issue of that and made fun of my name every single class! I took it as a joke and even proved to him that I learnt to say his name correctly. During a group assignment and presentation, I got the lowest score out of the 4 of us. And one of the people was one who didn\u2019t do any work got a good grade just because the rest of us did the work! When I asked why I got a bad grade compared to my team mates, he just brushed me off giving some lame excuse I can\u2019t remember right now; but I do remember it was utter BS! He literally took out his revenge this way because I messed up pronouncing his name. And he was very biased towards my classmates who came from the same state as him.",

Obviously he couldn\u2019t give me poor marks for most things because, let\u2019s face it\u2026 numbers are numbers. If my numbers are right there\u2019s no way he can get around that. There was, however, ONE way he could stick it to me\u2026 and it was called the \u201cProblem of the Week.\u201d It was stupid. It was a silly stupid word problem that we had to do every week. Unfortunately, it was a pretty significant portion of our grade, and because the answers were written in paragraph form\u2026 you see where I\u2019m going with this? These were objective questions and rarely ever had any mathematical value to them, so I don\u2019t know what place they really held in a math class, but I digress. Without fail, I always received a D. My brother, however, was in the same class. He always got an A. One week I asked to work with him on the problem of the week. We worked together so, naturally, we had pretty much the same answer. It was worded slightly (and I mean SLIGHTLY) different, but we had, in essence, the same answer. Well\u2026 we turn them in and on the day they\u2019re given back, Scott has an A and I have a D. He then announces aloud to the class, \u201cBrett, which one of you cheated off the other?\u201d Doofy lookin mofo wasn\u2019t happy with his life, I guess, so he chose to take it out on a seventh grader who was always trying to be polite and kind to everyone. Well\u2026 my parents took it up with the front office. The problem of the week then promptly disappeared from our weekly routine. ",

            "answer_text": "Students certainly think so, but I have never known a teacher to do so. I have seen instructors give out high grades that aren't entirely earned, but I\u2019ve never known one to give out a low grade unfairly. We know that people will complain about low grades, so there has to be objective justification for doing so; normally, this is because of poor performance. I write LOTS of comments on essays and papers to explain what the student did wrong, but I still get complaints from students that expected to get a better grade. We also want our students to do well. Effort will sometimes get you leeway (and a better grade) because we know that you are trying and that you care. If every student did well, we would love it. That just doesn't happen, though, and often because of students who don't care. Some teachers grade based on a student\u2019s aptitude\u2014what is C work for one student might be the best work possible for another\u2014but I try not to. I always have objective things I am looking for in grading and stick to a rubric. Sometimes I am a bit harder on the good students because I know they can do better, but it is only ever a difference of a few points. Are there some teachers who give out bad grades to students they dislike? Of course. They are bad teachers. Most teachers, however, don't do this, no matter how often students think it happens. ",

But if a student is exceptionally disagreeable, I\u2019m not going to give that student any breaks. I think it is an important life lesson for people to learn that they are not entitled to favors or special treatment, and that it is necessary to build positive relationships. For example, I had a student in an online college course who refused to read the feedback I left on her work and responded to every grade with lengthy, angry emails - which meant I had to spend time rewriting the feedback in an email response AND reminding her to look at her feedback. She\u2019d call, text - all very accusatory and unpleasant. The online class she was in ended on a Saturday at 11:59 PM. The student had a tendency to submit work a few hours late. It is school policy that professors do not have to accept work after the class has ended (but they can use their discretion to do so in some situations). I reminded her of the policy several times in the week before the end of class and warned her very clearly and very specifically that work submitted after the course ended, on Saturday, at 11:59 PM by the classroom timestamp, would not be accepted. She submitted her last paper six hours late. I did not accept it. Zero on her final paper. Could I have taken her paper? Yes. But I did not. (No other students submitted their work late, so it wasn\u2019t an unfair penalty - she was the only one penalized for late work because she was the only one who was late). ",

So if a student makes our lives hard we won\u2019t go out of our way making his/hers easy and the same is true for those who treat us with respect. I won\u2019t say I would give bad grades to a student who I don\u2019t like, but I won\u2019t offer help either. Actually I try really hard to like every student. Still, if a student behaves well, tries hard and treats me with dignity I am sure more likely to lend a helping hand or give them the benefit of the doubt. ",

Im going to be honest, I marked papers and gave grades that were above deserved if I liked a student that put enough effort in without the output being expected. For example, I had a student who was really struggling with sentence structure in German. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldnt place verbs in the correct order which is rather difficult for new learners. However, he decided that he would see me for some additional help which I was happy to provide, and, by the end of term test he went into the writing and grammar areas quite confidently from what I saw. Yet, when I marked his paper, he just hadn\u2019t got the concept in there - this was a surprise. And so, concluding the marking of his paper, I came to see that he had (and, yes, I remember everything on his grade) 63% which, for this test, earned him a C. However, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to give him such a low mark, and so decided to try and find ways of giving him even a few extra marks to push for a C+. I managed to, and so gave him a C+ through some controversial marking purely due to his determination! So, in conclusion, I graded papers generously to those who put in effort! ",

At most schools, there are grading rubrics which define the criteria for each letter grade. Teachers must justify that students deserve the grade that they earned based on the grading rubric. If a student disagrees with the grade, they can file a grade appeal at most schools. At that point, there is an investigation. If you feel that you received a grade lower than what you thought you earned, you should appeal it. Each side must present evidence and an independent party or group makes a decision. In my experience, most teachers award the student that grade they earned based on the grading rubric. If you feel that your grade is unfair or wrong, then you should formally appeal it. ",

I've had to fail students I genuinely enjoyed because they either didn't turn assignments in or they didn't do well even after repeated attempts at remediation. Conversely, I've gladly recorded As for students whose attitudes I didn't particularly care for, but who demonstrated mastery in their work. Most of the educators I know personally also deal with students in this way.

This hasn\u2019t always been the case, so I make it a goal to get the teacher to love me while I simultaneously do absolutely nothing important in their class. Absolutely nothing important. But I still end up with good grades on tests, quizzes, or even on occasion, they will enter my homework grades for full credit, when I sure as hell didn\u2019t do it.

            "answer_text": "Had to answer this question. I just gave my ICSE boards and did decently okay. I had a certain subject teacher who used to hate me for no reason. He never gave me a score above 85 in his subject. However, I liked the subject, I did not care about the marks and studied it religiously. During our semester, when we had our marking of our projects, I had another huge issue with this teacher and I was totally sure that he would definitely screw my internal assessment grades. Fast forward to my boards- I did extremely well in this subject and it was a flawless paper. When the results came out, I got a 98 in the subject. I was 100% sure that the 2 marks had been deducted in the internal assessment. I went up to the teacher on the day of the results and told him my marks. My friend standing there slyly said that he was confident that the teacher had deducted the 2 marks in the internal assessment and the teacher have him a tough look. Confirmed my fear though and also answered your question. Yes, if a teacher doesn't like you, he will screw you for sure. ",

Some instructors have a small percentage of grade reserved for a students performance in class and his temperament. Many would grade students by the curriculum agreed at the start of the course. But, having said that, instructors can change grades if not satisfied, usually they try to push towards a better grade. I mean, most instructors expect students to do their best in class with a sincere effort. They usually wouldn\u2019t want to screw someone\u2019s grade unless you make them think otherwise. Come on man even they are humans and could portray a bad impression on their colleagues and students for nepotism. This is just my opinion and from my experience as a Teaching Support Assistant. Having said that, I also want to say that while there are many ethical professors with whom I\u2019ve worked with, I have a few experiences when I was doing my education in India where in a few cases, where their ego was more important to professors than ethics. I\u2019ve experienced favoritism, superior and subordinate relationships among professors. All in all, to conclude, a fair professor won't grade depending on their liking but a few morons would not mind giving a bad grade. ",

Because the professor argued that I used the wrong tense with my verbs. I wrote that a particular character did something, instead of saying he was doing something. Because I used past tense instead of present tense, he gave me a lesser grade. Now a cute boy, who sat behind me, whom he would flirt with, got an A. I found out a semester later, that no girl who took this professor's class ever received better than a B. Now I don't know that boy didn't deserve the A, but I know that I didn't deserve the B. ",

If we like the student, we are tickled by his achievement. If we don\u2019t particularly like (or actively dislike) the student, we aren\u2019t necessarily giddy, but we\u2019re still glad. And we\u2019re not particularly thrilled when the calculation at the end is on the wrong side of pass/fail, whether we like the student or we don\u2019t. When one of my students achieves what you, dear student, would consider a bad grade, it\u2019s only because he didn\u2019t care to make the effort to earn what you would call a good grade. I suspect that I\u2019m not unlike most teachers in this way. We like it when the grades are high. Do any teachers deliberately lower a grade because they don\u2019t like a student? Maybe. Probably. Yes. My hunch is that it happens rarely. ",

In 9th grade, my physics teacher (Who is still one of my favorite teachers, he teaches another class of mine now) gave me an 89 on a lab while my friend, who did just as good if not better, only received an 85. The teacher never gave anyone bad grades unless they did really bad or cheated (a different friend of mine turned an English essay into a science paper and was caught, but still got a passing grade). In 7th grade, I was going through a rough patch mentally and was subsequently doing poorly in several classes. I flunked spanish, and definitely would have flunked my english and science classes had those teachers not seriously helped me out and were very forgiving in my grades, allowing me to pass with d+/c- ",

I looked at my paper, 0. I didn't understand. I got 100s on everything in every subject (I was and still am that kid). I was marked to a zero because I doodled on the bottom of my paper because I finished early. Not to mention, I only finished early because we, in AAP science, were being given the same work as regular science. This dropped my grade from a 100 to a 80. WHAT! I was furious. She said she did that because I clearly didn't care about her class and didn't respect her authority. My friend, who also doodled on his paper, got full marks. If this isn't unfair I don't know what is. ",

            "answer_text": "I swear i'm always getting grades as low as 80 because of my ugly bitch face syndrome (and this year of my 11th Grade, I was given a grade of 75, it's not my fault for misplacing my journal it the teacher's fault). I'm always nice around people but because of these judgemental hypocrites in the Philippines i always end up getting these bad grades. Here in the Philippines, once you are attractive and close to the teachers, when i say close as in super friends, you'll get a grade of at leadt 88 to 98. Most teachers here in PH, will grade how you talk or recite but they don't give a fuck about the works of the students. They don't give a fuck how hardwork or effort you gave to their projects. They don't care about the student's mental health. How the students sleep less than 5 hours or less. How they cope up with others. The educations system here is so old that it should've rot in the 80's or 90's but still they don't have the guts to change it. ",

I have improved since then with medication for my ADHD and overall maturity, but I was a dick. I hated writing in my journal because I didn't like to take notes. (I still don't. I only have to wake up for like 5 seconds in my core classes to get the lesson.) I argued and asked pointless questions. I talked to my friend who sat next to me. I often didn't turn my work in on time or completed, and almost never to the best of my ability. However, if I earned an A, I got one. And I got my grade from a D to a B when I started medicating and giving a shit. ",

My freshman year in HS, General Science (what is that??) was taught by a Mr Mackowiak, who might not have been able to spell \u2018science\u2019. On my first 6-weeks report cart I got a C despite getting 100 on every quiz and test. A meeting with the Principal with my parents elicited the following explanation: He have me an A for written work, but an F for classroom participation, because I was always correcting him. My parents had some influence, so that was his last day teaching science. ",

They can give you a bad grade if they don't like your politics, looks, if you question them on what they're teaching, etc... there can be a myriad of things they may not like about you. But, here's the thing, it's not all teachers who do this. Some have a higher level of professionalism, but, there is that few that give the others a bad name. ",

Each person was in a group of about 3 people, and we collected the data together and figured out the equations separately. I turned mine in a little late, but no points were subtracted for a late assignment. I believed I had gotten a decent grade, but a few days later it turned out that I got a 2.7/4. One of the reasons why? My data that I collected and entered was apparently \u201ctoo big\u201d, and got subtracted 0.5 points for that. The dumbest part? My group had the exact same data as me and didn't get subtracted any points.  The only bright side was that I was able to fix my other mistakes for a higher grade. ",

What does it matter?\u201d He got a 90% on the final despite being on his phone 75% of my class. I\u2019m pretty sure he got a B.

Number 1- Not every teacher is like every other. Some teachers may be biased, but an overwhelming majority do not. And Number 2- If you\u2019re looking at all the other answers and contradicting number 1, that\u2019s because almost all of them would be talking about the one annoying teacher. After all, who\u2019s going to take time to talk about the teacher who\u2019s perfectly fine? No one, because that\u2019s boring and not worth the time to write, but the interesting/funny/memorable answer is going to be the one jerk who always had it in for you. So of course, everyone writes about that. Not trying to downplay or illegitimate any of these answers, but there is a reason why most of them are against teachers. Just think about that before you bring out the pitchforks. ",

Students who, when absent, I did a mental \u201cYES!\u201d because it meant my next 45 minutes would be easier with them out that day. I have learned to separate my personal feelings from them as students and their grades. My job is to teach them, and grades are supposed to reflect if they have learned the content. ",

I taught high school math for 4 years and I can honestly say that my students\u2019 grades reflected their effort and knowledge, and not my feelings towards them. However, in a different subject, such as language, where there is the opportunity for a more vague grading system, such as when grading a writing assignment, there is room for ambiguity on the teachers end. Subjectivity, really. It doesn't mean teachers do this, but it is a possibility in any subject, with any teacher. ",

We practically became his pets and role models (even though we despised the class). One day, though, classmate B and I were joking around with classmate C (who was an average B-C student) that the teacher loved us. Classmate B, C, and I decided to help each other on a packet. We all put the same answers to multiple choices, had the same info, and papers. Once we got our papers back, classmate B and I had gotten 100% while classmate C\u2019s had said \u201cGood job, you tried harder\u201d along with a B+. ",

That year his grades dropped to almost failing, we got a tutor outside of the class who expressed he was doing well with Maths and had no problem, we tried to address the problem with the school, they did not do much other than protect the teacher and telling us our son had attitude. He just passed that year, the following year a new teacher and his grades are back up. So yes it's very important to make a good impression on your teacher at the cost of your grades. ",

My feelings on each student have zero impact on the grade he/she earns. What does come into play is the end-of-the-year curve. All students who are a few points away from the next letter-grade cutoff are receiving a curve. The exception applies to the ones who skip 30% or more of my classes. In that case, those students aren\u2019t given any free points. I feel that matches the way life rewards you: sometimes showing up is a reflection on your commitment. ",

She used to give better grades to so called \u201cteacher's pet\u201dtype of students. She was never vigilant to clear the fusillade of doubts of students except for those who always surrounded her and followed her everywhere. This made me believe that still their are teachers who give best grades to the students they like . I guess this reason was enough to create a feeling of contempt amongst us. If teachers like her continues to be a part of teaching profession then surely a day will come when students will forget to respect teachers . ",

The professor approved it but was apparently under the delusion that I was going to come to an anti creationist conclusion. When he graded it he failed me on the grounds that I had made an inappropriate choice of subject. When I called him out on this in class and pointed out that he had pre-approved it he said let me see that I\u2019ll check the grade. What he did was mark me off 30% and there were only two red marks on the paper and they were both one letter typos. He gave me the highest score he could that would still prevent me from getting an \u2018A\u2019 for the course. I got my degree and this was the only class where I did not get a 4.0 grade. I was just getting a two-year accounting degree so I didn\u2019t really care. My advice to anyone getting a science degree would be keep your creationism to yourself until you have that degree in your hand. ",

And anyway, in the UK university system it is pretty much impossible to give a \u2018bad grade\u2019 for unjustifiable reasons. I was Senior Lecturer and exams officer for Education Studies at Keele University for several years and I can confirm that the assessment and examination process is very fair and unbiased. UK universities have visiting external examiners for every course and these examiners are totally neutral and carefully check all results, especially high and low grades. Students also have the right of appeal against any result and grades can be upped for extenuating circumstances. Most essays are double marked. Grades have to be agreed by both markers, then go through departmental validation, external examination and finally (!) be approved at Senate level in the university. So, as I say, about as rigorous as you could get. ",

Back in 11th-12th grade, I took chemistry and continued with advanced chemistry. This means that I had this teacher for 2 years. In the 12th grade, he chose me to participate in a state-wide competition. I did well enough to be invited to the national competition. Unfortunately, I had a prior engagement and could not attend. I informed the teacher after class as soon as I learned about the conflict. (This was in April, so he was my teacher for a year and 8 months.) The next class, in front of the class, he started criticizing my handwriting and even compared it to another student\u2019s. (My handwriting is horrible due to my having juvenile arthritis. It\u2019s bad enough that I try to never write, only type.) This has been mentioned to me by every teacher, except for one PE teacher. (I now had no respect for this teacher, due to him picking on the other student. I wanted to just not show up for his class anymore, and sense I was emancipated at this time, I could have easily done so. However, this would have been immature even for a 17 year old.) Twelve years later, after serving in the military, I finally read my transcripts and discovered that I received a \u201cB\u201d in his class. I can\u2019t be sure that he did this out of spite or I unconsciously did worse because I then despised him. Although when I took college chemistry I received an \u201cA+.\u201d ",

Of course, they have to justify their evaluation of student work if challenged, so they probably wouldn\u2019t assign an F to A work. They would probably nitpick good work to find reasons to mark it down. I think the much more likely scenario, however, is for teachers to cut a lot of slack to students they do like. Also, confirmation bias would make teachers tend to expect good students to submit good work and color their objectivity. Grading rubrics may help objectivity, but I have my doubts. Some grading is inherently subjective. ",

I will say, however, that I may be a little harsher in grading those students along the criteria I have established than I might for another student \u2014 where I might give a good student the benefit of the doubt that they seemed to understand and answer the question or a point within the question, I might deem the other student to not have answered that same point. I try to be consistent, but in reality, unless you're talking about multiple choice or true-false or mathematical calculations, grading by teachers is an exercise in subjectivity to some degree controllable only by rubrics and ethics.

When I was in tenth grade there was one test I was confident about above all other tests, it was for my math class and I was sure I was gonna get a good grade but to my surprise I got a 60 while the laziest kid in class got a 105 and he was a average in math while I was alternating between a B and A. I was shocked by that and very upset over it but eventually I came to realize that grade because apparently I was ahead of myself in math class and was even tutoring my classmates and she didn\u2019t want that to get in my head. Further proof is the fact the teacher never handed back the test and only showed us our grades in her gradebook. ",

And the duty of teacher is to educate the students to become what they want to be. The grade of the student is based on his paper results rather than teacher\u2019s own thoughts. ",
