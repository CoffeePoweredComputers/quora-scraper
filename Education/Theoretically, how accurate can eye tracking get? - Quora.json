            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question. You may think that the accuracy of eye tracking is limited to about 0.5\u20131\u00b0 degrees, because that is the size of the fovea. Accuracy cannot be smaller than that, because when we calibrate our eye tracker, this is how accurately we look at the calibration points. 0.5\u00b0 is also a very common error - inaccuracy - that we find in many eye trackers. However, our subjective feeling of looking at small objects suggests that we can attend to items much smaller than 0.5\u00b0. I think we need to develop better calibration methods to achieve better accuracy. Today the eye-tracked person looks around at 5 or 9 or so points. Of course when they saccade to points, their eye movements are not exact. They undershoot, overshoot and make corrections. A better way to calibrate the eye tracker is to do it in two steps: First to make a regular calibration, and then adjust the calibration result by using one of the post-calibration routines that have been developed in literature. I am partial to those of Blignaut on the one hand, and of Rucci and Poletti, on the other. They have proven that you can press accuracy down on both high-end eye trackers like the DPI and home-built eye camera units. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 2 separate points here How accurately does the human eye focus? - it actually doesn't. The eye is constantly moving and what we call fixations are just microsaccades.The tracker itself should be able to capture this extremely fast small movements of the eye. While quite a few trackers claim to do this (only in a very controlled lab set up), the technology and particularly the sampling rate of trackers, in my opinion, still needs to get better.",
