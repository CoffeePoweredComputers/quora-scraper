Go for the best if you are not enough then you will surely get the least.Try harder guys, in this world nothing is easy . In my knowledge ,there is no exam exist in India where there is minimum competition. You might have heard about MTS conducted by ssc. If you know about the job profile then I am sure you will not fill the form. Even in this exam you will see there is lot of competition. Sorry to say if you are searching for least competitive exam then you should not try in this field. By the way ,if you are pursuing your graduation then I will suggest you to go for higher studies and do your best in your own field ,I am sure this is easy and best way to achieve something better then trying these government exams . Thank you for reading this . ",
