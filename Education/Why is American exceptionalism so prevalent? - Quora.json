            "answer_text": "First, I would like to say that some of the most popular answers written here are just \u201cstinky\u201d. Rather than attempting to really figure out an indepth answer to this question, they choose to use this as a way of promoting good old USA bashing. (again, Ernest). To make my point, I, like many others here have mentioned, have never heard ANYONE EVER say any of quotes attributed here as the way we feel about our country. \u201cGift to the world\u201d? Really? And some, like \u201cArsenal of Democracy\u201d and our President being, \u201cThe Leader of the Free world\u201d are undeniable truths. At the time the arsenal quote was coined we WERE supplying most of the \u201cbutter and bullets\u201d used by the Allies to defeat the Axis powers. Were we not? And has the US President not been looked to guide the free world for many years? So why are these truths being used in such an ugly way? That I can\u2019t explain. Nor do I wish to try. But I will encourage men like Ernest, to read the \u201cArsenal of Democracy speech given by FDR on Dec 29th 1940 American Rhetoric: Franklin Delano Roosevelt before scoffing at the nickname or calling it \u201cpropaganda\u201d. (by the way, shame on you sir, for tarnishing this great speech) BUT, I believe that a true answer to this question has not been touched upon yet. That answer is pretty simple. And I believe what I am about to write here will put to rest this stupid argument over American Exceptionalism. (feel free to pass this along to President Obama. He can use it to get everyone off his back on this subject) Is the American youth \u201cbrainwashed\u201d at an early age to believe they are part of an exceptional nation? I don\u2019t know about \u201cbrainwashed\u201d, but each history book has a pair of rose colored glasses handed out with them. Why? Because if you teach your youth that their country is mediocre, then you will raise a country full of mediocre children. Teach US children that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fight in WW II, while we just stood around and watched and you will raise a nation of youth that won\u2019t mind doing just that the next time a world bully shows his ugly face. Instead the young men and women of the US Armed Forces are instilled with the idea that it is our nations responsibility to help out whenever needed. Any idea what the world would look like if the US wasn\u2019t around? As a proud tribal member of the Seven Feathers Band of Umpqua Indians, I know of the abuse my people endured at the hands of the white men that took our land, broke their own treaties and treated us like non-people. But I learned all of this through the efforts of my elders. Growing up my text books spoke of making my people \u201ccivilized\u201d, teaching us the white mans way of life as a way of helping us. And when we didn\u2019t comply, we were referred to as \u201csavages\u201d that could not understand the \u201cgift\u201d we were being given. So I ask you, should my grade school self have been taught about the injustice my people endured? To an extent, yes. (more on that in a minute). To bring this answer to a close, I want everyone to put themselves in the shoes of people most responsible for shaping the minds of the youth of a nation. Not just the USA, but any nation. No, every nation. The writers of history books used in schools. As you sit down to tell the tale of your nation\u2019s history, you must decide what you want these young impressionable minds to know. Should you go for complete truthfulness? Include every misdeed? Lift the carpet and expose all that which has been swept under it? Teach the children of your nation that they are same as every other youth in every other nation? That they should not celebrate the individual accomplishments their forefathers achieved? Definitely not find pride in the sacrifices made by Fathers and Grandfathers (my Grandfather died in an ugly forest, on German soil in WWII)? Write a history book that tells nothing of national pride but promotes the theory of mediocrity. That your nation is no better or worse than all the others. Include every stain, wart and screw up that your nation was responsible for. Make sure that you include the fact that their nation\u2019s efforts during a great war were too late to have made any real difference in the outcome (thus making it extremely hard for a small boy to understand why Grandpa died in the ugly forest on German soil). Include every detail of the treatment of people that were not like the founders of their nation\u2026 Write THAT history book and you will find yourself with a nation of men and women that are mediocre. Ones that believe their nation has no moral compass and no responsibility to help out on the world stage. Work harder to improve how their nation is perceived? Why? My Parents and Grandparents did nothing special with their lives. They were happy living in an average nation, being mediocre people. So will I. My ancestors turned a blind eye toward the treatment of others. So will I. Is that the history book that some here would have written? Should the youth of this nation be shown that they have no reason to be proud of our past? Should they also be taught that to strive to be the best or (heaven forbid) boast of being the best, is a sign of weakness or lack of character? If so, should Muhammad Ali have been ashamed of himself for proclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m the greatest of all time\u201d? Would Vince Lombardi have been able to build his Green Bay dynasty by telling his team, \u201cWinning isn\u2019t everything, no, really, winning isn\u2019t everything. Now go out there and be mediocre!\u201d Instead of, \u201cPerfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.\u201d As for me, I would like to thank the writers of the history books I grew up on. They gave me just enough information to make me research about the treatment of my ancestors, but not enough to hate this great nation. They told me why my Grandfather fought and died in Hurtgen forest on German soil. And in doing so, filled a young boy with pride that a member of my family had made the ultimate sacrifice to help defeat the Axis powers. They told me enough about the horrors of slavery to live my life judging people by character, not by the color of their skin. I have worked hard everyday of my adult life to be exceptional. To be the best, by doing the best I can. I have taught my sons and daughters this same concept. And they are, without a doubt, EXCEPTIONAL! If you would like to start teaching your children to be mediocre, that\u2019s fine. But forget trying to cast shame on the people of this great nation for proclaiming the US to be exceptional. To be the Greatest, you have to work hard to prove it. To be a winner, you have to tell yourself you\u2019re a winner. And if you tell yourself you\u2019re a winner and you work hard to prove it\u2026you WILL be exceptional. The United States of America is living proof of this. Thank GOD for rose colored glasses. Thanks for reading. Remember to always treat those around you with love and respect. Even the mentally ill who take the lives of innocent women and children in the name of religion. ",

            "answer_text": "America is nowhere near perfect, but it is unquestionably exceptional. Quick Facts: America receives 20% of all the world\u2019s immigrants.[1] This is 4 times higher than the next two countries (Russia and Germany 5%). 1 in every 5 immigrants flock here, often overcoming severe hardship to make it here, because they believe that America is exceptional in at least someway (other wise they\u2019d go somewhere else).26% of Americans are \u2018First Generation Americans,\u2019 [2]either immigrants or their US born children. Each family brings it\u2019s own history, culture and heritage to be mixed into the cultural stew that is America. Instead of disparate cultural conclaves, Americans embrace the unity and common experiences of diverse cultures.Americans give more to charity than any nation in history. The wealthiest 1% of Americans alone account for 1/3 of all charity worldwide.[3] According to Gallup\u2019s \u201cWorld View World Poll,\u201d Americans are more likely than any other nation to \u201chelp a stranger.\u201d [4]Humanitarian organizations receive nearly four times as much from Americans than any other nation.[5]The US has given the most food aid in the history of the world. [6]In just 240 years, America has helped lead the world from candles and stones to LEDs and iPhones. Even the poorest people alive today have better access to more resources, and greater opportunity than even kings of the 1700\u2019s. America is where the principles which spur such innovation were nurtured, developed and then shared with the world. (See American inventions below)America is kinder in conflict than almost any other country. Consider Japan post-WWII, a nation ripe for collapse and chaos. Now, Japan is one of the most advanced, innovative and powerful nations in the world. The US made that happen, even after Pearl Harbor and the other atrocities that happened to guys like my grandpa in the Pacific theater. America sends aid in the form of money, food, clothing, etc. to nations that openly despise us, some of our enemies receive more aid than our allies. [7]America is an abstaining, disciplined superpower. If America wanted to be an \u2018evil empire,\u2019 we could start with Canada and have it conquered by lunchtime. Canada has massive resources and it\u2019s population would easily integrate (they\u2019re practically American anyway). America\u2019s military might is unmatched (see below), yet America never takes over nations and governs them, but instead gives control back to the locals. Consider Iraq, Afghanistan, Grenada, Haiti and Bosnia, going all the way back to Germany and Japan.[8]10 Great Things: What To Love About The United States | Dinesh D'Souza American Innovation: 13 Born-in-the-USA inventions Top 100 American Inventions of All Time 20 American Inventions That Changed the World United States history -- American exceptionalism American achievements Towards the end of poverty How do Americans stand out from the rest of the world?
