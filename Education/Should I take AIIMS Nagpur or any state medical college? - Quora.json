            "answer_text": "A2A First of all I assume that you are a citizen of Maharashtra . So whether you take any state college or any Aiims other then Delhi is depends on many factors \u2022 The rank you got \ud83d\ude04 \u2022Can you adjust yourself in other state , culture , language etc \u2022How homesick you are Although am a student of Aiims Nagpur but I will trying to give unbiased opinion. Firstly I will tell about what our college have \u2022Quality faculty and education \u2022 Library with full of standard books \u2022Strict director ma'am \ud83d\ude04 \u2022 Infrastructure are developing but hostels ,opd , mess is lit \ud83d\udd25 \u2022As of now we don't have any fest ( will be organising in future) \u2022Sports facilities are okay okay with with badminton court ,table tennis ,bollyvol , basketball, cricket ground is almost ready \u2022 College campus is slightly outside the city so you have to take care of yourself if you came at night coz cabs are not ready to go there \u2022IIM Nagpur are also there and the reason you know why am mentioning it. lol \u2022 we have green campus which means no bikes are allowed These are the things which you must know about Aiims Nagpur . Back to your question that should I take any state college or aiims nagpur so in my opinion if you got college like BJ medical or KEM I just want to say any reputated college you must go with coz they have adequate patients plathora which helps you alot and you can learn just by observing them .(Aiims Nagpur students have adequate exposue of patients so don't worry about this ) But if you didn't get top state college then dost just go with any aiims as this is central institute so the amount of funding it receives is much more than state college . As a whole I mean to say any aiims grows much faster rate than state college . Actually it really don't matter from which college you did UG I can give you lot of example of some famous doc in my locality and even you can notice in your locality too that they are did their ug from some average college and then did Pg from best college like pgi Chandigarh aiims Delhi jipmer etc . What matters in ug is how well you study (self-study ) . If you go with aiims then you have tag of aiimsonian which is itself an achievement \ud83d\udd25 So work hard get good marks in entrance and grab that one seat which is waiting for you either in aiims or state college (top ) . All the best ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Shubham Khese Let us move towards the core of the question and have an analogy analysis first. Here is a picture you need to observe keenly.  Take Y axis as excellence and X axis as time passed .The first graph represents any well established and old state medical college, while the second graph depicts about any of the new AIIMS. The old colleges are already at the peak of their performance and these colleges aren't going to transform or improve a lot in the near future, and will remain more or less the same. No doubt they are progressing, but at a very slow rate. While all the new AIIMS are developing rapidly. And with ample central government fundings, world class infrastructure and some of the best human resources, there are N number of opportunities in front of these institutions, and they are going to become centres of excellence in the near future. Student-Teacher Ratio\u2014 The ratio of students to professor is much less in any AIIMS Institution compared to any other state medical college. This give additional extra edge of more central focus on students and more availability of resources to less number of students.Faculty\u2014 A fact to know, in any state where new AIIMS open, they offer payscale to faculties that is 2\u20133 times what they get in their state medical colleges. As a result, most of the top faculties of the state move to the particular AIIMS that gives them their academic excellence privilege.Facilities\u2014 No doubt, being central govt funded institution AIIMS always lead in terms of facilities in every aspect. Their hostels, laboratories, hospitals, libraries, sports, mess are all equipped with latest branded accessories.Hostels\u2014 This point is very important in case of medical colleges since MBBS is a very long duration course (5.5 yrs isn't a very short span) and cant be simply overlooked. Truly saying, except for the few top medical colleges and some other newly established govt colleges, hostels are in pathetic or below average conditions in most of the state govt colleges. Rooms are not furnished at all and many a times have to be shared by such number of students that's much beyond accommodation. Toilets\u2026better not to talk about them, washrooms occasionally cleaned, galleries are least concerned stuffs. Some colleges don't even manage to renovate their lecture halls. AIIMS on the other hand provide almost luxury life in their hostels (charging less than \u20b91000 a year lol) with almost each student having single room accomodation.Latest technology and Expensive equipments\u2014 Always been provided there in AIIMS be it virtual cadavers or any other technically advanced medical tool. Most state colleges have to manage with the old ones or even been funded to purchase new, not usually reach to students due to ample corruption (very evident in MP, UP, Rajasthan, Bihar as I've many friends there in different colleges and been told the reality).Cadavers\u2014 Availability of cadavers and number of students per cadaver have always been a trouble issue in most of the govt state medical colleges which is been not the case so far in any of the new AIIMS till date.Research Work\u2014 AIIMS institutions have always been indulged in active research works and promoting related activities even at UG level. This thing is rare or almost negligible in other medical colleges.Patient Load\u2014 This is the most ridiculous point I've found those saying \u201c Since these AIIMS are new, you will have less patient load in your hospital and hence less clinical exposure. \u201c For anyone in India having atleast a basic knowledge about the population and population density of the country, this would be an ample joke to make laugh till the stomach ache. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Why?? Have you ever seen a single hospital in your city where you don't have to wait for hours to meet the doctor or no any wait for getting an appointment. Really coming to the point, whichever city where new AIIMS are setup, they are planned to lower the loads on other hospitals and provide tertiary health care services which are not accessible in most of these areas in enough or vicinity.Healthcare Facilities Reliability\u2014 To know the reality of any new AIIMS, check where the politicians are admitted for treatment in their respective states, you'll get the answer yourself. For sake of examples AIIMS Patna, AIIMS Bbsr, AIIMS Bhopal, AIIMS Jodhpur, AIIMS Raipur, AIIMS Rishikesh\u2026all being trolled once as like these new AIIMS, and just few years later see their position. Apart from all these things, it is only studies that do matter in the end whether you are doing MBBS from AIIMS Delhi or from lowest ranked college of a state. \u00a0Saying on the same grounds, a student from a low ranked college with pathetic facilities can grab a top rank in NEET PG while another student from the top ranked college of the country can fail even in semesters. \u00a0Every college has its own pros and cons, so one need to be very wise while making a choice because it might affect his/her career to a certain extent. \u00a0PS- This answer is only meant to exterminate and demolish misconceptions and false assumptions made upon new AIIMS, NOT to humiliate or demean any other state colleges. Readers Discretion is advised at the end \ud83d\ude1c [The graphical portion used to elucidate the analogy is inspired from another AIIMSonian answer on a similar question.] ",
