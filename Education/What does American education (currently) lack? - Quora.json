            "answer_text": "Acknowledgement of talents and strong suits early on. I was taught how to read and write, and math all the way up to my multiplication tables by kindergarten by my grandparents. When we learning numbers and I tried to demonstrate addition to my teacher, she merely shut me down and said \"Well we're just concentrating on how to write numbers down.\" She then criticized the way I wrote 4s (the way you see on the screen, which apparently were \"flags\" and not 4s) and made me relearn to write them in a way no one writes 4s now. What a waste of time that year was. I get how school is not only teaching you academically but how to mature socially and emotionally, but frankly that way of teaching also hurt my confidence instead of addressing that while I needed more patience and humility, I definitely was ahead. When I messed up directions because I was bored when the teacher was explaining them and tried to skip ahead, I would be reprimanded for not following directions instead of people saying \"it's okay, here's a second chance, try to follow directions next time.\" Harrumph. Granted back when I was kid, ADHD wasn't a thing and the teacher had a lot of kids to take care of. -sigh- There are many tumblr posts where people recount experiences where teachers told them to stop getting ahead and even telling the parents to stop their kids from learning. Even now I hear kids from my neighborhood who are REALLY bored in math class because the school won't let them skip to higher ones.  Sorry this was more of a story versus a list, where the other answers definitely did a good job of, but just to show you even years later when kids learn what education should be like and ways to actually encourage children even if they made mistakes instead of shutting them down, they get really resentful and those kindergarten teachers they loved for years suddenly are the first people that let them down.

            "answer_text": "A lack of understanding of the difference between learning and teaching. Learning is pulling in what someone finds valuable. Teaching is pushing towards someone what the teacher finds valuable. Learning can happen without teaching. Teaching is just meaningless talk and motions without learning. Learning is also making connections. It's trying out what you know. It's refining your understanding and making the knowledge your own by using it. (The more personally meaningful the projects, the more profound the learning.) American schools are all about pushing massive amounts of information at kids. People naturally resist knowledge pushed on them that they don't have a use for. So why are educators surprised when kids resist 12 or more years of knowledge pushed on them that doesn't seem useful to them? It's inconvenient for teachers that kids resist but a perfectly predictable human reaction. Then after the pushing there's testing to see if it got in. But not whether the child actually understands it. Not whether the child can use it in a novel meaningful-to-the-child situation. (Which is much harder to test for.) Not whether the information will stick. The situation has only gotten worse with the focus on standardized testing. The hope was that tests would show weaknesses in teaching. But it only served to focus more strongly on the type of teaching that can be tested. The effect of that is that classrooms have moved further and further from the type of environment that fosters learning and understanding. ",
