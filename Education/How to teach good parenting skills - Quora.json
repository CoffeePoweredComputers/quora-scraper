            "answer_text": "How can one improve their parenting skills? By realizing a couple of simple facts: you took this up willingly. Nobody forced you and you are now on the hook for this job for as long as it takes. -Hint: assuming a healthy child, it will take vastly less time and will get progressively easier and more fun if you do it well.you only get ONE chance to raise your child. While there is always time (while their young) to rectify mistakes, there are NO re-dos.-Hint: if\u2026rather WHEN you do something wrong, talk to your child about it (given the appropriate maturity level) - it is OK to apologize and move on. It not only makes you feel better, it also teaches a great lesson to the child.the old adage about \u201cpicking your battles\u201d is a fallacy that leads to inconsistency and to confused and miserable children. If something was wrong yesterday, it is wrong today, and wrong tomorrow, until, perhaps, the child grows to the point where it is now allowed and thus no longer wrong. -Hint: if something is no longer wrong, make sure the child knows that and understands why.parenthood is a gift and a blessing, treat it as such every day and you will have a hard time going too far wrong.-Hint: like many things, if you find your time as a parent to be wholly or even mostly without joy, you are doing it wrong.I say this with almost every answer, but for the sake of you, your children and our common future they represent, I hope this helps.
