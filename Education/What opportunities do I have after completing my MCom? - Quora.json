In fact, this are excellent questions you had to ask yourself before starting studying your degree. In any case, it is time to do three major actions: A. Find out what your true passions, dreams, desires are about the world of work; Do not give up, do not fear from people's negative advice nor from your downgrade thoughts . If you do not act according to your real passion you will not be able to pave your career path. So it's time to ask, what do you like, dream about your occupational life? What was in your mind when you decided to attend studying? 1. How can I be an excellent in my work? 2. In what fields of performance do people tell me that I am excellent and I feel that I am truly performing well? 3. When I look forward and imagine my life, how do I see the employment aspect in my life? 4. Am I depressing or preventing myself from thinking about an occupation that pleasantly excites me because I want to be practical? 5. What is the environment in which I want to work? B. Curriculum Vitae It is important that you prepare a curriculum vitae that includes practical experience if you have a clear specification of what you initiated, what you changed, and whether you can add quantitative measures to your business. Your studies in the degree are also considered, and every project you did, except what is new, what is its contribution, what you brought to efficiency and improvement. It is important. For example: Introduced a new way to reduce supply time in 20% by developing a new policy. Handled the 50% workload increase (YoY) by outsourcing processes while retaining ROI Imported 500 daily items and $20 M worth of goods\u2026 Do not describe your jobs definition\u2019 describe your contributions. C. Create a networking system of relationships through social networks and direct employment directly to the list of companies you want to work in them.
