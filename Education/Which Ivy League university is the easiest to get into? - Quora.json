            "answer_text": "Overall (without regard to a particular student): Cornell. As pointed out, the easiest Ivy to get into for a specific student will depend on that student\u2019s fit. My daughter\u2019s good friend was rejected from Purdue but admitted to and attends Princeton. Colleges care a lot about \u201cyield\u201d - the conversions from admission to attendance - and this student was so exemplary that Purdue likely saw him as a high risk of getting admitted but attending elsewhere. Someone asked in a comment about Cornell\u2019s individual college admission statistics (some of the Cornell colleges admit as many students as an entire other Ivy school). The last data I could find broken down by college was from 2011 (note that the overall admission rate was higher then at 18% vs less than 15% now, in accord with the trend towards lower and lower admission rates at colleges): No College Designated 0% (there were 1,000+ applicants who trashed their app by doing this!) Arts & Sciences 15% (private) Architecture, Art & Planning 16% (private) Agriculture & Life Sciences 19% (statutory) Engineering 21% (private) Industrial & Labor Relations 24% (statutory) Hotel Administration 27% (private) Human Ecology 32% (statutory) TOTAL UNIVERSITY 18% Note that the two most difficult colleges to get into (as of 2011) are among the private (receive no state support) colleges including the largest college, Arts & Sciences. If this trend that A&S has an admit rate a few percentage points lower than the university average hold true today, then it is likely that Cornell A&S is no easier to get into than several of the other Ivies. Also note that the third hardest college to get into is the largest of the statutory colleges (those that receive partial state support): ALS, beating out the college of engineering. Even though these stats are out of date, they show that really this is not a statutory/private difference per se (after the first two the list alternates down the line), but likely reflects the different represented majors that make up each college. Cornell admits not only into a college but often also into an individual major, so this is another influence on an individual student\u2019s likelihood of getting in. It is likely that some majors within a college are more competitive than others, particularly in ALS given its size and diversity. Many of the majors in the statutory colleges are not represented at any of the other Ivies. Students in all colleges at Cornell can take classes in any of the other colleges. So Human Ecology students can take courses in CS or Philosophy (there is some restriction on the total credits outside of statutory colleges for those paying the lower in state tuition, but many bio courses in particular are dual numbered so don\u2019t count against this limit). Since the recent reorganization, the hotel school is demoted from a college and incorporated along with several other business departments formerly in other colleges into the new College of Business.

            "answer_text": "The easiest Ivy to get into is the one that you want to get into the most. Rewind back to 2015, Jan 1st. I was a high school senior then, and I was apply to schools for regular decision. At that point, I got in MIT/Caltech/UChicago and a few other schools for early action, so I wasn\u2019t trying too hard on the reminder of my applications\u2026 except for Harvard\u2019s and Stanford\u2019s, the two schools that I might go over MIT. Call me dumb or pretentious, but at that time, I really, really wanted to get in an Ivy. Thus, along with my Harvard application (that I prepared painstakingly for months), I threw in an app for Yale and another for Princeton. I knew nothing about Yale or Princeton. The thing you\u2019ll realize is that Ivys are all different, and you need to fit your essay into each one. That takes a lot of work and time that I didn\u2019t have as a last minute applicant. Of course, then, my applications for Yale and Princeton were trash. I didn\u2019t get in either. I got in Harvard and am going there right now. Sometimes I think about the time I wasted on New Year\u2019s Day for Yale and Princeton and I shake my head at how dumb it is\u2014 don\u2019t just apply to a ton of Ivys because it sounds nice and you want to get in at least one or something, that usually doesn\u2019t work. Research to get a sense of what you want, and then put everything you have to get in there; then, it\u2019ll be the easiest Ivy for you to get into. ",
