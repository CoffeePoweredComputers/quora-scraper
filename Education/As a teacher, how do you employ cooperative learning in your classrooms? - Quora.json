            "answer_text": "Great question! Cooperative learning is one of the best strategies to use in your classroom to encourage critical thinking, build community, and analyze a topic more thoroughly. Here are a few strategies that I use in my classes: Students seated in groups. I have my class set up with desks in groups on 4 (or I have also used larger tables). This makes starting any cooperative learning activity easy because students are already in groups. Often I will have a set of primary and secondary sources for them to analyze. I drop off one packet at each set of desks as I give instructions. Then students work in their groups to analyze the resources. I will usually change up the groups/seating quarterly or more often depending on how things are going. That allows students to work more closely with other students in the class. Station Activities. Sometimes an activity works better if students are moving around the room. For these lessons, I will place students into different groups than the ones they are seated in. It could be partners or groups of 3\u20134. A good way to do this is to print the activity on different colored paper and then pass it out to everyone. Then I say red is one group, blue, green, orange, are the next, etc. For these lessons, I will play music as they move to the stations so they stay at each one for a set amount of time and don;t rush to finish. It helps to have a larger classroom for these activities, but they are often very engaging! Partner Discussions. Often in lectures, I want students to share their thoughts, predict what might happen next, or take a stance. Students might be hesitant to share their immediate thoughts, so what I often do is first give everyone 30 seconds to talk about it with a \u201cshoulder partner\u201d seated next to them. I like to play the Jeopardy theme or another fun song while they discuss because it encourages better discussion than just in total quiet. Then I call on students to share and they\u2019re more comfortable doing so after getting the chance to talk it over with a classmate first. Hope those give you some ideas! ",

            "answer_text": "I use many cooperative-learning techniques in my English classes. The most common technique involves a whole-class discussion of a piece of literature. I use Socratic questioning to prompt responses from members of the group, who agree or disagree with each other about interpretations until we reach a sense of consensus. I make this technique more intimate by putting students in small groups, which can vary in size from ten to two. I randomize the constituents in these groups with a variety of strategies: by birth date, by shoe size, by height, by counting off numbers and putting same-numbered students in the same group. I occasionally modify these smaller groups in three ways: pairs and squares (in which a group of two merges with another group of two in order to compare and contrast answers and to discuss an expansion point), modified fishbowl (in which an inner circle of students discusses while an outer circle observes \u2026 until someone from the outer circle moves into the inner circle to temporarily contribute before moving back out), and stations (in which each corner of the room has a discussion question and different students rotate in different directions to discuss the answers to each question). I will also use groups of three to produce a product: one student is the leader, one is the written recorder, and one is the oral reporter. I also use groups of two when I use a problem-based learning approach to teaching grammar and punctuation. I also use small groups when doing experiential activities, such as simulations and role play for empathy. There may be more ways that I use cooperative learning. Teachers must be comfortable with letting students talk (and might need to teach students how to do so ahead of time). Cooperative learning works! ",
