            "answer_text": "Gritty and/or Smart students. Let me elaborate more: Maths HL is one of the most difficult subjects offered by the IB, and it requires certain dedication and qualities for students to succeed. IB maths HL is taken by two different kinds of student: a) who want to adorn their high school transcript or b) lover of mathematics. If you are like most of us i.e. in category a) you need to be gritty and be ready for tough times ahead. You will be asked to study the \u201ccore\u201d six topics common between HL and SL (Induction, Stats, Calculus, Vectors, Sequence-series and trigonometry), but for HL you will also be asked to study an extra option. You will asked to choose one from sets-relations, calculus, stats and discrete maths. These subjects will not be dealt superfluously, but you will be required to delve into it quite a lot. Balancing other subjects, CAS activities and your leisure will prove to be quite a burden. Beware of the IAs, as they tend to be the ones where students most likely lose their focus and do worse. For instance, I once remember when other activities (CAS and IAs) demanded attention, and due to that, I lost my focus completely. My semester exams were so poor for maths HL that my parents once asked to consider dropping HL. I consider myself to be fairly above average in mathematics so for me to give away my self and Indian pride, I was the only kid who studied in India taking HL at my school for my batch, was too much. I decided to persevere and not take it lightly. At first, my results were barely passing (~65% after curve). Then, came the long summer break after junior year, where I revisited all the concepts learned beforehand and it worked. (I ended up with a decent 6, 1 mark away from the elusive 7!. If you belong to the 2nd category and are of thinking of doing a math major, then you should definitely take Maths HL, maybe even further maths, as it will provide you with a solid background for future studies. Beware of the IAs, they should seem to give you an opportunity to delve into proper research of your favourite topic, but tread with caution as your topic might be too vague or specific for a proper IA, and always remember the rubric when writing one.

            "answer_text": "There are two kinds of students who take Math HL. The first is the one that loves maths and takes it for fun and for a challenge. This person regardless of his/her ability in the subject will strive to succeed in IB Math HL. Loving this subject and being so curious about it will help you so much since you\u2019ll always be on top of your work and if you don\u2019t understand a concept, you\u2019ll be researching about it until you understand it. Also, people who love challenges and are great at solving them would love this course as the challenge they face are pretty big. The second one is the one that takes it for his/her future studies. This person depending on their ability may succeed in IB Math HL. Just because they are taking it for their future does not mean that they will be successful with it. It could turn out that they end up with 4\u2019s or even 3\u2019s and need compensation from their other subjects. Even if he/her revises non-stop it still may be a challenge for them to get a \u2018good\u2019 grade. TL;DR - The one who loves maths the most and enjoys it as a challenging subject is the one that will succeed the most. ",
