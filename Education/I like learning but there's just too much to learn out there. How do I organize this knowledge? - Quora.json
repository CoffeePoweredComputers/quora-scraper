            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Michael J. Tran. You are way ahead of the game just owning to the fact you like learning. That will make you a lifelong learner, and even though human lifetimes are but a speck on geologic or cosmic time, you can learn a great deat if you apply your entire life to reading, studying, discussing and pondering. There are numerous ways to organize the pursuit of knowledge. You can decide to get an advanced degree, and that will focus you learning effort like a laser for a time. You'll learn a great deal about one specific study, and then can look at how it relates to other human knowledge. Consider this example. Doug Emlen is an evolutionary biologist. He got fascinated by what causes certain animals, like the moose, to develop massive weapons that have a massive cost in energy required to carry them around. Later, he began to see parallels in human development of ever greater weapons. His insights in the video below are fascinating,  Another way to push the frontiers of knowledge is to find human conundrums that fascinate you, then launch yourself into them till you have advanced the state of the art, and publish your findings. Publishing without sufficient academic credentials was almost a grail quest not so long ago, but today with Internet content curators hungry for well researched, quality content it is a piece of cake to get published. Finally, if you want to focus your learning, don't just read, write. Researching a book will take you much deeper into a topic that interests you than you could ever imagine before you start the project. And it's sure to turn up additional areas you'll want to address once the original book it completed.  \u201cAnyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty.  Anyone who keeps learning stays young.\u201d     \u2015     Henry Ford ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot tell you exactly what you need to do, but i can tell you what i do related to learning. I start lately to make big plans. I just started 1 year plan to get in perfect shape. Month 2 and everything is going on smoothly. But as i diverted, i come back. I like to learn, especially new things. Nutrition, japanese, psychology, you name it. I usually do courses at MIT, Berkeley or Harvard, the online ones, for free or with just the right amount of money. I am learning something new for at least 6 months, so i can start two of this projects every year. Right now i am learning about Japan and the Black ships history. You can do something you really like, or something you need. But always try to finish what you started if possible. I hope it helps. G ",
