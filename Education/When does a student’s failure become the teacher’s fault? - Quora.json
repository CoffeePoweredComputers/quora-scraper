            "answer_text": "It\u2019s always the teacher\u2019s fault. Example #1: A student has attendance that is atrocious. The teacher calls home, emails home, notifies the school, etc. Nothing changes. Is that student\u2019s failure the teacher\u2019s fault? Example #2: The teacher assigns regular homework. The student never does any of the homework. The teacher calls home, emails home, notifies the school, etc. The teacher offers tutoring. The student does not attend. Is that student\u2019s failure the teacher\u2019s fault? Example #3: The teacher plays video games in class. The teacher shows movies all day. The teacher doesn\u2019t return papers in a timely fashion or give students feedback. Some students fail. Is that student\u2019s failure the teacher\u2019s fault? The answer is \u201cyes\u201d in all three cases. How? Well, in case #1, the teacher should have gone to the home of the child (with the appropriate authorities, of course, like CPS and the police) and had a face-to-face with the parents and child about the severity of the situation. In case #2, the teacher should have arranged for officials from the military and criminal justice to meet with the parents and student and talk to them about the repercussions of poor grades. And, in case #3, the teacher should have done a better job trying to engage students. There\u2019s obviously a problem here: teachers have limited time and resources. Cases #1 and #2 are nearly impossible for a teacher to solve, in part because many teachers (myself included) don\u2019t have one student like that, but dozens. What\u2019s the solution? Easy - we need to significantly improve the education system. This starts with additional investment in the schools. We need to hire extra people to interact with the community on behalf of the teachers so that teachers can do what they\u2019re trained to do - teach. Those additional employees (community leaders, social workers, law enforcement, child protective services, etc.) need to have time to meet with teachers to get up to speed on the problems faced by individual students and how they can assist. They also need time to actually interact within their communities. Furthermore, both these new employees and existing teaching staffs need additional support with the paperwork this will generate. That means clerical and technology staff will need to be hired and trained. We\u2019ll need extra money to advertise and promote this new intervention. And we\u2019ll need a long-term commitment to the success of cradle to adulthood education and community involvement. When a child fails, it\u2019s our fault as a society. It\u2019s our fault as a nation. And we will pay for our crimes in the form of increased crime in our community, the cost of increased incarceration, the loss of productivity from those incarcerated, the diminished image our nation will have on the world stage, the diminished innovation that could have been brought on by those currently incarcerated, and the wholesale loss of generations of poor and oppressed people across this country. A child cannot fail - not without our help and complicity. If that child does fail, it is on all of our backs. Teachers, parents, educators, the community, and most importantly, the government that turns a blind eye to the suffering of its citizens. We have the money and know-how to fix this. We just lack the will. ",

            "answer_text": "When a teacher becomes failure to understand his/her student's mind, a student's failure becomes the teacher's fault then. Yes, it matters and the very evidence of this line lies in the film named \u201cTaree Zameen Par\u201d. If a teacher is unable to be like a friend with a student,s/ he never penetrates the unspeakable mind of a student which is very important. A friend can help one to express and expose own mind who was not so before. That's why Psychology study should be important for the teacher so that s/he can guide their students properly! Yes, guidance is very required in order to encourage them in their own way. A good friend may be a new dawn for changing one's life positively. The call of \u2018teacher\u201d should create a happy, lite,and friend like impression in a student's mind than a rage anger face with a cane. \u2018Anger ' creates nothing special among the students, rather they keep quite themselves and abstain from asking any questions to their teacher. They embrace their problems within themselves without asking about the solution! Not only this, a student can hate the teacher too. It must create a gap in \u2018teacher-student' communication. It is not that everybody is skilled one in everything, but in something. Being a teacher, one must find out the \u2018something' special in a student which gears up him/her to go ahead towards the success gradually. An involvement from the part of a teacher with a student is very necessary to help in solving the problems as well as to cheer him up! But, it happens seldom. Communication gap hinders the progress of a student as well as a teacher. But, a student will be much affected undoubtedly. Liberal attitude and free mentality help to speak one's mind. A bridge between two mind must build the strong understanding. A teacher needs to be tolerant, patient towards a student in order to make him/her a modest, genuine and genius. Bookish knowledge and score don't mean everything for becoming a successful person,but moral education and characteristic development are also expected along with that. If a teacher can be famous for his student's success, then a student's faliure can be considered as its vice-versa (though always not true). For the kids a teacher's attitude (tolerant, politeness, patient,way of speaking) depends much. One\u2019s behaviour comes first to attach with one,then knowledge matters. Last but not the least that knowledge has no power if a person can\u2019t convince other people with his/her knowledge. ",
