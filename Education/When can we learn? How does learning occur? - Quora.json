            "answer_text": "We learn all the time, unconsciously. Everything we see, hear, experience, etc. is considered against the framework of what we have previously experienced. Some concepts are rejected, others are updated, others stay the same. Even so, we do learn better at different times - things like color, sound, and space all affect our ability to absorb, understand and learn. Working out problems (mental struggle) is a high-learning activator too. Personal learning style versus the style of the teacher also plays a part in learning effectiveness. ",
