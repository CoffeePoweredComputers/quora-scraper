            "answer_text": "NO. Teachers also cannot change, once submitted, in the Common App. Best option is to email updated recommendation letter directly to the college that you applied, from the official email ID of the school / teacher. This is outside the Common App. [OR] Add some other teacher in the Common App and request him/her to upload a recommendation letter, if that is feasible. Example - If you already requested a Math teacher, as per your target college\u2019s requirement and no other Math teacher taught you, in the high school, then you cannot choose this option.But, if the target college mentioned you can share a teacher in either Math / Science category, [Math teacher already submitted a recommendation letter], you can add some other teacher who taught you a science subject.While applying to a college, you can skip tag the second teacher\u2019s recommendation. You have full control, from all available recommendation letters, in the Common App, to choose the one you which should reach the college, when you submit the application. ",
