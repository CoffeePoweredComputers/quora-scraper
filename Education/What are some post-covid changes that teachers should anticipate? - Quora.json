            "answer_text": "Students are likely to need to relearn in-school student behaviors when physical presence resumes. Some students are going to have behavioral and emotional concerns beyond this, however, due to loss of family members to Covid-19. Depending on the health conditions, students may have to adjust to hybrid (some physically present, some virtual) learning. Teachers will need to be able to shift rapidly from physical to virtual teaching as conditions change, meaning that all lessons will need to be created with both modalities in mind. Teachers will need to become much more flexible in their teaching style, as well as student product expectations. ",

            "answer_text": "One change in our post-covid schooling is how quickly we send children home, now. Yesterday, one of my students started up with a runny nose, a red eye, and feeling yuck. Whereas before we would have expected her to tough it out for a while, to make sure she was actually unwell and not just brewing a massive sneeze, yesterday I took her straight to the office, who called her grandma to come and get her. The saddest thing for her was that she was excited about having a Fillet o\u2019 Fish for dinner that night. I\u2019m guessing she ended up with congee, instead. ",
