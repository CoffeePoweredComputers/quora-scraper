            "answer_text": " I think it is France. I mean their biggest attraction is Eiffel tower. Who cares? Their food is overplayed. It is good, but not all that imaginative. Anyone who thought the USA is the most overrated needs to ask themselves \u201cin what?\u201d\u2026 No country has more influence in world politics than the United States. No country has more influence over the Golbal Economy than the United States No country is militarily as powerful than the United States No country has done more for the cause of freedom in the world than the United States No country leads the world in industry after industry like the United States - from technology to farming. No country consistently produces revolutionary technology like the united states. No country has as many top notch colleges as the United States. Sure you all know Harvard, Stanford, Yale, MIT, Caltech, Berkeley. But the 100th best college in the United States would make the top 3 best college in most countries. Most countries colleges are not as nice as the United States high schools. The people of the United States are friendly and respectful. They will respect your religion, race, and nationality. They laugh easily - even at themselves. They are playful and, when the opportunity calls for it, wicked smart. They are curious, but in a civil way. They are irreverent - they treat you like an equal - not as someone who is better or worse. No country has the portfolio of cities like the United States: New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, New Orleans, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle. Each city a jewel in its own right. Just check out the cuisine in each region - from the eclectic foods of San Francisco and New Orleans to the absurdly delicious lobster of the Northeast and the Norwegian and German inspired dishes of the Midwest. Whatever dish you hunger for from any country has been made here. In fact, think of two countries and imagine how their food would taste if fused - it is probably being created in the United States right now. Now check out the music scene. Rock & Roll was invented here. Blues, Jazz, country, big band, and more. Music scene in Chicago, Houston, Alabama, Boston and Midwest is full of possibilities and imagination. Ask anyone to list their top 10 movies in the world and it is likely that at least 50% of it is American. America shapes the world culture more than any other place in the world. The sheer imagination of this country is incomparable. Few countries can offer access to as much access to oceans as the United States. From sea to shining sea - you can see the Atlantic, pacific a Few countries have access to as many variety of weather and landscape as the United States - from Florida Keys to San Diego and Maine to Minnesota - we are not even discussing Alaska and Hawaii. Also, few countries have their commitment to self-improvement stated boldly in their founding documents - always working to \u201cmake a more perfect union\u201d. To those who say United States is overrated, don\u2019t know how to rate. Because if you break the ratings down, this is still an underrated country. Visit American and judge for yourself. Come over and be pleasantly surprised by the gregariousness and generosity of her people. Be amazed by the sheer size and beauty. Be shocked by the creativity of her people in music, food, theater, movies, dance. Be inspired by its commitment to knowledge and the implementation of that knowledge in her Universities. Be blown away by the variety of scenes from Savannah, Georgia to the California Bay, Baton Rouge, LA and lake Superior and Lake Huron in the Midwest. ",

            "answer_text": "http://deanbocari.quora.com/Is-America-really-the-greatest-nation-in-the-worldDean Bokhari  I joke often about being one of the few New Yorkers that can swallow his pride and say that I like living in California way more than New York. This usually gets a laugh, but *sometimes* it makes people upset (usually New Yorkers). When I was a kid, I remember my father pointing out something that would stay with me for my entire life... Whenever we'd watch the State of the Union Address, or any other public appearance by the U.S. President -- here's what would go down: Every U.S. President (that I've been alive to see) would say something along these lines as they were concluding their talk:  \"..and God bless America...\" Immediately after hearing that, my father would shake his head a few times, stare back at the TV as if he were talking to Bush or Clinton himself, and say:  \"Why the [expletive] would he only say 'God bless America'? Why not 'God bless the Globe?' 'Why not God bless the World?'\" Great point, pops... Why don't they? \"God bless America\" presupposes that (#1) everyone holds a unanimous belief about God and that (#2) every other nation shouldn't be \"blessed.\" Do you really believe that God/Whatever you believe/Creator -- Do you believe this Ultimate Creator of all would actually only \"bless\" a select few? But lets put the whole religious thing aside and hold on to this whole \"bless America\" part and talk about how it correlates with another popular statement:  \"America is the greatest nation in the world.\" When a non-American citizen hears \"America is the greatest nation in the world\" - how do think it makes them feel?  Maybe some feelings of \"they must think they're better\"?  Would it surprise you? Do other leaders of other nations who speak the same way essentially communicate the same indirect message? Is the President being indirectly pompous? Is he being ignorant? Are \"we, the people\" being ignorant?  ...Maybe. I don't know. I was born in America. But I don't know. I haven't been to many other countries. My Dad is from Afghanistan -- I've never been there. But he tells me it's beautiful out there. I've got close friends and fraternity brothers that are in the Army and in the Marines -- they tell me the mountains of Kandahar are gorgeous. And they're weren't out there on vacation. My mother is from Uzbekistan and Russia. She tells me it's beautiful out there, too. She's also lived in China. And Saudia Arabia. And Pakistan.  Both of my parents have traveled extensively and lived in other countries prior to settling down in the United States. Not a single time have either one of them stood up and proclaimed \"X country is the greatest nation in the world.\" I was born in Oceanside, Long Island. I've lived in three major metropolitan areas in my life: NY, DC, LA. All I know is the United States. I've been to other places around the world -- Turkey, Pakistan, England, Geneva, Italy, France. I haven't been to enough places to formulate an opinion on that yet. My name is Dean Bokhari. I'm 27 years old. I live in Orange County, CA. I love it here. I love this country. But is it really the \"greatest nation on earth?\" I don't know. How about you? ",
