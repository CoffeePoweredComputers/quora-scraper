The only reasons for doing it would be if you failed English or Maths since there are a lot of places that wont take you if you don\u2019t have a pass in those two subjects, or if you do not have at least 5 different subjects to GCSE or better ",

With certain exceptions (like needing GCSE Maths & English if applying for many British public sector jobs or Teacher Training), your O levels/ GCSEs are there to get you onto your A level courses. A levels are to get you to university After University, practically no one cares about O levels. ",
