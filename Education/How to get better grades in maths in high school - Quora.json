            "answer_text": "I had the same issue when I was in grade 9\u201310\u2026..became an A student in grades 10\u201311. Followed the same principle in all of my college courses, especially the ones I wasnt really interested in, and graduated from University with a stellar GPA. Here\u2019s the trick. Love math. Drill into your head that Math is fascinating (it actually IS!!)\u2026.its much more than learning how a certain equation works\u2026remember someone somewhere years and years ago came up with this out of nothing! Dont just sit there in class staring at the board. Think (for as long as your attention span allows). When doing your HW, dont just get it done with and move on! MATH IS INTERESTING. Carry this enthusiasm with every problem you solve. \u201cwow this was interesting\u201d \u201cSo if this works here,,,,,why would it not work there\u2026.\u201d ALSO; Know the real life application of things! it makes them 10x more interesting and gives a purpose to what you are learning. I went through school with these 3 equation just boringly memorized somewhere in the back of my head:  Only the other day when I was helping a middle school student out that i realized the use of these equations!! Take tan for example\u2026.tan(a)=opposite/adjacent. don\u2019t just memorize it (like i once did)\u2026.think\u2026know the real life application\u2026.MATH IS INTERESTING!!!  Using tan, you can figure out the height of the tree (OR THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING) by knowing how far you are from the object, and the angle of elevation! HOW COOL IS THAT?\u2026\u2026.okay maybe it isnt that cool. But in your head think: \u201cWOOOOWZZZZAGAGA THIS IS AMAZING. This will not only make you an A student, but will make you retain more. For life. always remember, in the greater viewpoint of life, its about what you retain and not your grades. The people who seem wise arent those who carried a GPA of 3.99\u2026.they are simply the ones with interest and hunger for knowledge. The WOW THIS IS INTERESTING type of people. They enjoy what they learn, and thus they retain. ",

            "answer_text": "First things first. Math is a problem solving subject. The key to succeeding in Math is not to study Math; in fact, it doesn't work! To smart students, it's constantly working on mathematical problem solving. A lot of problems. All kinds of problems. The more, the merrier! The harder, the better. Tackling past exam series is one way to go, and to get better at it, preferably under simulated exam conditions. At its core, Math entails and necessitates a thorough understanding of each and every variable, and their inter-relationship, in the formulas and equations. You also need to spend an inordinate amount of time to understand and work on the proofs, in most instances. In class, you simply need to pay attention to all the worked examples as shown by your lecturer or professor on the white board, or from your textbook, and then you put your acquired knowledge into your solution working, covering a myriad variety of new problems given in class by your lecturer professor, or taken out from your textbook, all on your own. When you have attained Q.E.D. while problem solving, step back and ask, is there another way to tackle the problem? A better way? An unorthodox way, if any? You may want to talk to knowledgeable persons, including your Math teacher or professor. You can also read up the work of great mathematicians and understand how they tackle the seemingly big problems. Mathematical problem solving basically teaches us how to think logically and reason rationally. The way you see the problem is the problem. Can you relate it to mathematical problem solving? Play with \"what if\" scenarios. Do your level best to transpose your mathematical problem solving to the real world, in your personal setting. Explore some real life scenarios and see how the logic goes. Last but not least, dedicate at least one hour every day on your Mathematical problem solving. ",

            "answer_text": "Ask your teacher for help after class! Unless he or she really hates the job, that\u2019s what he or she is here for!Note: Be respectful when working out a time to meet with your teacher. They don\u2019t have to give up their lunchtime or after school to meet with you, but they should be willing to work with you at some point.Ask questions while your teacher is teaching if you don\u2019t understand something. They say that one who asks a question is a fool for a moment, one who does not ask a question is a fool for life.Peer tutoring is rad, and typically freeKhan Academy videos, which you can pause and rewind at will, are a great way of refreshing things you\u2019ve learned in class.Do extra practice problems. Make sure you really sit and think about where you\u2019re supposed to go from each step, so that the process sinks in.Other than that, without more specific information, I can\u2019t think of anything else. Good luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "I had the same problem-I understood the concepts but I didn\u2019t do well on tests. I would recommend going on websites such as Khan Academy or Wolfram Alpha (Computational Knowledge Engine) for better explanations on concepts you may not understand. I know people who used the websites before tests and it helped with their studying. If possible, try going to your teacher during office hours for help. I don\u2019t know which grade level you\u2019re in (K-12) but in college, professors used to tell us that if you have questions that aren\u2019t covered in class to go in during office hours. If you need help understanding the concepts, try going to tutoring, using a study group or tutor others. If you can explain the concepts to another person it\u2019s one step closer to raising your grade. If your teacher/professor gives you back your tests, go over the problems you got wrong and see where you made the mistake. Going over those places will teach you what to do next time. ",

Thats what it takes to get good marks in mathematics.Even I did not get good marks in half yearly of my 10th class( I got marks in forties out of 100). But then I decided to to do something about it(because it was my only option), I did a lot of practice. I first completed the NCERT and then RS AGRAWAL and finally solved a lot of sample question papers and finally in the final exams got a 10 CGPA in mathematics. All I would like to tell you is that you can really get good marks in maths too only if you are determined to do it.Practice more and more questions, solve sample papers, take regular test and stay calm and confident. ALL THE BEST!! ",

In conclusion,not only should we talk more with different people when in trouble,but also we should work harder. ",
