            "answer_text": "Greetings, In the United States, you can fail them all without fear of retention. Students are regularly passed on to high school from which students either earn enough credits to graduate, or embark on the arduous journey that begins with repeating failed classes, transitions to enrolling in \u201calternative high school,\u201d continues with attempts at \u201ccredit recovery,\u201d and, ultimately imposes the pretense of G.E.D. preparation. Social Promotion is seductive in that it allows schools and families to avoid the always emotional conferences that accompany addressing the dilemma of whether or not to promote or retain students who struggle to succeed academically. Schools routinely pass on underprepared students, but are careful to note which skills do not meet standard as a liability hedge. Sincerely, AJG ",

            "answer_text": "There are only two semesters generally unless a trimester is used. Some subjects you must pass three quarters (1 1/2 semester). Some you can fail an entire semester and be okay. If you fail one semester, you can take summer school, credit retrieval classes or even take that semester instead of an elective the next year, depending on the school\u2019s policy and procedure. The best bet is to do the work necessary to pass every course, every semester. ",

            "answer_text": "The overall average of your grades is considered in most schools. So if your average is 60 one semester and 85 the next that makes an average of 72.5 which is not good but is still passing. However if you fail particular subjects both semesters, such as math, you may be promoted but be put into a below grade level math class. ",
