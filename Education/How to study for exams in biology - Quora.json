            "answer_text": "I do not know how to answer this question to be honest. How do you do well in other subjects? I am guessing you find hard to remember a lot of names and concepts that biology entails. I tutored a lot of kids and they very quickly forget the names but remember the mechanism somehow.  The way I used to do was study a lot.  Funnily, I did not figure out a short cut. To remember and fix it in my brain cells, I used to write it and practice it with diagrams. Unfortunately, we did not had youtube at that time to explain us concepts in animation way so i guess you can understand something that way. Plus it is much easier to remember when you finish one chapter and solve problems at the end of the chapter. The more problems you solve the more of the concept gets clearer in you head. Analytical thinking kicks in with memory playing its role, so it get fixed in your brain for good. Even scientists study hard in order to remember and do well in their experiments.  Making notes helped me. Reading aloud helped me. I guess you have to figure your own way what works the best for you. Good luck. thanks for AtoA. ",

            "answer_text": "Biology is definitely a science subject. First of all our concept should be clear. Secondly, you have to cram special terms like scientific names, labeling of diagrams etc. The best way to prepare for a biology test is you have to read your test topic at least three times than close your book and write in notebook whatever or how much you understand. After writing you have to check your work with the help of book and highlight your own mistakes through red pen or any sort of highlighter. Than again revise it from your notebook where you right. At the end, you have to revise lecture orally without book and record your voice or in the front of mirror. If you follow this way with the help of God, you definitely get good marks. Biology students\u2019 should kept in mind that presentation or written expressions matters a lot. So, when you will attempt your biology test or paper you should emphasize on your written expression. For Example: The question is; Explain the organ human eye? Also draw and labeled diagram of eye? You attempt this question step by step like this; Definition of Eye.Definition of Lens.Parts of Eye.Structure of Human Eye.Function of Human Eye.Instruments used for studies of eye (optics).Diagram and Labelling of Eye.Than, definitely you would get full marks if you follow some good tips in bio paper/test...(Thank You) Regards: Momna Azmat.",

            "answer_text": "Biology is one of the tough subject. Where understanding and memorizing both are important. You can use these things. Choose a topic then read it first to last one or two times.Take a blank piece of paper. Write here what you understand in which you just read.Pinpoint the area you don't understand and then go back to the materials and check it out.Review and read loud out in a complete sentences first to last.Apply NO 3 until you understand full concept and until you teach yourself first to last with complete sentences.Use analogy to remember tough word or keyword.Findout keywords which you don't know, learn, and understand first before going into details.Draw diagram beside each concept. which will help you to retain information long time.Test yourself before exam night. It will help you to find out in which area you don't know and which area your concept is unclear. And help you to retain information long time. Because when we write we need to think about the topic, realize the concept, and information we learn. It reinforce our memory to retain information more than before.Keep clam and relax. Take a Nap after studying. Research shows that short term information get into long term memory when we sleep after reading.Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Contrary to popular opinion, Biology is NOT mugging up. It's a very conceptual subject and if the basics are not clear no amount of cramming up is going to help you. What is the most fundamental part of Biology? Biochemistry. A perfect understanding of Biochemistry will allow you to understand most of the later stuff. And once you have understood you can not forget. Next is the General Cell Structure. A keen understanding will ease up your studies a lot. Lastly understand everything. Let's take the example of Plant Anatomy. There is no point in mugging up where what type of cell is but if you know the cell structure, biochemistry and have a general understanding of the role of various regions of plants, you can easily figure out what type cell should be located where. (Obviously root hair cells need something that can adsorb a lot of water so cells rich in lignin, suberin etc.) Always remember, logically connecting all components is the key to understanding. ",

Then you should pick up a textbook and skim through the relevant parts to have a picture about what you have to learn. After that you can deepen your knowledge, step by step, always paying attention to the relationships between certain notions and trying to understand the underlying mechanisms. If you make sense of what you learn the memorization part will be much easier. When you already have a really good overall picture of the topic you should start paying attention to the smallest details which will hopefully fit into your knowledge. Also, try to ask yourself questions about the topic (and also solve quizzes if possible) and if you don't understand something only by using your textbook, don't hesitate to investigate further on the internet.

The best way is to make vocabulary cards at the beginning of each new unit or chapter. Start with a stack of note cards. Write one vocabulary word on one side then the definition on the other. Now begin studying them. Take a word at a time and without looking define it. Check your answer. If you are correct , place the card in the\"know\" pile. If not , it goes in the \"try again\" pile. Go through the \" try again\" pile until you know them all and they are in the \"know \" pile. This helps us separate what we know from what we need to work on . We won't waste time going over what we already know, but can use the time to study the unknown material. ",

I wish I had better news to give, but that is simply the way things are. What I can recommend is to relate the things you are being tested on to larger biological concepts. For example, if you need to know about phototropism in plants, make sure that you not only understand what it is, but why it is necessary for the plant to maintain homeostasis. If you actively try and relate each example to the major concepts in biology, then you will learn the material on a deeper level, and it will stick with you longer. I hope this helps, and good luck!

Most people seem to think that reading and taking notes is a good way and for some it works well. However, some find more active and interactive methods work for them. Card sorts, games, quizzes, challenging friends, use of technology like BBC Bite size and so on - all methods to revise\u2026 I am always a fan of social revision too - getting together with friends to work together. A final method that works for most is exam practise. Get hold of some past papers. Do them first as if it were a real exam - no notes or text books, timed (usually assume 1 minute per mark but it may vary depending on the exam) and in silence. Then use your notes and discuss with friends to see if you can write a better answer. Finally, mark it using the marks scheme. Your goal at the end of all that is to get no difference between the first answer and the final one\u2026 Ok you are unlikely to get there but the closer you get the higher marks you will get in the final test because you are literally doing the best you ever can under exam conditions. To be honest, learning how to answer exam questions is a far more useful skill than the knowledge you use to answer them\u2026 often it can mean you get marks when you don\u2019t know anything about the question just by writing a reasonable guess.

Don't consider it just like another subject and avoid pretending to be focussed on the plain texts. Biology is more expressed diagrammatically than theoretically in plain text. Try to focus on the diagrams and relate your text with them. It's the best way to comprehend the basics of biology. Hope it will help.  Good luck.   ",

Ditto lab sessions. Read around the subject. You should have access to a library full of books on biology, read the ones that cover subjects that interest you. By the time exams come around you should be sufficiently steeped in biological knowledge that they should be a mere formality. A skim through the notes, some sample questions and you will be as ready as you ever will be. Do not leave it all to the last minute, this is the kiss of death. ",
