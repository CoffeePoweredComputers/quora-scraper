            "answer_text": "Well, this is pretty much what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve always loved butterflies and have studied them my entire life, watching their behavior, learning how they fit into their environments, what they eat, how they develop, their taxonomy and the reasons why it sometimes changes, everything to do with Lepidoptera really. I am far from an expert and haven\u2019t done any formal research, but I understand the requirements for a research paper, know people who have submitted them, and could do one if I were interested. I have a BA in history and took no science courses in college except statistics, which I wasn\u2019t especially good at. At one point I did consider going to grad school for entomology, but there are so few jobs in the field I decided it would be a waste of money. So yes, you can certainly do all the amateur science you want, any way you want. In fact, in entomology especially, citizen science is the up-and-coming thing. Basically, what you\u2019re talking about is a lifelong, serious hobby, and that\u2019s a great thing. ",

            "answer_text": "No more than being a model railroader and expert on trains, but not working for a railroad. Like being a Civil War buff but not a professional historian. Amateur astronomers have discovered comets and supernovae, and they use off the shelf gear to take photographs better than any observatory could get 50 years ago. There are bird-watchers who can identify birds better than many professional ornithologists and rockhounds who know minerals better than many geologists.  A rockhound in action. Have fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Studying a subject does not have to be for a certain purpose, but could be for self-fulfillment, and pleasure. So, there is nothing wrong with studying and becoming an educated layman in the field, if it gives you satisfaction and pleasure. This route of studying is called informal education. ",
