            "answer_text": "While I was in prison I was given access to education. I later would spend the last 8 years out of 16 tutoring over 400 inmates in various subjects. Computers, life skills, hobby crafts, first aid/cpr. I had a knack for figuring things out and I found that I could put that use to learning a new skill, so I took every class available to me. Now,suppose I decide to use those skills to create computer viruses that you open on your computer and it takes all your information, and now, I have all your financial information. But, Since I've been out I've used those skills for good. I worked the same job for 8 years at a Non-Profit Feeding 290,000 hungry Alaskans, worked the next 3 as an EMS Coordinator/Firefighter saving lives, saving homes, driving an Ambulance, managing a fire department, helping to Ensure Alaska State Troopers do a Fine Job protecting my community and teaching little ones about how to look for options and how to make good choices. Now the con:Suppose I get a Presidential pardon for all my good deeds, I've saved lives and my stories are documented.Full rights restored, I decide I would like to finally go hunting. I am Native American and I purchase my first fire arm legally. I go into the woods and accidentally, or on purpose, shoot someone. I will always be the Felon who failed, no matter what. ",

            "answer_text": "What are the pros and cons of letting prison inmates take training and education or college courses? Pro: Education has been shown to have a direct, positive impact on recidivism. Cons: The men and women taking the classes. Actually, a very successful college course was instituted a number of years ago by the warden of San Quentin State Prison in California. Many inmates received accredited degrees at very low cost. When the warden became Secretary of the CDCR, she wanted to institute the program in all institutions in the state. The CCPOA insisted on three seats on the committee that was to do this. Is it any surprise that the program was never instituted? CCPOA is the Union of California's Correctional Officers. ",
