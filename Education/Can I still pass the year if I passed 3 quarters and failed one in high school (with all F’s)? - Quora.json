            "answer_text": "If you had a high A all three quarters then maybe. But then again I'm sure you'd barely scarpe by and maybe not even that. In my school if you fail a quarter and that brings your semester grade down to like a 60 or below, your gonna have to take that class again. I would highly recommend against failing all your classes as it not only hurts your GPA, college chances (yes they can rescind offers even if you already got accepted), scholarships and time. Now I'm kind of curious as to why/how you'd manage(d) to fail all your classes. If it is because of a chronic illnesses, a death of a close loved one, rehab, etc then I'm sure you can talk to your counselor and go over your situation with them. Let them know why you haven't done well and tell them that you take responsibility for it but would like to succeed. If your counselor is human with a beating kind heart they may work something out with you. If they are an automotan then I'm sorry but you'd be out of luck. Hope you can get through this situation all right. ",
