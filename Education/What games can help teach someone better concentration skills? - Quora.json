            "answer_text": "Marle, Action video games may improve reading ability. If you think about the \"fish challenge,\" it's not unlike the task of reading alphabetic writing. Might visual-spatial gaming help children learn to keep track of words on the printed page? A recent study supports the idea. Sandro Franceschini and his colleagues (2013) randomly assigned kids with dyslexia to play either action or non-action video games. Kids in each group completed nine, 80-minute sessions of game playing, and their reading abilities were tested before and after training. The results were quite dramatic. The kids who had played action games improved their reading speed--without any loss in accuracy--and their gains exceeded the amount of spontaneous, developmental improvement that kids ordinarily make over the course of a year. The children also scored better on tests of visual attention. What exactly is going on? Vanessa Harrar and her colleagues (2014) have found that dyslexics have particularly hard time switching attention from visual to auditory stimuli, which makes the standard approach to reading -- seeing a letter and then imagining the sound it makes -- very difficult. They think that action video games may help people practice switching back and forth. So it seems that action video games can hone visual attention skills and help kids with dyslexia improve reading ability. But that doesn't mean that action games are beneficial for all sorts of attention. What, for example, about paying attention to \"talking heads?\" Listening to a teacher before he says something unexpected or exciting. This proactive sort of attention seems crucial for studying and following directions at school. And it\u2019s what many avid gamers seem to have trouble with. Playing video games might cause attention problems at school Recently, Edward Swing and his colleagues tracked over 1300 American kids for over 13 months (Swing et al 2010). The kids, in grades 3-5, were asked to keep track of how much time they spent playing video games. These tallies were cross-checked against their parents\u2019 reports. Researchers also asked teachers to evaluate each child\u2019s attention skills at 4 different points over the 13-month study. The results revealed a weak, but statistically significant, link between video games and teacher-reported attention problems. And the pattern was consistent with the idea that playing video games causes attention problems: Kids who played more at the beginning of the study experienced increased attention problems at the end. This was true even after controlling for prior student attention problems. Teachers said the kids got worse over time. What about heavy use? Video games, attention problems, and the brain Another study, led by Kay Bailey, measured the brain activity of 51 male undergraduates as they tried to pay attention. The young college men were presented with the Stroop task, a standard psychology test that asks a person to identify the color of a word that is flashed on a screen. What makes the Stroop task particularly difficult is that the meaning of the word conflicts with the color. For example, the word \u201cred\" might be written in green letters. The researchers compared the performance of two groups: \u2022 \u201cLow volume\" gamers (who played video games less than 2 hours per week) \u2022 \u201cHigh volume\" gamers (who played video games more than 40 hours per week) As the undergraduates worked, researchers timed their responses and recorded their brain ERPs, or event-related potentials. When it came to reacting after a word flashed on the screen, both groups performed similarly. But there was a fascinating difference in brain activity just before the words were flashed on the screen. The \u201clow volume\" gamers showed evidence of paying more attention during these \u201cwait and see\" moments. By contrast, the \u201chigh volume\" gamers seemed to have trouble sustaining their attention. Their brain activity resembled someone who has less \u201cproactive control,\" i.e., more trouble keeping his mind focused on what is about to happen. Bailey and colleagues note that their study doesn\u2019t demonstrate causation. It\u2019s possible that people with less proactive control are more attracted by video games. But given the implications of the Swing study--which found that kids\u2019 attention skills worsened over time if they played more video games--the new research is worrying. Why might video games make kids less attentive? Television seems to have a similar effect (Swing et al 2010), which suggests that fast edits and flashy graphics play a role. According to Edward Swing, \u201cIt is still not clear why screen media may increase attention problems, but many researchers speculate that it may be due to rapid-pacing, or the natural attention grabbing aspects that television and video games use.\" Swing\u2019s coauthor, media expert David Gentile agrees. \"Brain science demonstrates that the brain becomes what the brain does.\" \"If we train the brain to require constant stimulation and constant flickering lights, changes in sound and camera angle, or immediate feedback, such as video games can provide, then when the child lands in the classroom where the teacher doesn't have a million-dollar-per-episode budget, it may be hard to get children to sustain their attention.\" ",
