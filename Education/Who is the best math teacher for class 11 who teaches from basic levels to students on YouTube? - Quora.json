            "answer_text": "If u are preparing for only boards then go for Ashish kumar-lets learn channel. He teaches very well with animated graphs and tells about the application of mathematics in real life. So u get an extra motivation to solve a question. In first days, u will feel bored bcoz he doesn\u2019t teaches with board and marker. But after a week you will be managed up. But if u are preparing for entrance exams, U can go for Mohit Tyagi . I have not taught by him but i have listened a lot about him. No. Of subcribers of Ashish kumar is very less (45k) and views in videos is also not very large. But don't compare him with these things .you can learn the real variety of maths. Some students distract him by downloading his videos, which decreases his earning from youtube (he have already left his coaching centre to teach in youtube). So he made an website so that students can't download the videos. U can visit the website www.ashishkumarletslearn.com. Hope it helps and don't forget to upvote ",
