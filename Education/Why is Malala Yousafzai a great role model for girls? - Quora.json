            "answer_text": "Malala Yousafzai or any other girl from todays world can never be role model for Pakistani girlsBecause 90% of Pakistan population are either strictly religious or somewhat religious and loves Islam and Islamic personality.So in order to get popular among masses for long time, you need to be religious.From the childhood the role model for Pakistani girls are Aisha (RA) or Fatima (RA) and such personalities as the ideal case on inner side.Of course they do copy film stars and TV stars in terms of their outlook but as i said deep inside their thought is the ideal personality of Aisha (RA) and Fatima (RA) which means on the long term basis, they can never follow women of todays world because at the end of the day it is \"thoughts that control our actions\".
