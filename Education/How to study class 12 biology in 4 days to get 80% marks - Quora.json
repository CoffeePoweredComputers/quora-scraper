            "answer_text": "Hey,actually since I did not have bio as my subject so I don\u2019t know much about it.But many of my friends were PCB stream students so they always told me that among all the subjects they find Biology very interesting and because of that it becomes easier also.And almost all PCB students had to say the same about biology So yes,assuming that you are currently in class 12th,I would suggest that do not wait for those last four days to arrive rather begin with your preparation well in advance.You have ample of time in your hands right now.Make the best use of it.And rather prefer to revise your biology syllabus in those four days,if you do it this way it would be more helpful for you. And in case if you haven\u2019t got much time in hand then you have got to play smart okay So your first and foremost step is do not invest too much time in one single chapter ,divide your time equally.Take breaks ,it would help you to replenish your concentration and focus which is the need of the hour.If you are finding a particular chapter very difficult and time consuming then switch to some other chapter and leave it for the end.Since you would be studying many chapters so make sure that you revise.Because its better to do 80% of syllabus completely than doing 100% of thr syllabus with unsurity of attempting the questions.Do go through the previous year question papers and do not start attempting it like you do in a typical exam scenario,rather read the question,close your eyes,speak the answers loudy and then verify it. In this way you would be able to go through more questions in lesser time.Go atleast through the questions of thr chapter that you have ultimately decided to leave or you are not very comfortable with it. In exam you would be able to attempt the question.Keep your presentation neat and clean since its biology make diagrams wherever possible and you would sail through it very conveniently.All the best!!!! Do take atleast a sleep of five hours before commencing the exam.Its much needed my friend.",

First complete those chapters whose weightage in marks is high.Whichever chapter you finish from the book make sure you finished it throughly not 50 or 60%.If there are 14 chapters you just need to complete those which are important for your exams and revise them nicely for 4 days.",
