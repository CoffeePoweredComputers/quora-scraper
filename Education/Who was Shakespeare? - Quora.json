            "answer_text": "No doubt William Shakespeare is the most popular writer of English Literature . He is most famous English playwright. His plays are most popular all over the world . But when we try to know about his personal life then we find that he was not well educated . His birth, childhood and even his death are not clear . For many years he was almost lost from the world, perhaps Till 1589 or so .He started his career in a drama company .He worked at low level . Later he became an actor and after that he became a drama writer. He wrote some poetry. But he followed the writering style of Christopher Marlowe, who was well educated person. He was one of the University wits . He invented blank verse in his dramas. And iambic pentameter in his poems . The same was practised by William Shakespeare in his writings .A person of such a status died un noticed . How it can be possible ?? One of an actor of his drama company died only after 3 years in 1519 was mentioned by many people of that time and a famous drama writer and an actor Shakespeare died in1516 but there is not a single mention about his death . How can a person without education write better than an highly educated person like Marlowe . Marlowe wrote only 5 or 6 dramas in his life and was perhaps less popular than Shakespeare . We know each and every thing about him except his death . William Shakespeare might be a pen name of Marlowe or Ben Johnson . People generally guess that Marlowe faked his death and escaped and after that he started writing in the name of Shakespeare . Many prominent writers believe in this theory . But there are many who reject the theory of pen name . Only God knows the truth . But there is a controversy over the name of Shakespeare . I knew a little , but when the question came I read about it again . What is in a name of that which We call a rose by any other name would Smell as sweet \u0928\u093e\u092e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0930\u0916\u093e \u0939\u0948 ?? Means that the writer is not bothered much about the authenticity and authority of the play but he wanted to spread his feelings and passion upto the public . He has nothing to do with name or fame What makes the writer to declare so ??? Was he a well fed pen writer ?? Or what made Shakespeare to declare such things ??? ",

            "answer_text": "William Shakespeare, son of a well-to-do glovemaker from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was an actor during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James VI/I. For most of his career, he worked with an acting troupe called The Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men, Lord Hunsdon\u2019s Men (when the old Lord Chamberlain died and his son inherited the troupe), The Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men again (when the son was appointed to his father\u2019s old job), and, finally, The King\u2019s Men, when King James took them over. Shakespeare became a Sharer (partner) with a guaranteed share of the proceeds, which made him quite wealthy for a member of the middle class. (The connection with nobles and the King was that, legally, actors counted as beggars, without the excuse of being crippled. For all practical purposes, it was a crime to be an actor. But if someone of the upper classes wished his servants to do plays for him, that was perfectly OK, and those servants obviously needed to rehearse, and if they rehearsed in a theater building, and charged the public money to come in and see, well, if their lord didn\u2019t mind, that was OK, too.) Shakespeare started writing plays. And he turned out to be quite good at it. Nearly all his plays were hits, and after a while, they even started being sold in book form, though usually either stolen or after they\u2019d gone out of fashion, since it was to the company\u2019s advantage to keep a monopoly on them. He wrote comedies, tragedies, history plays about England, and, starting around the time his granddaughter was born, strange plays that are almost fairy tales; nowadays we call those the romances. He also wrote some straight poems, but the only way way you could make much money off poetry was to include a dedication to a rich person and say you couldn\u2019t have done it without them, etc., and hope you\u2019d be thrown a big bag of money. Plays where you got a percentage of the gross were a better deal. Over the years, of course, his plays came to be seen as old-fashioned. He wrote a few more in partnership, but soon retired to Stratford-upon-Avon, and, after a few years, he died. A generation afterwards, under the dictatorship of Oliver Cromwell, acting was made thoroughly illegal. But that lasted only a little while, and theatre came back. The plays from Shakespeare\u2019s later days came back, and there were new plays, too, but Shakespeare was not forgotten, and, in time, people began to see again that he was something really special. He understood people in a way that few writers ever have, and could see all the lies we tell ourselves, too. And he was a master of writing dialog in exquisite verse that nevertheless sounds just as though the character is making it up as he goes along. And he\u2019s always mainly interested in telling a story, not in trying to impress us with some political or religious \u201cmessage\u201d. His only message is, \u201cLook! Look at this! Isn\u2019t it strange? Isn\u2019t it funny? Isn\u2019t it heartbreaking? Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d There\u2019s never been anyone else like him. ",
