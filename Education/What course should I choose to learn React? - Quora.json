            "answer_text": "I took the Modern React with Redux course when I first started learning React and I think it\u2019s a pretty solid course overall, however, if you\u2019re just starting learning React it might be a little bit overwhelming because it also introduces Redux relatively quickly. Now, learning Redux is something you definitely want to do, but if possible, I\u2019d recommend you to first have a solid grasp of the React basic API and maybe even build some demo apps yourself using only React (without Redux). Personally, I think I would gotten more out of that course \u2014 or out of the whole Redux section, anyway \u2014 if I had already been more familiar with the basic React stuff. I can also recommend you some other React courses I\u2019ve taken ever since: If you have (or can afford) a Lynda.com account, I can recommend you: React.js Essential Training If you have (or can afford) a PluralSight account: React.js: Getting Started (I\u2019m gonna give you a pro tip: If you sign up to Microsoft Visual Studio Dev Essentials , they usually give you a 3-month trial of Pluralsight, which is more than enough to take all the React courses they have in there. ) Best of luck!
