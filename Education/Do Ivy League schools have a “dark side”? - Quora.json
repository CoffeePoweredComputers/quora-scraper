            "answer_text": "Yes, there\u2019s a dark side: suicide, myth, and snobbery. If you get into an Ivy, they have the money to arrange financial aid sufficient for you to attend and will do so (this is a relatively new phenomenon). Even some families making six figure household incomes get financial aid. If you get in, you should probably go. The downside of suicide is that, every year, students who don\u2019t get into an Ivy or another specific \u201celite\u201d institution will attempt suicide, citing that rejection. MIT (not an Ivy, but related) has had ongoing problems with admitted students attempting suicide because they feel they aren\u2019t succeeding (or because they in fact aren\u2019t succeeding). The problem is indicative of a larger issue, which is the belief that the Ivies and other elite colleges are the only paths to success. As for the myth: they\u2019re great schools, and most admitted students have performed quite well, but the notion that they are completely egalitarian and meritocratic is\u2026 well, it\u2019s nonsense. A few years ago, about 10% of a Harvard freshman class became embroiled in cheating, and it was a fiasco. They received little more than a slap on the wrist. That doesn\u2019t mean Ivy League students and faculty aren\u2019t exceptional, it just means that there are other schools filled with equally brilliant faculty and students. Yes, the Ivy League has produced US presidents, but so has an obscure, rural Texas teacher\u2019s college. Sure, Ivy League schools have educated and/or employ Nobel prize winners, but so have many other schools. Ivy League schools may receive a plurality of accolades, but they don\u2019t receive a majority, let alone all. Go ahead and read the responses from Ivy League students and graduates in this thread. They have direct experience. However, few have direct experience elsewhere and obvious none have experience not applying to or not being accepted into an Ivy, so put their experiences in a larger context. They aren\u2019t evil monsters, but they aren\u2019t some sort of Jedi Knights, either. Sadly, there\u2019s still a ton of snobbery, and I mean that sincerely, directed toward public institutions especially. Google\u2019s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both attended public undergrad institutions (University of Michigan and University of Maryland, respectively). Steve Jobs went to Reed College (private), while Steve Wozniak went to and was expelled from the University of Colorado (public), later attended a community college (De Anza College, public), and finished his undergrad at UC Berkeley (public). Bill Gates famously dropped out of Harvard, but he was convinced to do so by Paul Allen, who had dropped out of Washington State University (public); they co-founded Microsoft. Michael Dell dropped out of the University of Texas (public). Marc Andreesen, who co-founded Netscape and is now an important venture capitalist, got his BS from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC, public). His co-founder, Jim Clark (who also founded or co-founded Silicon Graphics and one of the companies that became WebMD) did his undergrad at the University of New Orleans (public). Larry Ellison of Oracle dropped out of UIUC (public) and the University of Chicago (private). Bill Joy, who founded Sun Microsystems (the company that created the Java programming language, and which is now owned by Oracle), earned his undergrad from the University of Michigan (public). Three completed advanced degrees: Larry Page completed his MS at Stanford (private), Bill Joy earned an MS from UC Berkeley (public), and Jim Clark has a PhD from University of Utah (public). Of the bunch, two degrees from selective private schools, eight from public universities, and four dropouts (no undergrad); not one graduated from an Ivy League school. The poorest of these is Steve Wozniak, worth a paltry $100 million, followed by Andreesen at $600 million; nine (Page, Brin, Jobs, Gates, Allen, Dell, Ellison, Joy, Clark) are (or were, in the case of Jobs) billionaires. Money and computing aren\u2019t everything, but of the 13 Americans who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, only two completed degrees at Ivies (TS Eliot and Toni Morrison). ",

            "answer_text": "Well, as an Ivy League student, it pains me that this is the reputation attached to schools like mine. To be a part of the Ivy League is a privilege and an accomplishment that I have worked towards my entire life. I say this from the perspective of a First Generation student (neither of my parents graduated college- one didn't graduate high school) who has focused on going to a prestigious college since elementary school. Many of my friends come from similar positions with families who have never considered college an attainable goal.  I also have wealthy friends who's parents are Harvard, Yale, Penn, etc. graduates and I don't see them as any less capable or deserving as I am. Ivy League and other high powered schools are home to some of the best thinkers and doers in the world. Most, if not all, of the students I have met are bright, ambitious, talented, caring individuals who most certainly DO crave knowledge and yes, they also strive for success. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be successful. And we certainly don't have to compromise our love for learning to be successful. We are each subjected to a strenuous and holistic application process. We earned our spots here because we are driven, intelligent and unique. Don't belittle that because there are a handful of legacies and power-hungry students. That's just ridiculous and, frankly, insulting.    If you want to talk about the dark side of the Ivy League and the stress on success, it isn't that the students aren't motivated to learn. It's that we so desperately want to learn, and learn from the best, that we get ourselves where we are forced to succeed. Ivy League schools are the homes of Nobel Prize winners, trail blazers, presidents, CEOs, and many many more amazing men and women. To be a part of that community, failure (unless it can be spun into an amazing success story) is not an option. Your whole life in school must be nearly pristine- your extracurricular activities substantial and your essays made to show that you are more than the academic robot you have forced yourself to become. If you want in to this amazing community of minds, you need to push yourself farther than it seems possible. Then, when you do get accepted, it becomes about staying in. There is no relief, no point where you relax. It becomes even more challenging (especially for the product of an average rated public school) than you could have imagined it would be. The work intensity is turned up so high that you can feel yourself burning from within.   But, you know what... as someone who also felt intellectually stagnant during my entire high school experience, I welcome this. Because though I've broken down more than once or twice, thought that surely I couldn't recover, I did. I met the most amazing people- better than anyone I could have invented in my head, better than I could have hoped or dreamed they would be. Each with their own ideas of success and fulfillment. Each with their own stories and values and quirks. People that I will have in my life for the rest of my life and people that I learn from every day.  If you really think you can learn about people from a news article, I feel sorry for you. And if a student is deterred by an article from trying to participate in this amazing community, then let them be deterred. Let someone else take their place. There is a reason that tens of thousands of students apply to Ivies each year- and it's not because it's their destiny. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my 2cents from attending Cornell: \u201cIs it true that they crave success but no knowledge?\u201d Fuck no. Everyone is about getting involved as they can in order to get smarter and smarter. Success is just a by-product of most kids giving their all to better themselves. \u201cIs it true [that the kids don\u2019t have passion for what they do and have been brought up with the Ivy League as their destiny]?\u201d That\u2019s the biggest bullshit statement of any article ever. Most of my friends are very passionate about what they do. The English majors are highly invested in our newspaper The Daily Sun, the engineers live and breathe their project teams, the computer scientists contribute to open source projects for shits and giggles, and the religious studies students meet up twice a week to debate the New Testament. None of these things really translate to success. Most people just really enjoy what they do (actually to the point that it kinda grosses me out because I\u2019d rather play Super Smash or go play basketball). And destiny? My god, hell no. I didn\u2019t even know that I wanted to go to an Ivy league until a month before applications were due. My parents just wanted me to go to state school, and honestly I kinda wish I did too. I specifically chose Cornell because I thought that it would be an Ivy League without all the pretentious, competitive airs of the other schools. So what\u2019s the dark side? First. The dark side is being around people that you aren\u2019t used to. This only really applies to public school kids. When you go from a measly, nonreputable high school and jump up to these schools, you can\u2019t help but realize how different you are. For one, many of us public school kids start to think we are inadequate or that we \u201cdon\u2019t belong\u201d because we get left in the face of geniuses and \u201cperfect\u201d human beings. But, you have to remember that this isn\u2019t true, and that the school did not make a mistake in choosing you to attend. Although I quickly realized this for myself, many peers have faced chronic depression and suicidal thoughts because of this. When you get put into a pond with only big fish, that\u2019s all you have to compare to, so you forget that your pond is the Lake Superior of all the bodies of water. Second. Different upbringing. As a public school kid from regular subarbia, you tend to have a different sense of humor and outlook on life than your ivy league peers. Certain jokes (as light hearted as they are) just don\u2019t fly. Like, one of my favorite comedies is Friday, but I\u2019ve had various people tell me that the movie isn\u2019t funny and is inappropriate. I also love hip-hop, but very few people appreciate it the way I do because they see it as vulgar and basically comical. Like I mention the line, \u201cmayonnaise colored benz, I push miracle whips\u201d, and they say, \u201cWhat? What\u2019s a whip?\u201d As clever as that line as, even when I explain that it\u2019s a car, they say, \u201cOh\u2026\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "So says people with sour grapes or who want to sell books. My father once told me that before you accept anything that another person says, writes or does, examine his or her motivations. I have followed that principle all my life and, to this day, it has not failed me. For example, I routinely read the backgrounds of all authors and experts I encounter. Mr. Deresiewicz is no exception. When I first read one of his articles years ago, I started thinking, \u201cWhat would bring a person, so steeped in the Ivy League world, so supported by its graces, to rage war against that same world?\u201d (I mean, let\u2019s be honest: you would probably never have read this guy\u2019s article had he not been a professor at Yale; because he\u2019d not have had the connections that positioned him to write it.) Three answers to my question came to mind: A desire for money, a desire for vengeance or a desire to tell the truth. On the money side, contrarian views sell. There are a myriad of books written by and about the exploits of Ivy Leaguers and the Ivy League institutions, all of which paint both as angels and earthly caverns of heaven, respectively. Of course, these depictions are not true. But neither are the depictions, like Deresiewicz\u2019s, which suggest that the students are demons and the institutions are like the recesses of hell. Nonetheless, by arguing the latter, he eggs on Ivy League detractors and by trumpeting the latter, he incenses Ivy League supporters. On net, he sells books and earns clicks from everyone involved. It\u2019s plausible, therefore, that many of the silly things Mr. Deresiewicz says are largely to sell books and get hits for his articles. Moreover, insofar as the revenge motivation, it did not take long for me to discover that the popular author was mentioned somewhere on the internet as an example of a junior faculty member that did not get tenure. In other words, Deresiewicz was fired from Yale (see Getting Tenure Back on Track) after nine years of perhaps holding high expectations that he would be tenured. Only after this rejection did he start raging against the world from which he came. Now the pieces of the puzzle seem more easy to put together. An Ivy League product from an upper middle class (Englewood, New Jersey) home, spits fire at the very place that dared reject his bid for a permanent place within it when, in the nine years he worked there, he failed to produce much in the way of literary work. To add some flavour to the whole matter, he even tries to enlist/manipulate the heartfelt sympathies of poor people by claiming Ivy League schools are elitist. Indeed, the first article he wrote that bashed the Ivy League came in the summer of the same year he was fired from Yale, that is, 2008. (Funny enough, for all the elitist stereotypes lobbed at Ivies, Yale was the first school to graduate a black PhD, Edward Bouchet, in 1876 and the first black Harvard graduate came in 1870.) Now despite how plausible the preceding motivations of sour grapes and book peddling might be, there is always the chance that Mr. Deresiewicz simply wanted to tell the truth. His writings and books could be tell-alls, whistle-blowings and expose\u2019s, designed to aid unsuspecting Ivy League would-be\u2019s, by warning them away from those bastards and bastions of hell. Yet, prove that Deresiewicz\u2019s arguments are true, one needs some empirical evidence. Alas, there\u2019s nothing empirical about the article you\u2019ve attached or about Deresiewicz\u2019s book(s). His entire repertoire is based upon his own experiences and, for that reason, are really fictional or at least, autobiographical\u2014which is more in line with his area of expertise as an English teacher. The point is that even if Mr. Deresiewicz believes he is offering the truth, it is merely his own truth, confirmed solely by his own observations: a position reaffirmed by the first-person narratives of his articles and books. He can in no way claim, even as a teacher of Jane Austen, that he has some great insight into the hearts and minds of all Yale students, let alone all Ivy League students, from his position in one narrow discipline. Yet, ironically, it is that position at Yale that has afforded him the opportunity to make these unsubstantiated claims, sell them to a publisher and get some traction in the media. Thus, my friend, I would suggest that before you decide whether to apply to Ivy League schools or any other schools, you consider from whom you receive advice as well as their motivations for giving it. My Dad, a Columbia grad, like Mr. Deresiewicz, but nonetheless a happy one, did not appear to have problems thinking outside the box when he gave that advice to me. ",

            "answer_text": "There are articles by Deresciewicz and Malcolm Gladwell railing against the insanity that is Ivy league college admissions, and to a small degree they have a point. However, they are also authors who have books to sell and publicity to attract so I don't consider them unbiased observers. I am not unbiased myself, but I think my bias is just the basic bias everyone has about their own personal experience - I don't have some hidden ulterior motive (at least not a conscious one). While I do believe that Ivy League college are excellent schools, the pressure and intensity to gain acceptance to such a school (especially by international students) disproportionate to the actual benefit to the student. compared to if they attended another school with slightly less prestigious history. Maybe, it was because of the people I liked to hang out with at Harvard (so there might be some selection bias as maybe I just didn't associated with the \"dark side of Harvard\"), but most of my friends were all about passion for knowledge and intellectual discovery and less about success (particularly financial success). I have friends who graduated with degree in Latin/Classical Literature, English, Social Studies, Physics with no intention of continuing on to academia (really the only guaranteed path for these fields of study), some of my friend tacked on a law degree or two while having no intention of becoming a practicing lawyer, one even started working at an Planetary observatory despite not being an astronomy major because her bf convinced her it would be \"fun.\" Many eventually settled into a job/career that used their impressive intellects (if not the copious knowledge they have gained at university). I guess my point in this meandering post is that... college, even Ivy league schools, is what you make of it. If you were someone who was overly focused on \"Success\" with a capital 'S,' that is going to carry into your life at college. If you hang out with a \"bad crowd\" of college students like that, you might also be drawn into it. And yes... schools would love for you to live up to the \"prestigious reputation\" of their names and \"make <insert-school name> here,\" but you don't have to. Just like you don't have to become a doctor and marry a nice man/woman as your parents would like. ",

            "answer_text": "You're asking for a very specific reaction to a very strange article. Ivy League schools have pretty diverse student bodies these days, and although some of the students have been brought up tinking of these schools as their ultimate educational goals, others are from very different backgrounds. This article paints a grim picture about Yale, but I can assure you that these schools are not actually vats of high-performing clones. This would essentially be an argument of anecdote vs anecdote. Fact is: you can have a good time at an Ivy League school. You can graduate as a creative person with a spark of individuality. You can be idealistic. You can flunk some classes. You can be an alcoholic. You can join a dance troupe or make sculptures of dicks or write a novel or simply quit all your extracurriculars and lie in bed and play Destiny until your eyes bleed. You can be a sorority sister or, at Dartmouth, an actual competitive lumberjack who climbs trees with an axe in each hand. Merely attending an Ivy League school does not transform you into the kind of fearsome android this writer fears you'll become. He's simply wrong about that. He seems to have been one of those success-driven kids. There are a lot of them, but it's not by any means an overwhelming kind of thing. I know Ivy League grads who work on farms today, barely above the povery line. I know Ivy League grads who went back to their tiny hometowns and eschewed gradschool to gladly become mediocre workaday office-dwellers and spend all their weekends hiking. I know Ivy League grads who went to med school, but I also know an Ivy League grad who went to grad school for, as far as I can tell, grad-level puppetry classes. (This person did not subsequently gain employment as an expert successful puppeteer.) I think a lot of this article is driven by the author's personal regrets. Yeah, you can become a neurotic networking-obsessed loser. But I lived in Silicon Valley and I met plenty of people from state schools who had managed to achieve that particular state of existence without ever going to an Ivy. If you want a kid who attends an Ivy League school without becoming some kind of \"dark side\" success robot, it's up to you as a parent to encourage that child in the opposite direction. It's also up to you as a parent to accept your kid and help them find happiness even if they want to become the most successful well-networked doctorlawyerfinancier in the universe, if that's what they really want.

            "answer_text": "I am an alumnus of the University of Chicago, so not an Ivy, but generally considered at least on-par with the Ivies. Here are my thoughts about the article. First, the author is on to something. I think the main problem is that many students are pushed towards elite colleges because parents want it, not because the student wants it. Or, equivalently, the student wants it because the parent sets it as an expectation. No one should expect their children to go to an Ivy. However, the points about lack of true diversity may be true now at most of the schools considered, but that was not my experience (1999 -2003, maybe things are different now). Besides the expected racial diversity, the people I knew were diverse in every meaningful way, except for limited diversity in terms of how much they liked thinking and academics (most everyone was something of an intellectual, or at least could hold their own in intellectual conversations). I had friends whose parents had careers like postal worker, FedEx driver, and delivery truck driver. There were immigrants from poor families, and incredibly wealthy people from abroad. People like me who had good home lives and parents who were still together, and people whose families were some degree of a dysfunctional mess. I met people who were genuine Communists, while I was the Treasurer of the College Republicans for a bit (I\u2019ve moved away from that). There were weird peculiarities of my sample (based only on my experience, everyone in Puerto Rico is a fat gay man and half of them are Jewish), but I think I can confidently say that there was true diversity in the student body. Finally, the academic experience was overwhelmingly positive. I was an economics and math major, but many of the best courses, and most harshly graded, were in the humanities. I truly got a well-rounded education. Now, the Common Core at the University of Chicago is something special, not found at the Ivies. Especially Brown. Let me be blunt; if you went to Brown, I have no respect for your education and probably won\u2019t have any respect for you. And it is a very fair point by the author that one can get a good education many other places than the Ivy League. In fact, I would argue that one can get a good education at any institute of higher learning, if one is willing to work very hard at it and pursue it to the exclusion of all else. It\u2019s simply much easier to get a good education at an environment like the University of Chicago, where the expectations of what students can do are high. And as for students committing suicide due to lack of admission, that\u2019s very sad, but not really the fault of the Ivies. I would guess in most cases it\u2019s the parents fault for having unreasonable expectations. As for the students who commit suicide once admitted, my frank opinion is that I wouldn\u2019t want to attend a school that didn\u2019t sometimes drive students to suicide. I realize this sounds very callous, but the simple fact is that young people commit suicide with sad frequency, failure at something important is often a proximate cause, and school is important to many people at risk. Any school that maintains high academic standards is going to be the trigger for someone at times, and the transition from high school academics to college academics is supposed to be challenging. It\u2019s sad, but just like with the non-admitted students, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame the school. ",

            "answer_text": "Edited to add: indeed one child is now attending Cornell, one is attending Purdue and one attending Bryn Mawr. The one at Purdue had some adjustment to make but all like their programs. I attended one of these schools, and the poor stepchild of them at that, and the only dark side was how freakin' hard we needed to work. My kids attend a boarding school where Ivy admissions is a true circus (parents and kids are nonsensical about it, ignoring many other quality schools that might be better for their kids). Of my own kids, one wants to attend my alma mater (in spite of its relative status issue) because she's passionate about a field of study there and loves the location, as I did. Other than that, although my kids are high achieving they are not looking at any other Ivies. We've spent the summer college visiting (20+ for me and counting - plus another 10 that dad did without me) and I am so impressed by what the rest of colleges have to offer. Beauty, inspiration, academics, athletics, extracurriculars and fun - there is a whole world out there beyond the Ivy league. The dark side is not as Deresiewicz claims inherent to the Ivies and has much less to do with privilege now (for all the reasons listed here by others - it is much pricier to attend a state school out of state than to attend an Ivy). It is inherent in the culture that would stick a kid in a school that is not the best in their field of interest, doesn't have a program they want, and/or isn't in the place that they want to live, just to have a credential. Don't get me wrong, the credential has value, but the perceived value is way out of proportion to the actual value. The ability of my college to impress stopped happening around five years after I graduated. After that your actual achievements take precedence. ",

            "answer_text": "The author of that article has genuine concerns, and seems to be on solid ground when he talks about the problems of a few individual students. However, he turned that article into a book, and had a strong financial/fame incentive to make the strongest, least reasonable claims he could. I think he's wrong more often than right in that particular article. It seems almost bizarre that a school like Yale would try to find the most interesting, intellectually diverse, self-motivated students in the country and actually do the opposite. In my experience, most students at Yale were very interested in either the subject they studied or some extracurricular activity (art, comedy, etc.). And they were generally well-informed about current events and culture (though this may have been due partly to wealth and other environmental factors growing up). I don't know enough non-Ivy students to safely compare both groups, but I very much doubt that Yale students were worse. Certainly many people at Yale feel somewhat empty ambition -- to make a lot of money or succeed at climbing some career ladder, without really caring about the results of their work beyond personal status. But this is far from the majority perspective, and I think you'll find students like this at any college in the country; the difference is more about SAT scores than personal philosophy.  Most students at just about any college care more about their friends and job prospects than they do about the intricacies of their major -- after all, most college grads don't go for a PhD. Yale isn't so different in this respect, but it has no more of a \"dark side\" than any other university. It's probably somewhat brighter, just based on the fact that students who are both highly intelligent and passionate about an academic subject tend to choose Ivy-type universities when they can. But again, I don't know enough about other colleges to make the comparison, and I'm going off of personal experiences and raw statistics here. (Personally, of the 100 or so Yalies I know well enough to comment at all on their career choices, I can think of about half-a-dozen who \"sold out\" in the traditional sense of going into finance or consulting without caring about the work.

            "answer_text": "I think Columbia makes its rules  for admissions pretty clear. If the kids (and their parents) want to poison the well by gaming the admissions process, it's their problem. I don't speak for Columbia Admissions, but the minute a candidate starts yakking about their standardized scores, their playing varsity sports, their GPA (without mentioning what kind of courses they took), I KNOW as a Columbia alumn that I don't want to see them on-campus. We've all read resumes. Resumes are essentially dead documents because they are exclusively about the past, and the past is dead. A perfect resume is nothing more than a dead document done to perfection. Applications that are nothing but perfect resumes need to go into the garbage. The Admissions Committee wants to see academic excellence or failing that, a clear potential for academic excellence because the academic environment is brutal. But academic excellence or the potential for academic excellence is only a check off item. The Admissions Committee wants to see and feel a spark in that individual because the Admissions Committee is looking for the kind of individuals who can be an inspiration to those around them - be they fellow students, faculty, the janitorial staff and yes, even the Columbia University Administration. I believe that young Bill Clinton would be the archetype of a Columbia admit. Dirt-poor rural family. Father an alcoholic.Worked as a teenager to help support his mother, even as he went for the tough courses in school and excelled in those courses. Outsize life dreams. You hang around him, you feel lucky that you know him. You do something for him, you feel lucky that you had the chance to do something for him and help him on his way.  I don't think that we, the Columbia community of students, faculty, administrators and alumns, are looking for drones. We are looking for restlessness and some constructive ambition or dissatisfaction that drives this restlessness. We are looking for agents of change and we want to be able to say that we did the very best we could to nurture these agents of change while they were under our care. As for rich kids on campus, I used to consider them as a negative - let's say that I ran into a couple  of spoiled brats. But then I thought about it: the world is diverse and so should the campus. And guess what, the world includes rich kids including spoiled brats. I was the first in my family to go to uni and I was a full scholarship student. I feel extremely lucky that I got to rub elbows and make good friends with people who were not at all like me including rich kids and including spoiled brats. And during the course of my professional and social life, I comfortably interact and work effectively with people who are not like me on a daily basis. And where did I get this level of comfort and this ability to work with others from? From my days as a Columbia student, of course. ",

            "answer_text": "Yup, the dynamic is true, people in the Ivy Leagues do behave this way; or at least, *there are* many more people in the Ivy league *who are* much more likely to be destiny-bound and unpassionate *than* in a lot of other places I've been.  Sure, people are complex systems, and so most communities (if they're big enough) will have members that break the trends for their area. I've found that, at least at Yale, it hasn't been all that difficult to surround myself with people who break the trends (at least in private). It might even be true that the majority of people only act strangely in public, and are much more passionate and personable once you get to know them (I found my friends early, though it took swimming through some frigid social waters before I found an island of sanity in the ocean of pretension). So feel free to try to get in. I did, and I survived. But if you do get in, and you decide to visit it in person... be suspicious. Not necessarily of the students you meet, but of the institution that presents itself to you. Remember that the polished face you see is nothing but a long, extended, three-dimensional commercial. Your college experience will, like a McDonald's cheeseburger, never live up to the expectations of the advertising. (And like a McDonald's cheeseburger, it's secretly delicious. Living most of your life as a dysfunctional stressball who never sleeps is secretly kind of fun. And one more time, like a McDonald's cheeseburger, overindulgence can make an Ivy League education a choice you regret.) --- On a considerably less formal note: If you come to Yale, don't go to Toads. And if you do go to Toads, don't go drunk. Or at least, if you do go drunk, go bother somebody else afterwards instead of wandering over Stiles to piss on the jock walk right below people's windows, that QPac girl doesn't want to see your schlong and neither do the people who live here. Or at least, if you're going to come piss on our sidewalk, don't start braying about it like a cow in heat, same goes for whatever awesome idea just went through your drunken brain, it's not that awesome, and there would be other things going through your drunken brain if I'd had the sense to bring a slingshot, things like \"hey man, what the fuck\" and \"is this guy for real\", to which the answer would be, absolutely, I'm tired and stressed and have an exam tomorrow and that means I'm making bad decisions, just like you. Ivy League in a nutshell, right there. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a Wharton MBA. Yes there is a dark side in the Ivies, for example I personally knew of two suicides during my two years there (a jump from a high rise not far from my apartment, and a gasoline dousing and match light-up right on the lawn on school grounds). There was also a little snobbery here and there (yes even within the Ivy League there is social stratification and exclusion). Having said that, this is no different from most other schools, ie. there were at least three suicides when I was an engineering undergraduate at the University of Houston. Jumps became so common from one particular building that they enclosed the open sky-view area on the top floor (which simply moved the suicide activity to other buildings)\u2026. and yes there was snobbery, cheating and grade inflation there too. In the end, the Ivies are no different, or exempt, from the dark human side present at any other school, or society in general; we are all pretty similar in many ways (mostly good people trying to do good, with a common thread of insecurity and fear of \u201cnot measuring up\u201d). One thing that does separate the Ivies from many other schools is the incredible breadth, knowledge, and achievement of your classmates. If you were used to being the Top Gun in all your prior academic endeavors and finally make it to the Ivy League, you will quickly see that you are no better than anyone else (and hopefully you\u2019ll take that very important lesson with you for the rest of your adult life).

            "answer_text": "Ivy League schools, like all schools, are made up of people. People have dark sides, so the answer to your question is an invariable yes. It is an unfortunate reality that millions of people struggle with mental health problems. These conditions tend to be more ubiquitous among high-achieving or Type-A individuals. Thus, every top school has students who are in dark places and it is in no way exclusive to the Ivy Leagues. For example, MIT recently was charged with responsibility in a student\u2019s suicide. However, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the institution was not at fault. I agree with this. If you put thousands of valedictorians and stand-out students together in one place, making them feel average at best and worthless at worst, underlying mental health problems can be brought to the surface. While people rightfully complain about the wealth/snobbery of some students at these schools, I would hardly call this a dark side. I think the mental health of students (and people in general) is a much more pressing issue and one that will not be easily resolved. Even when mental health issues thankfully do not end in suicide, they wreak havoc on a young adult\u2019s ability to thrive and fulfill their potential. All schools can do at this point is provide the proper resources and encourage students to seek them out. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm, coming from someone who\u2019s pretty much ingrained in the pre-professional culture at Wharton, UPenn\u2014the most \u201cresults/success oriented\u201d undergraduate business school in the nation, I\u2019d say the dark side is not where you\u2019d expect. Yes, the cutthroat competition exists. Yes, there are plenty of people who just want college for the skills, network, and money. Yes, there are people who will use to you as a means to advance their career or coursework. But calling this a \u201cdark side\u201d isn\u2019t telling since nearly ALL students who go to college are interested in some sort of job afterwards. The higher degree leads to higher salaries, and there\u2019s nothing wrong in wanting that. Regarding passion, even if most people are doing the Ivy league education for purely success, is there anything wrong in pursuing a high paying job that you have no passion for? (See Peter Singer\u2019s effective altruism and his two Princeton disciples.) Using the Ivy League education to first establish a financial foothold and then go on finding that passion-filled life is but one of many ways you can play this great game we all call life. WHAT I WOULD CALL THE DARK SIDE THOUGH\u2026 Is the fact that the Ivy League education says a lot about mental health awareness but doesn\u2019t necessary create an environment that caters it. Of course the academics are tough, but what you don\u2019t discover until you\u2019re the one suffering is that the system doesn\u2019t allow you to take realistic breaks. If your mother dies mid semester, you either take a leave of absence, pay for the rest of the semester, and get Incompletes on all your hard work in your classes OR stay in school and have your GPA go to ruins. There\u2019s constant pressure to stay on top of things since the standard is set so high. ",

            "answer_text": "I went to an Ivy League university, actually, the University of Pennsylvania! I also do outreach interviews for undergraduate admissions too! While I interview people who seem to have a gilded life in their destiny, they do not always get into the University of Pennsylvania. I have, for the most part, interviewed candidates who have a tremendous amount of familial pressure to succeed, and they get great grades and do well in extracurriculars, but they still don't get admitted. The students that have been admitted are the ones with passion for what they are already into - for this reason, I will write that my own experience is different than  Deresiewicz experience - so I must politely disagree.  When I went to UPenn, I have to admit that I was passionate about biochemistry. I took classes like music theory and history of world music to expand my horizons. If I was dispassionate, maybe I would have pursued a very easy major and just tried to finish school with minimal course load - for some reason, I didn't do that - I even spent summers taking classes so I could learn the material better. Some of my classmates seemed dispassionate regarding what they were studying, but they were the minority.  I won't bombard you with the specifics of my experience, but I will say that you or your child can find the atmosphere that excites and inspires them at an Ivy league. Perhaps William Deresiewicz wrote his article just to be inflammatory and to be read by concerned people - he does make his living as a journalist, right? Maybe he has a point, but from my experience, I feel like it is malarkey. I wonder if less people read his articles, if his writing will become even more controversial. ",

            "answer_text": "Ivy League schools have far too diverse a student body to sum up in such a simplistic way. Students experience varies considerably based on major, the particular Ivy they attend and demographics like being an international student. But certainly there are \"down\" sides to attending a prestigious and hence competitive and pressure-filled school. A vivid memory for me is visiting Cornell in the mid-70s when I was still in high school. They were fishing a body out of the campus gorge, a notorious spot for suicides for many years (perhaps still is.) I'm no psychiatrist, but something is wrong when students in their late teens so no way out with such regularity. The biggest \"dark side\" to me personally was the extreme disinterest - even disdain --- with which faculty viewed undergrads. My \"faculty advisor\" let me know he was willing to meet with me only because it was required -- and I better keep is short. I was done with him after that. Add to that class size -- my first class in college has 1800 kids in it. Hardly the kind of access to professors I had hoped for. I ended up transferring to a state college in the SUNY system and was much happier with the kind of education I received for about 1/10 of the cost. ",

            "answer_text": "Mr. Deresiewicz gives parents terrible advice, if only because the most elite colleges have the most money and give out the most financial aid.  They are cheaper than state schools for many families who are not very well off.  Would anyone pay more--perhaps substantially--to attend a less prestigious school?   But even if cost is not a factor in the decision, there is nothing wrong with wanting to attend the most prestigious schools.  They tend to have the most resources in every sense of the word: the best students, the best professors, greatest endowment per student, great on campus recruiting.   I have learned a tremendous amount from my friends, classmates, and professors.  Even if you don't necessarily think the most prestigious school you've been accepted to is the best fit, attending it could very well provide many opportunities you would not otherwise have had.   Most of my classmates are passionate about what they do--that's sort of what the admissions office is looking for. Apply to the most prestigious schools because you could see yourself studying at them.  Maybe you don't know what you want to do and you think studying at one will give you the most options.  Or maybe you love the idea of Yale's residential colleges and want to attend college in a small New England city.  Apply to colleges where you want to go--whatever your reasons are for wanting to go there.  Don't limit your options before the admissions offices even see your application--let them do that. ",

Excerpt: In short, I believe that each of these claims is partly true and largely false, and that none is a good reason to avoid getting an education at Harvard. Though I do believe that there are several good reasons one might avoid an Ivy schooling, I've found my first two years of college to be an intensely gratifying intellectual and social experience, wherein I have learned to put aside expectations to pursue the things I love, surrounded by largely level-headed classmates following their own passions. I expect to graduate socially, morally, and -- yes -- fiscally prepared to change, and what's more, live in, the real world. If you choose to join me here, I expect you'll find the same. I also reference quotes from a former Dean of Harvard College, a highschool educator from Roanoke, VA, members of Harvard's alumni interview corps, senior admissions officers at Harvard, alumni from Yale and Chicago, professors at U. Wisconsin-Madison and Cleveland State, and others, as well as personal experience. As for the character of the students here at Harvard, my final post, Dear Brother: These are the Friends I Met, addresses Deresiewicz's critiques. ",

Yet in the evening, the opposite occurs; the east side of all Ivy League building are on the dark side. On the other hand, mysteriously, the North and South sides of Ivy League buildings are only in the dark side between dusk and dawn. Strangely enough, the same phenomena occurs at most non-Ivy League schools in the US as well. So if you want to go to a school with no dark side, you might want to consider splitting your time between the University of Antarctica and the University of Greenland (so long as you divide your time appropriately, or else you could end up on the dark side all year)!

All I know is  I got a good engineering education, better I think than received by my friends who went to state institutions, and met some more worldly people than I would have otherwise met. And mentioning Cornell more often than not raises an eyebrow even here in the South where they don't know the Ivies as well as they do in the Northeast. I was taught well and taught to think, I don't think I fit any of those psychotic attributes that WD finds so repulsive. Most of my classmates and fellow students were knowledge hungry.

Amazing professors and teaching staff, one of the largest libraries in the world, students who share your interests \u2026 it's a nerd paradise. ",

Even a lot of very bright students with very good grades who might potentially have a shot will not find some or all of the Ivies to their liking. Yes, the profs might be very good and the classes themselves very challenging, but most of your time will be on campus outside of class. It can seem like a very strange, intimidating, and uncongenial milieu to many students - especially those who didn\u2019t attend private prep schools. Some students can adjust to that, but others never do. ",

The academic requirements are often hard to keep up with because of the heavy load of coursework. Keeping up requires a very strong work ethic and the ability to learn how to learn. I think these attributes are essential for one to graduate from Cornell.Not everyone can cope with Cornell's pressure. Some people drop out. Some people even commit suicide, made easier in the past by the deep gorges at the north and south ends of the campus. Cornell has recently constructed obstacles to prevent suicide by gorging out. Students should realize that there is life outside and after Cornell.I saw some competitiveness at Cornell but I did my best to avoid getting caught up in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny thing about dark sides is they tend to stay hidden. In academia, credit to your work is pretty much the only thing you have. Every university is a hotbed of faculty politics, and Ivies are no exception. In fact, because of the name recognition, the stakes are much higher. The upside is these things rarely make it into the student experience, and let me stop you now before you try looking for any decently sized academic institution that doesn't have the same frictions.
