            "answer_text": "They are like the first and second courses in a restaurant. The first one lines your stomach and makes you hungry for the second.  With rare exceptions, every person has a first language. It needn\u2019t be a spoken language or a natural language. There are people whose first language is one of the sign languages, or Esperanto. But, language is something we all use to communicate our desires to the surrounding environment (usually the tired caregivers). From the initial babbely-bla, with a tonne of input and feedback from the surrounding speakers, we start reproducing the sounds they say. (This is of course a very simplistic summary of the field of a first language acquisition, I apologise to all academics who are cringing at the moment.) The first language is the first one you can communicate with. It is also called your mother tongue. To call something a second language it needs to be a language you can communicate in fluently, even if only in a limited context. Learning some French for final exams in school will not make French your second language. But, if your first language is Italian and you speak French at school with no problem, then French is your second language. Any language you learn after your first that becomes your second, third, fourth, up till\u2026 your patience to learn runs out. But! And here comes a big but (don\u2019t confuse with a big butt), all this is only the case if you are brought up in a monolingual environment, that is an environment where only one language is spoken. If each of your parents speaks a different language to you, or you hear a different language at home and a different one among your one year old peers in a playgroup, you will likely start speaking two languages. Both of these languages will be your mother tongues. Both of them will be your first languages. Technically speaking, any extra language you acquire after your mother tongues will be your second \u2014 even if you already had two. You can think of languages in tiers: lower tier languages are your first ones, and we count sequentially from there. Coming back to the restaurant metaphor, having two mother tongues is like having had two starters. But, the language restaurant is a gourmet one and the portions are tiny so, even having three or four starters can leave you hungry for more, and evoke a \"language bug\u201d (a non-scientific term) \u2014 the desire to learn even more languages, and eventually become a polyglot!

            "answer_text": "Language is the most significant aspect which makes us different from all other species. Accordingly, language acquisition is the most impressive aspect of human development both in psychological and cognitive perspective. However, all normal human beings acquire the language they first encounter as children. Then they might learn multiple languages but those languages will always be different from the first language they acquired by being exposed to. So, it is evident that there are a lot of differences between the first language and the second language of a person. Let\u2019s explore the differences: A first language is the mother tongue or native language of a person while a second language is a language a person learns in order to communicate with the native speaker of that language.The first language is like an instinct which is triggered by birth and developed with the experience of being exposed to it. A second language is a personal choice of a person.There is no other alternative to a first language. A person cannot decide his/her first language. It comes to him/her as an inheritance/legacy/birthright. On the other hand, a second language is always fixed by the person. There are many alternatives to a second language. A person/community can choose a second language among other languages.The acquiring process of the first language is very rapid while the learning process of the second language can vary from language to language and from person to person, but can never be as rapid as the first language acquisition.
