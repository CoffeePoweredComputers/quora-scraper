            "answer_text": "No one can answer this question for you and if some one try to answer you he is not a competent person. Let me help you why I am saying this. How do you define a good career for yourself? The career which you may like may not be good for someone else and the right career for others may not be good for you. Therefore, this is very subjective and personal choice. This is common problem but we all trust others to advise us for a good course or career. Let\u2019s take an example - How will you react if I advise you to go for B.Tech CS? Or go to US and take a degree in Maths. These are the best career for you. Your conclusion will be I am a big fool and you will be surprise that what kind of career counselor I am. I am very sure that you can find a bright career path for yourself. Just read this carefully - I would advise you to follow a simple process to find out a right career path for yourself. List out your career choices - you may list a large number - list all of them in first attempt.Then find out more information & take a decision on each of them. If required take help of your friend, family members, teachers or any other senior person you have access to. Understand each option and start reducing your list based on your own criteria, information and choice.Contact any career counselor or any other person or site to take personality assessment test to find your personality traits. This will help you matching your personality traits and interest with your choice. This personality test gives you opportunity to identify your own good & not so good personality traits, which you can work on, which will help you all through you life.You can also add any career choice during this process, which you have missed or didn\u2019t like it in your first selection or have come to know about it now.I am sure you will end-up very soon with 2 or 3 choices. Then it will be easy for you to narrow down your final career path.Consider the full profile of a career path or job - not just subject/course or few aspects of a job profile, such as - many of us are impressed by a well dressed Army or police officer. Don\u2019t give undue weightage to earnings in this career selection process. The right career will give you more better life, peace, and pleasure.In case if you are confused in last two or three choices, then gather more information on each of them and then take a final view. Don\u2019t worry this a very common & normal scenario.Don't go by just advice & suggestions, consider your choice first based on your advantage or limitations. Feel free to contact me at any point for help. Hope this helps. ",
