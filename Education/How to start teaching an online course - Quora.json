            "answer_text": "Teaching an online course is very similar to conducting online tuitions. Online teaching/ tutoring isn\u2019t as hard as it used to be. It has always been one of the best industries to work in. Kudos to you! I spoke to a couple of teachers and asked them how did they make the switch to online teaching. While doing my research I also bumped into a very informative blog series. I\u2019m collating a few important points to keep in mind while starting your online teaching course: Choose your niche. It\u2019s very important to stand out in a competitive industry like the tutoring industry. It helps you set the direction for everything.Understand your audience. You need to ask yourself what do your potential customers value? Is it professional tutoring, personalized attention or regular feedback. This will help you develop a top-notch sales pitch and offerings that will appeal to them.Look around you and analyze your competition. Highlight your unique selling proposition or USP. It\u2019s the differentiating factor for your business that makes you stand out from the competition.What\u2019s your payment model going to look like? There are a couple of factors to keep in mind when deciding on a payment model. Location, subject expertise and qualification and competitor price point are going to mould your payment model as well.And lastly, finalize the tools that you need. For online teaching, deciding on tools that you\u2019re going to need for the smooth functioning of your business is going to be key. At the very base, you\u2019re going to need a video conferencing and scheduling software. You should check out Appointy\u2019s integration with Zoom that makes scheduling video sessions seamless.For a deeper insight, you can check out the blog series here: How to start teaching courses online and find customers: A guide for Covid-19 and beyond!

            "answer_text": "Most people will tell you to go create it, waste time, and finally sell! That\u2019s risky! I did it this way and launched my course to crickets. Months of preparation, and finally when I launched it, no one bought. What you need to do instead is very simple, and so much safer: pre-sell the course. During the whole process you want to gather an audience around you and engage with people (help them out) so that when you finally launch it, you have people that know like and trust you. Step 1: Decide who you want to sell to and what result you want to bring themStep 2: start researching your audience. go where they hangout (usually facebook group) and find out where they are not being served properly\u2026 ask them.Step 3: Outline the course. Find the easiest and fastest way to get them the best possible result. (break down the big problem from step 2 into 5 steps)Step 4: Launch a free live training in which you will teach them something related to your course, and get them a quick win. at the end of the training you pitch them (this is where you validate your course)Step 5: (if needed) reiterate. else, just collect the money and go teach them live.Kevin Chiche ",

            "answer_text": "Why You? Before you go into building the course, which I fully endorse, the question you have to ask yourself, is why are people going to choose your course? To make the course work, you will need people to complete it. From what I have seen in the training sector is that people want some form of qualification or assurance that the course they are doing is going to be worth their time! To create the course I have heard good reviews from: ThinkificLearnworldsI would focus the course on being as interactive as possible, with lots of activities and ways to engage the learner. Either go for a short course which they can complete in a few hours or make the course that runs for several weeks and being completed part-time! If you want it to be systemised you can create multiple-choice questions which can be automatically marked, if you want to put work into it, you can request them to write answers and assess them! The best ones I have done are the ones that are quick and you can keep some of the work e.g. workbooks OR the ones that last weeks and you have to dedicate a lot of time to and it involves reading! Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "First point to consider: full-time, tenure-track online teaching jobs are rare. Most online colleges hire teachers to work at a distance.  Second: Not all schools offer the same deals. Employment conditions such as pay rate, required training, and class size vary widely.   Get Educated has compiled this guide to show you what to look for so you can land work as an online instructor at the post-secondary level. Qualifications Most online schools hire part-time adjuncts. To qualify, you\u2019ll generally need to hold a master\u2019s degree or be able to document that you\u2019ve taken a cluster of advanced coursework in the areas you wish to teach. Number of Courses You Can Teach Many schools limit the number of online courses or credit hours any one instructor is allowed to teach. Six courses per year might be typical (18 credit hours per semester). Academic freedom Some online schools have pre-set curricula, which can be easier and take less time for you to deliver\u2014but which can be restricting, especially if you are used to creating your own material.
