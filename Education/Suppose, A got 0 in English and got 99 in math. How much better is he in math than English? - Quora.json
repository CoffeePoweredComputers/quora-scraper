            "answer_text": "I assume you mean someone got 0% right on a English test but 99% right on a math test. The answer is: who knows? My experience is that most people have a poor understanding of numbers and a poorer understanding of percentages. Usually a bare number doesn\u2019t mean much. Back before we understood the concept of sexism, a young lady might have the measurements of 36\u201324\u201336. But what if her measurements were 90\u201360\u201390, what would we think of her then? Well, if the first measurements were in inches and the second in centimeters, the answer is that the two sets of measurement are almost identical. Without the units, the numbers are meaningless. Ah, but aren\u2019t percentages different? They are. The question is, the percentage of what? Suppose the student is in fifth grade. Let\u2019s let the English test be on Beowulf and the math test is on adding pairs of two digit numbers. What chance would the kid have on that English test, but he should do very well on the math test. The scores would tell us little, if anything. Even at that, percentages in different tests, even in the same subject are not directly comparable. That is the point of standardized tests. I could be wrong, but I believe the SAT started out with a mean of 500 points with a standard deviation of 100 points. If you got a score of 600 on the math test, but 400 on the verbal it meant your were one standard deviation above the mean on the math test and one standard deviation below the mean on the verbal test. But you can\u2019t say you are 50% smarter in math than language because there is no unit of measurement for comparison with a common and natural zero point. One could also use percentiles. Your percentile is the percentage of students who got a lower score than you. But again, someone who got a 60 percentile score is not 50% better than someone who got a 40 percentile score. It doesn\u2019t work that way. When it comes to scores, all you can really do is compare how well someone did by how far they are above or below the average in terms of standard deviation, or in terms of percentiles, but anything much beyond that is just meaningless fun and games with numbers.
