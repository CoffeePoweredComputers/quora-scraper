            "answer_text": "Dear SAT Aspirant, On the College Board - SAT, AP, and College Planning Tools -/SAT, you will find SAT and SAT subject tests- For the under graduate programs in USA-it is ideally required from the student to submit the scores of both the tests . Let us look at the importance of the two tests:- 1.SAT is an aptitude based exam using tools such and Math and English to review your thinking skills. The SAT requires a student to be adept in solving Math problems from topics such as Arithmetic, number system, Geometry, Modern Math . Math problems come in varieties of Word problems and numerical ones. The English questions are grammar based, vocabulary based and Critical thinking based reading questions. 2. The Subject SAT is given by the students to display their thorough knowledge of the subject they plan to study for the UG program in the USA. A SAT subject test can be on Math, higher Math, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, American Literature, World History and a plethora of other subjects that the student intends to show the Admission council about his strength in the respective subjects. Now, to answer your question further- dear student please note that it is advised to give both the exams along with APs to reap the benefits in the School, such as credit waivers, scholarships based on the SAT , Subject SAT scores, Fee waivers based on the scores. Most of the students look at easy options to enter the school- in due course of their studies regret not having given these tests to seek various benefits.

The huge disadvantage is that you won\u2019t be accepted to those colleges that require them. Please check with the college(s) you\u2019d like to attend, find out if they require SAT subject test scores when you apply, and plan accordingly. ",
