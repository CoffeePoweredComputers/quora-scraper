            "answer_text": "Yes, but we must think carefully about what the definition of \u2018education\u2019 is. Two thousand years ago, education for most people meant going to work with your parents and learning the family trade. This still works well today.Two hundred years ago, education for most people meant seeking out an apprenticeship with a master craftsman. This still works well today.Twenty years ago, education for most people meant memorizing a ton of facts and then going to a company to start on the job training. This doesn\u2019t work very well today. Computers have taken over many of these jobs.Two years ago, education for most people meant learning to solve problems, think creatively, value your time, and find a career that matches your passion. While these are some of the main goals of modern education, the extent to which they are achieved varies greatly!Two minutes ago, education for me meant reading a question on Quora and exercising my brain by responding.The good thing is that education is automatic. Kids will always learn skills and thought patterns. Whether those skills match the job market is the current problem we face in the US. Many kids graduating today are lacking either the craftsmanship skills of two hundred years ago or the critical thinking skills valued in today\u2019s newer businesses. However, the \u2018basic\u2019 skills education of twenty years ago has been disrupted severely by computers and robots. There just aren\u2019t that many jobs for someone who memorized a lot of stuff and can sit down quietly in a row of desks and copy words from a screen on the wall. But many school systems are still stuck in the system that is still doing the \u2018twenty year ago\u2019 method. The good part is that many more schools have begun to realize that they have fallen behind. The first step to fixing a problem is to realize that you have one. Speakers, writers, and activists like Sir Ken Robinson have been instrumental in dragging these less visionary schools out of the dusty cobwebs of history and into the bright light of creative accomplishment of today. Now our only problem is that Artificial Intelligence will begin to think creatively and take over creative jobs soon. What this means for the next twenty years we cannot say, but it will likely be an even more drastic change than the last twenty have been. Cheers! ",
