            "answer_text": "To start from, its fair to assume that u are taking the CAIEs, since most of us do, here in South Asia. \u201cI will be giving both AS and A2 together\u201d, I have to be honest, thats a lot at hand; u would be preparing for 5 papers each of bio and chemistry, including those nerve wracking practicals, and 4 math papers, all in just a few months. Its quite improbable that you end up even with what you are aiming for. The best option i see is that you give ur As papers in this coming may/june examinations and the A2 ones, the harder ones in oct/nov,i.e u take a gap year. I don\u2019t see another way around,than taking a gap year. Its perfectly fine to take one, loads do for various reasons as necessary. Drawing from my experiences, I would say essentially two reasons account for a student not being able enough to perform well in his exams: Do you really understand what you read about? When u read something, a sentence say, its really important you understand what it says, before u simply go on reading the next one. Say, u read, as \u2018simple\u2019 as electrons move around the nucleus . Now, don\u2019t just jump to reading the next sentence in line, give it a minute or so, Ponder over it; What makes the electrons move around the nucleus. How do they move, and why do they do so in that particular manner. So being curious, asking questions makes u not only want to study more, but more so, u gradually develop this great analytical ability which enables u to analyse situations much better than before. After all there\u2019s far more to than ending up with a grade on a grade sheet, how you achieve so carries far greater weightage. You could do fairly well just by doing loads of past papers, since for the most part the questions keep repeating, but u would be missing on that analytical part. Second is to get your thoughts into words clearly; one needs to be specific when writing answers. Its worth knowing what does a certain word really means than what u might think it means. So, as long as the questions keep piling up, and u\u2019re eager to know why things happen in the manner they do, and then being able to explain in the simplest of words, and specifically, that i think is the point when one really starts understanding what they read about. Applying learned understanding of the subject to the exam questions Just do enough of these exam questions that u familiarize yourself with the style of questions being asked. Even the style doesn\u2019t really matter as long as got your concepts strong. There are some other minor things too like the \u2018glossary of words\u2019 so u know what u\u2019re exactly being asked to write. The Example Candidate responses helps u in that regard, so do consult them. As a guidance from where u might wanna study from, i\u2019ve linked in some ebooks and websites.
