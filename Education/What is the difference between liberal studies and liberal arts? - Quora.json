            "answer_text": "Liberal Studies is specifically for elementary teachers. It\u2019s the gateway to a credential in k-8 or elementary education. This is the degree I have. Liberal Arts is much more general and provides many good opportunities for employment in many different fields. In my experience employers often confuse the two. I have heard from potential employers in many different opportunities that they often look for a liberal arts degree (in my case they were confusing my liberal studies with a liberal arts degree) because it means that the candidate has a wide breadth of knowledge and has taken a variety of classes that can afford a unique skill set that is more generalized than someone who for example has a business administration degree.
