            "answer_text": "The U.S. does have some of the best private schools in the world. Phillips Academy produced lots of presidents and congressmans. I believe Massachusetts ranks high even among the developed world. I will say that our average k-12 public schools are horrible. I can only speak from experience of having attended k-12 public school. Schools really intrudes into family life. Even as early as elementary school, Mom and Dad drops off their kids at 8 and heads to work from 9 to 5. The kids will attend school from 8 to 1 and then after school programs from 1 to 6. By the time mom and dad picks up their kids and goes home, it is already 7. Dinner time is very rush. Realistically, they have 2 hours every night together as a family. This might be one reason why families are falling apart. Kids are alienated from their parents. Mom and Dad are overworked and alienated from each other.Related to point 1, family really does not really exist. Both Mom and Dad are working full time. When their kids are in high school, they only want to be with their friends. School goes from 7:30 to 3:30. Their daughter only wants to be with her friends. Their son unusually have football or baseball practice until 6:30. There are usually 2 to 3 hours of homework afterwards. Mom is stressed, dad is stressed, their daughter is stressed, and son is stressed. Home is basically just a place where they sleep.Public schools produce lots of malfunctioning children. A good portion of these kids attending these public schools comes from abusive households. They in turn abuse other kids at school. Kids are exposed to drugs and other inappropriate stuff as early as 2nd grade. Most of the filth I know were learned from other kids at school.Schools are literally unhealthy. The bathrooms are filthy. Lunches are disgusting. Police officers literally patrols the school. Kids literally gets arrested at school.Schools tries to \u201cbalance the field\u201d by going with the lowest common denominator. I know 14 and 15 year olds who are ready for college level math. Their school won't allow them to opt out of math classes. They are forced to be in classes with people under their league.It is very ineffective. Subjects that can be learn in 6 weeks are stretched out for 9 months. Some classes are a joke that you can study the night before the exam and pass effortlessly. American schools definitely wastes 13 year of precious life.Schools are very outdated. Schools are still operating like factories and \u201ceducating\u201d kids like assembly lines. Homework are about busy work such as copying definitions. Tests are usually about regurgitating information. Kids are given spelling test in elementary school and multiple choice test on American History or Biology in middle and high school. It is literally reading the chapter and filling in the blanks. This may explain why lots of high school graduates cannot read or think logically. I know adults who cannot do basic math.Very low standard for graduation. When I was going through school, I remember D\u2019s are passing grades. Many of my peers graduated with a sub 2.0 GPA.My recommendation is to avoid these public schools as much as possible. It is best to just have your kids to their education online and learn stuff that are useful. I have seen 13 year olds who can code proficiently. They definitely did not learn to code from public schools. I know that immigrants want to come to this country to give their children a better chance to life. The truth is these schools will mess up your children. ",

            "answer_text": "The Society and The Corporate Culture - American society does not value academics plain and simple. The primary function of our high schools is for students to internalize ultra-nationalism and learn the art of socializing while competing on the athletic field and none of these things are an accident. Ask yourself, how many parents have their kids develop their intellects by participating in the American Math Competition vs. the number of parents that have their kids destroy their brains playing football? The Americans that care about academics tend to be first generation Americans or immigrants, who are under the impression that academic prowess is the mechanism to success in our society. Sadly the academically oriented kids will likely be exploited in the workplace, because they have grown up with the illusion that hard work pays. In all likelihood these hardworking students will be subservient to people who are half as knowledgeable as them but have cultivated the art of schmoozing and networking since birth. Many of those connections are developed through the shared experiences on the athletic field or shared admiration of watching professional sports and a shared contempt for the academics who were \u2018wasting their time\u2019 acquiring \u2018book knowledge\u2019 and did not develop a sufficient \u2018appreciation of the real world\u2019.The Death of US Manufacturing - instead of having vocational training for students, it is now expected that nearly all of high school students go to college. As a result, academic classes are flooded with students who are in no way prepared to understand the material to any serious degree. The net result is that courses are taught at a much lower level.The Stagnation of Wages and Increased Economic Uncertainty - students are under pressure from parents to \u201cperform\u201d in terms of returning home perfect transcripts. Administrators are under even greater pressure from parents to perform in terms of generating the grades for their children, administrators then apply leverage onto teachers. As a result high schools have abdicated their role in assessment, and grades are meaningless.The growth in Administration - over the past six decades the number of students in our schools have doubled, the number of teachers increased by 252%, but the number of administrators increased by 700%. I would like to say that this administrative layer adds no value to our schools but the reality is much worse. I have formulated what I half joking call the Laws of School Administrators, they read as follows:If you expect nothing from administrators, you are expecting too much. Mathematically, the utility of administrators is strictly less than zero. U(A) < 0An irreversible process in education follows the path set forth by administrators. This process increases the average grades of all students in a school system. If G is the average grades of all students in a school system then dG is strictly greater than zero. dG > 0The Schools of Education, the Unions and the Administrators colluding to extort the public - Currently there is an ingenious system set up where tax payers finance \u201chigher ed degrees\u201d primarily in \u201cthe field of Education\u201d for teachers, as a result teachers move to the right on the salary guide. These degrees are not worth the paper they are printed on. The Schools of Education are the academic backwaters of our university system and the only reason that they persist is because they bring in so much money to the universities. The reason that this taxpayer fraud persists is because once teachers have higher ed degrees in education it is fairly easy for them to become administrators, and a subset of those become superintendents. The Superintendents are in the position to push policies through Boards of Education to continue this racket. The educational theories put forth by the Schools of Education tend to directly align with corporate interests which leads to the next reason.The Looting of the public coffers by private corporate entities - The public sector has always been looked on like fresh meat for corporations. Several decades ago the corporations that primarily preyed on our schools were publishers. Over the past three decades, that has shifted to tech corporations. The mechanism that makes this happen is that the tech companies lobby government officials to earmark grants for schools that follow initiatives that will ultimately lead to selling their products. Since there is a finite amount of money that can be extorted from the public through taxes, administrators are always seeking additional funds. Securing grants for technology initiatives is one method that gets money for the short run but in the long run becomes incredibly expensive since it will ultimately require a technology support staff who will then be incentivized to keep their jobs. The net effect is that teachers and students become servants to these technologies that generally negatively impact the classroom. For example, SmartBoards which are finally being phased out of most schools, were inferior to simply having a chalk board and a pull down screen - and that is just the tip of the iceberg.The Class Structure and Financing of American Education - The Education system is financed primarily through local property taxes. This was purposely done to maintain a system of apartheid and to maintain the class system that exists in the US. The public prefers to ignore both because it sheds light on too many myths that we like to believe about our country. What this creates is a sense of entitlement in our suburban white schools and a sense of hopelessness in our urban schools. In the former, parents believe that they deserve something for the property taxes they are paying, and in the latter the students have enough life experience to see right through the nonsense. They know the education game is rigged.Constructivist Ideology - Besides being the snake-oil salesmen for the publishing and technology corporations, the Schools of Education are the proponents of fraudulent ideological cult called Constructivism. The central tenet of Constructivist ideology is that children are natural \u201cactive learners\u201d who need to \u201cdiscover the knowledge\u201d, not merely learn it \u201cpassively\u201d from experts in the field. Take a handful of high school students, put them in groups, and they will naturally discover the laws of Physics, and the teacher should just act as a facilitator. Teachers should be \u201cthe guide on the side\u201d instead of the \u201csage on the stage\u201d. It sounds great particularly to suburban parents who are thoroughly impressed with their children being on Honor Roll (over half of the school is on Honor Roll), and think of their children as geniuses in the making. There is however an extremely large problem with it, it makes absolutely no sense. It took the greatest geniuses in history to come up the theories that underlie Physics or the Theorems of Mathematics. Many of these concepts eluded the greatest minds in history. Apparently a group of teenagers who are barely equipped to solve a ready made quadratic equation will somehow uncover the Conservation of Angular Momentum. It is an insult to the history of knowledge, yet this is precisely the snake oil that is promoted by Schools of Education. Administrators love it because they know that if teachers implement Constructivist ideas in their classrooms, it is guaranteed to fail. So if they are looking to terminate an effective teacher, what they will do is accuse the teacher of having a classroom that is too \u201cteacher centered\u201d and insufficiently \u201cstudent centered\u201d. Then when the teacher makes the modification to turn their classroom into an \u201cactive learning environment\u201d the administrators will accuse them of having insufficient control of the classroom and that students are not learning.High School Sports - did you ever wonder why many of your high school teachers were not particularly knowledgeable in their respective fields? You have to understand that there exists a subset of high school teachers who get degrees in education, for the primary purpose to recreate their glory days on the athletic field. If this sounds pathetic, that is because it is pathetic. What is worse is that the importance of athletics in the general culture allows these teachers to rise in power within the school. This plays a huge role in who becomes high school administrators, in particular principals and superintendents. If you don\u2019t believe me, go look into your alma mater, chances are the current principal was a gym teacher and a coach. The toxic effects that athletics has on our schools both high school and college, is incalculable. It plays a large role in why many teachers tend to be so dispassionate about the subjects they teach - they were never academically oriented in the first place.College Admissions - You would think that for the academically oriented first generation Americans or immigrant kids would get into top universities based on their academic prowess. Think again. Most will struggle with the inherent unfairness and lack of a meritocracy in not only the workplace but in college admissions as well. Where many of these top students will find themselves frozen out of the top schools who have created a variety of mechanisms to give preferences to the most privileged students(legacy, niche sports etc). Furthermore, many of our nations top high schools are really not great academic schools, they are transcript mills. The teachers in those schools rubber stamp A\u2019s and A+\u2019s on the transcripts of students in all of the \u201cmost rigorous coursework\u201d AP and IB classes. This frees up these students to spend their time and money on activities that make them look like well rounded superstars both academically and in sports and extracurricular activities. They have nowhere near the proficiency of the immigrant kids who actually put in the work to learn the material. But since AP scores are not required for the transcripts of most schools they are not considered in the admissions process - all that matters is the grade in the course.The Tenure Process- No this is not going to be a corporate screed about how tenure is bad and hurts students. On the contrary, what tenure does is protects teachers from arbitrary dismissal and forces the parasitic administrative layer to justify why a teacher should be terminated. Not only should every teacher have tenure rights, but every employee everywhere should have tenure rights. What the process to obtain tenure does is gives the administrative layer a vetting mechanism to terminate the most effective teachers and to keep those that are the most obedient to their ever changing whims. The ones who get the protection of tenure don\u2019t need it. In other words, the teachers that are granted tenure are the least likely to ever need the protections of tenure precisely because they will follow the dictates of administrators regardless of how ineffective or counterproductive their ideas are for student learning. What this does is creates resentment on the part of the general population on to the people who have these workplace rights, because they fundamentally believe that these individuals don\u2019t deserve them . To a large degree they are correct, because they rarely use it in the service of learning.Ultra-Nationalist Indoctrination - The United States is one of the few countries where students are effectively required to recite a loyalty pledge (Pledge of Allegiance) on a daily basis from the time they are in Kindergarten. It is an effective requirement because for the overwhelming majority of their schooling, students have no idea that they actually have a choice to do the loyalty pledge. Students are not the only people who are effectively required, Teachers are as well. While no administrator is dumb enough to directly cite it as a reason for terminating a teacher, because it is against the law. The reality is that there are so many means at the disposal of the administrators to remove teachers that no teacher wants to stick out. The overall climate inside of our schools and our society is one of obedience on the part of the entire population. It is so disturbing to see whole classes of students mindlessly recite this loyalty pledge, in many cases incorrectly saying invisible instead of indivisible, every single day, year after year. It helps create a society of mindless drones, many of whom will voluntarily sign up to be the cannon fodder for the oligarchy that effectively rules this empire. Lastly they are predisposed to thinking that the American system of healthcare or education is the best because after all \u2018America is the greatest country in the past, present, and future history of the Universe\u2019. It is a disturbing farce.So there you have it, I gave you 12 reasons. I am sure there are many more, but this gives you an idea. ",
