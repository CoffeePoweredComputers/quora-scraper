            "answer_text": "Most universities in European lands have conducting departments at their music colleges (conservatories / academies). In general, the programme begins at the undergraduate level (after high school). In order to get into a conducting programme, you must have strong knowledge in music theory, form, harmony, poliphony, music history, as well as solid proficiency at the piano. The only realistic way to meet these requirements is to have finished music high school (this is in addition to the regular high school). Four years of university-level study at the conservatory would usually comprise of twice-weekly conducting lessons, plus solf\u00e8ge, composition, form analysis, vocal and instrumental polyphony, more harmony, more history of music, more piano, orchestration, choral singing, a foreign language, history of fine arts, psychology, sociology and a few other elective courses. Most courses meet twice weekly and are at least one full year, although some go for several years (solf\u00e8ge and piano run for all four years of study, orchestration for three, composition for two, etc). Completing the four years of study confers bachelors of fine arts (conducting). This degree programme provides basic conducting skills and knowledge, but for high-profile professional ensembles, it is usually insufficient and masters degree (or PhD) is desired. Conducting is a very intense and demanding study programme. At my old academy of music, the various departments are numbered, and the order of numbering is generally considered to be by degree of difficulty (and, unoficially, the pecking order): CompositionConductingStrings (violin, viola, cello, contrabass)PianoWinds (wood/brass)Voice (opera)Musicology (and ethnomusicology)Music educationPercussion, harp, guitar, harpsicord/organ, jazz In America, conducting is mostly studied at the graduate level, after completing four-year university general studies in music.

            "answer_text": "It depends. Do you mean a full time conductor for a major symphony, a music teacher at a high school that conducts the high school band, a conductor of a community band, a church orchestra, or something else? Most full time conductors have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in music but to the be the conductor of a major symphony, you\u2019re probably going to have to have a master\u2019s degree in music/conducting. I was part of a community orchestra in a small city near where I lived and the guy that conducted it had a general degree in music but that was not one of the requirements. We started with a jazz band. The guy that ran it knew the mayor and was able to get approval to start a city funded band, and then another guy that played in it was able to get approval for a city funded symphonic band, but not specifically because he had a degree. I\u2019ve also been part of other bands and orchestras ranging from community bands to church orchestras and the conductors had varying levels of experience and education. In general of course, the person will have to have a basic understanding of music and conducting in order to be able to do the job. ",
