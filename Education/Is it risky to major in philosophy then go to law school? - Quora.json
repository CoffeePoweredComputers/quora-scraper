            "answer_text": "There are two ways to interpret your question:   1.  Given that I intend to go to law school, is it risky to major in philosophy?  Or  2.  Given the range of alternatives to either, is it risky to major in philosophy then go to law school? As others have said, the answer to the first interpretation is:  it's not risky.  I'll echo the choir, that nothing you do in undergrad will substantively prepare you for law school.  If anything, a philosophy degree will inure you to the seemingly endless academic pontifications that some law school classes engage in.  (Whether or not either the philosophy degree or those academic pontifications prepare you for the practice of law is another story.) As for the second question, I cannot overstate the inherent risk of going to law school (regardless of one's academic major).  It has been covered in great depth elsewhere, but the upshot is that (a) law school costs to much, (b) the curriculum is out of touch with skills needed to practice law, and (c) admissions are way out of sync with job market realities.   In more detail, I recommend looking at a blog called Inside the Law School Scam, written by law school professor Paul Campos.  He put it succinctly in his pseudo-farewell post:   \"19 months and 499 posts later, it turns out that the core message of this blog \u2013 that legal academia is operating on the basis of an unsustainable economic model, which requires most law students to borrow more money to get law degrees than it makes sense for them to borrow, given their career prospects, and that for many years law schools worked hard, wittingly or unwittingly, to hide this increasingly inconvenient truth from both themselves and their potential matriculants \u2013 has evolved from a horrible heresy to something close to conventional wisdom.\" (I say pseudo-farewell, because he still updates infrequently.  But it's always informative.) Whether it's at this blog or elsewhere, seriously consider going to law school.  Weigh what it costs -- both in terms of tuition and opportunity cost -- vs. the next best alternative.  Compute how long it takes to \"turn the corner,\" if ever.  By that, I mean:  suppose you decide to major in philosophy and teach high school, or be a waiter/waitress, or be a plumber, etc.  Let's say your next best alternative would earn you a $50K /yr salary for the first 5 years, then a $70K/yr salary for the next 5.  In law school, you'd take on roughly $150-200K in debt over three years, then expect to earn a certain salary.  In order to earn more in your first year out of law school vs. our hypothetical next best alternative, you'd have to earn about $300K -- you'd have to cover the law school debt of $150K, plus three years of a $50K salary.  Okay, there aren't a lot of $300K/yr jobs available to recent law school grads.  Run the number for turning that corner in your second year.  Your third.  Fourth? For a lucky few, there are big firm jobs with starting salaries at about $160K (and rise about $20K/year/year).  The likelihood of getting such jobs are very small.  The average starting salary for lawyers, if memory serves, is closer to about $80K.   It takes a long time to financially justify law school on that pace. ",

            "answer_text": "Risky in what way? I\u2019ve often echoed the sentiments I see expressed here, to the effect that your undergraduate major has no effect on getting into law school. But I think I see a slightly different question being addressed: what major will make you more comfortable BEING in law school? For that I would say one of the disciplines which I privately classify as \u201ctalking and not doing.\u201d These include English \u2014 maybe the BEST preparaton for law school, since a J.D. is hardly more than a glorified English degree, IMHO, \u2014 at least IN ONE SENSE. (Now you spend your time reading and interpreting cases, rather than stories.) Others are Philosophy, Political Science, History, etc., etc., \u2014 disciplines where you are simply expected to talk a good game. It takes a much smarter person to actual make things work \u2014 make a computer do EXACTLY what you want it to do with complete accuracy, make a blueprint for a building that won\u2019t fall down, use math and physics to chart a correct course for a spaceship to Mars. Am I saying an auto mechanic is smarter than a B.A. in English? Maybe. The engineer who designed the engine? DEFINITELY \u2014 or at least he is using more of his brain. So if you are one of those people \u2014 Mathematician, Physicist, Engineer, Computer Wiz, etc. etc. - you may find law school a little frustrating, because you are still looking for a definite answer - an answer that is obviously correct - an answer that makes things work \u2014- and there isn\u2019t any. There is just your argument vs. the next guy or girl\u2019s argument. In an environment where all the answers are somewhat arbitrary, you are no smarter than the B.A. in Basket Weaving, because he/she can talk about Equal Protection just as well as you can \u2014 as well as lots of people can. Besides, science majors \u2014 you maybe not be used to being called on at random and presenting the facts to a room full of 100 people, while the Prof publicly feels out the facts you didn\u2019t bother to memorize because nobody would ask. So for you MD\u2019s and nuclear physicists out there who got the the bug to attend in your head somehow \u2014 law school can be tough \u2014 partly because you are so smart. ",
