            "answer_text": "Personally, I prefer traditional school. Now for those who prefer online school, just hear me out. Online school is great because it\u2019s easier to work at your own pace, you can sleep in a little, and you can stay home. But it\u2019s just not my preferred way of schooling.  I like being in a classroom environment with a teacher and classmates. I like being able to have a teacher explain and teach lessons in person rather than watching a video lesson. I like being able to socialize with people in my classes and work on group projects together in person. I\u2019m mostly a kinesthetic learner, so I like being able to do things physically and being in an actual school environment just seems to help with my ability to understand things.  I also like being able to spend lunch with friends and actually see other people in person. I hate facetiming or texting people, and I avoid it unless I have no other way of communicating with people. Also, some classes are difficult to do from home or online, and are definitely not the same as doing them in class. Take Phys Ed for example. A lot of the things we do in phys ed are team games, or require equipment, like for weight training. From home, you are very limited on what activities you can do. You can still do some exercises, but you can\u2019t do anything like team sports activities or anything that requires equipment that you wouldn\u2019t generally have at home. So yeah, I prefer traditional school, but online school is still great, it\u2019s just not for me. . \u2665\ufe0fYour daily dose of fake edginess\u2665\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Every online class is run differently, but in most cases, it is much easier to schedule your classes around the rest of your day when you go to school virtually. Campus-based courses require that you attend class a certain number of times every week, at specific times. That might mean changing your work schedule or having to hire a babysitter. Online classes sometimes require that you attend scheduled meetings in chat rooms, but in many cases, you can work the virtual classes into your schedule whenever you want. This provides flexibility for you to be able to work toward your degree on your own time, at your own pace. Another important factor to consider is how quickly you are hoping to finish your degree. An associate\u2019s degree typically takes about two years to complete, while a bachelor\u2019s degree takes about four. Keep in mind that these time-frames are based on attending courses full time, which usually means taking at least 12 credit hours per semester. For students who work full time or who have other obligations, an online forum allows the flexibility of being able to take on more coursework each semester without the burden of sitting through classes at set times every day. Interaction You do get to interact with other students at both online and offline universities. It\u2019s a common misconception that students who go to school online never talk with other students or their professors. Your social interactions with students and professors depend on your own habits. If you want to have social relationships with others in your program, you\u2019ll have to reach out in the same way as you would if you had just met someone in a classroom. You\u2019ll interact with other students through VoIP, chat rooms, and email, and your professors are available to help you through the material, just as you\u2019d find at a typical campus college. With many online degree programs, you will find that they offer multiple campus locations as well as student centers in order to provide students with access to professors and advisers if they need face-to-face communication. These programs are designed to help set students up for success by ensuring they have access to any people or resources they may need throughout their education. Resources At an online college, the resources you get will be slightly different than the resources that will be available to you at a traditional campus college. Online schools are less expensive, partly because you don\u2019t have to pay for facilities such as gyms, libraries, dining halls, and residence halls. If you want these to be part of your college experience, you may want to consider attending a brick-and-mortar school. Although, attending an online school does not necessarily mean you won\u2019t have access to these amenities; many brick-and-mortar institutions offer online programs and allow those students access to the same resources as traditional students. And many online programs also have campus locations that can offer you similar amenities. Most online colleges also provide access to virtual libraries, and some even have partnerships with local facilities, so you still have access to the tools you need to be a successful student. Both an accredited online college and a traditional campus college will provide you with the education you need to excel in your field. One style of learning is not necessarily better than the other; the key is to pick the type of program that works best for you, your lifestyle, and your schedule. Factors to Consider With an Online Education Accreditation: Accreditation means that the college or university has met all of the necessary requirements to prove academic excellence through their curriculum, faculty, facilities, and overall competency. Accreditation is what makes your degree valid; any learning institution that is not properly accredited is not credible or recognized as a reputable school. When you are researching online programs, this is the most important factor to look into if you want your degree to be accepted by future employers.Cost: Getting the most value for your dollar is important, so shopping around for a program that fits your budget is essential. The upside to online programs, aside from the flexibility they offer, is that generally speaking, they are more affordable than brick-and-mortar institutions. Many even offer convenient payment plans in order to help break up the cost.Available Financial Aid: Even at a lower cost, it can be difficult for some students to afford to pay for college; looking into various forms of financial aid can help alleviate some of that burden. You should check with potential schools to find out if they offer grants, scholarships, loans, work-study programs, or any other forms of aid. A great place to start if you are interested in applying for financial aid is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.Courses Offered: Not all online schools are created equal; newer programs may not offer the courses or degree plan you need. Before committing to an online school, you want to make sure that they offer what you are looking for. For brick-and-mortar institutions that offer online programs, another option is taking part of your coursework online and part on-campus if the courses are not all offered in a virtual setting.Graduation Rate: This is another important factor that should weigh into your decision. Knowing what percentage of students who graduate from a particular school can tell you many things. This number calculates the total number of degree-seeking students compared to the percentage of those students who graduate. Low graduation and retention rates could be caused by the lack of support a school provides. Be sure to thoroughly research any potential schools to ensure that they have the proper tools, support, and faculty in place in order to help you succeed.",

            "answer_text": "Face-to-face classroom education has been the only way to attend classes for thousands of years. Now, we can take classes online. They are more attractive, convenient, and accessible. That\u2019s why I prefer them over F2F courses. It's true that some types of classes are better face-to-face, at least to some degree. For example, you can\u2019t learn to put out a fire or perform surgery without practice. It obviously depends on the sphere of activity. Here are the reasons why I prefer online to F2F classes: You can study at your own pace. While the instructor sets the deadline for completing the course, i.e., until midterm, you can choose when you study on your own. There are also some topics that are difficult to understand at first. An online course is available 24/7, so you can watch it again from the point where you get stuck and can submit some carefully thought out questions.Learn on the go. Universities post courses on online platforms, and this is the next point of convenience. It makes learning possible anywhere through your device: while commuting, in a cafe, at the university or at home on the couch. You only need an Internet connection.Fewer errors. Some courses include online simulators that allow you to make all your mistakes during the learning process, try out different scenarios (e.g., conduct an in-depth interview with possible answers from potential respondents), and see the consequences of your actions. So, when you start working, you will already have some experience and a clear understanding of the situation.Attractiveness. A person can maintain his or her focus for 20 minutes on average, and then their attention gets scattered. You often don\u2019t listen carefully if the topic isn\u2019t interesting for you. Online classes give you the opportunity to select pieces that you still have to learn and skip those you already know. Moreover, online classes are often attractively designed to keep your attention.Plus, if you want to take some extra training, getting it online will save money. Online courses give you the opportunity to learn from the best professionals and you can select the instructor based on reviews or the educational program. In-person sessions with such an instructor would require much greater effort and resources from the professor's side. So, it will be much more expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "IN AN IDEAL WORLD, if you have the money and time, nothing beats to learn something in a brick-and-mortar class from a good instructor. But that\u2019s also the problem, isn\u2019t it? What if you do not have the time or money, if you are in the wrong location and live nowhere near the campus, and if the instructor turns out to be a disaster? That\u2019s when online teaching shines. With online teaching, you usually do not need a lot of money to take the course.You can take the course whenever you want.You can take the course from any location you want.And if you do not like the instructor, you can switch to a different instructor with the click of your mouse.That actually happened to me. I took a number of online Microsoft Excel courses none of which were provided by competent instructors. But the courses were either free or I could get my money back if not satisfied. At the end of this online search, I at last found a course that was given by a dynamite Excel teacher! I couldn\u2019t be happier. I still go back and study different lessons of his course to brush up on my Excel skill set. There is also the issue of a CERTIFICATE of DIPLOMA. Most regular colleges issue diplomas or degrees that are worth something in real life and that\u2019s why they charge you an arm and a leg. But that does NOT mean that they necessarily teach a lot better than online courses. It all depends. The good news is, some employers these days are NOT looking at your diploma but your real-life skills and what you can for them. My son, for example, studied history at college but right now works as a top-notch web developer; something he was always good at. So lack of a diploma may not always be the disadvantage that you might think it is. (LET ME ADD THIS TOO \u2014 there ARE online course providers that actually issue CERTIFICATES OF COMPLETION or \u201cdiplomas\u201d of various sorts including some of the best known universities in the United States. You may check out UDACITY and COURSERA for example. And for a general list of certificate/diploma providers for technical writing programs in the United States, I recommend my comprehensive list Certificate Programs in Technical Writing & Technical Communication | Technical Communication Center) ",

            "answer_text": "Though I accept that an being in a classroom is \u201cbetter\u201d in several ways than online, there are several advantages to online learning: Online courses allow you to study at your own pace and schedule. This is of particular importance to adult learners. I have done a number of courses on edX by doing my lessons before work or on weekends. Single parents and working adults would have access to education in cases where they might of been able to afford school, but just didn\u2019t have the time or circumstances.It is far less expensive to deliver. If all state universities had to have 100% of all classroom work online, it would move us closer to having universal education without the sword-fights over funding. It would even benefit in resident students, as if they miss a few classes due to the flu, they would have an easy way to make up the difference.It eliminates the scheduling issues that some students have, when they need a class but it\u2019s \u201cfull,\u201d or on the opposite end, it does not run due to too few students signing up (I had that occur to me, as I was a part-time student going to night school. Some courses ran only once a year.) One aspect it eliminates is the EEOC issues. Colleges now have to limit admissions by being selective. In many cases they use criteria other than test scores in an attempt to \u201clevel\u201d the playing field. The point here is with being online, not being able to attend the classroom version is \u201cnot the end of the world\u201d if you don't get accepted. If your test scores qualified you to attend, then you get to attend one way or another. Note I consider \u201cdistance learning\u201d were you watch & listen to classroom instruction in real-time to be pretty much \u201ccampus schooling\u201d last: I realize some programs have lab requirements. That would have to be worked out, but I see it as doable. However, if we free up some resources with many student opting for online options, even by choice due to the convenience factor, then the classes that absolutely require attendance would benefit. Edit: One extra point to those who think online is a step down from a classroom, just remember that many first-year students are taught in this format:  I\u2019m not sure how those people in the back row benefit anymore than someone watching via a webcam, or watching even a week later.

            "answer_text": "I suggest you for this online courses just google search as \"Zoe Talent Solutions\". All of this means that students, from working professionals to recent high school graduates, find many reasons to take all or some of their courses online. The following list includes 10 advantages to online learning.  Variety of programs and courses: From traditional four-year universities to completely online career colleges, higher education today offers a variety of options for students. This means that no matter what students study, from nursing to neuroscience, they can find the courses or programs they need online. Students can also earn every academic degree online, from a career certificate to a doctorate.Lower total costs: Online programs prove a more affordable option than traditional colleges. Though not all online degrees offer less expensive net tuition prices than traditional colleges, associated expenses almost always cost less. For example, there are no commuting costs, and sometimes required course materials, such as textbooks, are available online at no cost. In addition, many colleges and universities accept credits earned via free massive open online courses (MOOCs), the most recent advance in online education. These free online courses can help students fulfill general education requirements.More comfortable learning environment: Commercials that feature online students studying in their pajamas only skims the surface of one of the benefits of online education: no physical class sessions. Students listen to lectures and complete assignments sent to them electronically, with no need to fight traffic, leave work early for class, or miss important family time.Convenience and flexibility: Online courses give students the opportunity to plan study time around the rest of their day, instead of the other way around. Students can study and work at their convenience. Course material is always accessible online, making special library trips unnecessary. All of these benefits help students balance work and family commitments with their education.More interaction and greater ability to concentrate: While contradictory evidence about the rate of online student participation versus participation in traditional courses exists, one thing remains certain: Online courses offer shy or more reticent students the opportunity to participate in class discussions more easily than face-to-face class sessions. Some students even report better concentration in online classes due to the lack of classroom activity.Career advancement: Students can take online courses and even complete entire degrees while working, while in-between jobs, or while taking time to raise a family. This academic work will explain any discontinuity or gaps in a resume as well. Also, earning a degree can show ambitiousness to prospective employers and a desire to remain informed and prepared for new challenges.Continue in your profession: Even if someone wants to complete a degree, it may not mean they want to leave their current job. For most students today, increasing college costs mandate that some students continue working while in school. The previously mentioned flexibility of online programs enable students to keep working while also pursuing academic credentials.Avoid commuting: During snowstorms and thunderstorms, colleges may cancel classes to avoid putting commuting students at risk of dangerous driving conditions. Rather than miss important class sessions, students in online courses can always \u201cattend\u201d by participating in discussion boards or chat sessions, turning in their work on time, and watching lectures or reading materials. Many students also find substantial savings on fuel costs with no commute for classes.Improve your technical skills: Even the most basic online course requires the development of new computer skills, as students learn to navigate different learning management systems (LMS) and programs. The participation skills students learn within their online courses translate to many professions, including creating and sharing documents, incorporating audio/video materials into assignments, completing online training sessions, etc. Some schools even offer students free laptops or iPads.Transfer credits: For college students who want to attend summer classes, but live too far from their colleges and/or work summer jobs, taking online classes from an accredited college and transferring the credits to their primary college can be beneficial. Students can earn college credit while still enjoying their summer vacation or fulfilling the responsibilities of their seasonal employment. Similarly, if a college or university does not offer enough open sections of a required course, students can take the course online at another college and transfer the credits.",

            "answer_text": "Two decades or so ago, opinions like these were common: \u201cHow can people buy things online? You can never match the experience of shopping in stores!\u201d \u201cIs it safe to bank online? Nothing can ever match the high street banking experience!\u201d \u201cWhere can you get good study/reference materials? A library, any day!\u201d You get the idea. Online coaching is great. Once you overcome the resistance to change (which BTW is strong, given that learning as we know it in schools and colleges is usually in classrooms), you will realize that online learning is a convenience that you cannot allow yourself to miss. The best part of online learning is that it gives you the chance to attend classes by the best teachers. You no longer need to fret that your city or coaching center does not have that amazing prof you had heard about! In some answers to this question, the respondents have said that with online coaching, you need a lot more sincerity and commitment to learn as compared to offline. I disagree. If you aren't motivated enough, attending a class isn't going to make you more so. :)  If you are motivated enough, online coaching won't hold you back. In fact, you can learn anytime you please, at the pace you want. You can even choose the topic for the day's class based on what you are in the mood to learn. As to participating in class and getting doubts cleared, we tend to view traditional classrooms through rose-tinted glasses when thinking of these things. A good teacher paces himself to address the slightly-below average student in a class. You are forced to go with this flow whether you understand the concept in the first minute or remain clueless even after the class is over. And a vast majority of students hesitate to ask doubts that seem \"silly\". With online coaching, you can rewind the class as many times as you like and raise doubts without worrying about how it make you look in front of classmates! This is not to say all classroom learning is bad\u2014just that there are two sides to the same coin! Online coaching is also priced way lower than classroom coaching. Of course, not all online coaching is created equal. A good teacher is a good teacher, whether he/she teaches online or in a class! The converse too is true. So, you need to choose the online course carefully. So, read reviews of the course online. Also, go with the courses that allow you to sample a part of the actual course before you buy. Nothing like first-hand experience to help you make up your mind! All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m one person who had benefited from both traditional classes and online classes at various stages of my academic life. I\u2019ll explain my preference among these at various stages of life with reasons and my gains. Is online better than traditional classes? From knowledge transfer perspective, it is a concrete \u2018yes\u2019. But, will I suggest online classes for schools and undergraduate courses? A big \u2018No\u2019. Under the present situation of pandemic when schools and colleges are shifting to online mode at least on a temporary basis, this question is of prime value! As a school child, many of us won\u2019t have clear aims in life and it would be very difficult to develop interest in studies without an aim! Then how did you manage to develop interest during your childhood? I\u2019ll point out few that helped in my case: 1. I used to like science period just because my teacher used to take us out and teach us by showing small experiments in the open. 2. I liked Malayalam period for the stories my teacher used to tell us while teaching. 3. There was an issue in saying \u2018no\u2019 to a teacher whom I got personally attached with. So I had to do home works or tasks given by that teacher without any excuses. 4. Good vibes of receiving appreciation in front of the class on good performances and the fear of insult on bad performances used to provide some extra fuel. These are some indirect ways in which we develop the habit of learning and these things happen better in traditional schooling than online classes. This is just one part of the gains of traditional education during school days. I\u2019ll show the other part now: You may have good subject knowledge and ideas to develop new stuffs, but you will also need to convey your ideas and developments to the world so as to succeed. You will need confidence, presentation skills and interpersonal skills. Traditional schools help in this by providing opportunities to take part in cultural events and literary events from very young age. Every time you step onto the stage, you\u2019ll come back with a bag full of confidence and positivity. I remember my teachers dedicating good amount of their time in preparing us for different events at school. During those seasons, our English teacher used to turn to a Drama teacher, Malayalam teacher to a Dance teacher and so on.  One moment from my school days that I\u2019ll always remember is of my teacher interrupting me in the middle of examination at school during my 12th std and taking me to the designated centre in our district for registering my performance in district level arts fest and completing procedures for participating in state level fest. Online classes that focus just on improving subject knowledge won\u2019t even think of something like that, especially in 12th std. Can you guess what the item was? Essay writing English! Today ,when I look back, I realise that those were the stepping stones because of which I\u2019m even writing this! I will anyway write board exam and once I do well there, no one will ask me about my score in mid-terms. But I would never have had the experience of fest had I missed it there. Then comes sports. Back then, I was fat and short, and my chances of winning a running race or long jump on sports day were meagre (you can say zero). Still, the appreciation that I got from school somehow made me believe that I had good chances of winning and I used to hopefully participate in not just one, but 4-5 events one after the other. No one ever discouraged me saying that there is no point in my running! Once, my teachers had even kept me in relay team seeing my excitement. That is the only trophy in running competition that I got in my school life. (for 3rd place because there were only 3 relay teams). I was anyway not a top contender, but I used to stay so excited that I would take just a bite on food so as to satisfy my mom and hurry up to sports ground. As expected, at the end of the day I would end up winning no event but totally exhausted as if I\u2019ve performed so much! Many years forward, today, I find the same enthusiasm when I attend gym or play games and I get good results this time. Now I find running so easy and I do better than most others. The initial ignition created by traditional schooling helped me!  Coming to college life, this is an undergraduate course and you need to gain decent subject knowledge. Why do I still suggest traditional college life over online classes? Here is the reason - Before college, you are controlled in some way by one person or the other. After college, you will get into situations where you can\u2019t afford to experiment. It\u2019s the college where you get to experiment and learn life skills! Here you get situations to put skills that you gained from school into practice and develop them from real world perspective. My college offered me enough opportunities to participate, plan and organize different events. I got to develop my ideas, create events, do good team work, improve my communication and interpersonal skills, meet many successful personalities and make good use of it!  Now, let\u2019s discuss about the phase of my life where online classes came to my rescue: This was the stage after my college life when I had started working. I developed some genuine interest in gaining subject knowledge and wanted to get master degree from the best possible institute. Now, my only aim is to gain enough knowledge and expertise in Computer Science so as to score as high as possible in GATE and I had no need to develop extra-curricular skills or personality traits from GATE coaching. All that I wanted was to get coached by the best teacher! Here, online class was a clear winner. Pros: 1. I can attend online classes taken by the teacher of my choice \u2013 I\u2019ll surely pick the one whom I think is the best! 2. No time wastage in commute, no time wastage in waiting for classes to start. 3. I needed the teacher to be available at my comfort as I have to attend office during office hours. When classes are online, I can watch whenever I\u2019m free as they are recorded. 4. No classroom etiquette to be followed. I can be on my own! 5. Can learn when in mood, can take a nap and get up fresh when sleepy. 6. I can control video speed. I no more need to wait for the teacher. I can choose the fastest possible speed for my comfort and save time. 7. I can re-play any part that I find tough to grasp. In regular class, teacher can\u2019t repeat for every single student. 8. No disturbance. I can sit and watch lectures in a peaceful environment with no disturbance at all. Cons: Just one \u2013 instant doubt clearance is not possible as videos are recorded. I think this one factor is worth compromising given that you have enough pros! This time, classes were 100% dedicated on providing me subject knowledge and I got well in sync with it. I put in some decent efforts and ended up being All India 39th rank holder.  Conclusion \u2013 Online class is clear winner coming to transfer of subject knowledge given that the student is self-motivated and doesn\u2019t need lab or other facilities to proceed. I will surely recommend online classes if you are in this solely for gaining subject knowledge. Coming to schools and undergraduates, traditional classes will always be my pick as compromising a bit in knowledge gain is worth as you\u2019ll get to learn enough life skills! ",

            "answer_text": "Your question is very broad. For most students I would say no. That\u2019s especially true for the youngest students. However, for some students it can be better. And with COVID-19 numbers what they are in some areas, it is better than spreading the virus in schools. Some things really are the lesser of evils. How effective online learning is depends in part on the age and development of the student. Young kids do not learn best online. There is no such thing as a \u201crobust\u201d kindergarten curriculum online. Human connection is vital, either with a teacher or parent. There are quality online courses for older students, high school and college, but I don\u2019t think anything replaces good in person discussion and debate. Being online is fine, but you never know when mom is sitting beside her child prompting him. As students get older, they need to learn to function in a group and independently. A lot of good can be said for learning independently. But it isn\u2019t always better than learning with others. We are still social beings. I\u2019ve taken online college courses, and in general I would prefer in person course work. It\u2019s harder to motivate online, there\u2019s no human connection,. I find it more difficult. But that\u2019s not to say that for some people and for some subjects it doesn\u2019t work. It would not work well for a lab science, but it can work well for a history or English course. So there\u2019s your answer, maybe, sometimes, but not always. ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to learning, both types of learning are equally important whether it is online learning or traditional learning. The end goal here is to get a solid understanding of the topic. There are some students who can learn more effectively with the help of a visual medium rather than a theoretical means of learning. These students love online learning as a wonderful means of learning. Why people are inclined towards Online Learning? As we all are facing the problems caused by COVID-19 which causes schools to shut down the only mode of learning that we can have right now is Online learning. It is the best and most safer option to practice amidst the Corona Virus outbreak. It is a cost-effective and good option that enhances the overall learning experiences of the kids. The best thing about online learning is that all the things which are discussed are well documented on the internet in a dedicated platform and the student can refer to these documents anytime he/she has any type of doubt using the internet. For example, let us assume the teacher has given a lecture on the Binomial theorem and the student has missed that lecture. Then he can access the recorded session of the teacher from the learning platform and learn about the concept easily.  Why Traditional learning is useful? The traditional learning is the oldest form of learning. It is still practiced in most of the school and is considered as the most wonderful way of Student-Teacher interaction on a personal level. With the help of Face-to-Face teaching, the teacher can track the student activities and their behavior more easily. For Example, If a teacher is delivering a lecture on Ohm\u2019s law he notices the child\u2019s body language to judge whether the student is understanding the topic or not. If the student is yawning and talking with friends then the teacher can easily detect this behavior and ask the child to focus. This type of behavior tracking for each individual student is not possible for the teacher. In traditional learning, teachers are aware of the individual students' abilities and learning pace thus they prepare the chapter accordingly so that each person can fully understand the topic. Which one to choose- Online Education Vs Traditional Education? Both of these are wonderful learning options if we combine both of these then we will get an even more effective learning technique in the form of Blended learning which is a combination of both Face-to-Face learning along with online education that will complement each other. Conclusion Thus, Blended learning is the most effective option to choose as a learning model that has the functionalities of both. Thanks for reading my answer! Stay Healthy, Stay Inside! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cStudying online\u201d is a very, very broad term. Studying online could refer to a MOOC, to reading a textbook online, to taking a college course online, to studying one-on-one with a tutor online. Some online options may be better than \u201cregular\u201d classes, whereas others will be worse. Of course, this also depends on the quality of the class as well as the individual learner or student. I can speak on this topic from my own research and experience to do with online tutoring - specifically, one-on-one, face-to-face tutoring in an interactive digital classroom. For a lot of students, this is the solution they need. In a \u201cregular\u201d class, they get divided attention from an instructor who\u2019s attempting to pace a lesson for 30 students who all learn at different speeds and to appeal to the learning styles of 30 unique students, each with their own learning goals and challenges. If the pace and methods of the teacher don\u2019t work for them, the best option is to fill gaps with undivided attention from a professional tutor. Now, you\u2019re probably saying to yourself, \u201cSure, but why can\u2019t that tutor be a regular in-person tutor?\u201d Fair point. Sure, they could be a regular in-person tutor, but an in-person tutor simply cannot beat the online alternative for the following reasons (these reasons refer to credible online tutoring companies and use Skooli as an example): Online tutors are more affordableOnline tutors are more accessibleOnline tutors are background and criminal record checkedOnline tutors need to have professional qualificationsOnline tutoring sessions are recorded and can be rewatched laterOnline tutoring sessions can be attended from home or on-the-goOnline tutors can be located anywhere; students aren\u2019t restricted to the teaching capabilities of local in-person tutorsIf you need extra help with your academics, try online tutoring with Skooli.

            "answer_text": "Both have their pros and cons. Classroom Learning Pros: Physical student-teacher interaction; it is easier to understand the student\u2019s expressions, concentration, and understanding levels Cons: Unneeded distractions and deliberate class disruptions; if there\u2019s a fest going on, then concentration is shot; a need for commute which means less time for class; not all have the same level of processing complex information so it is difficult to maintain the level of understanding Online Learning Pros: Self-paced; more engaging with new tech and SMART classrooms; affordable with low-cost investment; no need for commute - learn anywhere; transferable knowledge; low distractions and greater concentration; no time wastage Cons: Bandwidth and connectivity issues; requires active internet; low understanding of student\u2019s expressions and problem points; never know who\u2019s actually listening and who\u2019s ditched the class Based on the above, I\u2019d say online learning is a tad better because students can understand the concepts at their own pace without hindering the rest; it is also much more affordable than classroom learning - you\u2019ve got comfortable surroundings, no need to spend on travel, learn anytime, anywhere, and the knowledge is applicable in real-life scenarios - overall bonus points. The cons - bandwidth issues and other technical errors are fixable; as for students ditching, well those who want to learn, they do learn, the rest can be properly motivated by incentives ;) So yeah, online is the way to go. I\u2019d recommend Coursera and Edu4sure as staring points - the platforms are comprehensive, structured, have millions of courses both basic and advanced. Edu4sure also provides 1-on-1 mentoring in doubt sessions and both have comparable price points. Hope this helps you out. Happy learning! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I started my online tuition program 3 years back. I was immensely surprised by the convenience it offered as a tutor and so were my students. It saves a lot of time, as compared to conventional classes. Conventional tuitions or coaching centers are at city centers usually and commuting is a matter of concern for students who stay at remote places.There is a wider set of tutors available online. You can choose among the tutors whom you are comfortable with in terms of quality and level of teaching which suits you. So it\u2019s not as generic as a conventional class, which is meant for a wide range of students from different background.The one to one or group classes (conferencing) have its difference in the individual attention for students. A live discussion forum is the new combined study.In this era of e-learning, online resources should be expoloited to the maximum. Online classes and lectures are in abundance and will replace tuitions and postal coaching completely in the near future.Tests, assignments and evaluation could be done online. There is no loss of report and analysis is simpler. Parents can also access the performance reports online.There are online teaching platforms for school/graduate levels or anyone for that matter, who wants to pick up a hobby or a foreign language. You get professional people across the globe to choose from.As a tutor anyone can hone their teaching skills via online classes. Remember teaching is a noble way to learn too. :)",

            "answer_text": "Why online courses are better than classroom Coaching for JEE 1. Selection of right teacher for you in Coaching is not possible for you. But in online learning you will buy course only after seeing his demo lectures. In big Coaching institutes, all teachers are not equally good so there is possibility that you don't get appropriate faculty for you. 2. Cost friendly If you go for classroom learning you have to pay between 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh rupees as Coaching fees for two year Coaching . Also you have to spend another 2.5 lakh rupees for your stay in other city as hostel charges and mess charges. Overall expenses are between 5 to 6 lakhs of rupees. This cost is too high. Also you don't have any guarantee that you will get equally good faculties in all three subject in your coaching. So. Majority of students are not selected in jee advanced (~80%). Around 45 % of students are not able to clear jee main Exam. If a student stays in his home city and read NCERT books thoroughly along with online coaching. He will Definitely clear JEE main. Sometimes he feels so low in confidence because he is not getting good faculties in Coaching and this effects his jee mains results also. . Now we campare online coaching, there are many good teachers some of them are IITians and having experience of teaching in big institute of Kota. At Nucleon, we provide all three PCM course of 11 and 12 th at only approx 50000 cost which is only 10 % of the fees of classroom Coaching . 3 Time saving Students have to invest, their daily one hour extra as travel time to Coaching. In online learning he don't need to go anywhere. He can learn from his home. 4. Very effective for revision and for Backup. If a student misses class at Coaching he has no back up. He has to take class notes of other student and has to study by his own. But in online learning all lectures are with him all the time so no worry to miss anything . If a student want to revise whole topic he may watch video again and again. But in classroom Coaching, he has no facility to attend a batch again for revision. 5. More concentration In online coaching you study with more concentration as there is no disturbance due to noise created by other students. 6. Rewind faculty If you feel that a particular concept is not understood by you, he may watch again. But in classroom you can not do it 7. No home sickness You can prepare online for Exam from your home and you don't need to go to any other place. There are chances that living alone in other city, away from parents, student get depressed or he may join bad company, if there is no supervision of parents. In online there are no such risks of deviation from study. ",

            "answer_text": "Before choosing one among online training or classroom training you must know about the difference and perspectives of both processes. Because choosing one might be easier when you have knowledge about both, depict some features and let\u2019s discuss the differences first. The online training Online training simply means learning with the help of devices and software at your place without moving anywhere. The online training program provided by the reputed educational app development company, includes the content that can be in any form like images, infographics, ppt, animated videos, video lectures, digital content as text and voices, etc. these all are the content managed as online study material for the student. Various fonts and strategies used in online mentoring is a very smart way of learning any time comfortably. Learning with the help of native software is very interesting and enhances the interaction with learning in the student. As we are entering to the technical world so the student is more curious about technology and this makes them education loving and tech-savvy. The classroom training Classroom training simply means teaching a student in a physical presence. A Major feature with this is that the student has to move to the classroom first am then it studies simply as the teacher teaches. Other aspects are very simple to depict that is the convenience in tutoring is not modifiable. Some students are curious about studies and some are not this creates a messy environment that leads to disturbance. Likewise, this is a direct loss of study. By having a look at the study patterns and facility opted in online as well as classroom training program it might have gone very clear to you. That both are the platforms are accessible and not bad. But the main questions come to choose the better one out of two right options. ",

There would be more possibilities during the class, and we will probably be more focused. For example, when you stay in a classroom, there would be seldom thing bothering you. While you have the class online, many people will do it in home. It may be easier to be bothered by so many things. Yet sometimes you won't have lots of free time. Online class is more flexible on time and place. After we have started to work,our time would be a little restricted. Online class is more convenient in most of the cases. And there is a nonnegligible problem. Light restrictions of online class will require strong self-discipline to guarantee you can alway follow you goal along the classes. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve taught for over 40 years in a program at Southern Methodist University\u2019s engineering school that has both on line and in-class students. My observation is that some students work best with one and some best with the other. My teaching style has adapted to fit both. On line students have some major advantages: time shifting (they can watch lectures at their own convenience) and space shifting (they can be where they are rather than going to a classroom) are two of the biggest. This has helped immensely, for example, with students who are in the military or who work for a company whose facilities are not near a campus. But they must also have more discipline - nobody forces them to pay attention, for example. In class students have advantages as well, such as an easier time asking questions of the professor and communication with others in the classroom. In short, it\u2019s not one size fits all. Note also that not all on line programs are well thought out. Having taught in this mode for over 40 years, I\u2019ve learned to make a lot of important changes to how I do things. A lot of what I see at some on line schools is pretty poor in terms of adapting to the needs of the on line students. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on your work ethic, schedule, and personal preference. I personally know that I would not function well on online school because I get distracted easily while doing schoolwork (I\u2019m supposed to be studying right now). I prefer the challenge and focus of an actual school. I can also take more challenging classes in school that you can\u2019t take online. I would get very bored and lonely without all the friends I see at school daily. I have a friend, however, who does school online and loves it. She can work at her own pace and participate in theater outside of school that she would have to miss a lot of school for. She also can work during the day, which her employer loves. She can go into school to work whenever she wants if she needs help from a teacher. She prefers this by far, but I do not think I would. Some people work better in front of a computer, and others work better in an actual classroom setting. Make sure you take your work ethic into consideration when making this decision. If you want to do other things during the day, it may be a good option. You can always do a year of online school and go back to public school if you don't like schooling online or vice versa. Best of luck in your decision! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say it depends on your goals. Both online courses and university courses can provide awesome instruction in just about any field. If you want to learn something quickly and cheaply, online is a great bet. If you want solid credentials and connections with professors and peers, you\u2019re better off with an actual university. You can make connections online too, but there\u2019s something to be said for getting to know people in person. I\u2019ve done a mix of both. I got a B.A. in English Literature from the University of British Columbia, which was awesome, because I read a bunch of amazing books I never would have read otherwise, and I learned a whole new way of thinking. I got a Master\u2019s in Journalism from Carleton University, which gave me a lot of hands-on, practical training and difficult but valuable feedback on my work. I also made some great friends there. The combination of those two degrees eventually led me into a solid career (which I later abandoned to write full-time) as a consultant for advertising agencies. The not-so-awesome part was the $40,000 debt I walked away with. Since then, I\u2019ve taken online courses in writing and business, and learned a ton of useful stuff for only a few hundred bucks. I don\u2019t regret having earned my degrees, though. Some jobs demand university credentials and other ones don\u2019t, so I\u2019d suggest looking into the requirements for what you want to do. ",

            "answer_text": "official post as Online education vs Offline education Which is the better option? Online education vs Offline education Which is the better option?  online class  The Corona epidemic has forced us to embrace online education. Over the last few months, we have become acquainted with many different types of technology that we never even dreamed of. Due to the proliferation of the Internet, we used to use a lot of technology for the purpose of education, but now that schools have been completely closed for a long time, we have to raise virtual classes from school to university level. We have been involved with classroom education for decades, so it is often natural to compare the two methods. Right? While both methods have their strengths, they also have their weaknesses. So let\u2019s understand a little bit about both methods. Distance: Does not matter  Distance Does not matter The biggest question in offline education is to be present on the spot. At the school level, this question may not come up but at the university level this type, of course, comes up when certain types of courses are being conducted in certain universities. There are many problems in moving from one place to another then there can be an economic problem and also a social problem. And perhaps the strongest aspect of online education is that the question of distance is now a thing of the past. Sitting anywhere, a person can connect himself to the classroom with a single link. The only condition is that there should be an internet connection. Read also - Expectations form the parents while online education Study on your time.  study on your time We are all so badly arranged in the frame of 8 hours that we know that time has been accepted by God. Getting into the habit of working with a timetable is not possible for everyone. And you don't need to want to study only from 9 to 12 in the morning. When it comes to learning, school is probably over. While in online education a student can study at that time. It is not bound by any kind of time constraint. One can walk in one's own time instead of walking with time. Tools limitations?  tools When teaching in a classroom, only the four walls of the classroom remain the limit. Rarely does a teacher try to get out of those walls? You can teach students through textbooks and maps. While online classes provide you with more than one tool. From animation videos to PowerPoint presentations, a great blog can be shared that allows students to learn from quality references. Time to react  quick reaction There is a kind of eye-contact between the teacher and the students when the student is in the classroom so that the teacher understands what is being taught in the classroom from the reaction of the students whereas in online learning the teacher rarely pays attention. Can give whether the student knows what is being explained or not. Online platforms often have a polling facility that allows them to answer immediately as they have to answer in hundreds of calculations so that the student does not know whether he understands it or not. Recording lectures facility This is one of the limitations of offline lectures. Once a chapter has been explained by the teacher, then again the same lectures, if one has to organize, a lot of limitations arise. Even online platforms facilitate the recording of lectures. Due to which if a person is absent due to circumstances or if a person finds the subject matter of the lectures difficult, then that person can understand it again. Read about - What is new normal? Limitations on extracurricular activities  Extra activities The biggest advantage of classroom education is that it emphasizes extracurricular activities as well as learning so that students can develop other skills as well, while the online system places great limits on extracurricular activities. Which prevents students from developing other skills along with learning. Which is the biggest drop back of online learning. Development of group spirit  group activity Since online education is individual, most young children do not develop a sense of community. Being in a group is also an art. From which a lot can be learned but only small children studying on-screen cannot learn this art which sometimes makes them feel like they are missing a lot in life. Network Issues  Network issues In the same way that offline education is related to the classroom, the network is a basic condition for online education. In developing countries, online education is possible for people living in cities when network facilities have not reached every citizen but efforts are being made to make it not yet possible for people living in rural areas but this is not an easy task. Yes, data has become very cheap in India but has not yet become ubiquitous. Thus, on both sides, there are advantages and disadvantages, but in the current situation, online education is the only way to prevent the transition to corona.

Image source: Google I've many points to justify my opinion. Those are - 1. India has a population of 1.3 billion and 73 million people are lie in the poverty line among them. Though India offer the world's cheapest call and data package but yet it's too expensive for most of the people. People who don't know will they get to eat tomorrow or not, how they can recharge their mobile with a data pack? Do you think their children have no rights of education?  2. Everyone doesn't have broadband connection at their home. They use their mobile data to attend classes. Some of the students live in a rural areas, some in the villages so, it's very common they'll face problems regarding internet connection. They won't have interrupt free classes.  3. Suppose you're attending a meeting and abruptly a notification pops up on your screen. It's very obvious that you'll get distracted. You'll probably leave the class.  4. It's very hard to stay focused while attending a class in a small screen at home. Besides, you may not clearly understand a diagram.  Do you know what are the benefits of an offline classroom? The environment, it helps you to concentrate. You can discuss with your classmates, even solve a question together with fun. You can interact with others, learn something new. Reading books, writing from blackboard all has a different kind of fun.  And it's amazing. Nothing can replace it. ",

I assume that by \u201conline classes\u201d you mean synchronous events done through what is called a virtual classroom like Adobe Connect or Citrix GoToMeeting/Webinar as opposed to asynchronous eLearning that is self-directed online learning done at any time that is convenient for the learner. Synchronous classes have an advantage that learners don\u2019t have to travel to a specific location to attend a class. Other than that, the success of an online class is dependent completely on the participants. If the instructor just lectures with PowerPoint slides, they are no better than \u201cregular\u201d classes. If the instructor makes the presentation interactive by asking questions and using discussion, they can be very good but little different from a \u201cregular\u201d class other than the fact that students do not get to interact face-to-face. Another negative factor for online classes is that it is easier for the learner to get distracted by other things like phone messages and mind wandering. Online learners need to be very self-motivated. ",

In a good class, the students ask a lot of questions that makes the discussion vibrant, dynamic and it in courses like an MBA or a Masters it brings up interesting viewpoints and anecdotes when students who have worked previously have experiences they can share that often take things out from the realm of academic or intellectual discussion to a practical real-world application of a concept. The other aspect is where many great teachers are truly in their element when they feed off of the energy of the students in the class. I have taken an online course from my professor from college and I found a stark difference in how well he taught in the classroom. You might want to check out a compromise between the convenience of online and the above benefits of in classroom learning I mentioned. I\u2019m not sure what domain you are interested in. Here are a few examples for data science/machine learning. MIT OpenCourseWare: Audio/Video Lectures Stanford CompSc: CS 193A: Android Application Development Python for Data Science: Great Learning Academy - Course Statistics for Data Science: Great Learning Academy - Course I hope I was able to help.

            "answer_text": "As an educator, I believe that in person school is much better than online. In our current world, there is a lot of debate over this. While online schooling might be better in slowing down the transmission rate of COVID-19, I do not believe that students are learning and engaging as much as they would in the classroom. My nephew had to start his first year of school online. He had never stepped foot inside a traditional classroom before. During his zoom meetings, he zones out on the screen. He doesn\u2019t seem to be doing very well with online schooling. High school students may adapt better to online school because they are older and can ultimately do most of their work on their own. This is not the case for primary school students. In the end, each child is different. Every child learns in their own way. Some children may excel with online school, while others will not do well at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Online education is actually available in multiple forms and easily mistaken as less helpful very often . But it is extremely useful if used smartly. Let me get to some basic categories of online education - 1- Recorded videos 2- Classroom recordings 3- Personalised Videos The 1st one among the list is the most common . Every second person associated with teaching sector is doing the same thing , many have done a great work though . Basically a person sets up a camera , imagines a scene where he has few students sitting in front of him and then he delivers the lecture on board . Simple , yet ineffective and boring . Not of great help to student also. The 2nd one is a bit organised , as few institutions or startups manage to install nice cameras in 'real' classrooms of some famous teachers in kota and get their classes recorded . You see only the teacher writing on board on your screen , but the teacher is actually involved in a class with 40\u201350 students . This is a bit better than the previous case as the teacher is more dynamic and energetic in this model . Now the third and the best one . Personalised session, means you learnt or get taught precisely according to your needs . For eg you have studied a chapter at school or your coaching , but a small part of it is still not understood well , few doubts are left , few more examples are reqd etc etc . Now its only the 10\u201315% of the chater that you actually require , but if you go to previous 2 cases , it means you have study the whole chapter , get bored up and wait for your part to come . But in personalised session , you and your teacher are actually on a live 1-to-1 video call with his screen shared with you . Ask whatever you want to study or learn , in a precise time , with specific notes and questions . This model is extremely useful and effective as compared with any mode of learning , even with a potential to replace the traditional coaching models also . Thanks for reading so long .

Personally, depending upon what school you are going to and what major you are looking at, as well as the classes involved, would be my biggest issue. If you are able to take the classes online I think it\u2019s a huge plus and you should definitely do that; however, there\u2019s drawbacks that come along with it. If you\u2019re a freshman in college, those first months are extremely vital in order to learn campus norms, resources, etc. you want to know where everything is. That being said. There are many positives that go with starting online. You will certainly be saving money if you are working from home on both housing a dining; however, some institutions charge higher prices per credit hour for online classes which negate a chunk of that money saves. That\u2019s not even to mention the health concerns. If you\u2019re in an area that is extremely densely populated I wouldn\u2019t bother going on campus. There are really no benefits other than maybe making a few friends in the classes or your living space. ",

Even we at Edu4Sure, provide online training and have seen an increase in the number of enrollments.

This is because online classes are always being recorded and learners are being provided with its access.It is cost-effective as it saves the cost and time needed for travel.It also helps us to avoid travel inconveniences like bad weather and traffic jams.It helps us to concentrate due to fewer distractions.But online training has another side too due to which we cannot say that it is a better way to learn. Disadvantages of online training are: It requires a strong internet connection but poor internet connection is a common problem.It requires gadgets like smartphones or laptops and everyone does not have these gadgets.It also requires self-motivation from the student\u2019s side as online training is a little boring way because we do not have friends with whom we can make our learning fun.There are few face-to-face interactions with the trainers due to which sometimes it is difficult to make students understand complex topics.These disadvantages are overcome by classroom training. Therefore, the blend of both the way of learning can lead to effective training. ",

I dropped out if middle school halfway through the year. Although I have a little respect for those that have money,(it takes some discipline to get and keep it,) I have far more humility toward someone that has more knowledge than I do, I also have a far greater feeling of respect toward them. Social interaction is very important to some, I mean as in live conversations, or actual visuals of your classmates, but I enjoyed the text conversations I had with classmates and professor's far more. I guess it's a personal choice, if which is more enjoyable. I was there more to learn than enjoy. I ended up doing both. ",

They do offer a few advantages, but the experience that school teaches you on an ongoing basis is unmatched. The social skills that a child will learn on a daily basis, the tough experiences a child has, the lessons learnt from them, will all contribute to a better, more fully-formed human being in the future. We cannot thrive without a society and in many cases, cannot survive without one. Therefore, it is essential to learn social skills from an early age. Sitting at home for months or years, learning from a school can be detrimental for a student. That being said, an online education provider like  Online Tutoring, Homework Help and Test Prep in Math, Science, and Englishhttp://Tutor.com , Chegg.com and MySchoolPage (Personalized, One-to-One Live Online Tutoring Service For K-12 Students) actually give you the benefit of personalization, better learning of individual concepts and theories and provide the convenience of flexible scheduling of classes.

Some subject requires more face-to-face interaction between instructor and students, while others allow self learning on the part of student.

However, the same cannot be said about cooking class and dancing class where instructors must observe the student\u2019s result. In terms of learning mostly knowledge-based school subject on the other hand, a physical class works better because teacher can interact with students directly in the classroom while working with exercise. However, technology, such as hologram or virtual reality, can improve to the level where an online class feels exactly like a physical class.

First step to consider is that not one of those teachers who have taught us for centuries, have ever received any grades that are reflected in their GPA\u2019s that were called; Thinking, Thought, nor How to Think. 30 years ago we had everything for interactive education. However, imagine this?

With profitability growing, a lot of online programs appeared that basically took classroom components such as PowerPoints and lecture notes and tossed them online. Doesn\u2019t work that way, though. Each different mode of education deserves its own considerations.

That said, a bad U course might also leave things wanting at multistructural and your wallet empty. Thus the saying MOOCs haven't made education much better, rather they've made it more difficult to charge for bad education. There's no doubt you can learn a great deal, fill in a lot of gaps and raise your level of learning via self-paced learning with determination, flexibility and curiousity, i.e. seek out mentors, read books, ask yourself the complex questions, etc. But not many people have the energy or motivation to do so.

            "answer_text": "This depends on the kind of \u201ctraditional class\u201d you refer to. If it\u2019s a large lecture class with no questions, an online class can be just as (in)effective as a F2F lecture. Lectures are little better than well-written texts. Some rare professors can make large lectures an exciting experience\u2014not many do. AND let\u2019s take into account that people learn in different \u201cpreferred\u201d channels. Some people prefer to hear things to reading or \u201cseeing\u201d them. Some people cannot sit and prefer to be active while learning. Brain chemistry also filters in here. A large lecture for a person with ADHD is not the best way to \u201clearn.\u201d My experience and career has been based on case method classes which include the following: Selection of cases that present real, (not made up) business problems and end with a decision dilemma (not description cases).Selection of accompanying technical notes or chapters that give students some frameworks for analysis.Writing a syllabus that charts a path through related business problems.Students with some work experience who read and analyze the materials in advance.Students who meet in learning teams to make sure everyone is as far as they can go with the case given different backgrounds and experiences.90 minute classes.Rooms with semi-circular seating so everyone can see and listen to everyone.Rooms with multi-media channels\u2014internet, chalkboards, flip charts, projectors, overhead cameras, audio systems.Instructors who cold call on students (not just volunteers) so everyone has a chance to speak and express their opinions.Instructors who are highly skilled at asking good questions that stimulate thought for everyone.Discussions in which the students talk more than the instructor.Discussions in which what the students say is graded daily by the instructor after class.Discussions that include intense role plays\u2014only when implied by student comments.Discussions in which the instructor is facilitating learning and going at the envelope of the STUDENTS\u2019 understanding not the instructor\u2019s.Discussions characterized by high energy, humor, deep insight, working at the edge of students\u2019 understanding, no interruptions (coming in late, going to the restroom, AV faux pas, etc.) multi-media segments seamlessly intermixed, and complete and intense focus on the \u201cmagic bubble\u201d of collective insight in the room.Summaries driven by the students\u2019 insights and only the gaps filled in by the instructor.THAT\u2019s a \u201ctraditional class\u201d to me. I tried to get all of that every class, every course. I\u2019ve taught on-line classes. Invariably they were a miserably poor approximation of what happens in the class outlined above. People on commuter trains, in coffee shops, watching tv etc. in the on-line classes, no facial or body language, connectivity issues, synchronous versus asynchronous structures, and on and on. ONLINE courses are a reasonable approximation of a lecture class. LECTURE classes are a very poor substitute for a well-done F2F CASE METHOD class. There\u2019s little comparison. The ASSUMPTION of the question above is that most students have experienced LECTURES as the typical \u201ctraditional\u201d class. That is a travesty of educational institutions and instructors who don\u2019t understand the basics of adult learning. See Teaching Management. ",

If the student utilises online tools well then it really can be more productive than a regular class with effective use of electronic textbooks, technology, diagrams, whiteboards etc and electronic notes. However, if the teacher is not technically savvy then the lesson can be extremely uneffective and with lots of time wastage. Furthermore, some students can focus well even behind a screen whereas others require face-to-face interaction and stimulation. It really depends on the circumstances. However, one thing is for certain as in all cases which is that if there is a willingness to learn by the student they will always find a way to learn. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is blurring over time. As Janera states, it depends on many factors. In-person classes allow for rich interaction and can result in an enhanced learning environment. But with technological advances, internet (online) courses are capable of being quite interactive and there is an ability to built an internet/online learning community. It does take some self-discipline for individuals to systematically participate in internet/online learning. In person classes often enforce a schedule that can serve as a motivational tool to encourage students to participate. But the future looks bright. I think, that over time, internet/online classes will become more and more engaging. By taking advantage of communication technologies, they may approach the interaction felt in an in-person classroom experience. ",

            "answer_text": " The battle between E-learning and traditional learning is the major issue. As We know, in today's era to opt for any educational course we don't need to go out and also wait for the session to end. We can start e-learning anytime , any place, just because of digitization. E-learning has become the latest trend in India with more and more students opting for online tutoring or online coaching. While in the past, students had a dream to study abroad , but now students can enroll in any course worldwide. Online learning is known as the education that takes place over the Internet and also referred to as \u201ce Learning\u201d, or \u201cdistance learning\u201d. Why Traditional Learning Methods are Better Discipline - Some issues may distract you while learning like speed of net, fed up to sit alone, whats app notification, lack of concentration, and many more to skip your lesson.Other side there is no chance of distraction if you join a traditional class because there is a time limit to each class, your menter notice yours activities, there is no net issues, proper concentration and discipline maintained . A Place Full of Like-Minded People - In traditional learning, you are a part of a group who are also attending the same class. There is proper interaction with you teacher, classmates that helps you to better understand the topics. No, doubt there is also interaction with your mentor while taking online class but still it does not give you traditional learning feels Guidance of Professionals - E-learners miss the guidance of the teachers or professionals because they can only read and understand the literal meaning of the written piece, but in traditional learning, there is a discussion of face to face that you feel more relaxed.

            "answer_text": "You are talking about the study from home, I guess. It has both negative and positive aspects. Here are some positive points. Online classes are better in only way if you have the proper study environment, no noise no distractions. So, you can take your class with full concern. You can refresh yourself by having liquids and edibles with you that are mostly restricted for the sake of the decorum of the class. Secondly, some introvert students who are hesitate to talk in front of the teacher or whole class, questions and answers easily. On the other hand, online classes are also causing damage to the careers of intelligent students. A class is always composed of brilliant, average and dull students. Sometimes, a shortcut taker can beat you in your apparent grades. As grades do not matter if you really have the core of particular kind of knowledge. Sometimes, students cheat on assignments and quizzes to get some good grades which are highly possible in online sessions as no one is supervising the students while taking quizzes etc. I really don\u2019t think this is a useful experience of online classes. Moreover, students do not take it serious and become lazier than before. Copy pasting assignments and projects, cheating in quizzes and becoming lazier can\u2019t give institutes a proper yield. Hope it will help you. Excuse grammatical mistakes if any. Note : Those are just from my personal experience and observation. \ud83d\udc40 ",

            "answer_text": "Most of us have grown up listening to our professors droning on in a classroom, during a seemingly unending lecture. Using mobile phones in classrooms were strictly forbidden. But now educational institutes are increasingly using mobile devices for teaching purposes. In the last decade we have seen a dramatic change in the training pattern. Mobile devices have become a part of training and teaching methods. So what is better, the age old classroom learning or the modern eLearning? Let\u2019s have a look at a couple of advantages and disadvantages of both teaching methods. Advantages of Classroom learning Human interaction We, as humans, crave for human interaction. In a traditional classroom training model, there\u2019s a physical trainer present, who imparts knowledge. A living breathing mentor obviously has an upper hand over a machine. Dialogue There are more opportunities to ask questions and get your doubts clarified. Sometimes, one question leads to another and it might eventually lead to a whole new topic. The teacher can tell us about things that are not limited to the course contents. Disadvantages of Classroom learning Reluctance to ask questions We do know that some students are timid and might shy away from asking questions in front of an entire classroom. Their doubts would remain unanswered, unless brought up by another student. Individual attention A teacher cannot pay attention to every student in the classroom. And we all have taken advantage of this in some way or the other- hiding behind someone to avoid answering a question, doodling on the last page, or taking a nice 30 minute nap. Advantages of eLearning Flexible Students don\u2019t have to carry loads of books everyday. One digital device is enough, it could either be a smartphone, tablet, PC or laptop. eLearning content can be accessed anywhere and anytime. Students can access the study materials whenever they want, as per their convenience. Some eLearning platforms also offer an offline option which doesn't require internet connection to access the content. Interactive No longer do the students have to just sit and listen to someone constantly talking. They can actually be more proactive in their training program. The online content can be embedded with external links for more information, videos, audio etc to make the learning process more engaging and interactive. 3D simulations, interactive games and gamifications make the training program more challenging, providing students with an opportunity to interact with their peers, coordinate and solve problems. With quizzes and interactive assessments, the trainer can evaluate the progress of every student. Introducing eLearning in classrooms makes the learning process more interactive and helps in knowledge retention. Disadvantages of eLearning Unmotivated learners Some students might not feel motivated enough to peruse the online content without an actual classroom environment. They could get distracted and might end up just mindlessly staring at the screen. This unenthusiastic behaviour would lead to wastage of time. One really needs to be self-disciplined in order to continue with eLearning. Technical issues Your device must be compatible with the training module. Some online content work only on certain kind of devices. Also, some online training can be accessed only with an internet connection. Slow or broken connection can hamper the learning process, making the learner frustrated. ",

Without this your education stays incomplete. Classroom sessions bring a different learning ambiance for students who want to be successful in their lives. On the other hand when they enter the world of competitions, they often feel that they are getting stagnant somewhere. The student who was once a brilliant geek, starts getting frustrated seeing the new joinees in the same organisation progressing faster. The only reason behind this is missing of recent skills. This is where online certification programmes from various reputed training centres come into play. The timings stay flexible for the adult learners. They get to the dept of a domain and learn the modern technologies which can help in their productivity. These courses are shorter in length and help in tranformation and also helping professionals to get the right push to climb the corporate ladder faster than before. ",

You learn a trick -> after some time you forget it -> you can go back learn the trick again. You don't have fear of confessing to your mates or your teacher that you grasp the tricks slowly. 2. You can start your study anytime and anywhere. Offline coaching: 1. You can make a personal relationship with teachers. You can rely on them if you got stuck during your preparation. 2. You can learn better with your peers when there is a competitive environment. Competence is required while preparing for a National Level exam. I did classroom coaching in BFactory with Rahul Anand sir and Kamlesh Chauhan sir who were my guide during my preparation. I scored 92.88 percentile with only 4 months of preparation. I am still preparing under their guidance. The faculty team at the institute is filled with great teachers who are always there to help you out. Contemplate about what you need and choose wisely. All the best ",

Immersion in a coaching context is useful. That said, we are all very used and comfortable with talking \u2018long-distance\u2019. I do almost all of my coaching through the internet. Much of the personal coaching world works that way. It opens up possibilities otherwise very limited for coaches and clients from anywhere and everywhere to collaborate.

You can find the coach that suits your needs - even if s/he lives on the other side of the world. Michael ",

Firstly i know the edtech industry is booming and people are moving towards online learning, but i still believe the atmosphere of a classroom cannot be replaced in an online platform. Yes, if you are familiar to traditional form of teaching, where the teacher just gives the monologue and students follow then there won't be much difference in classrooms and online platforms but if you are in a, lets say, MBA class where peer learning, Classroom discussions, Case study discussions etc forms the major part of learning, there i believe the online platforms fall short, this atmosphere of classroom cannot be replaced by online channels yet. May with better infrastructure and technology this online channels might get better with this as well, but as per now the infrastructure is not that sophisticated yet. ",

They all tie together to eat up the time a student have in his hand. It leaves one with no time to pursue other important activities. Online class save time and time saved is equal to learning new skill.Enhance creativity & productivity - No one! On this planet can learn technology without using it. With online class students comes directly in contact with new technology and AI powered products. This not only increase one creativity & thinking power when it comes to learning new things, but also raise productivity.More opportunities - Everything in this world comes with opportunity cost. The time one spend while travelling to school can be used to explore better opportunities. The money saved while taking online class instead of school classes can be used to hire an online tutor.",

Much to my surprise I really got into that course, and it helped me with critical thinking that I could apply to life in general. A pubic speaking class helped me overcome http://shyness.It\u2019s a time to be on your own for probably for the first time in your life. Dorm living and campus social life expose you to a diverse range of \u201ccharacters\u201d, people who think, act and look different. For me, it was an opportunity to overcome shyness and to shed some of the small-town prejudices that I was raised with.Online is just another medium for delivering education. It should be offered in college programs for all students. Exposure to online education provides another way of learning, and may be the type of learning that you will encounter later in life. I wish we had online learning when I was in college (decades ago).I\u2019d recommend the traditional college experience, for at least the first two years. ",

But according to me, classroom teaching is more comfortable and useful for students because Students like us who need practical knowledge cannot gain it through online mode.We can only make them watch videos online but not the practical knowledge of the topics taught. As we all know that practical knowledge always lasts more in the memory of the student rather than the topics learnt through watching and theoretically learning. There will always be some disturbances during an online teaching. There may be pop-up notifications in whatever device we use, whether it may be a laptop or a mobile phone or whatever. This causes a distraction and lacks concentration without which students gain nothing.Students or teachers can be at any place while they are learning through online mode. There is no hundred percent certainty that those places will be calm and supporting for students to listen to classes and teachers to teach classes. But in classrooms, there will be much less disturbances or may be none like this.The student- teacher interaction is very necessary for the class and the students to be productive. This might not be one hundred percent possible through online teaching. So, I consider classroom teaching is a better option than online teaching. ",

You see, I have taken 16-week in-person classes and 8-week online classes and I can tell you with great certainty that I prefer the online class. Here\u2019s why: Life happens in 16 weeks. It\u2019s easy to pay attention and be present in a class that lasts 8 weeks. Also, if your class is anything like mine have been, it\u2019s relatively self-paced and you are able to look/work ahead. Also, when you take online courses, you learn to self-teach which can be highly beneficial later in life. I love school and I have learned so much in both online and in-person classes. I think it is up to your own discretion whether you find online or in-person classes to be most effective. ",

Then, do your research on what course(s) you can take to get yourself accepted in that industry. Whichever method of education you choose, do ensure that the teaching institution / university / college or school that is offering you the degree or certification \u2026is reputable and legitimate.

What if you remotely and not near a campus or the local campus does not offer the major you want to take.  Online can address that issue.

            "answer_text": "One prediction that you see a lot, a completely computerized education system probably will not occur. After more than 30 to 40% of class time is spent on computers, learning seems to decline. So, there will still be teachers and classrooms, although most homework will be done on computers, not on paper. Computer based instruction and e-learning is cheaper to provide for large quantities of people. However, that form of learning is often relegated to basic information (data requiring memorization) and compliance training. Even when being trained to use a computer system, people learn faster and retain more when there is a live teacher in the room with them providing instructions. In the age of rapid change, a live teacher can update material much faster than computer based instruction can be reprogrammed. Finally, students often learn more from other students than instructors and that tends not to occur with on-line education. ",

You can go to one of billions of webpages to find your information, and if there isn't enough you can go to a different page. However, if you get stuck then there is no one to help you. It also requires a lot of focus to not get distracted by other websites, and you run the risk of getting false information. In a classroom you have the advantage of having people around you to help you, and to keep you focused, but it is not available at all times, and can cost you money.  There is also a limited amount of information in a textbook. I would suggest using both methods to learn, as they each have their pros and cons. ",

Online learning should be seen as a supplement to face-to-face learning, not a replacement. Blended learning is an example where these two methods of learning come together to offer a more comprehensive and enriching learning & development experience. With many advanced learning management systems (LMSs) available at present, deploying eLearning and online employment training is a lot easier than ever before. To give a specific example, ProProfs Training Maker is a cloud-based learning management system that you can use to unlock all the benefits of a hosted software application. It comes with the following features: Custom course creationEducational path planningReal-time trackingReports & AnalyticsCertificationAll this makes this tool highly valuable. It is a simple yet functional platform that can help optimize and meet all your online training needs. By providing both pre and post-training support, the tool makes distance learning or workforce training such as onboarding a breeze. One of the best parts of such training software is their time and space-defying nature in that both instructors and course attendees can access them anytime, anywhere using multiple devices. The moment you embrace such a versatile, robust, and smart tool, you would never look at online learning with the same eyes again. ",

            "answer_text": "1. ELearning does help save costs. Moreover, it helps both educational institutions and students do so. Colleges don\u2019t have to provide students with space for learning and with some additional materials for their education. Students don\u2019t have to travel somewhere to build new skills and gain new knowledge. While e-learning still requires teachers to record their lectures and create courses, these learning materials can be used for a long time and easily changed when the need comes. Therefore, colleges save money on instructors and professors too. 2. ELearning does make the education more available. For some students coming to another country to study something is impossible, especially if they want only to study a certain course instead of receiving a degree. E-learning simplifies the process greatly, allowing students from all over the world to complete courses created by world\u2019s best universities. This benefits native students too, allowing them to communicate and study along with people coming from different cultures. Sure, there are colleges that offer multicultural experience too, but they aren\u2019t as diverse as the online learning institutions. 3. ELearning does make students more mobile. E-learning allows students to study from any place where they have a stable internet access. It also allows them to study at any time they find comfortable. All this not only makes the learning process easier for people living in different time zones but also allows the students to combine online education with work or getting a college degree. Moreover, this also allows students to organize their time more effectively. For example, you can learn something on your way home in a bus or during your gym training. This means that even the busiest students could learn properly. For more advantages check this blog post Advantages and Disadvantages of E-Learning Technologies for Students ",

            "answer_text": "Problems faced by students in offline tuition & coaching : 1. Limited availability of quality teachers for offline home tuition: A limited number of teachers available in a given locality, area or city can't be accessible to all the students for offline home tuition at student's place. Lack of teacher training to educationally qualified potential teachers & lack of experienced teachers in a given locality, area further compounds the problem. 2. Limited availability of different teachers for each subject under one roof & for all classes 3. Limited availability of quality tuition centers for offline tuition. 4. Uncertainty about credibility of available offline teachers or tuition centers 5. High demand but poor supply of quality teachers makes offline home tuition more expensive. 6. Travel time consumed & travel cost incurred during commuting by student or teacher for offline learning or tutoring further increases tuition charges for the student & makes it less economical for the teacher. 7. Wastage of significant amount of time in tiring traffic in metro cities is a problem both for the tutor as well as for the student. 8. Air Pollution in Cities discourages parents, students & teachers for commuting. 9. Safety & security of student especially the safety of girl child is an issue of most concern for the parent during offline tuition process at home or at offline tuition center. 10. Lack of individual attention in offline tuition centre classes. 11. Ease & Convenience in offline home tuition is lesser than online tuition. Why Online Tuition at Teaching Care is better than offline tuition: 1. EASE, CONVENIENCE & ACCESSIBILITY to a big pool of duly screened, properly tested, thoroughly trained, experienced & quality teachers from across India & abroad 2. BETTER QUALITY TEACHERS are made available at LOW RATES as compared to offline tuition as the teacher doesn\u2019t have to waste time & money in commuting to student\u2019s home or to tuition center. 3. MORE ECONOMICAL & AFFORDABLE for the student as it saves precious time & money that is wasted in commuting and provides better quality teachers at relatively low rates vis a vis offline tuition. 4. MORE FLEXIBILITY in commencement of course schedule, time schedule, class schedule & class duration. 5. FULL INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION in 1 to 1 class or one to few short group class. The teacher provides personalized attention to student based on student's learning level, learning pace & learning requirements. 6. DEMOCRATISED ACESS TO PERSONALISED LEARNING beyond geographical barriers. 7. SPECIALISED TEACHER for each subject under one roof & for all classes. 8. SAFE & SECURE 9. CLASS MONITORING BY PARENT. 10. AUTOMATIC CLASS RECORDING FOR REVISION. 11. BETTER PRESENTATION & LECTURE DELIVERY: live classes have two way live interactive classroom with real time audio video communication with the teacher. The classroom has online whiteboard for writing, typing, rubbing, erasing, power point presentation, showing images, pdf file, word file, youtube video & animation video. The classroom also has provision for chatting, code writing and automatic class recording for revision. You can ask doubts during the class and clear all doubts instantly during the class from the teacher. Summary: Ease & Convenience Accessibility Lower Pricing/Affordability Better Quality of Teachers Flexibility Individual Attention Personalized learning based on student's learning level, learning pace and learning requirements. Better Presentation & Lecture Delivery Automatic class recording Travel time and cost saved. No tiring traffic congestion Variety in Courses All subjects under one roof Safety & Security. However, It applies to 1 to 1 classes. Online group classes have disadvantages than offline group Classes. For exampleOnline Classes by Schools and Coaching Institutes still suffer from one size fits all approach. Due to covid-19, schools and coaching institutes switched over from offline to online classes in order to survive their business but did not update themselves nor did anything to get rid off the same old method of teaching wherein same size fits all approach is still followed. It has further made learning an uncomfortable experience for students as online group classes have added more problems for students such as reduced interaction between student and teacher; audio interruptions due to poor networks, unavailability of devices etc. Personalized 1 to 1 teaching is the key ensure to effective learning in the current online education scenario which suddenly enforced online group classes on teachers who were never trained for taking online classes. The result is that parents have started complaining to schools as parents are monitoring their kid's classes and happen to see various lacuna in online classes ranging from methods of teaching, quality of teaching, interaction of teacher with students, pronunciation, behavior, unnecessary overly assignments & activities, lack of focus on basic concepts etc Schools do not clear basic fundamental concepts, hence, students need to take coaching to clear any competitive exam whether it is engineering, medicine, banking, SSC, CDS, IAS or so on. And because colleges do not cater to education in the way it should be dealt in, that's why 80% Indian engineers, many doctors and most graduates and post graduates do not get jobs in the job market. It's failure of school education system that leads to existence of multi-billion coaching industry in India. ",

No online system can really match the schooling system.

How much ever AI we bring in, we should not make a kid talk to a computer and take away the emotional development in his/her formative years by taking out the human factor. Diploma / Graduation : It can be a mix as students by this time are matured enough to make the judgement. Post Graduation : Can be online Professional / Career Education : People look for upskilling in this stage and online courses or trainings are better as they provide the flexibility of anytime access, plethora of choices from anywhere in the world etc. ",

Modern online or learning does have its place, and may even have its advantages and in some cases. Personally, I think a course taught by a live professor or instructor is better than online because there is the opportunity of interaction between students and instructors. Students can ask questions or make comments and based on these questions or comments, the professor can adjust the pace of his class or even sometimes make adjustments in his lecture as he goes along. The professors we had were excellent scholars in their field with a lot of experience. I believe they were better able to transfer that experience and knowledge to us in the classroom live than online. ",

This is necessary to achieve inclusion in education. There are many intangible outcomes in education which can be achieved only through such a mode. Students learn not only from the teacher and books/articles but also from their peers. If we want education to inculcate empathy, democratic behavior, openness and an equitable attitude towards people belong to other caste, religion, race, and gender and so on through education, these cannot be achieved through an education in which the teacher and the student is linked only through the technology.

One advantage of online coaching is that you get enough time for self study, the other being the low expenses. But I would suggest that if you have both the options, prefer to choose institute coaching as the things learnt in class can't be acquired through any other means. One more advantage of it is the healthy discussion between the peers. This may seem a little insignificant to many people but it teaches us a lot of things. ",

The expression of a voice only gives you 30% you need the other 70% to get the full impact and that comes from the facial impressions. WE also especially with the teens and the last 2 generations which means the 20 & 30 yr olds need to learn about communication with real people. Social Manners need to be learned. NOT ignored. You don\u2019t break up with someone on social media. Have the courage to do this in person. We are not cardboard people or an artificial intelligent robot. People have feelings. Man /woman up and start dealing with your emotional hook ups and break ups in person!! ",

While ideas can be shared online, it seems to me that the sharing of ideas online is not as vibrant, or interactive, as doing so face to face with your fellow students as well as with your professors. The written word is certainly important in studying any subject. However, I found that the side conversations held at the water fountain, in the hallway outside the classroom, or in the break room were often timrs just as important as the classroom lectures and reading assignments. Online learning is absent those opportunities of learning. For my money, classroom learning has my vote. ",

I can study right from home and I can study any topic I want. It saves me so much time. Not only that, it also helps me understand my study concepts really well.
