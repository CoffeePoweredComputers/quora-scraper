You would need to belong to an educational institution whether student, staff, teacher, professor, etc. and have an email account through it People try to get these email addresses to get educational discounts and educational versions of apps. Some people have gotten around this, so many companies now require a mailed photocopy or a scanned copy of a current educational ID as well. ",
