            "answer_text": "Yes, no one will waste a year for sure. Schools reopen dates are definitely postponed and are more likely to be opened in the month of August. Here in Hyderabad, the board exams are conducted in this month itself so there will be no problem and not much of a delay in the academic year. Many schools in the city such as Tejasvi Vidyaranya are conducting online classes for the students and maybe even continue till everything gets back normal. ",
