            "answer_text": "First, let me clarify what I take the question to be. If anyone were listing the most famous universities in England today, they would certainly include Imperial College, London, University College, London, the London School of Economics and King\u2019s College, London. But until the 19th Century, the only two universities in England were Oxford and Cambridge. So the question is why it was not until the 19th Century that London had a university of its own. Also, there\u2019s a reference to the most famous school - singular - which is obviously a reference to Eton College. Schools: I\u2019ll deal with the school question first. Eton College was founded in 1440. Westminster School was also founded at some time in the early 15th Century, although no exact date seems to be available. Today, anyone would consider Westminster to be part of London, but of course the city of London itself is the area around St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. In 1509, John Colet, Dean of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, founded St. Paul\u2019s School. After the fire of London in 1666, (famously documented by Samuel Pepys, a former pupil at St. Paul\u2019s) the school moved to a new site. It is currently in Hammersmith. Harrow School was founded in 1572, at the time it was just ten miles from London, but as the area we refer to as \u201cLondon\u201d has expanded, it is now considered to be in London. Only seven former pupils of Harrow have gone on to be Prime Minister - not as many as Eton - but one of them was Winston Churchill. Three former pupils went on to win Nobel prizes. So for centuries, three of Eton\u2019s main competitors have been in London. Princes William and Harry studied at Eton, along with David Cameron and Boris Johnson, and so for the moment, Eton is probably better known worldwide, but when I was growing up, people would speak about \u201cEton, Harrow, Winchester, Rugby and so on.\u201d The only thing that needs to be explained is why, in the early 21st Century, Eton has gained a bit of an edge on its rivals. Universities: Oxford was a prosperous market town that became a centre of learning because it had monasteries (the earliest being the Abbey of St. Frideswide, built in the 8th Century). This is why Britain\u2019s first university came into existence there around the 12th Century. In 1209, some scholars fled to Cambridge because the tension that had arisen between townspeople and scholars had made Oxford a dangerous place. I\u2019d imagine that they wanted a quiet town where there wouldn\u2019t be any trouble. The interesting question then is why no further universities were founded in England from the 13th Century to the 19th Century. There were many institutions of higher education established in that time. In London, you have the Inns of Court and Inns of Chancery, where barristers and solicitors are trained. From 1123 onwards, you have medical training at St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital, now part of Queen Mary, University of London, and in 1751 you have St. George\u2019s Medical School, now St. George\u2019s, University of London. The Royal Veterinary College was founded in 1791 and is now part of the University of London. The City and Guilds Institute was founded in 1878 to develop a formal system of technical education, but the Livery Companies from which it was formed had already existed for centuries. So what set the two universities apart? First, the universities offered a broader education. St. George\u2019s, in London, was a medical school - its sole purpose was to train people for the medical profession. Both Oxford and Cambridge had chairs in medicine by the 16th Century, so they were places were you could study medicine, but studying and teaching medicine was not the sole purpose of either university. Secondly, the universities were entitled to grant degrees. This monopoly gave them power, and they used that power to maintain their monopoly. Durham had a long tradition of theological teaching, but it did not have a university until 1832 (the oldest English university outside of Oxford and Cambridge). This is because Oxford and Cambridge did not want a rival. Incidentally, from 1826 to 1836 the \u201cUniversity of London\u201d operated without any Royal Charter, granting degrees without legal recognition. In 1836, it became University College, London, recognized as a constituent of London University. So the Oxbridge monopoly on degrees was broken by an act that was almost a form of civil disobedience. I think it is useful to consider the case of Cardinal Wolsey. In 1525, he was at the height of his power as Lord Chancellor and suppressing the Abbey of St. Frideswide gave his access to immense wealth which he used to found a new college in Oxford, Cardinal College. (It was closed by Henry VIII in 1530, refounded as King\u2019s College in 1532, and became Christ Church in 1546). Christ Church is, today, Oxford\u2019s grandest college, but Wolsey\u2019s original plans were much grander - it would have stretched across what is now Christ Church Meadow to the Isis. If anyone could have founded a new university, surely it was Wolsey - he had the money, the power and the ambition. Of course, having taken wealth from St. Frideswide\u2019s Abbey, Wolsey might have felt obliged to spend that wealth in Oxford. But also, I suspect, he knew that there was no way he could have founded a university that would rival what Oxford and Cambridge had become. Better to found a college that, he hoped, would dominate Oxford than a university that would be dominated by Oxford and Cambridge. PS: Thanks to Ron Birrell for pointing out that in one sentence I wrote \u201cUK\u201d instead of \u201cEngland.\u201d That has now been corrected. ",

It\u2019s most famous school (pre university) is Eton and its two greatest universities are Oxford and Cambridge. Just now re-read your question.. You ask why? On that, I can only speculate. In a sense, with Oxford and Cambridge are what Americans would call land grant universities. There was never that much \u201cfree\u201d land for a king to give away inside of London. Regarding Eton, I have no idea other than the fact that London would not be a very nice place to send your little boy off to school.
