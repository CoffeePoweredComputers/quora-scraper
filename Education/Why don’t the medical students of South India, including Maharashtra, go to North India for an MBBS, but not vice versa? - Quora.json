            "answer_text": "I was associated with a medical college in a state in south India & know some of the teaching faculty there. Their teaching, both theory & practical is so great that this fact is known to all prospective applicants including the citizens over there. To begin with, doctors in south India work with a mission, their diagnosis, treatment is simply par excellence. The same cannot be said of North India. Going back: There are many other points worth pondering. Basic education right from primary to Universities is much more of a high standard than any place of North India. South Indians believe in strict discipline & do not meddle in others. North India is just the opposite in this. Living in South India is cheaper than North. A student gets learned colleagues in south - never in the north. Food in south is highly nutritious as compared to north, which is highly required while studying medicine. Good library, hostel & attached hospital are always available in south, not so in north at least in some cases. Moreover, medical colleges are more in each of the south Indian states as compared to north. ",

            "answer_text": "Geography of India includes land mass up to Goa in southern part of India. But we are used to say only 4 states as South India for they speak Dravidian http://languages.In reality Maharashtra ,Goa and some parts of Odisha form part of South India. The main reason for seeing more southern Indian students studying in Northern India is AIIMS. Entire institutions/hospitals of AIIMS are established in Northern part of India. Apart from Delhi ,the institutions are there in Bhopal ,Bhubaneswar, Raipur,Jodhpur,Patna and Rishikesh. There are several Armed forces Medical colleges and Army Medical Colleges too in northern India. Students from Southern India perform well in National board examinations and get admission according to their merits. ie: Students from Tamilnadu/other states of Southern India are willing to go to Jharkand to be best P Gs in particular branch of studies. Deserving and willing students are going to Russia and even East European countries for medical education. It is a competitive world those who compete and win earn a place to study any where they deserve. ",
