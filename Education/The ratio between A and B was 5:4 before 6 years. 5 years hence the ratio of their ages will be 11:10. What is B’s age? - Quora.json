            "answer_text": "Let 5 year ago age of B was x so that time age of A was 5x/4. So after 11 from then there ages will be x+11 and 5x/4+11 so 5x/4+11/(x+11)=11/10 or 5x+44/4x+44=11/10 or 50x+440=44x+484 or 6x=484\u2013440=44 or x =44/6 or 22/3. So 6 yera back age of B was 7 years and 4 months and A was 22/3*5/4=110/12 was 9 year 2 months. After 11 year from then there age will be 20 years 2 months and 18 years and 4 month so ratio will be 242:220 which is 11:10 .Hence present age of B is 13 years 4 months. ",
