            "answer_text": "Many would ask you to practice 100s of sums but trust me unless you focus your mind and know to use which formula when doing hundreds of sums are of no use to sum it up I meant be perfect with the formulas!!!! It really doesn't matter how much sums or from what not books your friend might do at the end of the day it matters how much you have learnt and are you satisfied with it! Guys a little tip: never study for marks its of no use well yes it will give you temporary happiness but in the long tee its of no use As I always say text book is your holy book Remember this Important point in any stage of your study in years When you solve a problem think deeply,try various methods to solve it. If you can't solve never be discouraged! Check the soloution and think why weren't you able to solve it! Why didnt you think of that way! Yes after you have done this and have confidence in yourself then you can start solving from agarwal and RD shrama they are the best books to refer to! You don't have to go to higher standard books as CBSE always checks if you are perfect in the concept! WWell RD sharma is already a very high level book so that should be fine. All the best for your boards Lil champs!!! Stay calm and focused the last 2 months are the most important ones! ",
