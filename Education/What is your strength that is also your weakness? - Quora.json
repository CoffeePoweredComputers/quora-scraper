            "answer_text": "Its often seen that our strongest strengths become our biggest weakness. In the particular outdoor game involving a team of players, a particular player was outstanding & was the star of the game. The opposite team that was supposed to play against them, did a continuous review of this outstanding player, identified 2 players only to have this star marked, so that he was not allowed to play to his full potential. Though it may appear to be negative, there is no rule which says this strategy is not permitted, because the rules of the game assumed that nobody would go down to this level.Sometimes life seems to be advantageous to some ( which people call it as luck) even though they dont exhibit much skills or talents; but it seems disadvantageous even to the most talented / qualified ones, who fight for their very existence, when other scrape through easily. People could be so good & kind to others ( a valuable asset in interpersonal relationship), often find this noble trait works to their disadvantage, because the very people with whom they interact, take undue advantage of the other person\u2019s nobility,without understanding the pressure / toll on the individual who provides the service. Sometimes the noble soul would have to work for extra hours as well.Everybody has a freedom to choose, how to respond to such situations, but choosing to respond positively even at times of disadvantage due to additional load , shows dedication , commitment, maturity of the person to react wisely & conduct responsibly, Such people leave behind a noble legacy & sweet memories with their presence at such positions, while setting a high standards for the next generation to follow.

            "answer_text": "To put it conversely, my biggest weakness is also my biggest strength: I\u2019m weird. I\u2019ve always been a weird person. I\u2019m possibly nondiagnosed ASD, naturally socially awkward, and have had a sheltered lifestyle since I was very young. Oh, and I\u2019m a contrarian/conflict theorist. I am not at all fun at parties. Oh, and because of my sheltered background, I\u2019m also naive. Now on one hand, it can get sucky when I feel like I\u2019m on the fringe of a group, or society. I don\u2019t have a lot of resources, networks, or clout to piggyback off of. On the other, I\u2019m incredibly resilient as a person. I can ask more of myself than I think others ask of themselves. I\u2019ve accomplished so much with my life specifically because I want to follow through on my life goal of being able to help and assist others who have been in places similar to where I\u2019ve been. My wierdness and naivete has the huge benefit of me never being able to place judgements on others, or make biased assumptions. I approach all people with good faith and confidence as human beings. Usually people don\u2019t gravitate towards me unless absolutely needed, so when they do, I tend to have the uncanny ability to relax them and make them feel listened to. ",
