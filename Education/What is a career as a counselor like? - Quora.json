            "answer_text": "I loved it. I worked as a sexual assault counsellor for 7 years, managed a service providing therapy to children and families affected by abuse for 4 years, and operated a private therapy practice for 6 years. I loved working closely with people, one on one, at their own pace. I worked with children and adults of all abilities and all walks of life. I loved the mental stimulation and challenge of dealing with the unknown. I was always conscious of the privilege of my work, that someone was choosing to share with me their inner thoughts and feelings. It was sometimes exhausting, but could also be exhillerating. I remember at one stage that it felt like counselling encompassed a large part of my life. This was at a time when I was a manager/therapist 4 days a week, while running a private therapy practice, in addition to studying a psychotherapy diploma part time. All while bringing up my children as a single parent. That was a crazy year of intense study. I thought I would work as a counsellor forever. I took on a different position working with vulnerable victims of crime in the criminal justice system at a time that I needed to be more available to my kids. While my counselling skills and background is a benefit in my role, I am not a therapist. I never intended to work in my current position so long, but 6 years later I am still there and find myself still enjoying the different challenges in my work. I wouldn't be surprised if I return to working as a therapist again someday. It still fascinates me, and the learning never ends. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are speaking in regards to psychotherapists: It starts by obtaining a master\u2019s degree from an accredited program, either in Mental Health Counseling or Social Work. Make sure the program will give you what you need to become license eligible in the state you practice. Grad School for counseling takes a few years and includes rigorous coursework and many semesters of internship that will help you learn the ropes. The internship can be very rewarding and very challenging. I suggest trying a bunch of different things: inpatient, outpatient, child & adolescent, etc. Once all that\u2019s done, you become eligible to practice under clinical supervision. Most people freshly graduated work for large clinics/facilities so they can get the supervision required to satisfy licensure requirements. You will work more independently, have a chance to make many decisions yourself. Think of it as eqivaleny to a doctor\u2019s residency. Once you take the test and have your full license (LMHC, LICSW, etc.) You are considered \u201cindependent\u201d but you are never alone. All professionals ahould seek peer supervision. Some licensed professionals move into management, such as myself, but I keep seeing 1:1 clients. Some go into private practice, some teach, some just keep seeing clients where they are comfortable. The hardest part of my job is when a client dies. ",
