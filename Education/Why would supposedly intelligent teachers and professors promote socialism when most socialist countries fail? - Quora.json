            "answer_text": "To be fair, a fair portion of capitalist countries have also failed in some sense at some time in their history, like devolved into dictatorship, had a coup or had a civil war. Most intelligent people I\u2019ve met that have advocated for something that is actually socialism and not social democracy have advocated for variants on socialism that have not really been implemented on a large scale, such as libertarian socialism or democratic socialism with all or many businesses government or employee-owned and the government being democratically elected. I have met some hardcore Marxist-Leninists that are well-educated and they usually advocate for Marxism-Leninism because they genuinely believe it does work, that when it collapses it is due to poor leadership or other issues that are not inherent with the economic system itself. They point to things like the nil homelessness rate, nil unemployment rate, free access to healthcare and education that were present in the USSR and how quickly it went from a backwards agrarian economy to a world superpower as evidence of its success. I must admit, the academics and teachers I\u2019ve met have either been too afraid to voice their political views as it\u2019s unprofessional to when you\u2019re their student, or have been right-wing if anything. If these academics and teachers you\u2019ve encountered are advocating for social democracy and not socialism, it could be because that has been successfully implemented in many countries (arguably all developed countries, just to varying degrees) and has lead to some of the most stable and pleasant democracies in the world (e.g. Finland is ranked as the most stable country in the world by the fragile state index, and it is one of the most social democratic countries in the world).

            "answer_text": "Socialism is what kept capitalism from failing. In order to dissuade people from voting communists, capitalists had to accede to some of the workers demands, which kept capitalism functional by regulating it. The moment the communist threat no longer existed, capitalists went gung ho destructing the fundamental values of the people, of which Adam Smith stated they were fundamental to the markets: honesty, mutual help, trust and so on. What happened with the banks in 2008 was the result of giving free reins to people who only believe in the law of the strongest, going on a rampage against all that held things together without they knowing (or wanting to know) because greed will meke you sell a gun to your murderer.
