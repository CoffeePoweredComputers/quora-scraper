            "answer_text": "Education :To educe means 'to draw out' what is within a person. A person is multifaceted. They just don't know it yet. One can only draw out what is already present.  Schooling is the process of filling, not of drawing out. Choices :People make choices based on information and goals to achieve. Most students in 5-8 standard don't have an idea about What interests them?What they are capable of?What they're meant to be? Kids look around and base their interests based on very limited information. Few are lucky enough to know from the start what they want to do. Finance and Status :Parents basically look for a stable job which will establish their children on a sound financial track. They are more worried about day-to-day livelihood. Money makes most fields comparable if not equal. Prestige and respect in society is key as a lot of things are tied into your particular station in life. A bank manager, a businessman, a sportsman, a doctor, an engineer have different profiles. Depending on social context parents may choose from these out other professions. ======= Choice should be based on few things OptionsAptitudeMotivationTo be able to navigate to a successful and happy career following are needed : Need - Necessity is the mother of invention. One should feel the need to learn, to explore, to be skilled. Having a guitar with no motivation is worse than having no guitar at all.Exposure to varied things to know your options and give a background for further effort in future.Motivation - Out of exposure and necessity comes interest. Wanting to succeed at something is motivationAccess to great teachers or resources.Ability to learn and teach oneself new things in-depth and breadth. Many times what interests one person in a field may not interest another. So you need to be able to customise your education as per your \"fit\".Learn by doing helps one to teach oneself through trial-and-error and experimentation. This helps when you have no precedent/teacher/mentor to fallback on in a new field.",

            "answer_text": "What I have noted from my experience with US middle and high schools (my sons graduated high school in 2009 and 2010) there is little choice in 8th grade, other then the Level of the courses (1, 2, 3 with 1 being the toughest (honors)).   And to be admitted to the Level 1 track the student needs an excellent track record (or parents who harass the administration needlessly).   My eldest son did have a choice for how he took the mathematics progression and he choose Innovative Math Program with my encouragement, as it was the closest to engineering.  He then was still able to take Calculus and Statistics courses as a senior (he is now a Mechanical Engineer).  But, the school system abandoned the IMP program.{I am on a technical advisory committee, advising the Superintendent on STEM issues).   Other than that, the student chooses electives.   For example my younger son wanted to major in Business and Management in college (he did) and he took business related electives in high school. Otherwise it is: ScienceMathematicsHistoryLiteratureLanguagesElectivesHigh school is a place to be Well Rounded in All fields. That is why MIT (a Technical college) mandates a recommendation from a Humanities teacher...... ",
