Then I had two kids and was still thoroughly lost. If I hadn't had friends who cared enough to take me by the hand and show me how to do things, I'd have been in way over my head! In other words, teach your kids the basic skills they need to survive on their own. It makes a huge difference. I made sure my kids learned this stuff, and in my opinion, their quality of life once they got out on their own was vastly different (an improvement) from my own! ",

            "answer_text": "Children learn by observation and imitation. So to teach them about good things the adults around them should be doing them practically. Here are a few things he should learn from you-  To say sorry whenever he has done something wrong. If you say sorry whenever you've done something wrong he'll learn by example.To say Thanks when someone helps him. Thank him loud and clear when he brings you something or offers something.Wish him Good morning and Goodnight everyday. Wish others you pass by so that he knows it's good manners to wish people.To follow traffic rules. If you're jumping traffic signals and cursing people on road, he'll learn the same thing.Teach him that sharing is caring.  Once in a while take him to an orphanage or a similar place, sponsor  their lunch for a day and explain him why people should help those in  need. Also tell him why wastage of resources is a bad thing while many people are suffering due to lack of those.If you practice any religion then make it a habit to pray along with him everynight before bed, thanking the Almighty for having a good day. Make him appreciate what he has.If you want him to be physically active (he should be physically active instead of playing with mobiles or Ipads) then play along with him whenever you find time. Work out together with him every morning.He's not too young to start learning doing things on his own. Make him pile up his toys into a box after playtime. Let him dress up himself, teach him to fold his clothes and put them in the shelf. Start small and gradually he becomes independent and does things by himself. Teach him to be self sufficient.Life is not about grades in school. Don't pressurize him about grades but create enthusiasm in him to learn new things and apply them. Just memorizing a bunch of things won't help him.Cuddle him and kiss him even after he grows up. Shower him with love and never judge him. He'll grow up to be a loving person.More important of all - Set an example, so that he grows up and becomes like you. Be the person you want him to be when he grows up.Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "I must appreciate your thought. Not many parents think about giving additional knowledge to their kids that would help them become a good citizen. Well, I must say that today we need good citizens the most than anything else.  Now, what would you need to make your kid a good citizen. Certainly, he should learn extra-curricular activities as that would expand his hobbies and would keep him healthy, but along with that, you should focus on mental health as well.  I would suggest, for that, you should try to strengthen his roots. For this, try to give him knowledge about his mother-tongue. This is essential and sadly parents these days teach their kids foreign language and neglect their mother tongue. Don't feel ashamed teaching your kid that as then only he would be able to learn new language.  Secondly, start teaching him respecting elders, and other social etiquette like greetings elders, caring for grandparents and other similar small things that is slowly diminishing. These things would help him grow, personally.  Thirdly, teach him how to respect those who are of lower stature and how to behave with those who are of higher stature. Teach him to be open minded at the same time respect our culture.  There are many such things, but aforementioned are few hints to what all you should teach your son. I hope, you would use your wisdom and do what is right.  :) ",

            "answer_text": "Natural answer is to be a GOOD HUMAN BEING. He should learn to NOT discriminate. Never disrespect the elders.  Feed a poor man in need.  Be gentle to someone physically and mentally not as strong as he is.  Be kind to animals.  Learn to be a leader, speak his mind up.  and above all Make him a READER, he himself will learn everything. Books make us go places.  Now these all sound easy but people should start early in life starting with small things.  Make him make his own bed, it will help him so much in future.  Ask him to clean his room , clean himself properly everyday. It's a good habit and it will grow later on.  He should be responsible for his things, if he looses anything make sure he understands that everything is not replaceable. Make him learn to make his own sandwich, put on his own shirt button back, tie his laces ( although I can't tie mine properly yet ), arrange his book for classes at night instead of  rushing in the morning.  Make him understand that there are things that can be planned and then there are things meant to be done at the moment.  Ask him to carry a handkerchief all the time.  Give him responsibility , make some cash to handle, a book to keep. Make sure he writes a diary.  He doesn't need to learn an instrument or paint or dance or swim. Let him do everything if he wants to or just let him focus on one thing if he has passion. Mind it he doesn't need to be good at it, the key point is to never give up.  Although I have zero experience in motherhood, but someday I will implement these in my child's life. I want him to grow as a person the way he wants to be, free, independent but above all I want him to look back and know that he is good enough, he can accomplish things, he can choose a new hobby, he can learn, he can adapt.

            "answer_text": "Teach them to become respectful as they grow up. To achieve this, one good tip I can give you is to speak to your kids with respect. I\u2019m a firm believer in speaking to kids as if they were adults. I don\u2019t mean talking about politics and religion. I mean that, regardless of the age of the child, I believe that you should use the same tone as if you were talking to a peer. When you speak to your peers, you take their feelings into consideration. You\u2019d never yell at your friend to hurry up in the bathroom. You\u2019d never lose your temper if your friend spilled his milk at the supper table. Instead, you\u2019d use tact. You\u2019d knock on the bathroom door and ask, \u201care you okay?\u201d You\u2019d laugh with your friend to guard him from embarrassment over the milk. Why should your words to your children be any less respectful than those you use with your peers? Your words should aim to guide your child, but never to hurt, embarrass or show disrespect. Your children will learn from your example. You can also checkout this helpful article I found for a list of parenting tips. Definitely a good read!

A 3yr child's mind is like a sponge and they are capable of learning 5 languages at one go. (I have read it in a research article.) If your mother tongue is hindi try teaching your child Tamil/telugu/marati/kannada. If you are from South India then go for hindi /gujarati/bengali.... Just one language. Take help from your colleague or friend having different mother tongue. They will never deny for sure. In this way you can also learn a new language and appreciate our country's diversity. ",
