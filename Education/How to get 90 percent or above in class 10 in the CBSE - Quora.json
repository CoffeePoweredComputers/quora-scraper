            "answer_text": "So, you are going to appear for your 10th board exams this year and may be wondering if it is possible to score 99% in your 10th class examination. Well, I would like to say you, \u201cYes, it is possible\u201d. It is not easy, but can be done, if you really want to do it. People might ask what is so special about 99% marks. It is just that anyone can score 90%. That is not at all difficult. Even a student with average intelligence, who studies hard can score 90%. But 99% marks mean that you have mastered the complete syllabus. There is no one better than you. You are the champion of champions. Well, first of all remember that there is nothing that you cannot achieve. It might be a 99% in your board exams or anything else in your life, everything is possible, if you truly want to achieve it. All it takes is a lot of hard work and perseverance. Secondly, remember that there is no shortcut to success and you must try harder to make it right. Just be positive and focus on to your goal. Important points to get 99% marks in your 10th Exams Don\u2019t count hours, study till you understand a topic completely. As soon as you understand something, write it down in your own language to make your own notes.Important thing is the planning. To make sure that you do not lose your track in between, you must have a solid plan of study. Make a plan in the very beginning and follow it for the complete year. Start off from the topics that you don\u2019t have much confidence on. These topics are the ones, which are difficult for you to understand, to grasp and to remember. Study those topics first, keep two books with you (one rough and the other for revising it during exam). Make your own notes for the difficult topics first.The next thing is the study pattern. If you really want to achieve that 99% target, you must love your books. Yes, you must be completely in love with them. Do not take study as a burden, but try to like it. Your study pattern plays a big role. Try to make your study interesting.Make a schedule (time table), which would eventually help you in tracking your completion everyday.Do not compromise with your health.Give enough time for other important things that you like to do like games, music, food and friends.Do not worry even if you cannot complete the syllabus in first 6 months, but make sure that you complete it twice or thrice before the exam.Before going to sleep at night, revise everything that you have studied on that day.There is no shortcut or trick to score above 90.Hard work and dedication is all it takes.Preparation Tips for Subjects Class 10 Science The CBSE Class 10 Science mainly focuses on the following areas \u2013 Chemistry, Physics and Biology. Those students who wish pursue the science stream in class XI are advised to strictly focus on all these three areas as this will clear their foundations. The complete list of formulae, experiments and derivations should be kept handy.It\u2019s a strict no-no to miss the science laboratory lectures and classes. Utilise the science laboratory as much as you can for every single experiment.The NCERT books are to be followed thoroughly to score well in Science. Almost the whole question paper revolves around the concepts that are given in the NCERT book.Some science formulas have certain rules that you strictly need to follow and use it correctly. For example, to use the quadratic formula; you must first change the equation to the standard quadratic form.PHYSICS-Get a grip on the fundamental concepts of the subject. A major part of the exam contains direct formulae- and theorem-based questions. Therefore, revise them thoroughly to solve questions accurately. Use the formulae and theorems extensively in solving various problems from last years\u2019 papers and model papers.CHEMISTRY-The good news is this is a high-scoring subject, and also requires lesser time for preparation. Speed and accuracy in solving different problems can be acquired through in-depth study of the subject and extensive practice. Study the name reactions; make charts of formulae along with names and revise them as and when possible.BIOLOGY-As the subject includes lots of diagrams, give special attention to important diagrams and their theory. Make sure you remember the important terms and their respective functions. Biology involves learning and memorising difficult terminology. Write such terms repeatedly so as to get acquainted with them. Get thorough with the important definitions as the subject is mostly theory.Class 10 Math The CBSE Class 10 Class 10th mathematics focuses on the basic geometry, trigonometry and the concept of numbers. The subject helps to build a basic aptitude and concepts that would be beneficial for the students who wish to appear for the aptitude based tests in future. The class 10 Maths formulas are otherwise very general, but sometimes it is seen in the previous question papers that the questions are asked from the middle of such numerical which you have to identify it.The concepts/formulas sheet should be kept handy.You should know the usage of all the Maths formulas.If you really want to score an A1 in math exam, then it is really important to completely be in synch with your NCERT book. Almost the whole questions paper comprises of the concepts and formulas that are given in the NCERT book.If you are solving a problem based question, it is advisable to read the problem again and again to get the exact idea of what you\u2019re being asked to solve.Write down in a rough paper, exact what it is given in the question paper and what you are asked to find. Then in a systematic way, try and find what is asked to you.Once the revision is done, start solving the sample papers, unsolved papers and practice papers within the given set of time.Class 10 Social Studies Although social science may seem dull, use study tools to make it fun. Flash cards, timelines, colorful charts and funny mnemonics can help you study in addition to textbook and notes reading. In 10th class either your social sciences studies are beginning or ending. Read the course once without trying to remember it, just read like you would read the newspaper or novel and try to understand it.Give priority for your subjects and topics according to marks weight-age and easy and difficult chapters and use this list to create a practical study schedule.Take notes for specific points you feel are important and you are likely to forget, in addition to school notes.Create a chart with important dates, flip through it often and you will find that you are able to easily remember the dates.Study subject-wise rather than from all topics combined; they were separated for a reason.Use flash cards for definitions and also for various history events; flash cards help for fun and quick revision.Practice map work by tracing the important locations you want to remember, then try locating on a blank mapUnderstand economics and political science, its better than to try to memorize.Solve previous year papers/ sample papers to practice writing within word limits.Class 10 English Unseen passage/note making: This is an extremely scoring section and needs the least amount of effort comparatively. Read the passage carefully and you will be able to find the links to answer the questions.Writing skills: Follow formats religiously. Majority of the questions in this section are for 10 marks, divided into 3 marks for format, 4 for content and 3 for fluency/accuracy of English as far as I remember. Look at sample letters, articles from reference books to improve thinking skills and get an idea of presentation. The board examiners would much rather prefer an exhaustive article with lots of ideas and inputs by the student than just repetitive arguments in flowery language.Grammar: Practice, practice, practice. Brush up basic rules and attempt as many questions as possible and learn from the mistakes you make.Literature: Read all the chapters very thoroughly. Specially for poems, write in your book or a separate notepad all that your teacher explains. Having said that, you should also realise that understanding the chapter is not enough as you will be expected to write 7-10 mark answers in the exam. Keeping this in mind, try to attempt past year papers and questions from other reference material and try to frame long answers. Each of these long answers should have an introduction, body and conclusion. Aim for about 150-200 words spread across 3-4 paragraphs.Class 10 Hindi It is fairly easy to score 90+ in this paper 12th boards. But to score in late 90s, you need to study the NCERT textbooks really well. They are extremely useful.Get a question bank cum guide (Golden is one of them) and practice questions.Solve past year papers (Arihant, Oswal or any of the available sources), check against the solutions provided. In fact, a lot many times questions are just repeated in exams.This is it. These 3 simple things will equip you to score 95+ in the paper.Keep your mind fresh and never falter. Don't get stressed too much my friend. At the end you too will realise that was it really a thing of being stressed !. If I honestly make a true commitment about how I studied and managed then 101% you won't believe me. I enjoyed my 10th to the fullest I could do in the starting months. I was a backbencher and mainly depended upon tution (maths and science). I focused on ncert mainly and practiced sample papers. I started studied after September only. But after September, I studied day and night regularly. I just slept 4\u20135 hrs a day and was totally determined towards my boards. the last few months mainly jan-feb is the main and the most imp time for hardwork. Dont just try to take it lightly. That's the only time for self practice and to realise how much you are under water\u2026\u2026 Hope my words help. Best wishes\u2026.\u263a Good luck for your results. Hope you score even above 95% ",

            "answer_text": "I appeared for X Board exams last year and got 95% so I think I am eligible to answer this question. Scoring 90% is not at all difficult. You just need to practice subjective questions. MATHS: For maths I recommend practicing solved examples from RD Sharma. You will find every type of question with detailed solutions. You can also solve OSWAL Sample paper for a quick self analysis.SCIENCE: Read NCERT again and again. Learn all the chemical equations (Esterification and Soap ones are important). Again you can solve OSWAL Sample Papers for Science also. No other book is required.SOCIAL SCIENCE: Just read NCERT, no other book is required. You should make notes of important chapters so that you can revise the vast syllabus easily before exams. The notes should not contain long answers but rather bullet points and Key words. Use different colours to mark easy, medium and difficult topics.ENGLISH: Scoring good in English is very easy if you know what to do.Firstly begin your Letter to Editor with \u201cI am ABC from XYZ institute. I am an ardent reader of your Newspaper. Through the esteemed columns of your prestigious publication, I would like to draw the attention of concerned Authorities and Citizens towards\u2026 _(The Issue)_\u201dThe story should always have a Title and a Moral.The Long answers should have Three parts: The introduction, the content and an ending.Use difficult words in Article Writing. Using words like \u201cAesthetic, Magnificent, Utopia, Diastopia\u201d etc help to get a good impression and fetch extra marks. Don't forget the title (1 mark).Hope this answer helps. ALL THE BEST!!

            "answer_text": "Well firstly congratulations , you are on the right path because this question shows your desire to perform exceptionally in your board exam . I gave my board exam last year and scored 98.4 percentage in boards luckily , so since I got experience last year I can give you some suggestions that may help you too score 90 percent and even higher than it. 1 The most important and the very basic thing is that don\u2019t ignore ncert because it is must. Although we know it very well but many times we tend to forget it and start rushing towards lots of extra sources like guides or refresher. 2. Give equal preference to every subject whether it is english , hindi or social science. As most of the time we invest studying maths and science and ignore these subjects .Remeber all the subjects carry equal weightage and ultimately these are the subjects which will boost your percentage. 3. Be consistent - It does not matter that how many hours you are devoting for study because this is subjective for everyone but do study daily . At least invest 2 hours daily . 4. Try practicing as many previous year question papers as possible becuse then you get acquainted with the pattern and structure of the questions being asked. 5. Revision is the key so one thing you can do is whatever stuff you have studied whole week , give practice test from all those topics on sunday. You may ask your parents or sibling to make a practice test paper for you from all those topics you have covered in a week. This way you could analyse your performance and do all the improvement required . So book your weekend for revision and enjoyment!! 6. Learn how to attempt paper- You should know the correct way of attempting paper because paper presentation also help you to gain some extra marks , for this you may refer to you tube because many youtubers have covered this topic in detail. And whenever you solve sample paper set the timer and try to cover it in 2 hours 30 minute so that you can easily complete your board paper and also left with sometime to recheck it. Hope it helps !! And wish you all the best , You will rock it. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has their own different strategy but I think this one might help you. Pay attention to the lectures at class. Careful listening helps one a lot in learning. If you have any doubt ask your teacher.Plan your strategy in advance Set everyday goals for yourself. Need not to be something big like finishing whole chapter in one day but learning some important topics and terminologies.Never leave your studies for tomorrow. I can relate from my experience procrastinating costs a lot. So start early and be diligent from start.Make a realistic timetable not an idealistic one. It matters a lot how you manage your time and what is your everyday schedule.Make a timetable that you are convenient with and is really beneficial for your studies. If you make a timetable you cannot adjust with that ultimately you will be lenient towards your study.Make study interesting by learning the way you remember and understand. You can make charts, draw diagrams etc. If you are a visual learner than you will be able to learn better through educational animations and videos.After learning each chapter note the important points and make mind maps.Write concise and smart. Only highlight the important and scoring points. If you try to write more in belief that you will score more you will just mismanage your time in exam.And as the others mentioned some good books study them.Solve previous year question papers and take a lot of mock tests.Don\u2019t be over worried about your marks. The knowledge you earn is more worth than what you score.Don\u2019t be nervous in the exam hall and take care of yourself . At last I convey my best wishes for you. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s early months of the session and my sister, being in same class often ask me the same question. I\u2019ve got just one less than a perfect CGPA in 10th, so I\u2019m quite illegible to answer this. Quality over Quantity- I\u2019m a messed up student when it comes to following studying schedules and time tables. But, still I manage to cover an entire subject in a week or so. Devoting less time but with all focus and devotion can fetch you good marks.Be attentive in Classroom- So, it\u2019s perfectly fine if you\u2019re not regular at studies, you\u2019re not opening your books everyday at home. But, pay full attention in classroom. This not only gives you an idea about a topic but helps you to retain well in the boards preparation.Presentation matters- Okay so, I\u2019ve experienced this one. Presentation do matters, it\u2019s not only about the content. While writing an answer you must value the time of a reader as well. Answers should be apt and to the point.To make your answer sheet look more interesting you can use black and blue pen for writing. Moreover, I always try to use different method of presentation in each of my answer. For instance, making flow charts, tabular forms, use of boxes, making diagrams with your own interpretation. It just looks amazing! I have few of my 11th and 12th answer sheets in which I\u2019ve used similar method and it does fetch you good marks. Revisions- Is there any single definition or formula you forget each and every single time? Then, revision is the key for you. Time to time just revise over and over. For many of you, 10th would be first time when you\u2019re getting the whole book for exam if I\u2019\u2019m not wrong. To avoid last minute mugging up and confusions take revisions over and over. Maintain a small notepad for formulas, make placards for new words in English (Vocabulary), make notes if needed and read them, solve map questions and just glance at them everyday. READING last year\u2019s question papers- Yes, you read that right, at least READ the question papers, solving them is up to you. I know it\u2019s difficult to solve them in limited time and that so when you have syllabus lagging. If your preparation is done, then just go through the question papers to have an idea about what type of questions come in exam. But, for math you do need to practice a lot apart from NCERTs if aiming for full marks.Balance is important- Give enough time for other important things that you like to do like games,movies, music, food and friends. Don\u2019t stress yourself too much. Keep your mind fresh and never falter.Don\u2019t risk your 300/50% marks- In order to score good in math and science, don\u2019t forget language subjects (English & 2 other languages). They do carry marks. Practice writing skills.Pre-Boards are important- The biggest mistake one can do is not taking pre-boards seriously. They help you to gear up for final board exams and take necessary steps to start working on weak areas without feeling stressed.If you want to consult a guide- Bhavya Bansal's answer to What are best reference book for class 10?Stick to the NCERT- Yes, yes, CBSE loves ncert! There\u2019s nothing more to explain about it! :DAll the best, Thanks for reading! ",

Sometimes, CBSE 10th and 12th students do not prepare for pre-board exams seriously because the marks obtained in pre boards are not added to the final board marks. However, these pre-board exams are very important and must be attempted seriously with an honest effort because Pre-board exams provide real time scenario similar to the CBSE board exams. From these exams, students can easily identify their weaknesses and information about what they need to study. Moducation faculty advise all students to go through Class 10/12 Marking Scheme and CBSE toppers answer sheets (released by CBSE) before appearing in Pre - Board Examinations. Answer Sheet of CBSE Class 12 Toppers Answer Sheet of CBSE Class 10 Toppers Marking Scheme for CBSE Class 10 Board Exam 2018 Marking Scheme for CBSE Class 12 Marking Scheme 2018 How to Prepare for Boards in January 2018 Once CBSE Board Exam 2018 Date Sheet will be released? CBSE 10th & 12th board exam 2018 Date Sheet is expected to be released in the first week of January. Students preparing for CBSE board exam must plan (re-plan) their study accordingly immediately after the release of the Date Sheet for board exams. It is expected that every students must have studied the complete Syllabus, by the end of December. CBSE has also issued sample papers (like every year) to help students in understanding the latest examination pattern. During January, students must solve CBSE sample papers based on the latest board exam pattern and marking scheme. It is very difficult to score well without solving CBSE 12th and 10th practice papers. During this month students advised to revise formulae and concepts (or short notes) for every chapter and then solve chapterwise questions from previous year CBSE Board Papers. Solving previous year CBSE question papers of last 10 years is the key to score above 90% in CBSE board examinations because questions based on the concepts given in previous year CBSE question papers are repeated frequently in CBSE Class 10 or 12 board exams. Very frequently questions are repeated from previous year papers. Students can also attempt few CBSE Guess papers specially prepared for students who are going to appear for CBSE 10th and 12th board exam 2018. Sample Paper for CBSE Class 10 Exam 2018 Sample Paper for CBSE Class 12 Exam 2018 CBSE Class 10 Guess Papers CBSE Class 12 Guess Papers How to Study in February, the Last Month Before Final Board Exam 2018: (Revise & Practice: Don\u2019t study anything new) One should devote this month for revision purpose only. Do not study anything new in this month as you may get stuck in any new topic during last moment and it may add more confusion and may also result in wastage of precious time. Students should revise NCERT textbook summery, Formulae and Concepts in Moducation App & hand written notes prepared by themselves. Try solving at least 2 papers on daily basis. Stop using Facebook, Twitter and other social media websites. Usually students get involved in unnecessary conversations and discussions on these social sites which leads to emotional stress and hence wastage of time. So, be honest to yourself and uninstall all other apps not related to your board exams to follow your study timetable. What to Study in March During Board Exams : (Give your Best in CBSE Board Exams 2018) NO new chapter should be prepared during board exam period. During board examinations students do not have enough time to study entire syllabus in details. Therefore, they should focus only on the important highlighted concepts and summery of all chapters. Students can use self made notes (which they might have prepared while studying) and the important concepts and Formulae prepared by Moducation Experts. They should also solve CBSE guess papers because guess papers include important questions for CBSE board examination and such questions are asked in board exams. Modulation experts advise you not to read each and every line of NCERT at this stage because it is not possible now. more information visit edulekha ",

I expected a 90+ for SST but ended up getting 81. I gave for verification of marks expecting a raise. Anyway, coming back to the point, how to score 90%+ in boards. As I said it's just simple, you just need to devote extra time for studies and voila it's that simple. I didn't go for any tuition or any other alternate classes but still kinda got this much by just brushing up through NCERT text prior to the examinations. If a normal student like me can score this much then why can't anyone else?? So that's all buddy, what I just want to say is study to face the challenges which come as examinations in our life. Don't see Examinations as a burden nor see it as a piece of shit. Just move on and on to reach higher levels by competing yourself. The higher levels you reach, the more are the chances to achieve your goal. ",

There are few important steps that could be taken religiously to score 10 CGPA:- 1.Rely greatly over your NCERT: It\u2019s may sound hollow to a few but it works wonders, NCERT is the best book for understanding deeper into the subject, give it a try. 2. Have a thorough understanding: Chapters are not about only reading but having a deeper look into it. It is sad but its true that students rote learns subjects, where its clear that at this point understanding is important 3. Read chapters 3\u20134 times: Now this point might upset most of the students, they think that if they read there NCERT again and again how would they move on further, well you might not understand this thing but it really comes handy, there are many questions that are asked directly through a given paragraph and the point is they don\u2019t even change its language and by just reading you may remember the whole para 4. Practice as much as you can: \u201cPractice makes a man perfect\u201d is not only a proverb but also true in our practical lives, practice sample papers as much as you can and try relying on previous years board question papers and ulike. That\u2019s all, but follow this steps religiously Good Luck For Your Exam ",

Go through the NCERT books thoroughly. After you are done with that, opt for Oswaal Books Question Banks. They are detailed in nature. It contains Chapterwise and Topicwise presentation for systematic and methodical study. Practice previous years question papers. It will help you boost up your confidence. You will get to know the question pattern and also where you are lacking and what are your weaknesses. Never try and sit with one subject for the entire day. Mix-match that is, pick two subjects for a day and work on every subject with divided time. This reduces the boredom as well as enables you to finish the portion simultaneously with all subjects, in a planned way. Always write and learn. By this, you will not forget things easily. Plus, do not mug up anything rather than understand the concept. Just focus and study smart. Have a positive attitude and believe in yourself. All the best! ",
