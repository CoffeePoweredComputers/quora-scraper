            "answer_text": "Because they are private, there is often a lack of socioeconomic diversity, which can be rather annoying/frustrating at times. There is some diversity, but the majority of students tend to be better off, financially and come from middle to upper class backgrounds. They also tend to be pretty small in student population, so if you have an awkward experience with another student, it's not at all unlikely that you will run into them again. I'm sure there are more that people can come up with, but these are really the only ones that come to my mind when I just consider my experience so far at a liberal arts college (I'm in my 2nd year).  Honestly, I could tell you many, many more positives about liberal arts colleges (though they may just come down to my preferences; the downsides I listed above may also just be the result of my personal values, but I think that they are generally considered to be downsides by most people). To be honest, I can't imagine having a college experience that didn't include some of the things that I've been able to do/experience so far at a liberal arts college. forming friendships with and strong relationships with professorsopportunities to do paid summer research (I'm not sure if this is exclusive to liberal arts schools; it might not be)the ability to pursue a double major in philosophy and biology (which is what I am doing)small class sizes; interactive classes and class discussionsall classes are taught by professors, not TAs (I think that this may vary from college to college though)So I guess it really depends on the things that you value and want to be a part of your college experience.

            "answer_text": "Depending on who you ask, some of these may be positives:  Classes vary from small to tiny, which means no Harvard lectures where half the students don't show up. If you miss even a single class, expect to be contacted by a professor about it. Miss a few, and you may be forced to drop the class. Small classes means no anonymity. Many students like large lectures where they can just blend in, and you won't be able to do this as easily at a liberal arts college (LAC).While research universities almost always include some practical skills in their curriculum, LACs teach almost exclusively liberal arts (no accounting, etc) so marketing your skills directly out of college can be tricky.Recruiting for jobs is limited, or more often, non-existant because firms would rather spend their time and money at a school with more students to consider, even if it means going to a much less respected/selective university.The general populace hasn't heard of your LAC, only companies and the well-educated have.Limited diversity of opinions and size of interest groups.Less of an emphasis on sports.Usually there's no access to graduate courses, though normally senior-level coursework is about that level anyway.Location. Rarely are LACs in a major city.LAC professors are excellent teachers, but don't expect them to be world-class researchers. Their research output will likely be low in both volume and impact.Of course, there are many more! ",
