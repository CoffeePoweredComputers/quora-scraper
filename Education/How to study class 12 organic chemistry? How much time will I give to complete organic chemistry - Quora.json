            "answer_text": "Organic Chemistry is the most beautiful topic( I really mean it) that you will encounter in your 12th class syllabus. Logic and Qualitative reasoning is enough to get a strong grip in this topic. NOTE : Do not ever, ever by-heart [ON A SERIOUS NOTE] the reactions given[JUST FORGET THE ROTE WAY OF LEARNING THIS TOPIC].Be comfortable with your 11th organic material throughly, because it contains the most important fundamental concepts which help you to ace through the 12th organic syllabus.This topic revolves around probability. You will encounter ways through which one reaction can yield different products. So, you need to : Ask yourself ..what would happen if this molecule reacts at site A(say this gives product 1) or at a different Site B(say gives product 2)?THINK\u2026why does this reaction give more of product 1 rather than product 2?Consider different paths through which the reactants can react\u2026 again question yourself why one path is more feasable than the other?\u2026consider different cases and explore.NAMED REACTIONS : This is the part where you have to remember the names of reactions\u2026.but don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get through this naturally by solving plenty of problems\u2026 However, I would recommend preparing a cheatbook containing (should contain no reaction mechanism) NAME OF THE REACTIONREACTANT AND SUITABLE CONDITIONS ( TEMPERATURE, CATLYST, ETC )AND ONLY THE PRODUCT.(If you had put your efforts sincerely, you will be able to imagine the reaction mechanisms just by looking at the reaction name or the question presented.) MOST CRUCIAL PART: Deducing and understanding the mechanism of the reaction by thyself . Once you become familiar with how things work, you will be able to cruise through organic smoothly. PRACTICE: I would recommend you to solve conversion from one compund to other a bit more extensively as this boosts your creativity, makes you comfortable with reagents and gives you a deeper insight. Apart from that solve all the questions behind NCERT as well as JEE MAINS questions. PS : Each new topic is linked with the previous one..so revise the previous topics frequently\u2026everything is linked PPS : The thinking skill that you develop while solving quality questions in organic helps you in other subjects too!

            "answer_text": "L.G Wade is one of the best books regarding organic chemistry. You can prefer it along with NCERT course book. Atleast try to complete one topic a day. Likewise you can go through the name reactions(ex: Hoffmann bromamide, Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky etc) and try to get them by heart as JEE focuses on these reactions. As for I said L.G Wade will be helpful for extensive study. ",
