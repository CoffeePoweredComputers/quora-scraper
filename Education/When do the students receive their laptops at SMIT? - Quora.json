You can expect getting your Laptop during October-november. Usually they distribute it in slots like Section A getting it first and so on. Do get a laptop lock, they will ask for it while haning you the laptop. ",

So in all probability, you too will get it in December. P.S. Don\u2019t get fooled when you\u2019re seniors suddenly tell you in Mid-October that the laptops are being distributed in bizarre places such as the Director\u2019s Chamber or in the Common Canteen. It\u2019s definitely a hoax! ",
