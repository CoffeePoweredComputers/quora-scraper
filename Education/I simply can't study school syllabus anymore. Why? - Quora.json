It could be for many reasons It\u2019s boring as hell.If it\u2019s boring then it won\u2019t take a genius to figure out that you don\u2019t like it.This is my case in History and Geography:I have to learn a lot of shit about the Altai mountains and all that,nowhere near interesting.(This can also translate to \u201cNot interested\u201d.Which is the same thing as it would only appear boring to a person if s/he doesn\u2019t have an interest in it.Good but the method of teaching is shitty.This could be due to a bad teacher or some other reason,such as the book not using any pictures whatsoever.You want to do something else Another big reason.Sometimes,it\u2019s not bad,but you gotta/wanna do something else:and you simply procrastinate.I would not advice you to not-procrastinate,I\u2019m the 3rd in my class and was the 1st last year but still procrastinate,it gives relief and sometimes,a good break,I wasn\u2019t born to study my school\u2019s shit!Remember this:If you mess up with grades/marks once,that is not the end of the world. Also, \u201cBe yourself,you only get to live once,and this little life isn\u2019t gonna give you a moment to waste.\u201d If you\u2019re low,listen to this song  The Script-\u201cHall of Fame\u201d,Featuring Will.I.Am. Some lyrics Yeah, you can be the greatestYou can be the bestYou can be the King Kong banging on your chest You can beat the worldYou can beat the warYou can talk to God, go banging on his door You can throw your hands upYou can beat the clock (yeah)You can move a mountainYou can break rocksYou can be a masterDon't wait for luckDedicate yourself and you gon' find yourself (Chorus) You can go the distanceYou can run the mileYou can walk straight through hell with a smile You can be the heroYou can get the goldBreaking all the records they thought never could be broke Yeah, do it for your peopleDo it for your prideHow are you ever gonna know if you never even try? Do it for your countryDo it for your name'Cause there's gonna be a day... Hope it helped. ",
