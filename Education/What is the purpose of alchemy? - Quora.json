            "answer_text": "Alchemy is a spiritual practice involving the transmutation of low vibration to high vibration. \u201cLead\u201d and \u201cgold\u201d are metaphorical states of being, with \u201clead\u201d being the lowest state and \u201cgold\u201d being the highest state. Think of the archetypical Hero\u2019s Journey. The hero usually starts out in a \u201clow\u201d state of some kind. Maybe they\u2019re just an average human who feels like they can\u2019t make a difference in the world, or stuck in the grind of everyday life, or stuck in a bad life circumstance, or emotionally devastated, etc. Throughout their adventure and the various encounters that they have, they change. The hero usually ends their journey in a state of perfection or even divinity, experiencing a literal or figurative apotheosis (sometimes involving a return from death), and they are often more powerful, more mature, and more self-aware than they were. This is transmutation. Somehow, I came upon the realization that the experience of living is transmutation \u2014 we are all, in the course of our lives, seeking to obtain some elusive state of \u201cpurity,\u201d whether that be divinity or moral goodness or power or heaven after death. We all want to bring ourselves up. I believe that we are here on this earth because the experiences we have in life, no matter how plagued with suffering they may be, are designed to further the growth of our souls over the course of many lifetimes until we reach a state of divinity, perfection, nirvana. Alchemy is the meaning of life. Yeah, I realize I just said that. As for what that transmutation really consists of, I think it\u2019s a number of things. Self-knowledge in particular is incredibly important, at least in my opinion. Reconciling the dualities inherent in the self is part of that. Also part of that is clearing spiritual baggage that\u2019s holding you back, which is a lot easier said than done. The self-knowledge part is easy for me by now, but transmuting the unnecessary suffering that I inflict upon myself is harder, even though it seems like it would be easier. I still don\u2019t really get practical alchemy. I have a book on it, and I keep meaning to really go through it and attempt to make sense of it. Maybe practical alchemy is just a tool, a physical anchor that one can attach one\u2019s spiritual practice to, in order to make it more concrete. It\u2019s always easier to interact with something tangible rather than intangible. But I\u2019m going to stay far away from anything involving mercury \u2014 my mother played with raw mercury on her hands back before its dangers were known, and now I\u2019ve got loads of mercury in my bloodstream that I\u2019m trying to get rid of. Oh well. Maybe I\u2019ll experiment with practical alchemy eventually, once I actually know more about Hermeticism, but I think that what really matters is the spiritual aspect of it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Alchemy is a Western meditative practice akin to chakra exploration. I rate it as no more and no less \u2018valid\u2019 than chakra work. Good for getting your feet wet and learning to appreciate the subtleties of inner mental states. But not quite at the level of the Law of Attraction or Intention / Manifestation. The latter two have you actually affect the world through your actions and will. Alchemy / Chakras, when done properly, allow you to gently find an inner equilibrium and can serve as an excellent jumping off point for more \u2018serious\u2019 spiritual practice. I could scour Amazon for a \u2018decent\u2019 alchemy book to start with, but honestly you can do this yourself. Just go to a bookstore or library, and start looking through the books that interest you. One of them will reach out and \u2018grab\u2019 you. That\u2019s the one you want. When I was younger we didn\u2019t have this magical Internet thing to tell us the \u2018right\u2019 way to do things. You just had to make do with your intuition and, if you were lucky, a local teacher. I had both, and I have to say, one\u2019s own intuition is the best possible guide. ",
