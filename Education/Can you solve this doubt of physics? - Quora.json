            "answer_text": "By taking AO you cannot apply Biot Savarts law as applied above ,you can apply it only for a straight conductor of finite or infinite length if  the length you are considering is [between the conductor and the point where you want to calculate the magnetic field ]PPERPENDICULAR to the direction of flow of current in the conductor .as you can see if you take AO as the lenght,the lenght or distance  you are considering isn't perpendicular to the current carrying conductor [or the current in conductor] ",
