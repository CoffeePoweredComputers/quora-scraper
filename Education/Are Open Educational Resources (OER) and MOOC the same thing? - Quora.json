MOOCs, on the  other hand, are courses and a new model of teaching on-line to a wider  audience. So, the question is where the confusion arises from? Probably  the answer is in the word \u201cOPEN\u201d, which is there in both the terms.In OER, the word \u2018Open\u2019 refers to the \u2018content\u2019 of  the course or \u2018learning material\u2019. The author allows you to reuse,  revise, remix and redistribute the content. Further, the OER content is  open to the extent that you are free to do some ot more of these without  paying any fee or any royalties.On the other hand, the word \u201cOpen\u201d in MOOC means  that the Course is open to any one i.e. any one can take the course  online. It does not say anything about the content of the course that  may or may not be have an open license. ",
