            "answer_text": "No assaulting someone and beating someone up in a professional setting such as student teacher is not the best approach. It is an approach that would ideally land the assaulter in prison. If the laws would not land the assaulter in prison, the person beating up children will have to live with the fact they are an adult, who beat up children. I\u2019m not sure of the age of the kids, but usually attendance tied to grades works. If kids are not taking school seriously at all and not showing up, it may be many things. First of all maybe they HAVE been hit in school by teachers which would cause a form of PTSD. I certainly would not want to attend a school where I was physically assaulted - being truant would then be a healthy reaction for unhealthy circumstances. Maybe some of the children have issues at home? Maybe the culture (again I don\u2019t know where you live) isn\u2019t valuing education and there needs to be a systemic solution. But I can tell you - i would not want to go anywhere I was hit. ",

As far as truancy is concerned, from my own experience, I was caught cutting class in middle school(grade 7 or 8) school called my dad\u2026I received a good hard bare bottom belting when he got home\u2026.I never cut or missed a day of school after that\u2026all through high school and college. So it worked for me. ",
