            "answer_text": "My examination was on 7th January (1st shift), my test centre was about 27 km from my home so had to wake up at 5:00 am. I didn't have the best sleep and was feeling nauseous, and man this really affected my paper. After reaching centre on time and completing all the registration process I had to sit in front of the computer screen with the timer of the beginning of the exam reading 1h 10 min. Meanwhile I was still struggling with my nausea and went to the washroom 2\u20133 times to ensure that this didn't spoil my exam. When the paper finally began I started with chemistry. Laughed seeing a question from Dalton's law(never expected it to come). While I was still struggling with my nausea which was putting a limelight to my concentration in the paper, I ended attempting 18 questions from chemistry. Began with physics, took me time due to my bad health. My full focus couldn't be on the questions. Attempted 12 and left few questions involving good calculations for the end. The timer read 75 mins when I began with Maths, my relatively weak subject. The questions looked moderate to me and doable too but were quite lengthy and had to leave some questions in between. Just couldn't recall some formulas, like the one in a staistics question in which I needed to apply the sum of squares formula from A.P. Attempted 11. With 30 minutes remaining I started to apply alternative methods to the questions I couldn't do in maths. But then my nauseousness was at its peak and I couldn't help than going to the washroom. It took me 15 minutes there to wipe up. God! I hadn't eaten anything a day before which would affect my health to such level, my health too was good. Luck didn't favour me. After wasting 15 minutes I returned to my computer 15 minutes were left. Couldn't control my anxiety was just stuck between the questions due to the pressure provided by time. Could just add up one question in physics of numerical type. Literally my bad health messed up my jee main. After seeing the memory based solutions getting only 28\u201330 correct out of 42 attempted. Did lots of silly mistakes in maths like in a conics question my answer was -4 but it is actually 4(maybe these errors were due to my poor health due to which I couldn't focus). Getting 95\u2013110 despite scoring 100+ in my mock tests. Don't know what to do with such poor marks. Edit: Getting 88.33 percentile with 76 out of 300 marks. Hoping to improve in April attempt. ",
