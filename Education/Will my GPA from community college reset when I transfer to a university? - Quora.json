            "answer_text": "Will my GPA from community college reset when I transfer to a university? It depends on the University, but I suspect most would accept courses in transfer that were completed successfully with a grade of C or higher, but would not average the course \u201cquality points\u201d (or whatever they are called at your college) from your CC GPA courses into your University GPA. In other words, you would be able to \u201cuse\u201d (that is, transfer) the courses that \u201cfit\u201d into your 4-year degree program, but your GPA would most likely reset. In addition, your CC and University may have an \u201cArticulation Agreement\u201d or a 2+2 contract that works in a different way and guarantees your transfer and credit acceptance to the university. The only people who know for certain are the admissions folks at your University. Give them a call or send an e-mail. ",

            "answer_text": "Your undergraduate gpa stays the same as before and does not reset. All the classes you take at the university, will still contribute to your overall gpa. After your undergraduate bachelors degree, when you start grad-school. Your gpa does reset, you could say. Graduate school gpa is separate from your undergraduate gpa. So you can improve your gpa, during grad-school and then transfer to another university. Using your graduate degree.  If your that worried about your gpa, you could just quit that college, an start at the bottom again. At another university and just not send your transcript. You would be paying out of pocket, unless you done used your aid/scholarships up. ",
