            "answer_text": "Many fields will alter their definitions over time OR have people who propose more than one definition for a concept. With intelligence, for example, many believe \"multiple intelligences\" as discussed by Gardener is a better description of intelligence than the areas that the traditional IQ test evaluates. I think these issues arise more in social or soft sciences than they do in hard or lab sciences like Chemistry or Physics. Main thing is to make sure if there are varied definitions to know how anything you are reading or what is being lectured on is being defined and when you write or respond be clear what definition you are working from.It's just one of the aspects of working in that field that has to be dealt with and when not done well leads to confusion.It's rather like how many people will tell you to \"Take some magnesium!\" Great. There are many forms (with different bioavailabilities), many potential doses, the question of timing, etc. So they may be on the right track, but a person who refuses rather VAGUE advice like that will need to make some decisions in order to comply with the suggestion. Too often terms need to be defined. Get used to making sure they are; if not, define them so people understand what you used as your definition to respond. ",

            "answer_text": "Because social studies is relativistic. History is authoritative and consensus driven. Social studies gives perspectives of a topic and doesn\u2019t present context for those perspectives, and usually paint the person who presents it as enlightened above the past people they study. History uses context to explain how a culture thought and acted. ",
