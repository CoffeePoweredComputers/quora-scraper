            "answer_text": "Education should light a fire in you: a deep need for knowledge, a curse to make you unhappy without it. Technically this is pulling you away from the spiritual ideal of detachment and not being specifically addicted to knowledge and contribution to society\u2026 but we\u2019re talking about school. You can get all your seated meditation done when you own a house. Learning is a side-effect of that addiction, and the knowledge you build up, and the ability to analyze it, critically review it, will just increase. That\u2019s what serves you - your ability to do things that other people value, with information or data that they see is important. Never confuse what other people value (C++ debugging, f\u2019rinstance) with what is truly valuable: keep that hunger stoked. ",
