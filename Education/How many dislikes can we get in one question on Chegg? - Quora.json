Students like or dislike your question based on the quality of answer and the explanation you have given. if it\u2019s a good answer, then the student(who posted the question) will like it and if you provided a bad explanation with probably wrong answer, then the student (who posted the question) will dislike it. You will get more likes/dislikes for the same answer only when some other student who had a similar question or somewhat similar query found your answer. If they find it as good answer with good explanation then they will like it and if not, then they will dislike it. There\u2019s no such \u201cupper cap\u201d for the number of Likes/Dislikes for an answer. it strictly depends on \u201chow many students had the similar query or difficulty on similar concept\u201d. Literally, you may get as few as \u201csingle like/dislike\u201d to the \u201c40\u201350 Likes/dislikes\u201d for the same answer (practically, i have received 35 likes as maximum for one answer in my 2 years of work so far). there is no such limit. this is somewhat similar to \u201cyou will get as many comment/compliment from people as many have tasted your cooked dish\u201d.
