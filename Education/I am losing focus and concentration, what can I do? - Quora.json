            "answer_text": "If you have been living through the era of COVID-19 and coronavirus I can tell you one thing, you do not have to have ADHD to lose your focus and concentration. All of us have been thrown into turmoil during these times and one of the first things to go was our focus, concentration as well as productivity. They have all suffered. Maybe some of us have been able to pivot a little better than others. Such as those who have a Home Office, or flexible working conditions were able to adjust to the times of having kids home and office buildings being closed. But for many of us we have lost our focus during trying times. I feel many of us have taken the time of COVID-19 and have been able to better prepare ourselves for working under uncertain conditions. Many distractions quite frankly are unavoidable and if we're not flexible in some respects we'll never get anything done. And the only thing that will have is frustration. Some of the ways I have been able to improve my focus and concentration include. Tear apart my schedule. I had to completely rip apart my pre COVID-19 schedule that I got used to. Much of it revolves around school or quite frankly a lack of school. As school started in the fall, I needed to adjust the way I created focus days to revolve around the school schedule of my children. However, in short, one of the best ways to create focus is to find the best times of day to be able to work uninterrupted and with minimal distractions. For me, that is early in the morning. Fresh brain time. I mentioned working in the morning and that is when my brain can focus and concentrate the best. I try to get a good night's sleep, and that way my brain is fresh in the morning. It allows me to get in the zone, focus, and create work with less distractions and, less mistakes. I find some of my best work both quality and quantity come when my brain is fresh after a good night's sleep. Clean my desk. Nothing creates distractions and makes me lose my focus more than piles and other things on my desk. They catch your eye, grab your attention, and it is much harder to focus when there's a ton of stuff on your desk. Clean your desk on a regular basis, merge those to do lists into one, and create the optimal working environment so you can focus and concentrate. Get a good workout in. If I cannot concentrate, and I'm distracted by my thoughts, I go and get a good workout in. That can be going to the gym, taking a walk, or anything that helps me clear my head. I find that if I hit the gym for even an hour, I come back and I can really focus, pay attention, and get a ton of work done with a clear head. ",

            "answer_text": "Embrace it. It\u2019s 1:54 am on a Saturday night. I spent my day doing Tort problems from a Bar prep book. I have been struggling in the class and took it upon myself to buy supplement material. I\u2019m only a 1L student, so I don\u2019t necessarily need to think about the bar exam now. But a lot of the questions on exams are recycled old bar exams. I took it upon myself to study directly from the source. I did 40 questions nonstop. My head feels fried. I did a question, answered it and then reviewed the explanation. A lot of the material for the questions, is not a topic we have covered in our class yet. So it is new material I\u2019m learning. After doing said 40 questions, I still feel frustrated. I\u2019ll give you an example. Did you know if you trespass onto someone\u2019s property the \u201cwhy\u201d doesn\u2019t matter. Simply the act that you did it. So a popular question is \u201cif the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages, as a result of trespass, would the court side with the plaintiff?\u201d Logically you would try to find an explanation as to why the defendant trespassed, so it\u2019s not \u201cbad.\u201d But no. That\u2019s the sucker choice. The literal choice is if it can be proven the person intentionally trespassed onto someone else\u2019s property. I nearly started screaming. It\u2019s such a silly yet straightforward concept. So the idea is essentially \u201cdid they do it? Cool, they\u2019re liable for trespassing.\u201d It\u2019s annoying because you have to rewire your thinking process. So far in my classes, we had to dissect cases to understand why the verdict was the verdict it was. You break down the material to it\u2019s basic form to grasp what happened. Torts essentially throws concepts at you and sprinkles subtle tricks that make you want to lose your shit. I stopped the bar questions and decided to continue my outlines. I just have one more class to outline, but I think I will leave that for tomorrow (after I wake up.) I was going to go back to the bar questions. But I decided to take a break for the night. I understand I have a lot to do and cramming it all in one night will do me no good. I got a few quizzes coming up in the upcoming weeks, which will now include essays. Some mandatory workshops to attend. Our first (completed) memo assignment is due this week. I\u2019m literally petrified about it, because I feel like my memo is trash. The professor had some nice comments for my first draft, but ugh, it\u2019s a new concept of writing. It\u2019s so daunting. I always know when to call it quits. I don\u2019t push myself past my capabilities. I know if I push myself past my limit, I will overwhelm myself and my mind will just shut down. I\u2019ll literally just say \u201coh well\u201d and not do it. That mentality will easily get me kicked out of law school (hahahaha.) As a result, I always plan things in advance. I never leave anything until the night before. I understand how powerful panic has on me. So I never allow myself to reach a point, which I cannot control. Memo will finish this weekend. I\u2019ll review essay formats. I\u2019ll do more Tort questions. I\u2019ll catch up on the outline for the last class. I\u2019ll review for the quiz I have Monday. I organize my priorities and act accordingly. The key to managing stress and loss of concentration/focus is knowing yourself. Are you the type of person that thrives under pressure? How do you handle deadlines? What is your work process? Until you know yourself, you will not know how to maneuver your responsibilities. Take the time to learn under what situations you thrive and under what situation you collapse. It can even be a personal experiment. But after you learn about yourself, will you be able to formulate plans on how to work with mental blocks that occur. ",
