            "answer_text": "I think the biggest difference in IQ\u2019s between the actor and the character is Ashton Kutcher playing the stoner doofus, Michael Kelso, on That 70\u2019s Show. Ashton\u2019s IQ has been reported as high as 160, or so. The stark contrast between Ashton and his character is dramatic. The character probably had an IQ around 85\u201390. Maybe lower. Kelso was basically a male bimbo, a \u201chimbo\u201d as Kennedy Kight, shares in the comments below.  Michael Kelso was perpetually confused about everything. I bet he couldn\u2019t make a sandwich. He literally glued himself to a refrigerator!  I don\u2019t know if Aston\u2019s 160 IQ is verified, but there\u2019s evidence he is a highly gifted individual. He testified before Congress, as the founder of an organization protecting children, called Thorn, which now supplies the CIA and other agencies with AI facial recognition software. If you listen to his testimony below, you can sense his deep connection with personal history, a poignant sense of justice, overexcitibilities that nearly bring him to tears when he is angry at injustice he says devastated him. He expresses sincere feelings of honor and gratitude. He shifts quickly from deep dark emotions to being happy and excited about the opportunity to help save to children from slavery. This might be hard to watch for some, but I put it here so you can see what a high IQ person sounds like discussing something they are passionate about:  Rewinding a bit, as an actor, not only did he play a CEO so intently, he ended up in the hospital\u2026  \u2026 but he was a CEO, of Nikon Camera, a $3 Billion corporation. \u2190 Fake News (my apologies), he was just the \u201cface of Nikon\u201d as an endorsement deal. Thank you, Michael Woloch, for the correction!  He\u2019s a celebrated investor in a lot of start-ups and unicorns like Uber.  Rewinding some more\u2026 before becoming an actor, in case you miss it, Jo Kane, says in the comments, \u201cWorth a mention too: Kutcher was enrolled at University of Iowa in a Bio-Engineering degree\u2026\u201d He entered that program wanting to find a cure for his twin brother\u2019s heart disease. He\u2019s still helping to raise millions for cancer research. Later, he dropped out of college to become a male model.  He looks sad, right? Troubled? He didn\u2019t have an easy childhood. Can you imagine what it would be like to grow up so gifted, while your twin brother is bullied and disabled with cerebral palsy and heart disease?  He was married to Demi Moore for a while and I think she\u2019s super smart too.  He\u2019s now married to his costar from That 70\u2019s Show, Mila Kunis, another smartie. Rumor has it they aren\u2019t doing so well with the COVID-19 lockdowns. We are all human beings, no matter how smart we are. Let\u2019s wish them well.  So, it\u2019s pretty clear, Ashton Kutcher ain\u2019t no dummy, but his character sure was.  aaand thennn, As a bonus, here he is in \u201cDude Where\u2019s my Car\u201d playing another total goober.

            "answer_text": "This is an answer about dual cleavage, the dichotomies between flesh and mind, about frustration and whispers. And a fragile flame in a gruesome storm.   DOLPH Ivan Drago was arguably the most formidable adversary Rocky Balboa ever had. Blond, Russian and brain-washed by communism, he was the perfect boogey man brute in the ultimate cold-war-Rocky IV. And afterwards, the giant Swedish man who played the character Drago, never really escaped the stereotyped casting his athletic body always led to. But what next-to-nobody knows, is that this actor \u2014 Dolph Lundgren \u2014 is one of the smartest actors on the big screen. He has a BS and MS in chemical engineering, and \u2014 bells are ringing and trumpets play \u2014 he even received a very prestigious Fulbright scholarship to MIT:[1] Lundgren received a degree in chemical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in the early 1980s and a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney in 1982. Eat that, Balboa !   MARILYN Marilyn inspired people in a mesmerizing way, more than almost anyone else. Maybe only Elvis could cope with her in the last 70 years on the level of magic and pure iconic power. She had it all. The looks, the cleavage, the voice, and what many have never understood: the talent. She understood the magic of the screen like nobody else (except Elvis).  Yes, it has been said that her memory was not that strong, and that she often ran into troubles when saying her lines, but that might also have been the pills she had become so addicted to. Barbiturates. Sleeping pills. Near the end of her life \u2014 which ended after a mere 36 years \u2014 she wanted to break free. She wanted to show the world that she could act in much more subtle, complicated and delicately disturbed roles, and it simply killed her that she was not taken seriously because of her ever-lasting sex appeal.[2] The biggest myth is that she was dumb. The second is that she was fragile. The third is that she couldn't act. She was far from dumb, although she was not formally educated, and she was very sensitive about that. But she was very smart indeed\u2014and very tough. She had to be both to beat the Hollywood studio system in the 1950s. [...] The dumb blonde was a role\u2014she was an actress, for heaven's sake! Such a good actress that no one now believes she was anything but what she portrayed on screen. The woman who defined the term \u201csex symbol\u201d \u2014 and whose defining style is still running big time today on social media in various guises \u2014 kept struggling with that mind of hers, which was more powerful than many of her symbolic heirs will ever understand. She was found dead in the darkest circumstances, and too much has been said by eye witnesses for me to conclude that her death was really of an accidental overdose. Later she became Elton John\u2019s first candle in the wind, way before Lady Diana would enter a new version of the song.   \u201cGoodbye Norma Jean Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered into your brain They set you on the treadmill And they made you change your name\u201d \u201cAnd it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would have liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did\u201d (Candle in the wind, Elton John)  Follow my candles on Quora, at Thomas Cayne !
