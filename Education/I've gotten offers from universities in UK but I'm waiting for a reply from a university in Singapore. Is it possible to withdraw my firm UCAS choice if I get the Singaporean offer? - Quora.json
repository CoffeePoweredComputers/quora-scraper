            "answer_text": "You aren\u2019t very clear about what exactly you have done so far. But it is still several weeks until the May 1st deadline mentioned in Replying to Offers. You should check in UCAS whether you can change your firm acceptance before then. Your offer may be unconditional, in which case you would have made a UF choice, or conditional, known as CF, in which case you may also have made an insurance - CI - choice. Regardless of your grades, conditions are also subject to funding. So even if you have firmly accepted an unconditional offer, nobody is going to expect you to be contractually obliged at the age of 18 to have that funding in place if applying from abroad. Get in touch with UCAS. Don\u2019t be afraid to phone them. They will most likely have an idea of when the Singapore uni (NUS?) will make an offer. If not, contact them to find out when they will. And check deadlines for yourself. ",

Officially, by accepting a firm choice you are contractually obliged to take up the place, but in reality universities will usually release you from a firm offer if you change your mind. ",
