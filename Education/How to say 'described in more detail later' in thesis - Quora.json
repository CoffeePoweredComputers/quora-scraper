            "answer_text": "In your introduction to that section explain what you are going to do. What I mean by this is state that the terms that you use will be explained fully in the next chapter. When you have such terms using a glossary or footnotes can help to stop the explanation interrupting the flow of your writing. If you are still wary of not including a pointer. Then you can phrase it formally. So when you discuss the terms simply put a small explanation line in after them. An example might be: These terms are discussed in more detail on pages X, Y and Z. Or We shall be discussing these terms in depth in chapter X. The only issue that I see is that if the terms are so important you should really describe them earlier in the thesis. If the terms are core terms that the thesis is based on then it will be clear that they will be explained later especially as your introduction will state this and why it is later. ",

            "answer_text": "Explain the terminology well enough in the introduction so that readers will understand your theory chapter.  The purpose of the intro is to summarize and outline the work as a whole, and in practice, is the last part of the thesis you write.  (Although you probably have a draft intro already.)  So as your summarize your theory chapter in the intro, briefly explain the terminology as well.  ",
