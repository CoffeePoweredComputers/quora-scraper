            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s in the west and they have an academic background there is a high chance to this, if they\u2019re in the rest of the world the statement wouldn\u2019t be true anymore. Let\u2019s take this as an example for the the thesis following This Chart Shows Who Marries CEOs, Doctors, Chefs and Janitors there is a bias by evolutionary pressure to marry successful mates as can be seen in that interactive media above (as well as in studies) most women are very unlikely to \u2018downtrade\u2019 partnership material and will chose in their sense of social value \u2018upwards\u2019 now in the west there has been a recent and rather steep downwards development in academic success of young males, which incidentally starts to accellerate at the time traditionally far more women became educators than not, there is also a recent change to include active school participation and proper behaviour with a higher weight than exams and tests, ever since there have been considerably more young men who will not finish school or with the worst possible outcome, giving up on doing anything for society, but this is not about them this is about the few ones that become academics in america there are currently over 2 million more female academics than male academics, it is similar in europe (overall a lot more female academics than male ones) in most \u2018traditional\u2019 male fields women make the majority of students, in germany in medicine for example this is true for all fields but neurochirurgy and heartchirurgy (as well as related) probably due to the hormones that ravage each sex and choices people make in life so we have considerably more female academics with high expectations of a good mate as well as a relationship in a way they like this clashes with considerably less men to chose from which because they are the more sought after commodity due to their looks, academic success, intelligence, etc will be less willing to deal with \u2018subideal\u2019 mates and might run at the first few problems because there are so many more women of status who express interest in him when we look at the US population which is only 318 million this is a rather big number which is ever increasing more expedient (the two million difference now, there is already a million difference for the next iteration of students and this will increase) so with these demographic problems in the west there is less likelyhood for educated or intelligent women to be married, this can be seen in schoolteacher statistics and how often they are married (imagine how these people behave towards children of cultures they belief to be towelheads that mistreat women and how that sets these young people for life, at least in my country it\u2019s a problem that made it even to the media) if we look at other countries or continents like fewer parts of asia and a lot of parts of africa we will also notice that there are more female academics than male, but they chose what they study and how they marry based on completely different socioeconomic pressure/culture so they do not have the same problem. Especially in Afrika it\u2019s popular that the men work and support while the women get the chance to study and there are african countries where there are more women in parliament as well as academics and they do not suffer at all from our western problems, even tho in some countries it is starting like South Africa with the Fallist movement which is a spawn of western movements. They want to abolish colonial science and philosophy as well as medicine and education because these systems can\u2019t even explain how black magic witches kill people with lightning as well as being patriarchic and enslaving mentally.

            "answer_text": "Yes. For a variety of reasons. To begin with, there is a phenomenon called \u201cassortative mating\u201d: people tend to mate with partners with similar personality traits. High IQ people usually belong to certain personality types.  Pretty much all of these personality types are relatively rare, so that is the first big obstacle in finding a partner.High IQ people are usually highly passionate about what they do. They might easily miss other compatible people who are passionate about something completely different (say, movie making, a certain sport, astrophysics or linguistics)High IQ might for the same reason not consider less intelligent people of compatible personality types as partners if they don\u2019t find common ground.A lot depends on the environment. If high IQ people work e.g. in academia it might be relatively easy for them to find a partner (NB: the majority of people would have found a partner much earlier, say in the last years of high school).If a high IQ person lives, say in a small village, they might never find a partner, particularly if they are female. This would be the typical old spinster from in the olden days.

            "answer_text": "Less than who? Other unintelligent women? Or intelligent men? Intelligent women face the same challenges as anyone else, such as prejudice and sexism. And what works for others also works for them, self love, optimism and willingness to share their life with someone. Marriage does not require people to be dumb. What it does need is two partners who love and respect each other and treat each other as equals. Being intelligent and compassionate are not mutually exclusive. By that measure, intelligent women are just as capable of making a marriage work as any other person. Such statements are said to pacify ginormous male egos by men and women alike. The only truth that can be inferred from such beliefs is that intelligent women are definitely more likely to show a male chauvinist his real place, rather than the throne he imagines himself entitled to.

One time on the subway I saw a young woman who was obviously a high-powered lawyer or consultant heading out to the airport, and she was engaged in very earnest conversation with a young man in a working-class uniform with a sewed-on nametag that might have said \u201cBill\u201d or \u201cJames\u201d or \u201cRaoul\u201d. She was very pretty, and I was much impressed that she seemed to think that this young man was worth her time. I would have been much appreciative of an introduction to her, but I happened to have been married at the time. ",

In this world no one is perfect, be it a man or a woman. Intelligent men tend to make allowances for imperfections and have no problems in comprising for the sake of a good, healthy and long lasting relationship. Intelligent women, on the other hand are very fussy about what they want and as a result they drive away potential partners. ",
