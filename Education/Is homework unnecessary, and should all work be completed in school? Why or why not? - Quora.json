            "answer_text": "As a teacher and also earlier as a computer tech for a large computer company there is the expectation to get things done within a certain amount of time. Some of the work (computer tech) has been rated to take no longer than X, and you are expected to move onto the next piece of work at that time. So as a teacher or as a computer tech if I was not getting it done at work I took it with me. Its surprising to me that no one questions the amount of \u201chomework\u201d teachers do - that some of it may be excessive. And teachers need to have a healthy work play balance like anyone else. Though as one of my professors told me -\u201d teachers are in control of what they do, so they do it to themselves.\u201d For my engineering and woodworking classes, because of the software and hardware involved outside of class work means after school time in my classroom. Advanced Placement classes are supposed to have the same work level as college, so students picking these classes are asking to have that amount of work. Problem is that colleges have class time and lab time, high schools do not. So some of the work has to be done outside of class - homework. Some classes seem to need repetition for some of the students but not all. Those who do no need it will finish quickly and those who do will spend the time needed for them to develop the objective skill. And there is nothing worse than having a large portion of your class doing nothing while the rest are working. The other problem is the amount of information in some content areas that is expected to be covered. The time frame hasn\u2019t changed for years, so how do you justify not teaching some part of the content area because the teacher is not going to give homework assignments. And then the next teacher is caught with having to discover how far the previous teacher got. Then because of no homework throughout their time in school we stop graduating students until they are done at age 20? Now with that said do some teachers give an excessive amount of homework. Yes, a few. It would be great if teachers could create a method of giving only the homework necessary to those who need it. But the electronic grading systems are setup for the teacher to assign an activity to the class as a whole. Some are marginally flexible so that the teacher can exempt some students from having to do that activity. But then administrators ask for explanations about why this student did not have to do some activity. And it increase workload to single out 25% of your 130 students. ",
