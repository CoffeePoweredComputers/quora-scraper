            "answer_text": "For ambitious guitarists, I would suggest the Berklee Books written by William Leavitt. I learned how to read music notation by reading his collection of three books. The books are informative, challenging and empowering. His approach to teaching is based on his original compositions that demonstrate concepts and techniques that empower guitarists. He does not mince words. He also states that you do not learn music by playing old favorites. (Old favorites got me started.) All the music in the three-book series was written by Leavitt. His insights are effectively communicated. I bought the series books decades ago and I use them to shake off the cobwebs when I get too complacent. I play acoustic and electric guitars. I play pop, rock, jazz fusion and some metal. It is good practice to review your musical experiences to keep your style and abilities fresh. Berklee College of Music is in Boston Mass. ",
