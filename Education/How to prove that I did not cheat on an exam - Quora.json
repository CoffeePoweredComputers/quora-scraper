            "answer_text": "During the examination ,you should keep yourself  calm and not argue with the invigilator if he/she suspects that you are cheating .You should softly talk with the teacher keeping in mind not to disturb others , and try to convince teacher that you are not carrying chits or using mobile or copying from the students around .You may allow the teacher to check you ,your belongings if needed .Never lose temper or argue with the teacher in such cases ; the scenario may change itself- you may score more than the student from whom who were suspected cheating !! Most importantly need not argue to prove yourself right if you are honest as these marks will remain as numbers in reportcards ; all dat matters will only be how much knowledge you gained !! Good luck !! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are concerned about this happening, I suggest that you raise the issue with the person taking the class in advance and ask advice. One option might be for you to take the exam in a separate room. In that way, you can look around, but would not be in danger of distracting other test takers or seeing their work. That's a common solution when students have medical conditions that mean that they can't concentrate throughout an exam, for example. ",
