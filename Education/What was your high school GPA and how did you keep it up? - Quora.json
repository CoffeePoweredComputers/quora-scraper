            "answer_text": "My school\u2019s grades were on a 100-point scale. Unweighted was 99.54. Weighted was 102.51 (honors and AP classes were multiplied by 1.05). Basically what that means is that the majority of my final class averages were 100s. I was pretty legit back in my day. Here\u2019s how I did it: I was reasonably intelligent to begin with. As a kid, I remember breezing through elementary school with good scores and minimal effort. Even in middle school and high school, I don\u2019t think I found any of the work to be extremely challenging (the amount of work I got in those years was a challenge, but that\u2019s a different story).I paid attention in class (most of the time\u2014but I usually only zoned out if the teacher started going on and on about something I already knew).I asked questions whenever I didn\u2019t understand something perfectly.I did all of my homework, give or take a couple assignments that I couldn\u2019t quite get to because of the sheer amount of work I had to do some nights. Practice probably helped in some cases, and doing my assignments meant that no points would be uselessly deducted from my average.I avoided working in groups whenever possible (though that may have been partly due to a combination of introversion and social anxiety). In groups, you\u2019re not really doing everything and thinking it through by yourself; I liked working alone because it gave me the chance to go through every thought process on my own, without the distractions of other people and the stressed-out, rushed feeling that comes along with being in a group.I ran. A lot. I\u2019m not sure if this had a huge impact academically, but it helped keep down some of the stress, since it gave me a couple hours a day to think about something other than school (plus running = endorphins = basically getting high without drugs that kill your brain).There were lots of late nights and occasional tears, but I eventually pulled through. Keeping up your average isn\u2019t easy, even if the work itself is, because in order to have a high average you need to make sure that all of your homework is complete (in my school, anyway)\u2014and when you\u2019re in a lot of honors or AP classes, you get homework a lot. With that, I wish good luck to all of you who are still in high school! ",

            "answer_text": "I went to a normal public high school in the US. It seems like some people are giving some answers that only apply to a small percentage of high schoolers when in fact the majority go to a school like mine.I had a 4.1 weighted GPA at the end of my senior year, can't remember what my unweighted GPA was, but it was around 3.8. I only got a B in a class four semesters. The rest were A's. Here is my advice: 1. Get on your teachers' good side- I cannot stress this enough. Arrive on time to class, listen attentively, ask questions, pretty much become the teachers best student. If the teacher likes you, when you need to turn in that assignment late because you forgot it in your printer, they are more likely to let you. 2. Don't overload yourself with hard classes-I took two honors classes junior year, because I knew I could handle them and still get near straight A's. (I say near because honors chemistry was so damn hard, two of my B's came from that class, but the upside is it prepared me very well for college chemistry. ) 3. Don't give up if you think a class is too hard- There was this English class I had in sophomore year. The teacher was known for being super tough, very few people got an A in the class. I didn't give up though, did extra credit, had him read my essays, got on the teachers good side. Although I got a B first semester, I scored an A the next. 4. Study hard- This one\u2019s kind of self explanatory. People always talk about eating a good breakfast, a good nights sleep, but the bottom line is if you don't know the material, you're done. ",
