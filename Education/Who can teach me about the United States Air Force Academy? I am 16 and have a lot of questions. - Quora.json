            "answer_text": "Hi there, I'll take a quick stab at answering your questions as I went there and graduated in 2003. To answer your first question, upon graduation from the Air Force Academy you will owe five years of Active Duty Service Commitment. Then another three where you will technically be on the AF\u2019s books but not directly responsible for working for the AF (if there is a major war or other requirement they could recall you to service\u2014VERY slim chance of happening). As far as going to law school, there are a couple of direct entry programs where the AF will pay to send graduates to Master\u2019s programs or specialties. These are very competitive to get, as is everything at any of the Service Academies,and will be given based upon graduate class standing and needs of the AF. As for your resume, I would say leadership is the biggest differentiator for acceptance other than normal competitive college admissions that look for GPA and high standardized testing scores. To get acceptance I\u2019d encourage taking charge of as many activities as you can and demonstrating commitment and being able to show leadership aptitude. Things such as being a sports Team Captain, Class Officer, President of Clubs or Organizations, or JROTC/Eagle Scout type recognition. There's a lot of info online if you do your research, but feel free to PM me if you'd like to chat. The Service Academies are an excellent opportunity, but your college experience will be vastly different than a more traditional school. ",

            "answer_text": "The Air Force Academy has Liaison Officers in each state that you can talk to about your questions. You should be able to find out who they are through the academy web site. With regard to law school and other graduate programs, you have a commitment to serve in the Air Force after graduating from the academy and you are obligated to serve that commitment; however, the Air Force does have a scholarship program called \u201cAFIT\u201d (Air Force Institute of Technology) where they will send you on to get a graduate degree in some area. The program is very selective and not everyone is offered that opportunity, it has to be an area that the Air Force needs, and it will increase your commitment to stay in the Air Force. For example, I graduated from USAFA and a year or so later was selected to go to a civiilan college through AFIT to get my Master\u2019s Degree in Engineering. At the time I graduated, all cadets had a four-year commitment to stay in the Air Force and you incurred an additional commitment of three additional years for each year in graduate school. I went to graduate school for a year so I wound up with a total commitment of seven years. As to what they\u2019re looking for - academics, leadership skills, and physical fitness are all very important. Get familiar with the nomination process\u2026you can\u2019t get into the academy without a congressional nomination except in rare cases. That\u2019s a major hurdle to get across. Let me know if you have any additional questions. ",
