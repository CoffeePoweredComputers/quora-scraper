            "answer_text": "I got an Apple Pencil (and the iPad Pro, for that matter) because I wanted to draw with Procreate. Taking digital notes was just a bonus. To be honest, when it comes to note-taking, I mostly still prefer paper. It\u2019s less distracting, both when it comes to writing the notes themselves and when it comes to studying them again afterward. I focus better when I\u2019m on paper. The only scenario where I strongly prefer digital note-taking to paper is when the teacher has uploaded a PDF of the presentation and I want to write my notes on it directly. This happens to me in math and statistics classes but otherwise not much. Evaluate yourself. Do you feel that digital note-taking would be a big help for you as you study? Can it do useful things for you that paper and pens can\u2019t? Can you honestly handle all the extra not-useful things that a digital note-taker offers, namely constantly tempting you with other apps and the internet? If yes to all these things, then the Apple Pencil may be for you. ",

Remember though - you can\u2019t program on an iPad (it matters if you are into Computer Science) or install servers etc. Apart from developer kind-of work, iPad is amazing and Apple Pencil makes a very good companion.
