            "answer_text": "It is a simple discret probability distribution which goes as follows ; If an random experiment consists of n independent trials such that in each trial, probability of success p remains constant , then probability of r success in n trials is given by the formula ; P( X =r ) = C(n, r) (p^r) (q)^(n-r) ; r = 0, 1, 2, \u2026. n and q = (1 - p) denote the prob. of failure. For example prob. of getting 30 heads in 50 tosses of a fair coin is given by ; P(X = 30) = C(50, 30)(1/2)^(30) \u00d7(1 -1/2)^(20). [math]       [/math]= C(50, 30) (1/2)^(50) etc. ",
