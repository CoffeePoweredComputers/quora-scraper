            "answer_text": " The question you asked is a bit vague because the comparison you want is between a private college and a central university. -First of all, I want you to know that Delhi University has 77 colleges within its purview offering different courses. -Delhi University colleges are good depending upon several criteria such as- What is the ranking of a particular college? Is that college known for sciences, commerce, or humanities, Is it an A grade college? -I also want you to know that fees of DU colleges are considerably less than most of the private colleges -Since it is a central university, it is well known and is considered tier-1 in MBA colleges abroad -Now, coming to Amity Noida, here the friend circle you will find would be generally financially better off than in a Government college -Fees would be high but the infrastructure will be far better than DU colleges In the end, the call is upon you to decide as there is no guarantee that a student of a better college will be more successful in his career. It varies from person to person ",

            "answer_text": "Quite easily it is DU. The reasons are simple - at a college in DU, you are living day-in and out with top achievers(maybe there are few others who have had an easier way in but most people are smart ones). Living with them helps one get a better sense of competition and lets you be more aware of opportunities available. We get education to do well in life - professionally,socially and intellectually. Hence, getting admitted to  DU is always going to be a preferred option than getting into Amity. ",
