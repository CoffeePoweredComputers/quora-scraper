            "answer_text": "This is a loaded question, and I commend you for asking. When more teachers begin asking this sort of question, student learning outcomes/GPA's and general student interest will skyrocket. In my opinion. There are a few ways to go, and there is no single magic bullet. Try researching \"best practices\" in student engagement and you may find some names of those who stand out in their profession of teaching. One resource that can provide some insight from the student's perspective is www.ratemyprofessor.com  but the search is rather backward from what you're looking for. Occasionally you'll find raving reviews about how one teacher lectures and what they do specifically. So while it's backwards, if you hear about someone in particular, go look them up yourself! See what you can learn about them by what their students say about them. We need to be aware of our own presence and our own presentation. Yes, we can watch a fascinating lecture from a MIT lecturer who has perfected student engagement, but replicating the steps are not necessarily so simple until you know a little somethings about your own \"stage presence.\" For 5 years I worked at an NPR affiliate radio station and noticed that when I listened to the station while out driving around, many of my colleagues sounded like they were reading a eulogy. It wasn't very interesting at all. Soon we were all mandated to run a skimmer tape of ourselves (records all studio mic audio) and we were to take our tapes home and listen to them. I'm pretty sure that one exercise alone snapped us out of our solemn state. I heard some folks talking about some of the ivy-league institutions that offered MOOC's, some schools were encouraging teachers to take a MOOC so that they could understand the online course process from the student perspective. You will also find some top-notch instructors with some very effective teaching techniques. Granted, some are as boring as you could imagine, so student-beware...they're set up to be self-guided and self-paced, not so much dazzled. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are several free online learning lectures available today. It provides a greater support to the learners. Some of the good online lectures platforms for learning lecturing skills are its passive: Probably the main argument levied against lecture-based classroom styles involves how little it truly engages students. Breaking up the monotony with activities like quick papers, question-and-answer sessions, quizzes and others creates a more dynamic learning environment with memorable content. It doesn\u2019t engage every learning style: Education professionals and students recognize at least four different general learning styles, not all of which benefit from the lecture structure. The most effective classrooms mix up lessons in order to help students with varying strengths and weaknesses soak up content on a more equitable level. Only visual/verbal and auditory/verbal learners get anything out of lectures, so tactile and visual/nonverbal students end up falling behind. ",
