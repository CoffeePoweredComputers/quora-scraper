            "answer_text": "It\u2019s simple. William Shakespeare MAY have been illiterate because he grew up away from the city on a sheep farm. Stratfordians love to claim he was the son of \u201ca glover\u201d which makes him seem more \u201ccitified\u201d. The truth is, documents show his father John Shakespeare claimed to be a glover in 1556 before William was born. But then in 1570, when William was four, according to the Folger Shakespeare library, John Shakespeare is listed as a \u201ctenant\u201d in Ingon Meadow. Then in 1579, John calls himself a \u201cyeoman\u201d or farmer on another deed. Here is what the documented record shows: \u201cAlso of interest is the use of the term yeoman to describe John Shakespeare\u2019s occupation. John\u2019s trade was first mentioned in 1556, when he was described as a glover. In 1561, when granted administration of his father\u2019s estate he was described as a husbandman (agricola), and now, in 1575, as a yeoman, as he was on three subsequent occasions in 1579, 1580 and 1597. This expansion of his business interests is reflected in other evidence that by the 1570s he was involved in significant wool-dealing operations.\u201d Therefore William was living on a farm throughout his boyhood. It makes sense too because Anne Hathaway, also an illiterate, was also living on a farm. John Shakespeare had acted as surety for her father Richard Hathaway when William was just two years old. And two farmers had acted as witnesses for William\u2019s marriage to Anne Hathaway\u2014 NOT two townspeople. Two townspeople makes sense if William is living in the town (like the schoolmaster and a Latin instructor or private tutor.) But no such thing. Only farmers. Farmers did not need to read or write, and yes William could have learned how to read at a much later age. The problem is that the works of Shakespeare contain so much classical knowledge as well as knowing how to translate Latin to English, Italian, and astronomy that it is obvious to anyone who studies the Authorship evidence that the reason there is no proof that William Shakespeare went to school or learned how to read/write in Latin is because he never did.

            "answer_text": "There are people who do not like the idea that a commoner could write wonderful plays about royalty. (Many of these people think of Shakespeare as a lower class peasant. He was not. He was a member of the middle class.) They like to imagine that the true author of Shakespeare\u2019s plays was really someone else. This makes them feel superior, because they think they have figured out a mystery. They haven\u2019t. They are just wacky conspiracy theorists on this issue (although their members include Mark Twain, Sigmund Freud and Malcolm X). Many of them feel that in order to prove their theory, they must show that Shakespeare must have been utterly incapable of writing the plays attributed to him. The most ardent argue that he was not even literate. Their chief argument seems to be that they find his signatures hard to read. They argue bad penmanship is proof of illiteracy. Really. They do. I know it is hard to believe, but they actually do make this argument.. It wasn\u2019t even bad penmanship. Shakespeare\u2019s signatures were written in what is known as \u201csecretary hand.\u201d Secretary hand looks different from 21st century handwriting. ",
