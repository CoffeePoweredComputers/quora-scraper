            "answer_text": " We have a presidential election coming up. The Democrats have more than twenty candidates vying for the privilege to be their party\u2019s nominee. Since everyone loves Santa Claus, a popular tactic of the left is FREE STUFF. Most of the candidates are proposing, at a minimum, free tuition at public colleges and universities. What could possibly go wrong? Underemployment Today college grads are a dime-a-dozen. Every year around 1,900,000 shiny new bachelor\u2019s degrees are conferred. These proud graduates find themselves in a fierce competition for a limited number of well-paying, professional jobs. About 1,100,000 are successful in \u201cscoring\u201d one of these jobs. The rest end up making lattes. I\u2019m just going to make a wild guess. Let\u2019s say making college free results in 200,000 more college graduates every year. Duh! There are still only about 1,100,000 suitable jobs. The Deterioration of a College Education Over the last sixty years there has been a steady deterioration in the quality of a college degree. I suggest you read Academically Adrift for the details. One of the major contributing factors is the decline in the academic ability of the average college freshman. In the US almost anybody, whose parents have a checkbook, can find a college that will accept them. Only seven percent of colleges and universities are selective to any great extent, i.e. an acceptance rate of less than 50%. I don\u2019t have a breakdown between public and private, but you only have to skim down the list of the best public college and universities to #24. The acceptance rate is SEVENTY PERCENT. https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public Sixty years ago only 7% went on to college. They tended to be the academically elite. The unwritten rule of thumb was the top 10%\u2014an IQ of 120. Imagine you are teaching that class. Today every Tom, Dick, and Harriet (45%) goes to college.  Look over your right shoulder. That guy behind you in English 101 thinks Catcher in the Rye is a book about baseball. Now, imagine teaching that class. Opening up college to everyone is just going to exacerbate the deterioration of the quality of a college education. Every year twenty-five percent of the freshman class needs one or more remedial classes. What\u2019s that number going to be when college is free. Closing of Many Private Colleges and Universities Many of our best schools are private. This sector competes with the public schools, largely based, on a tenuous \u201cprestige\u201d factor. When option A charges $30,000 a year for tuition, but option B is free tuition, hundreds of private colleges and universities will have to close. I\u2019m not a big fan of paying for prestige, but the closure of these schools is not a good thing. Conclusion Repeat after me, \u201cCollege is NOT for everyone.\u201d \u201cFree\u201d college for all is a spectacularly bad idea.

            "answer_text": "This can\u2019t be answered in general. One question is: disadvantages for whom? If you can\u2019t afford higher education at all, obviously it\u2019s better to have it for free than not to have it. Conversely some people don\u2019t work as hard when it\u2019s free, and would work harder if they knew it was costing them (or their parents) thousands of dollars a year. So the question is: are you talking about people who could afford it if it weren\u2019t free, or about people who couldn\u2019t afford it at all? In some situations free higher education might mean the institution can\u2019t afford expensive equipment (necessary for laboratory sciences for instance), while a university that\u2019s expensive might be privately funded and wealthier. As for disadvantages of free higher education at a university with a sufficient public subsidy and private funds? Can\u2019t think of any. ",
