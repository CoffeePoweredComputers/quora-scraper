            "answer_text": "I\u2019m 15 and I have moved 31 times. I\u2019ve lived in 4 countries. Which are: Ireland(8\u20139years), Germany(1 month) , Philippines(Several months), and USA(almost 4 years). All of these are in order. And now to connect them all together. I was born and mostly raised in Ireland, born in Dublin and raised in Dundalk and Dublin, its half in Dublin and half in Dundalk. At the age of three I moved with my mom to Frankfurt, Germany. We were staying with my aunty.2.And then moved back to Ireland, where my sister was born.And then at age 4+ we moved to Illigan, in the Philippines, stayed with me and my sisters grandparents, my sister was almost 1 at this time.And then moved back to Ireland. And then we moved around a bit in Ireland. Than in 2014 we moved to the United States.5. We were staying in St. Charles for a week plus. In our Uncles sisters apartment. 6. And then we moved to another house that we rented in St. Charles. 7. After that we moved to West Chicago, with a friend of my moms. 8. Then we moved to the country side of Poplar Bluff in Missouri for like 3 weeks. 9. And then we moved to Jacksonville, Florida. Where we stayed in motel 6 for like a month. It was there where my mom married an American. 10. And then we moved to a trailer in Jacksonville and rented it for like 6 months. 11. And then we moved to another trailer in the same trailer park. We moved because we were running out of money so we stayed in a room in a guys trailer. 12. And then we moved to a farm in Keystone Heights. 13. And then stayed in Gainesville, in a apartment. 14. And then moved back to the farm in Keystone Heights. 15. And then we moved back to the same house we rented in St. Charles. And stayed there longer than the last time which is about 2 months. 16. And then we moved back to the same house again in West Chicago. 17. And then we moved to my moms best friends house in Visalia, California. 18. Then we stayed in a distant relatives house in Elk Grove, California. 19. And then we were kicked out, so we stayed for a month in this nice El Salvadorian lady\u2019s house in Sacramento. 20. And then we moved back to the house we were kicked out of in Elk Grove. And then we went homeless for a little while. 21. And then moved to an apartment that we rented for 2\u20133 months in Sacramento. It was there where my mom and stepdad separated and then later on divorced. He couldn\u2019t take the moving and there was too much stress. 22. And then we moved to a mansion in Wayne, IL. It was the same woman who owned the house from West Chicago that we stayed in 2 times. But she moved to Wayne, and got a 12 bedroom house with a indoor pool and huge land. And then from fights between my mom and her we left. 23. We left to Scottsdale, Arizona. We stayed in someone\u2019s house for a month. 24. And then we moved to a hotel for 3 months in Scottsdale. 25. And then we rented an apartment in Scottsdale for a couple of months. 26. And then we moved to Brookfield, IL. Where we rented for like 2 months. 27. And then we moved to Woodridge, IL. Where I\u2019m currently staying right now. 28, 29, 30, 31. The four other times were when we moved back in forth in Ireland. Now I could of moved more in my life that I don\u2019t know of. But these are the ones that I remember and have confirmed with my mom. I moved a lot in the USA but also a LOT in Ireland. So yeah, like I said it could be more. And now time to introduce myself. My name is Gabriel and my sister is Angelic but Angel for short. I am half Irish and half Filipino. My dad is Irish and my mom is Filipino. In my life my dad was never really there, he visited now and then but was never really there. I hope you enjoyed my life story. But this is only a quarter of my life. But still I hope you enjoyed. ",

            "answer_text": "I have moved a few times in my life. In the early years of my life my biofamily moved to 3 different places around Brisbane QLD. Then, between age 7 to 9 we lived at Palm Beach on the Goldcoast. The family moved to Kingscliff NSW for one term during year 9 at school before shifting back to Palm Beach Goldcoast. Two months before my twin and I\u2019s birthday I was put into fostercare in Lismore NSW and stayed in the Northern NSW area. I was moved to 3 more homes until I found my forever home. When I moved out of the fosterhome I lived in a shared house with several other people. It was horrible as I waa being \u201ctouched up\u201d by this man who didn\u2019t understand english very well. I moved out soon after. I stayed at my exfoster parents place until I found a unit to move into. I have been at this unit for almost 6 years now. So by my count at 27 yro, I have lived at 12 different places. ",

            "answer_text": "1&2) My family moved twice when I was less than 3 years old (I don't remember the first two houses I lived in.) We stayed at the third house until I was 18. 3) We then moved one province over where I stayed with my uncle for a couple of months. I'm counting that as a move. 4) My family then moved into a town home, my mom and brother are still there today. 5) I moved out, by myself, 2 provinces over. I found a basement suite on Kijiji and got the landlord to pick me up from the bus station. It literally had a mattress. I stayed there a month while I found a better place. 6) I moved into another basement suite. The landlady was nice and became my friend. At that time I was considering moving provinces again, so when she got an offer from a coworker, he moved into the basement suite and I moved into a room, becoming her roommate instead. 7) I found another basement suite. It had more space, so I moved. It was a block and a half away. 8) I found a house for rent that had a basement suite. I convinced my best friend to rent it with me. I got the basement suite and she and her husband got the top. That's where I'm living now. Coincidentally, it was 6 houses down from the previous basement suite. So I've moved 8 times, nowhere close to 36. My mom, though, has probably moved 100+ times. Her Dad got bored easily, so her family would sometimes leave after only a month. ",

After that, I moved to another town for university at 20. I spent a month living in an apartment my dad owned, then in the apartment he and his partner shared. Then they rented out a house that I lived in with them, for about a year, until I was 21 and moved out into the university dorm. Half a year later I moved in with my partner, that was in 2014. In 2015 we rented an apartment for a few months, and then moved out. This summer we bought an apartment of our own. This is alltogether 11 times, if my math is right. Chances are I\u2019ll move around some more until I die. ",
