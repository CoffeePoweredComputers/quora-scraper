            "answer_text": "Yes, it is important and has an effect on 12th mark sheet. Many topics of science and mathematics are not in 12thclass, which will be of very importance at college level. If now you get familiar with those topics it may be easier for you in college to grab those fundamentals. I even felt the need to study those books and sometimes regrets for not taking those things seriously when I am having five years of work experience after college and working on high Engineering & Technology job.
