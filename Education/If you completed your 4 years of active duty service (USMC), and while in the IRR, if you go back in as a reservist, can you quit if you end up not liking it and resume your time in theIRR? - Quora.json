            "answer_text": "Usually, the Answer is, \u201cyes, in the circumstances you include, you can be in the IRR and voluntarily join a reserve unit without incurring any obligation or contract to remain, and can transfer back to the IRR at will.\u201d But there are exceptions. The Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) is one of the categories of the reserve component of the US armed forces, along with several sub-categories:[1] [2] Selected Reserve (SELRES)[3] \u2014organized federal reserve and state National Guard units, at all times, including,Inactive National Guard (ING) of the Army National Guard,organized, federally-recognized naval militia units, when taken into federal naval service (only Alaska, New Jersey, New York, and South Carolina currently have such units),individuals, when serving under specific assignments as Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA) to Regular or Reserve units,individuals, when serving under specific assignments as Full-Time Support (FTS) under 10 US Code 12310 status and 10 USC 12301d orders, or Title 32 for National Guard:Army and Air Force \u201cActive Guard and Reserve,\u201d or AGR,Marine \u201cActive Reserve,\u201dNavy \u201cFull-Time Support,\u201d or FTS,Coast Guard \u201cReserve Program Administrator,\u201d or RPA,(Space Force doesn\u2019t [yet] have a reserve component).Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) \u2014 Individual reserve members who are under military contract (or retaining commissioned or warrant officer appointment), but are not members of the Selected Reserve, Standby Reserve, or Retired Reserve.[4] The IRR is a standing manpower pool for both strategic and operational requirements, and consists of both fully trained and untrained members, and includes:trained individuals having completed their contractually obligated Active or Reserve service (such as 4 years of active service or 6 years of SELRES drilling), but not having completed the statutory 8-year Military Service Obligation (MSO) contract,trained individuals having completed their MSO (both officers and enlisted), and voluntarily remaining by enlistment contract or voluntarily retaining a commission or warrant in the IRR,untrained individuals, having signed the MSO statutory contract, sworn the Oath of Enlistment, and awaiting shipping to basic training, commonly known as the DEP, or Delayed Entry Program,[5]untrained or certain trained individuals, having signed the MSO contract, and participating in various officer commissioning programs:Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets and midshipmen with a Secretarial appointment to Office, a contract, and in receipt of financial assistance,[6]Department of Transportation Maritime Administration Strategic Sealift Officer scholarships, the Student Incentive Payment Program,[7]Various other commissioning programs by each Service that require an MSO contract but do not require Regular or SELRES service, such as USMC Platoon Leaders Class, US Army Green to Gold (non-Active Duty Option), USAF Airman Enlisted Commissioning Program, and others.Standby Reserve[8] \u2014 trained reserve members who retain military status but are not qualified as Ready Reserves, and who may or may not be eligible to participate in any reserve training:Active Status List, able to participate without pay, but can be promoted,Inactive Status List, cannot participate in any reserve training, nor be promoted.Retired Reserve[9] \u2014 trained members of any Reserve category who qualify under any law for a military retirement, including:those eligible for a \u201cRegular\u201d retirement, with more than 20 years creditable, federal, active duty,those eligible for a \u201cNon-Regular\u201d (or \u201creserve\u201d) retirement at age 60, with 20+ creditable, federal, reserve qualifying years,[10]those eligible for a \u201c12731b Non-service connected disability\u201d retirement, after a medical board found a permanently disqualifying disability not caused by or aggravated by military service, with 15\u201320 creditable, federal, reserve qualifying years,[11]those eligible for a Permanent Disability Retirement List (PDRL) retirement after a medical board found a permanently disqualifying disability caused by or aggravated by military service, with any amount of creditable, federal service,those eligible for a Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL) retirement after a medical board found a temporarily disqualifying disability caused by or aggravated by military service, with any amount of creditable, federal service, to be re-evaluated annually for up to 3 years, when the determination is to return to full service, or transfer to the PDRL,those eligible for an \u201cHonorary Retirement,\u201d not generally awarded after the 1980\u2019s, and only before that for special circumstances, Notes: The National Guard, although a full reserve component of both the State militia and Federal armed forces, has no federally-recognized Retired Reserve equivalent. Army and Air National Guardsmen eligible to retire under federal laws and regulations are transferred upon retirement from the National Guard to the Retired Reserve lists of the US Army Reserve or USAF Reserve, as applicable. After transfer to the federal Retired Reserve, the former National Guardsman is eligible for the same benefits and status as any other member of the Retired Reserve.Many States maintain a State militia retired list, under State laws, to which any qualified individuals may be transferred or added, with whatever benefits thereto are provided under State law. This includes eligible state naval militia, in those states that have such an organized militia force (AK, CA, NJ, NY, OH, SC, TX), whether federally-recognized or not.Members of the Regular component are retired to the Retired List of the Regular Component, not the Retired Reserve.Cadets and Midshipmen of the Federal Service Academies have an 8-year MSO, but are neither enlisted nor commissioned or warranted officers, although they are appointed to a federal Office by the President or by delegated Presidential authority:US Military, Naval, and Air Force Academies - Cadets and Midshipmen appointed directly by the President, and serve as Regulars,US Coast Guard Academy - Cadets are appointed by the Secretary of DHS or a delegate such as the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and serve as Regulars,US Merchant Marine Academy - Midshipmen appointed by the Secretary of the Navy, into the Navy Reserve, so technically a separate \u201cno-touch\u201d sub-category of the IRR to hold them until they commission. Assuming a member of the reserve component, in the category IRR, having completed their contractually obligated active duty (Regular) or drilling reserve (SELRES) service, wishes to voluntarily join a Selected Reserve unit, which is a separate category of the reserves, they usually do not need a contract that locks them into a specific drilling reserve obligation; they just request to join the SELRES unit. And if they don\u2019t like it, just transfer back to the IRR. Often, there are \u201cReserve recruiters\u201d involved to screen and coordinate with units, verify medical and dental documentation and physical status, tattoos, previous service RE (reenlistment) codes and prior characterization of service, rank and MOS and special skills, etc. If the IRR reserve is joining a unit for a new MOS, or to obtain a reenlistment/affiliation bonus, or to attend a lengthy new school (like for foreign languages, highly technical fields, special operations, etc.), there may very well be some sort of \u201cobligation by service agreement\u201d involved, which is a \u201ccontract within the reserve contract\u201d that obligated the new SELRES member to attend a school, obtain a new skill or MOS, and participate with that SELRES unit for a set period of time, often 2 years of mandatory drilling. But unless the IRR reserve enters into some form of additional obligation to drill, as a fully-trained member of their Service they usually can join a SELRES unit (provided there is a vacancy and a similar MOS requirement at that unit) and \u201ctry it out.\u201d While reserve units would rather not waste time in processing and joining someone just to lose them in a month or 6, they also would rather not have to deal with dead wood or a troublemaker either. Better that such a \u201cnon-obligor\u201d simply request transfer back to the IRR than waste everyone\u2019s time as a lost cause in a SELRES unit. The reserves is confusing even to those who know a lot about it. And, frankly, it isn\u2019t for everyone. And, careful career management may allow a skilled reserve to still participate on their terms (mostly), from the IRR rather than in a SELRES unit, even obtain a reserve retirement (20 qualifying reserve years). Good luck.

            "answer_text": "While I cannot speak directly to the Marines, the Army reserve will allow you to go IRR after serving one full enlistment; with caveats. You have to get your command to agree and sign off on it. So think hard, because if they just spent a bundle of money on you to send you through some high-speed school chances are they will not let you go. Likewise, if you have an MOS that is in short supply but high demand, that would probably also be blocked. After serving active duty I was out for seventeen years before I came back into the service (Army National Guard). I had GREAT reservations and was concerned that I might hate it and get stuck. But I took a chance, and twenty years later I am very glad I did! Good luck, whatever you choose brother. ",
