            "answer_text": "Most of the website worth/valuation tools out there aren't helpful. They scrape for meaningless data and then try to extrapolate a value out of that. The real problem is that the creators of those tools have NO IDEA what websites are worth because they aren't in the industry! I'm a partner at Empire Flippers - we successfully negotiated hundreds of deals worth more than $4.5M in 2015 alone. We thought we could do better so we created a Valuation Tool that actually works: How Much Is My Website Worth? Website Valuation Tool - Empire Flippers The difference here is that we ACTUALLY use this tool to list (and sell) the websites and online businesses that are placed with us. As we sell more than 90% of listings, this tool is pretty accurate. ",
