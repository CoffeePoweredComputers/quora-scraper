            "answer_text": "In Texas, the alternative high school was where students were sent to continue their education as disciplinary action (such as being convicted of a misdemeanor). If a student was in one as a minor, this would not show on their school record. However, uncovering that someone went to one of these alternative schools would lead to a stigma. There was another type of high school for students that did not manage to graduate by 18. It was typically referred to as charter school. However, students with criminal records were not sent there. These older students had a little more freedom and had to behave in a mature manner to deal with it. Graduation from one of those was similar to getting a basic diploma from the high school. ",

My teacher and I had a conversation on my first day about how alternative school IS NOT for \u201cbad kids\" and he's watched so many intelligent, self disciplined, work driven young adults walk out of his school and go on to college after the public school system didn't give them a chance.
