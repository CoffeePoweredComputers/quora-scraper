            "answer_text": "First of all, you will have to gather information for the reasons why the external examination result was good. The first step: decide how you will investigate. Determine the scope of your search. Determine what may have had an influence on the result and include that in the scope. Example: A. What influenced the level of education prior to the examination? B. What influenced the examination itself? C. What influenced the evaluation? (Marking/Master answer sheets) Look at it all three these aspects (A, B and C) from these viewpoints. The educational institution (leadership and staff).The students/learners.The external examination party.The curriculum and examination policies.Other circumstances.Follow policies and procedures where applicable. If none are available you will probably have to clarify who will be assisting you in the process. Gather your thoughts on how you will accomplish the task. It is easier to determine everything in the beginning. Once you start investigating it may complicate the evaluation or even influence the result if things are changed mid-stream. Where you will need feedback from others, give them the same information and questions. It won\u2019t help if you ask one thing from one person, and something else from another. You need to know that your investigation compares apples with apples. Where other people are involved in your investigation, communicate clearly and timeously. Be sure everyone is aware of when their feedback is due. Secondly, do the investigation and gather the information. The third step: Analyze the information. Organize the information by facts and opinions*. Group similar root causes together. Support facts with evidence. * If you are uncertain about a fact, but still regard it important enough to mention, make sure to state clearly that it\u2019s an opinion. Support your opinion by explaining what influenced it. Step four would be the actual writing of the report to your headmaster. Use a simple and uncluttered format. Communicate clearly. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Example: Your contact address Educational Institution\u2019s address starting with \u2018The Headmaster\u2019 Date (of letter) Dear Mr/Mrs ___________ (Headmaster last name/surname) REPORTING ON EXTERNAL EXAMINATION PERFORMANCE RESULTS In response to your request to provide reasons for the (good) performance during the _______ (month) examinations, the following: I\u2019ve investigated the matter carefully and found the following contributing factors: (List the different facts and opinions.) ________ ________ ________ ________ Although most factors were inside our control, areas for improvement was identified. As it is our desire to continue providing quality education I would like to confirm my commitment to help improving our standard where needed. I am hoping to continue discussion on what steps we can take to maintain and improve our current results. Yours sincerely/faithfully \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 (your name and last name/surname)  If you have an expansive list, write the letter and add your list as an addendum. Note: Copied from a similar answer (where the results were poor). It has been slightly adapted.
