            "answer_text": "Marxism is a failed ideology, but Communism isn\u2019t. Before Marx gave it a Scientific Marxist name, Communism had been known for millennia under several other names. Also, it will stay with humanity long after the last mortal able to recognize Marx without googling the man. Primitive communism Karl Marx himself pointed at it in his description of prehistoric societies. He called them Urkommunismus, because they knew no private property (only individual one) and lived by the principle \u201cFrom each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\u201d. God\u2019s will Monotheistic religions have operated inside a very strong Communist paradigm. The world where private property exists is viewed by them as sinful, inferior, and mortal. The Great Beyond, commonly knows as paradise, being the true destination of virtuous souls, knows no private property. Christian monastic societies have been practicing Communism for centuries. They inspired secular Socialists who ultimately gave birth to the Scientific Communist of Karl Marx. \"All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need.\" ~ Acts 2:44-45. \"Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common. ... There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold. They laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.\" ~ Acts 4:32-35. Us against them The future of Communism, whatever name it takes, is also bright. The way the world works will forever recreate inequality. Some people always will have access to more goods, better experiences, prettier girls, sandier beaches and more fulfilling lives. A grand majority of us will forever view this as bloody injustice and try to find a way to redress the balance. While simple robbing and theft as a means of redistribution and social justice always stays in the realm of the dumb and lazy, the majority will forever prefer redistributing wealth by the power of collective will. Everyone seems to agree on the definition that \u201crich\u201d are those on the higher rungs\u2014and they better share, or else. Cue in the idea of State-enforced legislation of collective ownership. Et voil\u00e1! In times of trouble, Communism is much closer than it appears.  Below, a poster from the early days of Soviet rule in honor of May Day. A giant worker and his son use the celebratory occasion for stomping out parasites, leeches and exploiters. The worker is wearing the striped t-shirt of a military sailor, and his ferocious face suggests he\u2019s very serious about the stomping business. Soviet Communism ultimately collapsed and deeply compromised the brand name of the ideology. However, new slogans embraced nowadays by Western lower classes like \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d, \u201cTake back control\u201d and suchlike, indicate that the thirst for social justice, anti-exploitation and fair redistribution of wealth is immortal. All Communism really needs now is the passage of time. When new generations take the scene and historic memory fades, Communism will just re-brand itself and make a new claim for fame.  ",

            "answer_text": "Communism is a direct descendant of Marxism. Marxism is, in fact, a failed ideology because its predicted mechanism of action doesn\u2019t work (or so far hasn\u2019t worked). Saying communism works is similar to saying the rhythm method is effective at birth control\u2014looks good in theory with many flaws in practice. Marxism predicted ever-worsening conditions of the lower class and increasing misery in capitalism. In fact, the opposite has happened. No one can doubt there have been abuses by \u2018Capitalists.\u2019 Sweatshops, cartels, monopolies (especially in the early days of capitalism) come to mind. In that environment, it was very easy to see how the rich and powerful \u2014 like the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers \u2014 would continue to get more and more powerful and ultimately crush the workers who would have no power. Reality, of course, is a very different story. The reasoning is quite subtle. MARX\u2019S ECONOMIC IDEOLOGY (in a tiny, condensed nutshell) Marx makes a basic point in Das Kapital that the \u2018value\u2019 of a product is directly proportional to the amount of labor that goes into it. In a \u2018totally free\u2019 market, competition \u2018naturally\u2019 settles prices to the cost of labor. Capitalism still provides profits, however, because the people who \u2018own\u2019 the means of production (factories, railroads, etc.) have all of the leverage. Laborers don\u2019t own capital so as a result, they are \u2018forced\u2019 to sell their labor to \u2018Capitalists\u2019, and they compete until their wage is just enough to sustain them on a daily basis. Why don\u2019t laborers have capital? Because any time they buy capital, \u2018bigger\u2019 capitalists buy better machines that make their cost of production much cheaper and drive the smaller capitalists out of business. This spiral continues with bigger and bigger capitalists, more and more people selling their labor and competing for smaller and smaller profits. The resulting competition for labor causes laborers to work extra hours, which is the source of the profits. However, the \u2018capital\u2019 itself is only worth the \u2018labor\u2019 put into it, so really, the capitalist is working on borrowed time. Competition forces the race to the bottom\u2014increased capital investment, longer working hours, bigger companies with smaller profits, smaller companies going out of business, and less jobs. As wealth concentrates, the \u2018labor\u2019 class gets bigger and bigger and more and more miserable until they overthrow the capitalists and install a \u2018rule of the working class\u2019 SO WHAT HAPPENED?  Marx is writing right at the first part of the inflection of the curve. His prediction is that capitalists would accumulate all of the means of production and the workers would overthrow the capitalist overlords. That emphatically hasn\u2019t happened, and thank goodness. You can see the difference between \u2018Communist\u2019 countries and capitalist for what happens to their average citizen:  To give Marx credit, the \u2018Working Class\u2019 did in fact overthrow the capitalists in many societies, such as Russia and China. But those societies still are a far cry from the \u2018mass of workers\u2019 as the societies were primarily farming societies. In capitalist societies, the verdict is clear. Despite huge disparities in income, the average person living in a capitalist society is MUCH better off than they were 50 years ago, without exception. WHAT DID MARX FAIL TO SEE? With a relatively inflexible view of the world, I believe Marx has failed on 1 major account: Not realizing the power of government to \u2018check\u2019 capitalismNo \u2018purely\u2019 capitalistic society exists anymore. We have rules and regulations preventing monopolies. Governments clumsily come in and establish \u2018rules for operating\u2019 that companies must follow, including: Workers boards in GermanyMinimum wages across the worldSubsidies and taxes to prevent and correct externalitiesOutright legislation making certain practices illegalConfiscatory taxes (91% nominally on income at some points in the United States) have also helped ensure wealth is redistributed. While capitalism organizes economic activity, it doesn\u2019t organize ALL activity. COMMUNISM WILL NEVER RETURN Marx fundamentally saw capitalism as an unstoppable force that would ultimately consume itself. That didn\u2019t (and so far hasn\u2019t) happened. More importantly, he misunderstood the nature of a proletarian government. A \u2018workers party\u2019 does not speak for everyone. Just looking at how Communist Societies (even today) repress dissent provides a much darker picture of subjugating humans to rule. Doubtless there are benefits to strong centralized rule in the name of the people. Check out China\u2019s infrastructure (vs. India\u2019s, for example, or even the US\u2019). There is value to strong centralized authority with the \u2018workers\u2019 at the center. However, as an economic ideology opposed to Capitalism, with the technology of the time and even today\u2019s technology, his ideology did not and cannot succeed. All in all Communism as an economic ideology has turned out to be a pile of:  ",
