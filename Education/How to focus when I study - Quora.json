            "answer_text": "Firstly, I really appreciate that you are trying to take the studies seriously. Coming to your answer, see there are around 7\u20138 methods of learning. Following are some of the examples - Visual - People remember by seeing the pictures etc. Like in comics, paintings etc. If you can remember comics easily, then this is your best method.By hearing - People listen to the audio books, songs, radio etc and they grasp the things easily. If you find it easy to remember complete songs or follow radio commentary, then this is your best method.By reading - People who find it easy to remember by reading, are generally fond of novels, blogs etc.Studying in group - Such people want the support of positive energies to be around them. They can remember the things only through discussions, debates etc.Studying in isolation - Some people can not tolerate even a single disturbance. They have a great focus, but they need to be alone to concentrate and learn.Logical Reasoning - Some people are never able to learn the things, until they understand it completely. For example, historical dates rarely have any logic in them. But science is bound to have logic in it. Science is comparatively easier and history, geography is very difficult for the people that possess the logical method of learning.Please note all these are just rough and incomplete ideas that I read somewhere sometimes back. I would advise you to try remembering your chapters using all the above methods. The method through which you are able to grasp the maximum content, is probably the best method for you. In simple words, salt, sugar and chilies are all used to add taste. But if you add salt for making tea and sugar for making chicken, the results may never be good. Same is the case with your method of studies. You are progressing on the correct path, but only you need to follow YOUR most suitable method of learning. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for your question.\tThe first thing that concentration is achieved through constant efforts is mental equilibrium by bringing the mind under their control. If one\u2019s mind is under one\u2019s own control, great goals can be achieved through it, while if it is not, it becomes well nigh impossible to do even the most ordinary things. Truly the mind is endowed with tremendous, demoniacal strength. Yet many seem to be weak minded \u2013 at times or all through their lives - the reason being that their mental energies have been dissipated indiscriminately. Not all are aware that the sun\u2019s rays have the power to ignite fire. Why don\u2019t they know? The reason is, they would not have seen the sun\u2019s rays creating fire and burning down things! But when the same rays are passed through a convex lens and made to fall on a piece of paper, they can burn the paper. How did the rays acquire this power? It was the result of making them converge, and thereby, \u2018concentrated\u2019. Earlier, they were scattered in different directions. Hence, even though they could produce heat, they could not burn. But after becoming concentrated they could produce blazing fire. This is a secret to be noted. There lies remarkable power in our minds, intrinsically. Since this energy is being spent on all kinds of necessary and unnecessary matters, we are incapable of doing anything other than only the most commonplace things.\tAs Swami Vivekananda says, a concentrated mind is really a search-light. A search light makes it possible for us to see even the objects lying in distant, dark corners.\tWell, it is true that the mind has to be made to concentrate but what should be the object of concentration? It is not possible to give a specific answer, suitable to all people, at the same time; because, saying that the mind should be concentrated upon the light of the Atman would be absurd since not all have ventured to become yogis. Nor can it be said that the mind should be concentrated upon God, because, not everybody is a devotee! How about saying that the mind should be concentrated upon lessons? But then, not all are school-going students! So, it would be most appropriate to say that each individual has to personally choose his own particular object of concentration.\tBut here we shall discuss how students must concentrate their minds upon studies, since you asked for this and it is especially meant for students.1) Just as yogi needs a firm and soft seat to sit upon while meditating, every student must have the facility of a chair and a table to enable him to spread books and study comfortably. A student is akin to a yogi in many respects. The question, \u2018Where should the large number of poor students seek tables and chairs?\u2019 must not be asked here. Or \u2018Did Sir M. Visweswraiah has a table and a chair during his student-days? \u2013 This argument also must not be brought in here. Surely, all who read under the street lights can become Visweswaraiah. This apart, those who can\u2019t afford a table and a chair must at least have a desk. 2) Having sat down to read or write, one should not shake his/ her body unnecessarily. A large number of students adopt odd postures while sitting down to study. There are others who go on gazing at something or the other, as though engrossed in deep thinking, and chew their pens or pencils while at studies. There are many other such pretentious practices. All these are detrimental to concentration. All these ate detrimental to concentration. Even as a shaky vessel disturbs the water contained in it, so too the mind becomes disturbed when the body keeps changing its postures. Therefore it is important to sit in a dignified and steady posture while studying.3) That a single topic must be taken up for study at a given time, need not be specially mentioned. However, when a topic has been chosen, the mind should be kept immersed in it for at least one full hour. Merely reading through a book does not mean one has studied it. One must know the difference between merely reading a book and studying it. But concentration is one thing that is common to both \u2013 for reading as well as studying. A cursory reading of the book may enable the reader to know its synopsis. But studying thoroughly will enable the mind to descend into the depths of the contents of the book and grasp their true import, often hidden. This will result in a good command over the subject matter and will also help further reading.4) Once at the study-table with a topic for study, it is most important that the study be continued for a complete hour as said above. Usually the mind will not be prepared to instantly grasp a new subject. The various works we were engaged in during the course of the day, conversations we had with our friends and others or the thoughts that had occupied our minds just prior to taking up the present study, will still be active within. Hence, for the mind to get ready for the present study, a minimum of eight to ten minutes may be required. If the study is suddenly stopped just when the mind is entering the depths of the subject matter, concentration will be destroyed, and the study damaged. So, after a few minutes when the mind comes to focus, the opportunity should be used for diving deeper and making a profound study. Thus the mind should be applied to uninterrupted study for at least an hour.5) During this period, a family-member might call, with a request to attend to some other work. Therefore the inmates of the house must be told previously, \u201cPlease do not call me for an hour,\u201d because, the study can\u2019t be carried out with wholesome concentration if even the expectation that someone might interrupt lurks in the mind.6) Then there is the problem of noise pollution. Students amid the serene surroundings of villages are lucky in this matter. But students residing in cities, especially in capitals, have to encounter the evils of noise pollution. Since noise pollution is rampant in all towns and cities, there is no alternative, except to bear with it. However much one tires to adapt to this inconvenience, when the loudspeakers begin to blare, the studies are soon disturbed. While the holy Vinayaka Chathurthi celebrations, the ears are assailed by the rudest sounds for a whole month. About the Ramanavami celebrations \u2013 the less said the better; the students know their plights best. All these constitute some of the hellish experiences of city-dwellers.\tEducated members of the society as well as educationists seem to be helpless in this matter. Perhaps the educationists do not possess authority, but then those who wield power do not seem to possess the power of discrimination. Anyhow, there is a way of escaping noise pollution \u2013 the students must cultivate an intense desire to excel in studies, if there is this yearning in the mind, external noise will hardly be heard. For example, when a worry has overpowered our mind, even if a drum is beaten right beside us, we would not notice it. This yearning or urge is found to get intensified when the exams have approached. But if we nurture a strong ambition of excelling in the exams even while the exams are a long way off, we can develop a sort of concentration in studies. But it is good to remember that to develop concentration overnight is impossible for anyone.7) There is yet another scheme whereby concentration in studies can be achieved \u2013 it is by paying good attention to the subject read. This alertness is called \u2018Avadhana\u2019. It means keeping the mind wakeful and watchful. Most of the students are incapable of studying with attention because their minds remain suspended in a sort of dream-state or keep wandering aimlessly. Only he whose mind is wakeful succeeds in achieving concentration. Upon reading this, the question \u2013 \u2018How then can the mind be kept awake?\u2019 may crop up. Some helpful suggestions are given here.a) The intake of certain kinds of food increases sleepiness. Such food-stuffs must be avoided. b) The mind will remain energetic when the various organs of the body are kept clean; in addition, all personal things, including bedclothes and the clothing that is daily worn must be tidy. c) All other things in the room and articles of daily use must be maintained with orderliness. This orderliness reveals the wakeful state of the mind assertively. Carelessness is what is seen in most students. If we look at the chaotic condition of their personal belongings and their books we can easily understand how careless they are. d) Students should know another important point \u2013 it is equally necessary to keep the mind clean. Indecent and vulgar thoughts should not only be denied entry into the mind, but also be prevented from passing in the mind\u2019s vicinity, because they are the very culprits who create havoc in the mind and spoil it. It does not matter much even if the mind is drowsy or dreamy, but once such indecency and vulgarity creep into it, there can\u2019t be any talk of concentration. Since concentration comes easily to a pure and unpolluted mind, vicious and sinful thoughts should not be allowed anywhere near the mind. e) Students must resolve within themselves like this: \u2018I shall fully study these portions within an hour\u2019s time\u2019, and feel anxious to complete the study of the portions within the allotted time. It might not be possible to finish the portions within the allotted time in the beginning, but with such eager efforts, possibility of the mind remaining awake increases. \tAccordingly, constant efforts to keep the mind awake will help developing concentration to a large extent. 8) Students desirous of developing concentration must desist from gossip, considering it to be as dangerous as poison. However, discussing the lessons with friends is definitely helpful. The Yogis have discovered what a great amount of mental energy is lost through useless prattle. By vain gossip, the discipline and orderliness of the mind will be destroyed. A weak and indisciplined mind will become incapable of concentrating. Concentration is impossible for one with weak body and a weak mind. 9) Some students complain that when they try to concentrate they get headache. The main reason for this is that their brains do not have sufficient strength. In order to make the brain strong one should practice special yogasanas under the guidance of an adept. Tonics, chyavanaprasha etc.. may be taken along with nourishing food, as directed by a good doctor. Milk, butter and ghee must be taken in right quantities everyday. It is worth remembering that \u2018too much is too bad\u2019. However, the best tonic is the energy conserve through continence (Brahmacharya). For observing continence a few simple suggestions can be made:i) One should sincerely pray to his own indwelling Soul in the depth of his heart for sustaining this power of continence. ii) One must be careful not to fall into the company of unruly and indulgent students, as one would keep off tigers and hyenas. However, one should not go to the extent of criticizing them, for this would lead to other problems.10) Another important means, conducive to attainment of concentration is faith \u2013 Shraddha. Faith can\u2019t be obtained from outside, it is a virtue that must grow from within. Everybody would have heard the word \u201cfaith\u201d sometime or the other. But only a few people have understood its inner import. And, by the power of this faith they have progressed in their chosen paths and reached their goals. Such is the power of faith. It leads the persevering aspirant forward until he reaches his goal. \u2018What is this Shraddha that you are making so much of?\u2019 \u2013 One might ask. Faith is the trust that one has in his own strength. This is what is called \u2018Self confidence\u2019. A man might have exceptionally strong biceps, but if he has no faith in their strength, thy will be of no use to him. Hanuman was capable of leaping over the ocean but he remained silent since he did not believe that the required strength was there in himself.\tBut when Jambavantha aroused faith in Hanuman and made his strength know to him, he reached Lanka with one leap!\tIn every student lies hidden a wonderful capacity for acquiring tremendous knowledge. There is no doubt about this. Only, a student must not doubt about this. Only, a student must not doubt his own inner strength. Doubt is the staunch enemy of faith; as soon as any misgiving arises, the inherent strength becomes incapacitated. Afterwards only lamenting over his fate will fall to his lot. How to bring out this inherent knowledge? By studying and thinking regularly and methodically. The student should sit for study with determination resolving, \u201cI will definitely improve my knowledge by studying carefully\u201d. This is an effective technique by which the mind spontaneously gets concentrated. One must try it out to believe it.\tTruly, the greatness of faith is boundless. Hence we must keep telling ourselves. \u201cO faith, Victory is mine if you stand by; Failure and fall, if you fly away.\u201d11) There is another important key to concentration, the master-key, and that is love. It is an unalterable law that the mind dwells in the objects of its liking. Where there is an excessive love there the mind is united strongly. This point need not be elaborated, because each one can observe how his mind is in close association with this own object of liking. Hence it is essential that a student must develop love for his study.\tInitially, linking for the lessons will have to be cultivated with some effort. But later, as the subjects become easier to grasp, love springs up naturally. When love for studies develops, concentration is invariably attained. \tThe concentration that is developed through faith and love is the most natural; it involves no struggle and no strain. \tHowever there is a special suggestion for students. Even though one may be following the eleven precepts mentioned above, concentration can not be said to have been achieved in full measure until the subjects studied become fully understood. Therefore one must not feel sorry understood. Therefore one must not feel sorry and bemoan, \u201cWhy have I not achieved concentration yet?\u201d Instead, one must strive to study with patience and understand clearly all that is read. One should not proceed with the reading, for instance, without clearing up the meaning of a difficult word with the help of a dictionary. If reading is done without doing thus, the only \u2018outcome\u2019 is waste of time and los of energy. There is absolutely no benefit. Can the subject matter ever be understood, without an understanding of the difficult words in it?\tTo know how poor the educational caliber of today\u2019s students is, and more importantly their ability for writing is, they should by asked to write an essay on some topic. Each page will have a generous quota of defective sentence, words used wrongly and faulty lettering! However intelligent a student might be, without exertion and endeavour, nothing can be achieved. \tThat is why Lord Krishna says to Arjuna \u2013 \u201cConcentration can be accomplished by practice and detachment.\u201d Practice implies incessant striving and repeated efforts. Really it is quite difficult for a five year old boy to write a few simple words. But by the time he comes to the tenth standard he will be able to write even long passages effortlessly and fluently. How is this possible? By practice \u2013 nothing else. In this world great deeds have been achieved in the past, and are being achieved even now. We should, with an open mind visualize them one. How many people would have struggled persistently for every such accomplishment! There is nothing that is impossible for men of perseverance. \tNow coming to detachment \u2013what does it signify? Does it mean sannyasa-renunciation? No. Detachment implies, remaining aloof from all other temptations and attractions while striving to fulfill a chosen aim. That is, to retain interest and concern for the work in hand alone and to remain unconcerned about everything else \u2013 this is detachment. Since the goal of monks is self-realization, they have to renounce all the worldly things. And since the word \u2018detachment\u2019 has come to mean renunciation, whenever it is used today it is understood as becoming a monk and retiring to the forests. But this is not correct. Anyone engaged in accomplishing a particular goal is detached from other things to some extent. A student is expected to be devoted to the task of acquiring knowledge. But if his mind is being distracted by other temptations, how can his education prosper? Especially those, who are keen on acquiring concentration, must never even glace at other diversions. \tAt least after coming to know that there is joy and success in concentration, a student must not remain idle; he must at once apply himself to practice it diligently. It is indeed a true sign of concentration if one is absorbed in studies to the extent of forgetting not only the surrounding but even his body!\tIf one is desirous to overcome the diseases of his body and to enjoy sound health, if one intends to develop his intelligence, if one is really particular to achieve concentration, he should take recourse to practice of yogasanas. Regular practice of yogasanas strengthens and activates the nervous system and thereby helps in developing concentration. Yogasanas are a boon to humanity. \tMinds of the youth are like the Jog Falls. A huge volume of water, gushing down from the heights of a mountain, flows around blindly and at last, having served no purpose, loses its identity in the sea. On the other hand, if a dam is built across its waters and made to flow in regulated canals, agricultural fields can be irrigated and a rich crop harvested.Similarly, across the uncultured, self-willed mental-energies of the youth, which are spent purposelessly, a dam of disciplines and restrictions must be build; canals of a code of conduct must be dug; and the water of mental powers must be made to flow into the fields of education, art, literature and skilled labour. Then we can see how the glorious harvest of culture will flourish.Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, I want you to think about your big exam. Think about how important it is for you to pass it. Think about what consequences you'll face if you don't pass it. Write them down. Now, you surely know what you want to do. Distractions will always be there, but you have to beat your chaotic mind and lay your eyes on ONE DAMN THING i.e. pass the exam and for that goal, you need to work, and work hard. To achieve something you've never had, you need to do something you've never done. Its just that simple. Distraction is just a way through which your mind plays with you. It will blind you until you start thinking that your goal is not that important! You could rather have fun now and pass later! But, in reality, it doesn't work that way. The same distractions mock you when you fail. See, just remember that its no pain=no gain. And pain is temporary, but glory is forever. Then what are you waiting for? How can you get distracted and simultaneously cut down your own goals? Ohkay, now, cut down your distractions. If it's your phone, switch it off. Or just keep it in airplane mode.If it's food, keep snacks handy on your study table, so you don't get up and roam around and forget that you gotta study. Keep a water bottle handy too.If it's games, dude, control, games aren't gonna make you pass, so just unassemble your gaming devices.If its sex thoughts/porn/any crush, you're in trouble. Avoid avoid avoid anything that reminds you of these. Its just hormones going crazy, but the good news is, it is controllable. So chill.Next, remind yourself constantly. You could write your goal on a piece of paper and write all the reasons pointwise as to why it is important for you to achieve that goal. Stick this paper in a place where you usually look when you're distracted, like when I study and get bored/distracted, I look at the blank wall in front of me and think! So sticking that paper to such an area or sticking it on your study table will keep you going.Set your goal's picture/motivational quote picture etc. as your phone's/PC's homescreen / desktop background. Its just about keeping your goals in front of you as much as you can.Download some 'white noise' or 'study music' tracks that are 30 minutes, 1hour and 1.5 hours long. Put your phone on airplane mode, put your earphones on, listen to the tracks and study. This works and will make you study. Because once you start getting distracted, the music playing in your ears tells you silently that \"I played the music to study, I got to study\"Whenever distracted, remember, comfort is the enemy of achievement. So when you're following your distractions, you're following your comfort, and already setting up for loss. I hope these tips help you focus better. Its all in the mind and it is beatable. So be strong headed. :) all the best! For more tips on concentrating better, you could read my answer to How do I concentrate more on studies? ",

Go through all previous year papers and give as many mock tests as you can and time them. Your notes must help you in revising the entire chapter. Set small goals in each topic and achieve those goals. Take expert help when you cannot understand a solution for a problem. When you cannot concentrate take small breaks. Do some pranayama and meditation to help you handle stress. Try to relax and dont worry about what will happen during the exam. Focus on the present and write all answers and practice. Reading alone will not help. Be motivated and dont compare yourself with anyone. We all have a unique destiny. Do effective time management and prioritize your day. When you are distracted get to something which can help you relax and again come back. Find out where your time is getting wasted and plug all the gaps. Worries alone dont solve anything. Start executing your strategy. You still have a lot of time. Even 1 minute matters in life. So use your time wisely. ",
