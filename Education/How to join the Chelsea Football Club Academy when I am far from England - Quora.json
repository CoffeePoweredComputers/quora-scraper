You\u2019d have to be at the top echelon of players in your home country, and THEN manage to get noticed by someone from Chelsea and THEN play a position where the youth managers believe they are lacking. Seeing as CFC\u2019s youth side recently won the youth FA Cup they aren\u2019t hurting for talent. If you\u2019re in Europe, your chances increase. The further you are away the less likely it is. If you ever manage to become one of the best players where you live and become a professional you\u2019d have a better chance of someday joining CFC. Their scouts are always looking for talent to buy and rely on foreign players moreso than talent from their academy if you\u2019ve noticed. ",
