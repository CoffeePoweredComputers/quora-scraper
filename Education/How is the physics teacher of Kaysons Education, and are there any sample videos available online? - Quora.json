            "answer_text": "The main constituents of jee syllabus are Math,Chemistry,Physics. Here maths refer to your brain power and intelligence. Chemistry stands for keeping a vast stuff in your mind . But the physics make the difference it is not about intelligence rather than require a deep imagination skills as well. So coming to the point ,to prepare for physics or to prepare for other subjects are not the same thing. As well as to teach for physics or for other subjects are also not same. So here I shall describe some of the most important point that an institution must include in their methodology .In parallel I would look at kaysons as well as to some other institutes also. The very forst point as I mentioned above that physics can be conquered with your intelligence as well as strong imagination power.But the sad reality is an offline class can never be able to make some 3D representation to accomplish the task.But in online institute such as kaysons uses some ingenious way of 3D representation of things to develop the imagination skills.Along with this you need to look at the faculty member of that particular institute.Their experience their education qualification matter aot .As per my consideration etoos and Kayson are the most suitable for this purpose because of their qualifucatiin from prestigious IITs as well as their decent experience in this field.The third anothe important thing or better to say the most important is the study material.A teacher can tell you about the concepts and their implementation but the task is not yet accomplished till you learn the implementation by yourself only that you can by solving a number of quality problem. for that purpose I refer 3 choices Kayons ,Etoos and Allen dlp materials also.These are the finest physics content provider as I think.So these are the points that will be always recommended and for the rest sample video tutorial then the kaysons itself provide some demos and sample videos so need not to be worried about the sample classes and demo.That you would get easily.Eventually this is upto you which institute you opt for but their direction and their combined efforts will lead you to the best consequences.

            "answer_text": "Physics is the easiest subject. Do you think that??? No!! Yep I also do not think that physics is the easiest subject but still this is the most Wonderful and interesting one if you are good at the basics and concepts.I could share you my personal experience which made some scintillating changes to my physics and eventually it added some decent score to my jee score. Let us begin our discussion and try to figure it out that how prepare for kaysons and how is the physics faculty department at kaysons. 1. The fir ever thing that you must remember never follow the policy of \"jugaad\" looking at the answer and than solving the problem is the worst way of preparation and you just avoid it. 2. The best thing that you follow is you just study a particular topic and make notes of that and after clearing all you doubts go for problem solving. You can refer kaysons as a good concepts deliver honestly these video lectures are quite helpful which strengthened my concepts. 3. Suppose you stuck at a problem than you can not just go ahead .You must try to solve the problem at least 2 or 3 times then you can go for tutorial. In this perspective I find kaysons helpful as they have a large no of problems as well as their video solutions also.But try to avoid solution instead of that go for hints. 4 . A good concept deliver is called a good teacher. A good test sheets , healthy study material is your best friend during your jee journey. Kaysons is both ,because of his faculty member who are not only iitian but also they are really hardworking and experienced.The study material and inegnious teaching methodology is also really helpful.   After this discussion I just say that kaysons is a good choice but you must search out some other institutes like byjus,plances etoos(I also recommend this ,another fine option) Finally your success depends on your devotion and hardwork ,No institute can bring you success if you want to get that .So give your 100% and look forward for the best.

            "answer_text": "See physics has been one of the toughest subject as well as it is the most interesting you will ever find that imagination that rope and pully problems , that friction , that is quite amazing to study .But it differes from people to people . Let us bring some healthy discussion regarding this topic and try to resolve your doubts regarding physics preparation. Firstly you need to remember that physics is entirely conceptual .You have to deal with the depth of each and every formula for at least once so that you become well familier with the concepts and their implementation.When you consider kaysons for physics it seems to be a good options just not because of their faculty profile but still I would say there are several other aspects where kaysons seems to be leading.Along with their eminent faculties they provide some concepts like 3D representation where one can learn such topics easily that require a lot of thinking and imagination.While considering faculty I would say that etoos is also a good options as it has one of the known physics teacher NV Sir but kaysons takes a lead by its ingenious feature that I mentioned above.Other points to differentiate consist regular test series, test series among the same level students to brush up their skill and accumulation of alot of quality problem makes it better then etoos.For online demo lecture of kayosn you may use youtube where you can get a couple of videos to know about the institution amd their teaching methodology ",

            "answer_text": "See physics has been one of the toughest subject among all the three.This is so because it completely depends on your concepts .It you mess up with your concepts then your physics can never explore upto the jee level. Let us discuss what are the qualities that an ideal physics teacher possess and make a analysis for the physics faculty and the environment of kaysons for physics. You need to focus on the following points to get to know about kaysons and their faculty department of physics. First of all as I have earlier stated that physics is entirely conceptual .You need to go in the depth of the every formula for at least once so that you become well familier with the concepts and their implementation.Considering kaysons for physics seems to be a good options just not because of their faculty profile but because of several other aspects that an ideal jee institute must have.Along with their eminent faculties they provide some concepts like 3D representation where one can learn such topics easily that require a lot of thinking and imagination.While considering faculty I would say that etoos is also a good options as it has one of the known physics teacher NV Sir but kaysons takes a lead by its ingenious feature that I mentioned above.Other points to differentiate consist regular test series,tedt series among the same level students to brush up their skill and accumulation of alot of quality problem makes it better then etoos.For online demo lecture of kayosn you may use youtube where you can get a couple of videos to know about the institution amd their teaching methodology   I think these two images are enough to tell you that the institution believe in making thing practical not theoretical .But still I would say you to consider the other one especially etoos as they are also quite good at physics.Now the choice is yours what you opt should be your decision . I hope this helps you ",
