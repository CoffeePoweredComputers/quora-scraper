            "answer_text": "How do you change your perception? It\u2019s really easy, but also hard at the same time. Here is why (and how): What we define as \u201cour perception\u201d is - in a nutshell - the combination of what information you receive through your senses, and how your brain interprets them. This means there are two filters that reduce the actual reality to your personal perception What your senses pick up and what they don\u2019t.What you brain considers relevant and how it\u2019s being processed.Which already brings us to the answer to your question. If you want to change your perception you need to change how these two filters operate. Pay attention to what you pay attention to. If you only listen to people you agree with, then you won\u2019t be able to diversify your views, ideas, outcomes. If you always watch the same movies, listen to the same music, read the same news outlet, your brain won\u2019t be able to add options to its interpretation of the real world. If you never pause to look around, take a break from your routines, or walk another path, then you your brain will have a hard time figuring out new \u201cways\u201d for other problems.Once the information arrives at our brain, it will quickly interpret things, make judgements, make decisions, before you even know it. That is something you can\u2019t influence directly. But you can and need to stop right afterwards, to re-asses the situation. You can pause before you say what your brain considers to be the most obvious thing to say. You can consciously override the first impulse of what to do and consider other options.Simple example: You\u2019re driving in your car on a four lane street (two lanes for each direction). On the lane next to you someone all over sudden accelerates to take over, just before both lanes actually merge into one lane. You are a bit surprised by this guy still squeezing past you, and your first thought is: What an idiot to press past you just before the road narrows down to one lane, that\u2019s dangerous. That\u2019s your perception. However, because you are now working on not taking your perception for granted, you actually assess your own driving as well. And oops, turns out you were only going 45 where 60 would have been allowed. You realise that if you had been in that other car, you might have tried to speed past this \u201csnail\u201d as well, before risking to get stuck behind for the next few kilometers. Basically you can re-train your perception by first becoming aware of where you need to stop and change it, then pause to gain time to look at things from various perspectives, and the make a conscious decisions of how you want to proceed from there, whether you want to stick to your initial, automatic assessment, or alter your perception and the subsequent reaction. I hope this makes sense. As I said at the beginning, I don\u2019t know if this will be easy for you or hard. It sounds simple enough, but overriding your well trained brain\u2019s perceptions can be quite hard. Have a look here for some more \u201ctechnical\u201d insights into perception: Perception - Wikipedia Good luck. Also I just found this:  ",

            "answer_text": "1. Embrace Your Personal Style  If you're like me, you probably dash out the door in the morning wearing any old thing. And that's OK to do most of the time. But if you really want to make a great impression, slow down and take the time to truly get dressed. \"When we 'dress up' or wear something we feel really great in, others take notice,\" Rogers says. \"There's something to be said for 'looking the part.' If we can walk into a room with our head held high thanks to a fabulous outfit, your confidence is changing others' perceptions of you in an instant.\" 2. Practice Giving Off Kinder Vibes  While you certainly don't have to walk around with a 24/7 smile \u2014 if that's not your thing \u2014 know that it is possible to throw off kind vibes in other ways. \"Eyebrows are a big tool for showcasing emotion. Play with them and your expressions,\" Rogers says. \"Eyes are another ... Try it out in the mirror and see how your face portrays what it is you are feeling. And if you can radiate kindness just from your face, people will notice.\" 3. Put Those Shoulders Back  While the temptation to hunch may be strong, keep in mind that poor posture can make you appear less than confident. So push those shoulders back. \"If your shoulders are pushed back, they will appear broader and you will appear taller. It's a power stance and it conveys confidence,\" Rogers says. \"Follow your body's lead and others will immediately respond.\" 4. Ask Plenty Of Questions  When meeting someone new, or mingling in a group, focus on being that amazing person who asks lots of great questions. \"People love sharing their stories,\" Rogers says. \"Stick to a few simple questions (and add a few followups for good measure) and you'll see people instantly start to like you.\" 5. Make A Healthy Amount Of Eye Contact  It's totally normal to struggle with eye contact, especially if you're a nervous or anxious person. But it is worth working on. \"Avoidance of eye contact clues into others that you are not confident or sure of yourself, which probably isn't even true,\" Rogers says. \"It could just be a bad habit. So make sure you practice eye contact in the mirror every day to get used to it.\" 6. Relax Your Body  While it can be tricky to relax when you're outside your element, it's important to give it a try by slowing down, uncrossing your arms, and relaxing your face. \"When you are physically relaxed, other people perceive that you are comfortable with yourself,\" says confidence expert and trained therapist Karol Ward, LCSW. 7. Tell Yourself \"I Matter\"  One of the best ways to get good vibes from others is to put them out yourself. So the next time you go out, remind yourself you matter. \"Try to do a mental pep talk for yourself prior to an event taking place, and recognize that your presence and your unique strengths and personality and body type are all important,\" clinical psychologist Dr. Ariane Machin tells Bustle. \"This positive and empowered attitude will help you shine.\" 7. Go Anyway  Shutterstock When trying to make a good impression, it's important to actually show up. So put all sorts of get-togethers and networking events in your calendar and make a point to go. \"If we choose not to attend situations or events, we will never have an opportunity to know others and, in effect, they will not get to know us either,\" Machin says. \"Even if you don't feel like going somewhere, take a risk/opportunity and put yourself out there.\" You'll likely be glad you did. 9. Fill Your Brain With Positive Thoughts  People can totally tell when you're focusing in on negative thoughts. That's why \u2014 while it may be easier said that done \u2014 it's important to get rid of that negative self-talk and try to be a bit more positive. \"If you say something positive to yourself, such as 'You can do it,\" you will be helping create the scene,\" says licensed psychologist Marni Amsellem, PhD. \"People generally respond well to positivity.\" 10. Truly Listen To What Others Are Saying  Remember what I said about asking questions? People will remember whether or not you actually listened to them. Which is where the practice of \"looping\" may come in handy. As author Francis Cole Jones says, \"If someone is telling a long, involved story, say, 'I'm just going to interrupt you for a second to make sure I\u2019m following. You said, XYZ happened. Is that right?'\" By asking questions like these, it shows the speaker you're listening, and it allows them to clarify anything that was missed. \"Either way, they are left thinking you are a great listener.\" 11. Take Up Plenty Of Space  If you're feeling shy, it's normal to shrink up, fold your arms, or slouch. But in order to make a good impression, you're going to want to take up more space. \"Extend your presence,\" psychotherapist and executive coach Aimee Bernstein tells Bustle. \"When you take space energetically, people see you as more powerful and you feel that way yourself.\" To try it out, stand up taller, put your shoulders back, or gesture more to fill the space. It doesn't have to be over the top, of course. Just enough to show you feel comfortable enough to move round and truly \"be\" where you are. 12. Be Your Charismatic Self  The more comfortable you can be in any situation, the better. So go ahead and be your charismatic self by laughing, smiling, spinning yarns, or doing whatever is most \"you.\" \"Research shows that energy is contagious,\" Bernstein says. If you go into a room radiating this great energy, people will take notice. And you'll hold a positive spot in their brain as a result. 13. Decide How You'd Like To Define Yourself  Before heading into a situation where you'll need to make a good impression, try filling your brain with a few positive words and use them to define yourself. \"Pick three adjectives you want the attendees to use to describe you,\" Cole Jones says. \"Doing this helps to focus your energy.\" And it helps give off more of those positive vibes. Which, of course, is what this is all about. Whether you're meeting someone for the first time, or doing damage control after a bad first impression, there are ways to change how people perceive you. It just takes a little effort. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes the only freedom we have is to change our attitude - that changes our perception of life. No matter how badly things are going, you can choose to look for the good ones, even if there are only a few good ones. One of the truths of life is that most of us will not change the way we think, feel and act unless something forces us to do so. Just about every human is like that to some extent, so when things are really awful, we can ask ourselves something like \u201cWhat to I have to change in my life so that this does not happen again?\u201d Dr. Wayne Dyer had a great saying: \u201cWhen you change the way you look at things, what you look at changes!\u201d This is a truth at two levels; when you look at situations as having possible good aspects, you see them for the first time; however you also change your environment a bit and from then on a different mix of things comes your way. This is actually built into the way the universe was, is and will be created. Everything is changing, and you can help change it for the better; or for worse. Choose!

Complete disaster was averted in the nick of time by learning-using a few realities more fundamental than my personal perspectives. They are described in the Nichiren Buddhism, as taught by the Soka Gakkai Interntaional. -Life is better when you pay attention. -You are unique, as is every other being. -You are an aspect of everything, as is every other being. _Causes produce effects. -Lives change, yet Life persists. -Your path, no matter how similar it may seem on the surface, will never be exactly what anyone else\u2019s will be, is, or has been. Beyond that, you can shine with brilliance in your chosen environment. It's not as hard as it seems, if you are willing to learn what everybody already knows in bits, and pieces. You can use it, in a compact form to infuse your life with wisdom, and awareness. You become more effective, and make better use of your innate abilities. How? Base yourself on what is true for anyone, anywhere, anytime, under any circumstances. Then, your personal set of responses will be consistent with reality. There will be fewer collisions. The bedrock of reality is a set of simple to explain, yet difficult to accept realities. They are simple because that is the nature of fundamentals. They are hard to accept because they bypass, and challenge, so many assumptions to which we are habituated. This is a condensed description -Pay attention. Respect. Be equal to. Nam -You are an aspect of everything, and so is every other being. Myo -You are unique, and so is every other being. Ho -Causes produce effects, for all of us. You can wake up from mistaken views at any time. Renge -Lives change, Yet, Life goes on. Kyo Those who keep these simple realities in mind, simultaneously, will have fewer accidents, and be able to develop better lives. These consistently real truths are intuitively obvious, yet we often forget one, or more, when we react. Our emotional past, and the inherited tendencies from our ancestors get in the way of currently practical, rational thought. We can protect our good sense when we make efforts to infuse these fundamentals into our lives. The infusion is easier when the basic reality is packaged conveniently into six words. (Nam Myoho Renge Kyo). They are spoken in the language of the founder, Nichiren of thirteenth century Japan. William Ranger's post in William Who controls you? ",

For a couple of days, Divyansh Mundra is showing the truthfulness of BJP on this site, how he was approached to write about it, thinking of like a paid promotion but at the end, it turned out to simple dedicated writing with no pressure or such on the BJP topic. He shared this view in the public, twice but his answers get into the section of BNBR and spam policy. Anyone can tell that those answers were not violating BNBR. Can we change this perception? Can we go and show this to an anti-BJP and expect to get a positive response. He/she will never let us change the perception of reality. It has become a norm in the social platform that approaching writers for your own agenda means it will be a paid promotion or supporter of that party. The above one is just an example, there are millions of them who does not wants to see the reality, they just go with the flow, whatever society thinks is permanent and is final. Last week I was on the death anniversary of my mom's maternal uncle. Now in Hindu society, it is a rule to throw away all the remaining foods cooked on the 13th day after the death. From my mom's house, a ton of foods was destined to be thrown in the garbage, that day. I was shell-shocked when I saw that. Millions of people are dying every day due to hunger and we are throwing away those foods, only because it is the reality, people do that, it has been a tradition? I protested I did not care whatever my family members would think about myself but I urged this to my grandfather and my own maternal uncle. My maternal uncle responded to somewhat to my opinions but my grandfather did not. \u201cThe beggars won't even eat this food, it is unholy\u201d, my grandfather commented. I smiled and reply, \u201cIs it more unholy than death?\u201d. Grandfather was mum, he did not have words to argue that. I and my maternal uncle took that food and deposited to a nearby dhaba, from where local NGOs collect food to feed the beggars. My maternal uncle had his links and he really appreciated me for this step. We did not tell this at home but I am glad that I could feed a few beggars with that food. So yes, I have altered the perception of reality and have seen the truth behind it. It is beautiful as well as exceptional. Changing is another word for humanism. We are born to evolve not to flow with reality. Thanks for reading. ",

Or if you are using the word perception to mean understanding, you could try changing your premises. Sometimes people manage to change there frame of reference, see things from a new angle, or in a new light. You could think more deeply into things and gain a fresh understanding, a new perspective - it would change the meaning of things to you. You could change your moral beliefs, then the meaning of thins, how you evaluate them, would change. You could read a book that literally changed the way you see the world. You could read Ayn Rand.

What we perceive to be real becomes our reality.  There have been numerous studies in which a group of people where shown a series of events as a group.  Afterwards they were asked a series of questions to test their perception of what occurred.  People interpreted what they saw differently.  They were asked to support their answers and indicate how sure they were of their answers.  It is amazing how eyewitness accounts of an event differ by how people perceived the event. The only reality that you can affect is your own.  If there is something in your life, your reality, that displeases your then take action to change those aspect.  Waiting on others to change your reality is futile and wasteful.  Your reality is not set in stone and should not be dictated by others.  The only thing that can change your reality is ACTION.  Do something different.  Doing the same thing and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.  If you want change, do something different. ",
