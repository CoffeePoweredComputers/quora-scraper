            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Firstly, I Would strongly suggest you not to look the weightage of a particular topic at any point of your preparation, be it learning phase , or during practice or even during revision . weightage of topics in JEE is not fixed and they can ask any number of questions from any chapter. If I remember correctly once 2 or 3 questions were asked directly from Elasticity which is often neglected by JEE aspirants. Same goes with chapters like Fluid Mechanics (there are papers in which there was not a single question from fluids but there are papers in which whole matrix , comprehension and MCQ\u2019s were asked directly from fluids). So prioritizing your preparation wrt weightage/analysis of previous year papers will not be a good idea in my opinion. Coming to the main part of the question,generally class XII curriculum has more weightage in JEE simply because of the reason that most of the major topics are usually taught in class XII which include calculus , Organic Chemistry , Inorganic chemistry , Modern physics , Optics , Electromagnetism etc. But that does not mean that you can afford to leave some topics of class XI . If I talk subject wise then Physics- Class XI physics mainly focuses on Mechanics . If your mechanics is weak then be ready to face trouble in class XII physics also. You will be needing the concepts of mechanics like projectile motion , relative motion , Newton\u2019s laws of Motion , Work energy theorem , concepts of rotational dynamics , SHM etc while solving problems of topics from class XII physics. A lot of questions are asked from the fusion of Mechanics and electromagnetism so you can\u2019t afford to leave any of these parts . Chemistry- General organic chemistry which is taught in class XI is the backbone of JEE organic . If you are not good at GOC then you will be facing a lot of trouble in class XII organic . Every single problem in organic chemistry urges you to apply some or other concept of GOC like carbocation stability , Resonance stabilisation , Hyperconjugation effect , Mesomeric effect, counting of Isomers, Stereoisomerism etc. Other than that most of the physical chemistry is covered in class XI only which includes some of the most fundamental topics of physical chemistry like Thermodynamics , Ionic Equilibrium ,Stoichiometry etc. Concepts of the class XI physical will be used throughout your JEE chemistry be it physical , organic or inorganic. Maths- I Don\u2019t think i need to tell you about this. In my opinion Calculus is a topic which requires the knowledge of full JEE mathematics. A Question of calculus can be combined with any topic of JEE mathematics be it Combinatorics , Coordinate Geometry, Algebra , Vectors , trigonometry and even Mathematical Reasoning! . You will be needing trigonometric identities at every second question you solve from calculus . Same goes with concepts of complex numbers, quadratic equations, Coordinate geometry etc. So finally i would like to conclude by saying that never prioritize your time by looking at weightage of a chapter . Every single chapter is important and if you leave some chapter then it will definitely hamper your preparation in some way or the other All the Best! ",
