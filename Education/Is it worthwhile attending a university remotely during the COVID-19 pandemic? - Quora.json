            "answer_text": "Good question. If I were a freshman though who signed up for the major college or university experience, I would just take all of my college pre requisites for 2 yrs at a community or Jr College. Then when this is all over and settled, transfer to the major university. Your degree/diploma will still say you graduated from your initial choice anyways. Different approach though if this is my jr or senior yr in college. Then yes, I would take my online majors via computer. ",
