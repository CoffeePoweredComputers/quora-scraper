            "answer_text": "Sex education exists at school level because that's the typical age when young people start their transformation into adults, and one of the inevitable parts of this transformation is discovering their sexuality. (The existence of sexuality and the instinctive need for sex is what keeps our species alive. If it didn't exist, we'd be long gone and the world would be ruled by octopuses.) So when our youngsters start discovering their bodies, and the new urges and desires that they feel, it's learning time for both them and their parents.  The parents will have to learn to accept that their babies are not babies anymore, and that they are going through a process that is natural, beautiful, and inevitable. They will have to learn to dive deep into their memory and remember that they have been through the same things. Maybe at the same age, maybe at a different age, because not all people are the same, but they most certainly did experience the same things.  Their awareness and acceptance of these things will be crucial to the development of their young son or daughter. This moment is a turning point in a person's life when the relationship with their parents is re-defined, and it can become stronger or much, much weaker.  But the most learning will be done by the young future adults, who are completely new to this subject. And there are four ways to learn about it:  At home, explained by the parents. This can be a desired way to learn about the birds and the bees, but it may often make either the parents or the child uncomfortable, due to the subject typically being considered taboo or embarrassing. From the circle of friends. This type of learning is a combination of positives and negatives, so it's a little like a lottery. You can learn valuable things from more experienced friends, but you can also end up with a lot of misinformation and bad or even harmful advice. By raw experience. Unfortunately this is often the case, and it's quite dangerous, because young adults who suddenly find themselves needing sex are instinctively very aware of the benefits of sex, but completely ignorant to the dangers it carries for the uninformed. Via sex education classes in school. This is an environment that can avoid all the drawbacks that exist in the learning scenarios I described above. By their more formal nature, schools offer the possibility to strip sex of the taboo or embarrassing stigmas. By their didactic nature, they will also offer correct and up to date information, and they most importantly will teach the students about the precautions they should take when they decide to have sex, and the benefits of those precautions (or the dangers of ignoring them).  My point is that schools don't encourage students to have the sex that they otherwise wouldn't have. They encourage them to have it in a safe and mature way, whenever should they decide they are ready for it (they should also teach them the power of the word \"no\").  Unfortunately, this is still just wishful thinking in many places. In fact, a lot of schools are actually teaching students not to have sex, which is just as bad as not having any sex classes at all.    ",
