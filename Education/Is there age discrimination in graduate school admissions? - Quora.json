            "answer_text": "You can't use one example to conclude anything.  There were many \"normal\" age people with great accomplishments and scores who were also rejected.  I'm tired of people assuming that Carl was more entitled and if he didn't get it then all people of his age won't get in.  That's the same discrimination that is applied to women and minorities.  Rather than viewing a person as an individual, if the woman makes a mistake than all women can't do it, or if the minority messes up then all minorities will mess up.  You are using that same irrational logic. ",
