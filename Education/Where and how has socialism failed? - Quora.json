            "answer_text": "Right wingers and free marketeer types will predictably scurry to the comfort zone of dismissing the argument that socialism has not failed by pointing  out that this is what socialist  tend to do in the face of such failure - namely, saying what has failed was not socialism.  Ultimately this ends up in the discussion being bogged down in fruitless  and sterile word game about what socialism means I prefer, as a socialist, to tack a different tack - to clearly state at the outset what I mean by socialism.  So my understanding of what is meant by socialism is heavily influenced by the classical Marxian definition of socialism as a non-market stateless system of society where the productive resources are owned in common by everyone  - not the state or some private corporation.  Socialism in this sense is and was a synonym for communism This view of socialism predates Lenin who changed the meaning of  socialism completely to a refer to a kind of  society which he called a \u201cstate capitalist monopoly\u201d run in the interest of the whole people. It is pointless arguing whether Marx \u2018s definition of socialism was right or whether Lenin's definition of socialism was right.  No one has a patent on the word socialism.  But if you are going to ask wherever socialism has failed then reasonably you have to explain which definition of socialism it s that you are using or have in mind. By Marx\u2019s definition of socialism socialism has not failed - however much our free marketeer types may dislike this fact - quite simply because it has not yet been tried Lenin\u2019s definition of socialism has been tried on the other had.  Did it fail?  Yes and no .  For instance in the early  years of the Soviet Union particularly from the 1930s onwards, it was clear that its state capitalist economy as I would call it outstripped the growth rates of western economies by quite a significant  margin.  It fared less well in the post war years because there were serious problems endemic to this kind of \u201ccommand economy\u201d model of running capitalism which increasingly came to the fore as the economy matured and diversified Other forms of state capitalism such as what exists in China have seemed to be more flexible in this regard and we now have a situation where so called \u201ccommunist\u201d China is pipped to knock \u201ccapitalist\u201d America off its pedestal as the number one economy in the world. That in itself is a salutary warning against the dangers of generalising! ",

            "answer_text": "The capitalist will tell you that socialism is anything other than capitalism and\u2026failed as a result. No central govt. in history has ever been an exclusively socialist govt. and thus, has\u2026never been tried. I define socialism as did Oxford before WWII and the capitalist propaganda successfully butchered it to mean communism. OXFORD: govt. ownership of most if not all\u2026means of production. However, with the tendency (deliberate desire) of even those today and here to make the denigrating parallel with communism often reflect just enough state into their wish, in order to define socialism as equal to communism and\u2026they are wrong. Communism is collectivization and govt, ownership of everything\u2026including you. Socialism is neither of those. [It] is mostly private. For example in a socialist economy there is private profits, private property, private corp. boards of directors, socialism does not require that all proceeds from the economy becomes govt. property to be directed by govt. All socialism is, is an ideal similar to capitalism with almost all of the same incentives, but is simply a break from ALL profits being private and thereby, without a single deference to society at large. The capitalist battles against the tax code and payroll costs and simply doesn\u2019t want to share a n y t h i n g with anybody. Socialism in fact, leaves profits and incentives in place but constructs a safety net for those who understand even the capitalist, there are winners and loser in capitalism and losers need certain basics until\u2026they win again. Economic theoreticians argue that socialism only lasts until you run out of other peoples\u2019 money. The US has over time, devoted Trillion$ of taxpayer wealth to corporate socialism, with subsidies, price supports, huge bank bailouts, govt, run, single-payer \u2018health\u2019 insurance corps. etc., etc. So when will the taxpayer run out of that money ? [He] has and has been broke and for 40 years hence the capitalist borrowing some $21 trillion at the national level and another $50 trillion on the private level. You decide which is better and would have done just as well since WWII. ",
