            "answer_text": "They probably don\u2019t think that at all. Instead, they are probably worried that you won\u2019t get into a top college or university. And they may also be worried that the kids of some of their friends are going to get better grades \u2014 and better college acceptances \u2014 than you; and then they would not have anything to brag about. There is no good answer for this. Almost every kid experiences it, in one form or another, from his parents. Probably the best way to try to de-fuse this is to say something like \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. I want to get into [chosen university] or somewhere nearly as good, so I am pushing for the best grades I can get. But I know [chosen university] demands well-rounded students, so I\u2019m participating in [list of extra-cirricuars and athletics and non=school activities] so I can show I\u2019m not just an academic nerd.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think I might need to change or drop, to improve my college application?\u201d. Most likely they won\u2019t have any good answer for that, and they will just tell you to work harder, to which you will agree. However, they might tell you to cut out the TV programs, or your social media postings and reading on the internet, or your use of your smart phone, or hanging out with your buddies. In such a case, they will be right. They have you, and you should cut those back, significantly. Then your grades will go up, and they will nag you less, and everyone will be happier. Except, of course, the moronic kids you were gabbing with on Facebook or Instagram. See how easy it is to make your parents happy, and get them off your back? ",

If you don\u2019t care about it, you\u2019ll find an excuse.\u201d This could be an opportunity for an open discussion. \u201cGood grades\u201d to them might be irrelevant. I\u2019ve had plenty of conferences where a student is getting B, but the parents think A\u2019s are the only acceptable grade\u2026 Talk with the parents and explain what actions you ARE doing, and seek reasonable suggestions to improve. I had a conversation with a student (in a parent-teacher conference):Student - \u201cMr. Hollis, your way just doesn\u2019t work for me... I do it my own way.\u201d Me - \u201cDid you get the correct answers?\u201dStudent - \u201cNo.\u201dMe - \u201cThen perhaps you should do it my way.\u201dStudent - \u201cBut I just don\u2019t get you.\u201dMe - \u201cDo you read the text?\u201dStudent - \u201cNo.\u201dMe - \u201cDo you take notes every class?\u201dStudent - \u201cNo.\u201dMe - \u201cDo you spend at least 30 minutes on your homework, checking your answers as you go?\u201dStudent - \u201cNo.\u201dMe - \u201cDo you make a study guide before the test?\u201dStudent - \u201cNo.\u201dMe - \u201cDo you see me for extra help, before or after school?\u201dStudent - \u201cNo.\u201dMe - \u201cWell, it\u2019s hard for me to accept your critique that my way doesn\u2019t work for you when you haven\u2019t done it my way. If you have your own way that works for you, that\u2019s fine. But if it doesn\u2019t work for you, you really should try it my way\u2026\u201d ",
