            "answer_text": "Because physical education covers things that other subjects neglect to teach. Although subjects like science, math, english e.t.c teach skills that will be important for a whole host of different careers and while PE is only said to have skills limited to those more physical careers (sports industry e.t.c), the skills learnt in PE can be beneficial for Everybody. Obviously, PE teaches you alot about the body/health. You can use this knowledge to improve your understanding of health and well-being/self esteem, physically improve performance or you can simply learn to develop a sense of enjoyment through movement. Knowing how to keep your body in good knick, especially as you get older, is important to a functional and happy life (in most cases). PE also gives you the oppurtunity to work in groups and overcome both physical and mental challenges. Leadership qualities are often easy to assess in students within a PE class, as it takes alot of strength to negotiate the contradictions between the competitive and co-operative nature of the subject. There is also the argument that PE should be used to address social concerns related to health (obesity e.t.c) although, this should be done for educative as opposed to political purposes. ",

            "answer_text": "History has been created as India brings home the title of world champions in Badminton and the remarkable person that did it has broken all stigmas, as it's a woman. None other than our own PV Sindhu, has now become the first Indian to win the world championship in Badminton. The match was held in Basil, Switzerland. Sindhu's opponent, Nozomi Okuhara, the rising player from Japan, was completely vanquished with a scoreline of 21-7 as Sindhu began with the aggressive and attacking approach. The fans were also startled to see Sindhu in a new style. She has made the country proud and her mother's celebrating the victory by cooking 'Fish Curry' and 'Keema' as it's the way, to welcome champions, her mother said. It is also brought in light that it was her mother's birthday, on the 25th of August, when Sindhu won the championship. 'I dedicate this medal to my mother', Sindhu said. Sports today, has become an incredible choice for making a successful career. It includes working hard day and night but if you're one for sports, then this can turn into a rewarding choice. For the similar reason, physical education is being taught in schools for the overall holistic development of a child, along with several benefits that fitness gives to an individual and opening the doors of becoming a sports person and finding your right passion or the right sport. It is thus, equally important to choose the right school for your child that understands the value of physical education. Finding these schools can be a cumbersome task, and thus schools affiliated with the right board can save your time. In similar news, NWAC; Northwest Accreditation Comission, is an international board that provides accreditation to various schools all around the world. Under this board, physical education is not only a compulsory subject but also, adequate resources and knowledge is provided to all the students to ensure that all children stay healthy and fit, and those who wish to pursue this as more than a hobby and develop a career out of it later in the future, can start paving upon the right path from the early stage. Sports and Physical education not only strengthen the physical capabilities and stamina within a child, but also promote the development of mental health and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. Not only that, sports help in reducing stress and anxiety among students which is the major cause of deterioration in their academic performance. We, as parents, must therefore ensure that our child is maintaining a healthy lifestyle by inculcating physical education and sports in their routine. ",
