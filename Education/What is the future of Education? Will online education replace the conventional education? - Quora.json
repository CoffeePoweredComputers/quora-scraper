            "answer_text": "An interesting question. First it depends on what type and level of education you speak of. With the basic educational levels, I believe the classroom will still be there, as in many cases both parents work. They could lay off teachers and put more elearning in these schools, and also the socialization is important. As you move to higher education, college classes are now listening to a monitor of the teacher while in a classroom-to me very sterile and does nothing for my enthusiasm of the subject or the chance to meet a potential role model. Since many people work, but want to further their education, online classes are a practical choice, but again, the lack of socialization and debate or conversation and exchange of ideas does not really happen. Postgraduate classes can utilize some online courses, but the thesis and dissertation preparation must be done on a one to one basis with your professor. I believe that many classes will be held online for the college to make more money and convenience for students, but the classroom will probably never totally go away. At least I hope not-they were some of my best and most memorable days with friends made that are still with me today. I graduated with my undergrad degree in 1980, and my Masters in 1987. The PC was just coming out in the USA for personal use\u2014Yes, I can proudly say all my formal education came from books and instructors\u2014I don\u2019t think I did too bad\u2014do you? I worked three jobs at a time during my undergrad days, and full time ER nurse at the graduate level. I did not have time for Pokemon or computer games, but now I would take on-line computer courses that I plan on doing-but education costs so much in the US! So my plans are on hold till money comes\u2014nurses are not rich unfortunately. ",

            "answer_text": "I think, yes, in the couple of decades to come, i believe the way online education has been making its mark for the last couple of years and deeper and deeper penetration of internet, the online education would come as a strong alternative approach to education , if not a complete substitute. Not one, there are millions of reasons for this. Be present at institute physically to gain knowledge would going to be obsolete. Students would likely be gather under one hall together on one fine day only for giving exams/interviews at max. Though the legendary institutes like IITs/IIMs would continue to function and are not likely to be replaced any sooner. Masses would opt for online education instead of joining random not so privileged xyz institute of the country in the years to come, provided that degree/statement of marks obtained through such online courses holds same credibility and validity as the one passed out from real institute as pr govt norms. The well known institutes contributes not only towards quality education, but also towards research and development, hence, no question, online education cannot be thought as any substitute of them as of now. Schools , i think, will be the first to be replaced by digital institutes, followed by ordinary colleges. I think, coaching centers, on the other-hand, would continue to exists as long as competitive exams exists. Many students would continue to prefer eye to eye instructor rather than virtual one when it comes to prepare for competitive exams. Digital institutions would have many advantages over the current physical institutes, and is likely to attract more and more online beneficiaries, starting from cities and than making its mark in small cities to villages. Of-course, Students can learn at their own comfort of place and timings.They can choose the instructor of their choice. If they don\u2019t like the instructor, join some other website to pursue the same course.If class is missed, recorded lectures would be thee to cover up.No hectic fees and financial exploitation from Institutes.Encourage educational discussions on various forums.Saves a lot of time, in school we all know, who studies !! Instead students will be listening to lecture with all attentions, grasping every work spoken in online classes.Many students need to change their school/college die ti frequent transfer of their father who is working in govt job. This problem would cease to exist for obvious reasons.There shall be better and encouraging teachers. Spatial proximity of the school/college is a deciding factor today on the basis of which students/parents choose. No matter, how in competitive the set of teachers or educational environment is setup in such institutes, we have to choose them. Hence, there is a lack of sense of competition among schools which results in not encouraging them to improve the the schooling system. With online institutes in place, there will be no in competitive teachers. The system of feedback would become more transparent and effective.However, there shall be certain disadvantages as well. Students are under obligation to attend physical schools/colleges. In case of online courses. most students would become lethargic, out of schedule, undisciplined towards attending online classes. However, this can be controlled by instructor.It shall be not possible to impart online education to Remote villages because of lack of resources - awareness, electricity, equipment, internet etc.Sports and extra curricular activities shall be a great miss. But then i believe, in the era of changing world, there shall be schools only for such activities. Students can join them for personality development - 1 hr/ 2 hr per week is suffice.In schools/Colleges, Students are made to communicate in English. At home, there shall be no encouragement to develop the habit to communicate in English unless enforced and encouraged by parents. But again, how many parents would do that ? Again, as stated in point 3 above, enhancing communication skill also needs to be addressed by personality development institutes.In a nutshell, it shall be great to have online institutes with same credibility and acceptance as the physical institutes of today in the years to come. They will be increase the competition, force the physical institutions to improve their service else go vanish. Overall, i see, online education shall be a big positive influence in not so sound education system of the country. ",
