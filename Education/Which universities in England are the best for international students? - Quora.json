            "answer_text": "You have limited your query to England, but I can confirm St. Andrews, Scotland is one of the best UK universities for international students. 30% of the student body is from overseas. I am an American who went to St. Andrews in 1982 to 1986, when there was very little structure for international students. Over time, and particularly after the Duke of Cambridge attended St. Andrews and had a relatively glamorous and open life there, St. Andrews has become a third choice for such students after Oxford and Cambridge. You are foolish if you do not look at St. Andrews. ",

            "answer_text": "Any of the Russell Group universities are very good and between them they will cover the vast majority of courses you may wish to study. Make sure your English is up to speed, IELTS 6.5 or 7 and apply. The larger universities have quite a mix internationally, though there have been increasing numbers of students from China, who tend to be the largest non-British nationality. I would personally avoid the bigger cities such as London and Manchester as they are more expensive places to live and the education is just as good elsewhere, but that\u2019s also a personal preference; the congestion and the traffic gets old, fast. Research your subject and see which Russell group uni has the best reputation in that area, then apply there. Good luck. ",
