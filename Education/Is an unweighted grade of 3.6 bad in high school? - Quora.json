            "answer_text": "Consider this, Universities weigh your gpa (classes you take and the grades you get in each of them) more on a college admission application moreso than SAT/ACT scores. Essentially having a high gpa with relatively good SAT scores is better than having a relatively good gpa with high SAT scores. And everyone here points out that being well-rounded and having excellent skills in extra-curriculars is important. In top tier Colleges, having the extra curricular skills is a must. With that said, if you have a 3.6 unweighted gpa - a relatively good gpa-, then you must have exceptionally high SAT and those extra-curriculars to have a fighting chance at getting in to an academically revered University. Overall a 3.6 gpa in high school is not bad. But if you wish to go to a top college, then a 3.6 is low. you'd want your weighted gpa to be 4.3-5.0 ",

            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you're talking about yourself.  Answer:  Depends on a lot of things. What classes are you taking? Are they AP classes or regular classes?  Are you doing any extracurriculars?  Furthermore, \"bad\" is relative. If you want to get into a top-10 school then 3.6 is probably not what you want to be shooting for. But if you're going for a more relaxed university then 3.6 can be great!  Lots of things to consider.  To sum up:  1. Determine what your goal is. 2. Examine the circumstances.  3. Evaluate if you'll reach your goals. Reaching your goals means you're doing good.  Note: On the third step try to avoid comparisons of yourself to others. Comparing oneself is usually a more harmful thing than helpful.  ",
