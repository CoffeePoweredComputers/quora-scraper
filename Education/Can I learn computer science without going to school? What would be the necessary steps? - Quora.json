            "answer_text": "The short answer to your question is Yes. My \u201ctitle\u201d is Software Engineer and I have no degree. I don't say this with pride, or to encourage others not to pursue education. I say this purely to show you what's possible. People often ask me how I got in my career. My faith is the number one reason, but this isn't a apiritual discussion so I will give you some serious action items. Be DecisiveYou need to eradicate all doubt of possibility from your mind. Decide it's possible and begin working. Which leads into\u2026 2. Focus and Follow Through Once you've decided your going to learn CS shut everything else out and start working. Embarking on something new is thrilling, but what happens when you face challenges? Here is where \u201cfollow through\u201d, \u201cgrit\u201d, \u201ctenacity\u201d all come into play. Train yourself to enjoy the process of the \u201clong game\u201d. 3. Master Learning Itself Use this time to hone in your learning process. Learning CS is a lot like learning an instrument. Shorter consistent practice sessions everyday are going to benefit you more than binging 3 hours and forgetting most of what you learned. Also, constantly supplement theory with practical implementation. Don't just watch the tutorials, use the tutorials as inspiration for your own projects. Then use the tutorials as a supplement. BUILD THINGS CONSTANTLY. Some of the other answers have mentioned resources but I'll mention some here as well. Coding Problems: Codewars, Project Euler Education: MIT Open Courseware, Pluralsight, Udemy \u2026 That's the brunt of what you need. CS is very rewarding, and very much so an art in my opinion. Art executed through logic. If you take this on the skills you develop will be applicable everywhere. Stay consistent, and never back down. ",

Each individual mystery, you\u2019ll find, is incredibly small and pedestrian once you have understood it. Get the declarative nature of mathematics out of your head. Programming is not math, it\u2019s procedural (e.g., \u201c=\u201d is the assignment operator, not a declaration of equality.)Understand that you are going to have to learn several disciplines simultaneously at first:Using the build tools, and the build processLearning the fundamentals of programming that apply to all languagesLearning the syntax and grammar of the language you chose to start withChoose a language that\u2019s easy to learn. Start with Python. This is important because it eliminates all the hairy particulars of more stuffy languages and allows you to focus on the principles of programming. Learning additional languages is easy.Download the software for writing software.Start writing some programs. This will obviously involve seeking out some tutorials, or you can even find college lectures on YouTube. But writing programs is the only way to learn how to write programs.
