            "answer_text": "You have not provided the way your school weights AP and honors classes. You also have not stated how many credits you have alteady earned to have a GPA of 2.5. Once you know this you can find your what the possible average could be. For example, if you have 24 credits and a GPA of 2.5 multiply these together to get total points earned. (Total points earned \u00f7 total credits = current grade point average or GPA) 24 \u00d7 2.5 = 60. Now we will ASSUME the AP and Honors classes are weighted as two times a regular class. We will also ASSUME you recieve top scores in all your classes. (4 classes \u00d7 2.0 weighted \u00d7 4.0 scale = 32 points AND 4 classes \u00d7 1.0 weighted \u00d7 4.0 = 16. The sum is 48.) We will now see what the highest possible GPA could be based on these assumptions. (60 + 32) \u00f7 (24 + 8) = (92 \u00f7 32) = 2.875 So based on these assumptions you would not have a GPA of 3.5. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, that won't be possible. I took 4 APs in my junior year, and I had a 4.1 GPA before I took those classes. I say it won't go up much because you're only taking 3 APs and an honors class won't bring you up much, and neither will the APs, regardless if you get all As in them. After both semesters of my Junior year, I ended up with a 4.28 GPA. I didn't go up much and keep in mind I took 4 APs. In your case though, you'd only go up if you get all As in ALL your classes, but that wouldn't be enough to bring you up to a 3.0, at most it may go up to a 2.7. Good luck though! ",
