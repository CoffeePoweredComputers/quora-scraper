Joan Smith they say Timmys mom or something like that. Usually if you are writing an excuse you put current date and start dear ( the teachers name ) im sorry Timmy was absent yesterday or when ever it was. He has \u201c the reason\u201d you missed school. Example. Yesterday my son timmy had a bad case of the flu, i kept him home and watched his symptoms and finally took him to the local dr to have them prescribe meds to help. I have the dr. Paperwork if you need it. Hope it helps i dont keep him home often but it needed to be done this time. Sincerely Mrs. Joan smith. My number is 443-123- 4578 if you have any questions. Thank you. ",
