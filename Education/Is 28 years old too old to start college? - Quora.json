            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say that it\u2019s the best time to go to college. If, for the last few years, you have been trying to figure out what it is that you like (because you wasn\u2019t sure)/ you applied for various jobs (positions)/ you tested your assumptions about what it is that you\u2019d like to do/ you didn\u2019t rush your decision, but rather told yourself \u201cYou know what, actually, I\u2019m going to do the opposite of what everyone else is doing. I\u2019m going to try a bunch of things and see what it is that excites me.\u201d you are in a much better position to have a fulfilling life than the majority of kids who, unfortunately, bought into this myth that you need to know what you want to be in life when you\u2019re right out of high school. You feel you should have started right out of high school because everyone else believes that that\u2019s the way it should be/ that your early 20s is actually the only time you can go to college. Will people think it\u2019s weird that you waited that long before applying? Of course they will! Because they all believe that the way to build your career is to decide in your teenage years what you want to be in life, apply for college in your early 20s or even before you\u2019re 20, get a job that is line with the subject that you majored in and start building your career (climbing up that ladder). All because of a ludicrous expectation almost all adults have. Expectation that you should know what you want to do in life even before you got your chance to try anything. And why do they have this expectation and continue to sell young adults on this bullshit rule? Because they didn\u2019t have their chance to be unsure either. Recognise that it is a bullshit rule everyone follows without giving it any consideration at all. And then what? You will be 60 and still telling yourself \u201cOh, if only I went to that college in my early 20s, just like everybody else did.\u201d? It\u2019s a very limiting belief that if you want to be something in your life you have only this short time period between your late teens and your mid 20s. That the quality of your life is predicated on whatever you did or didn\u2019t in our early 20s. ",

            "answer_text": "I went to university at 20ish and failed out \u2014 an embarrassing moment in my life for sure. My dad worked super hard to give me just enough money to make tuition. But the University was big, and I barely had an understanding about what a university was. My parents did not go, my grandparents did not go, all of my aunts and uncles did not have degrees. The first week of classes, the train & bus service went on strike. I had to take a rikkety bike down the busy Toronto streets and I literally nearly died. I also got a job at around the same time, and travelling back and forth from uni to work was exhausting. I got caught up in the organization. I could not figure out the registrar\u2019s office, or funding, or bursaries etc. I had a paper due and printing it out in the computer lab had me all confused. My parents convinced me to take courses that were out of my league and by December, my year was a mess. I hid out the rest of the year, telling my parents that I failed my courses. But it was worse than that. I did not fail really \u2014 I flaked out. I think my grade averages for the term were 15, 8 , 0, 0 & 0. On the other hand, I knew I was smarter than that. I also had some really clever ideas to study. I went back to part-time school at 27, taking one course to see how it would go. Got an A. Then I took two summer courses. Both A+. Eventually I finished with very good marks and went to grad school to become a librarian. Now I have a PhD in public policy and am doing a post-doc in History with a large amount of complex coding and quantitative analysis. Oh yeah \u2014 Thanks to some frugality and the support of friends and family, I finished my degrees with no debt. In short, no. 28 is not too old to start university. If anything, it may be the very best time to start. You\u2019ll be in your early 30s when you finish and ready to make the world your oyster. You can do it! ",
