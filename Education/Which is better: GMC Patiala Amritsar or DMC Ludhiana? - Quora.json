            "answer_text": "DMC, no second thoughts. The teachers there are very good and pay a lot of attention to students. The college's building has been newly constructed and so the labs and lecture halls are all very good. Due to some amount of strictness, students generally don't slack off and so it's good to develop a base for bigger subjects. Also, they frequently conduct tests and so the students have to study regularly. The college campus is separate from the hospital but it's not so tough to commute. The best thing is that each batch has 100 students and so it's not too crowded. GMC Amritsar do not have much perks. The teachers are way too lenient, no check on attendance except community medicine, poor labs and equipment is of very bad quality. Worst is that each batch has 200 students and the lecture halls are too suffocating. They are not properly ventilated and some halls don't have air conditioners. The only perk it has is being a government college, the exposure one gets from patients is very vast as compared to DMC. You are on yourselves in GMC so you can spend ample time in OPD of different departments and learn clinical stuff. It doesn't mean that exposure in DMC is bad. It's very good. It's just that since GMC is less strict, a student gets more practical experience. Well, if you are a person who wants full freedom, do not want to attend lectures and waste all your time with friends then go for GMC. DMC is like a school while GMC will be like training in field.

            "answer_text": "I am from Ludhiana and I am doing MBBS from KMC Manipal. There are certain factors which are Involved when you are choosing your college. I will take them one by one Ranking of Institution - Although DMC might be better ranked than GMC Amritsar the patient exposure and training you will get in GMC would be far more better Fee - Hands down if you are getting a government college and you cannot afford private then you should go to GMC Amritsar City - Obviously Ludhiana is a better city to live in as compared to Amritsar I am a believer that you should never live in the same city as your professional college From my personal experience I got a seat by giving NEET 2016 and I got DMC but not a government college in Punjab. I would suggest rather than opting for DMC people should start preferring Manipal as it is top 10 medical college and the amount you spend is approximately the same as in DMC. I did not qualify for a government seat and if I would have I would have taken it. But now when I look back if you can afford studying from a private institute you should come to KMC Manipal as it is one of the best medical institutes in the country and the training and patient exposure you get here is amazing. City wise also Manipal is a nice to be in as an undergrad Answering your question if I had a choice between GMC and DMC I would have gone to GMC Amritsar ",
