            "answer_text": "Depends on what you consider to be worthwhile. If you see basing its worth on how successful you will be in that field, that will depend on how much effort you put into your job and education. I suppose the people or cultures that we currently havent found much of what they left behind but are likely to have left a great many things that could still be hidden somewhere we have not looked, would be a beneficial area to focus on if you want success. If little is known about them snd their way of life snd you have reason to believe that the answers to this could remain unfound then any discovery you make would probably have a big value. If you see basing it's worth upon how much you will like your profession, then all I can say Is that if you are truly interested in the it, snd enjoy it- then yes it will be worth it. If you see basing it on the value of the potential artifacts or knowledge that may be discovered, that will forever be an unknown. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not sure what you mean by worth it. Archeologists do a lot of different kinds of work. Some never leave the university and some travel extensively to dig in out of the way places. So what kind of archaeologist do you mean. I would add that it depends on where in the world you are and where you expect to dig or work in the field. Some countries have extensive archaeological programs and in some it is hard to get work after you graduate. Do your research. Find out what is available where you want to live and work. Find out what your expectations are around the kind of work you would be doing as an archaeologist. Do you see yourself in a university setting or out in the field or a bit of both? What part of the world interests you in terms of the archaeology? Few get rich in any field so first find something that you love to do. Something that keeps your interest. ",
