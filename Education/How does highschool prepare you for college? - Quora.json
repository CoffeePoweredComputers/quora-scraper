            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an 18-year-old college freshman in California right now, and this is what I have to say about this question: Much of it depends solely on how you make use of your high school experience. I graduated high school with a 4.3 GPA and 10 AP classes taken. I also did a year of football (I played DB) before getting my knee blown out and totally fucked for 6 months. To make up for my inability to play football, I also did things like Science Fair/Olympiad and started a few clubs, which eventually got me to quit football for the rest of high school. I am now a biology major at my local university seeking a career in neurosurgery. Since medical schools often emphasize the importance of being a Mr. Perfect, I guess I can say that I did spend my experience in high school well. The things I did helped me get into UC Davis, UC Riverside, UCSB, UC Merced, UC Irvine, and UCSD. I instead chose to go to Fresno State University in my hometown and am currently in my first semester of college. In the end, my heavy involvement in extracurricular activities helped me balance my academics with my social life and still do well academically and socially. Hear me when I say that this is a skill that is SO, SO critical to surviving college. See, my dad told me that in order to get the most out of college, you can\u2019t afford to be a bookworm. You need to study really well AND be extremely prominent socially. Going back to that statement about medical schools wanting applicants to be absolutely perfect, this is what I mean. Social networking is a highly important skill that can play a critical role in helping your career take flight. If you just sit down and study all day, you are neither practicing proper time management nor are you refining yourself and preparing for your future via social networking. You are not talking to those super-intelligent professors and researchers in your university who will give you nice research opportunities, nor are you receiving the advice of people in the same boat as you and how they are preparing for their career. I know some older guys who were absolute bookworms in high school and carried it on into college, and I can tell you that half of them have experienced mental breakdowns because of how mundane their lives were. They ended up with almost no friends, no one to study with (some of them did fail classes because of this), and no social life, meaning that they\u2019re swimming through this ocean all alone. That is incredibly tough to do. I know it sounds harsh, but here\u2019s the bitter truth: no matter what your career goal is, it is important to strive to be absolutely PERFECT in every respect, from the way you make your dorm room bed, to the way you dress and converse, to the grades you get on your final exams. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m perfect. I mean I ain\u2019t gonna post pictures of myself but I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and 125 lbs at 18 years of age, which is quite small for a guy and especially for a former high school football player. There are girls on campus who are twice my size lol. Yes, I am not of ideal stature. Yes, I do get the occasional B on a test. Yes, I do sometimes say stupid shit in a conversation. Yes, I am a bit black-washed, which is weird for someone of Indian descent. You don\u2019t see a lot of Indian guys joining a sport dominated by black people. But that\u2019s me. No matter what my flaws are, I STRIVE to be the best version of me every day. When did I start? High school, and boy am I thankful I started preparing myself then. It helps to have these good time management skills and social skills that I would\u2019ve otherwise not had if I hadn\u2019t trained myself in high school. This is where high school really becomes important, because I knew my 1510 SAT score wouldn\u2019t be even the least accurate in assessing whether I was really ready for college. To be ready for college, it takes grit and INTRINSIC motivation, not really as much an SAT or ACT score. Ain\u2019t nobody gonna be pushing you to turn in assignments in college like your high school teachers probably did. In college, if you didn\u2019t do your homework on time and accurately, then that\u2019s your funeral and ain\u2019t nobody gonna attend it but you. Stop asking bullshit questions like this, because your teachers ain\u2019t gonna do a damn thing in preparing you for college. That\u2019s up to YOU, son. It\u2019s what YOU make of it. If you don\u2019t want to be involved in high school, then that\u2019s going to come back to bite you later in college and the work world. Here\u2019s a suggestion, then: get your ass off your couch and start putting in the WORK to be a better, more well-rounded individual. Come on man! It all starts now. You feel me? ",

            "answer_text": "They say they are, and have done so for about 100 years. But this is only true for those students who have been identified as being \u201ccollege-bound.\u201d The non College Prep (CP) students used to have classes that taught skills useful in the workforce such as home economics classes, shop classes, typing, auto mechanics, agriculture techniques etc.. Many school districts have done away with \u201ctracked\u201d classes and instead offer more easily digestible (aka \u201cdumbed-down\u201d) classes for everyone. However, at the same time. schools today often offer Advanced Placement (AP) classes which will allow kids with certain skills and knowledge to attain course credit in subjects like History, Biology, Trigonometry, etc. when they go to college. It used to be, that Preparation for college was easily determined by the numeric Intelligence Quotient (IQ) score a student did on an educational test (most often, the Stanford-Binet). Researchers eventually realized that this test was primarily a measure of verbal fluency (which is actually a pretty good measure of success in college). In California, anyone who graduates from High School or obtains their GED can go to Junior College to earn an AA degree or certificate in some field of study, so I guess you could truthfully say that our high schools are preparing students for college.

However, some people learn study habits, learn not to procrastinate, learn to pay attention in class, etc. In other words, they learn how to learn at a higher level. Some go on to community colleges with their old ineffective high school (bad) study habits. (This included me for a long time.) Some use their learned study habits as a ladder to tackle more demanding coursework. In many cases a lot of us end up calling these people \u201cboss\u201d. Obviously there are tons of exceptions of every kind. I was happy with C\u2019s in high school. I was happy with C\u2019s for my first couple of years of college, because I never studied, and never needed to just to skate by. For many classes I never even bought the book. ",

The deeper and thus the metaphorical \u201celephant in the room\u201d is the what we mean by education and what should adolescents learn today from the ages of 15\u201318? Do we have realistic expectations of the value of college? This would be a totally different and longer discussion. To answer your question as asked, I would that high school does not prepare you for college any more than college prepares you for life. Obviously high schools with teachers who teach exceptionally well by some honest metric and whose teachers are motivated and inspired to impart a lifelong love of learning do a better job of preparing students for college. To the extent that the school sees secondary education as college preparation and backs up its teachers is the extent to which high school prepares a student. As a general proposition, I\u2019d say high school does a terrible job of preparing students for college. The entire educational system needs A MAJOR overhaul\u2026but that\u2019s a book. ",

            "answer_text": "AP courses - the AP exams gave me college credit.High School taught me some fundamental skills such as algebra and calculus. This is only useful for me because STEM-related majors. An Art or Music Major may not find it as useful.High School has a GPA system that many colleges would look at during the admission process.In high school, from my experience: English Classes - this should be called reading class. Students would read a few chapters overnight, fill out a worksheet, come into class and take a redundant quiz, go over the worksheet. There would be like one or two major essay assignments. Occasionally, there might be a vocab quiz which contains words from the book. In high school, writing only comes in one form: Essays, and they teach it like a mathematical equation: (Hook + Background + Topic Sentence + Example + Analysis + Concluding Sentence + Clincher = Essay). In college, writing is taught the way it should be, an art form! It\u2019s more expressive. Math Classes - the rough basics of algebra and calculus were the most important skills for me in college. There are still many little nit-picky stuff that I have yet to see again. For example: Imaginary numbers (useful for Electrical Engineering majors I believe), Flower Graphs (I haven\u2019t seen much use for that), geometric proofs (I have never seen that since geometry class at high school). History Classes - for me, high school\u2019s history class wasn\u2019t that useful in regards to the college courses. In High School, it talked mostly about blacks vs whites, racism problems, social class, human stupidity. In College, there is a Gen Ed history requirement, but I get to choose the course that I want to fulfill it which could be something completely different than high school\u2019s history courses. Science Classes - From what I heard, introductory science classes in college were much easier than science classes in my High School. High School prepares you in the sense that its very existence is a requirement in the societal system to enter college. ",

            "answer_text": "I am from Pakistan, so what I am about to write would be reflective of my experience in high school. Teachers in high school certainly do their bit, when it comes to preparing students for the next step of their journey. In Pakistan, corporal punishment is quite common. When students fail to perform to a certain set standard, then teachers try to tell them in the most forceful manner known to them that they, the students, need to get their act together and start performing well. The problem still prevalent in our system is that we still have a one size fits all model: starting form 9th grade, all of the students, whether they have any interest in science or not, are forced to study Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. In case of students neither interested in nor capable of studying science subjects, this approach not only wastes their time but also forces them to take an otherwise avoidable path. That digression aside, I believe that teachers in high schools certainly try to instil some sense into the students. Whether all of the students can be taught the same subjects is another story. ",

In college you would do a lot of reading so you\u2019ve got to develop your verbal skills. In addition to your vocabulary you need critical reading skills. You have to learn to read at a faster rate. The second objective is develop your reasoning and mathematical skills. High school provides the much needed foundation for science programs. You would also do a lot of reading in other fields like history. In addition to this college admission officers would be on the look out for well rounded students.
