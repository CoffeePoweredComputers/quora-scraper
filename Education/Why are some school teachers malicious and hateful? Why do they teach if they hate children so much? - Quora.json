She says that she is not as patient as she was in the beginning; I don\u2019t think she is like one of those teachers, malicious and hateful, that we all have had, but she is not as understanding as she was in her first few years of teaching.

            "answer_text": "I suppose there are malicious and hateful people in every profession, and, unfortunately, there are schools that tolerate this kind of behavior towards students. Some teachers actually believe it's in the students' best interest. They believe that when a student doesn't achieve, it's because they are \u201cunmotivated\u201d and the way to motivate them is to let them know that their performance \u201cwill not be tolerated.\u201d In my many years of teaching, I have found very few students who are actually unmotivated. When I give kids work they can do and teach them the skills they need to do it, they do it. The teachers who use negative techniques to motivate students end up more and more furious with them until the year ends and they have the good fortune to go on to another teacher. ",
