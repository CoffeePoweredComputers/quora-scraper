            "answer_text": "This was the million dollar question for me during the councelling, I was in a lot of dilemma to choose between these two. So I had been to both the colleges and I think I could answer it well . Both are great institutes and are have developed well. We can't say that one is better than the other, but I would compare them in some aspects which I considerd while joining and the decision is yours. Being a South Indian(AP) my comparision would be in a South indian point of view. 1. Academics: Faculty, Teaching and Facilities are best in all peripheral AIIMS but the curriculum is quite different. The schedule of AIIMS BBSR is pretty hectic with weekly exams. I don't think it is too bad but Eventually you would be exhausted and become tired of them. In BPL there are no weekly exams but only part completion tests after completion of a chapter. 2. Language: This is the aspect that should be considerd the most while joining. In AIIMS BPL the language is purely hindi but In AIIMS BBSR you need to understand the Odiya as well. Even though you can manage with Hindi in BBSR but the patients would vist the hospital from all over the state including Villages who don't Know Hindi well So you need to Learn Odiya as well. There were Odiya classes in AIIMS BBSR every week. As I don't know much Hindi and personally I felt learning Hindi would be more beneficial than learning Odiya. 3. Sports facilities: In this Aspect AIIMS BBSR winsas it has almost all the facilities. The Sports facilities are under development in AIIMS BPL. There are Volley ball, Basket ball, foot ball grounds and there are also Table tennis tables but no Gym and indoor badminton court in AIIMS BPL. 4. Climate: In AIIMS BBSR, the climate is very humid. You would sweat a lot even in normal days as it coastal area. In AIIMS BPL the climate is less humid and moderate weather. 5. Location of the institute from city: Both are not too far from the main city but comparitively AIMS BBSR is farther as it is in outskirts of the city. 6. Fest: Both have their own fests which are pretty good and are trying their best to compete with Pulse. Along with them AIIMS BPL had an additional Sports fest. In AIIMS BBSR there are more cultural type of fests and are more medical conferences. 7. Interaction with Seniors: In AIIMS BBSR there are strict rules for the first year students to prevent ragging which is good. As there is less interaction in Bbsr Personally ( personal opinion only no offence) I feel there is a better senior junior relationship in Bhopal. 8. As Both the institutes have more number of South Indians, Food is prepared to fit for both North and South Indian Students. These are very minor aspects which the both institutes differ as they Both are similar in major aspects. Both are great institutes and there are no major disadvantages in either of the institutes So you can choose any of them. I tried to provide the information I know and the decision is yours.

            "answer_text": "I have read the anonymous answers and would like to clear some doubts and misconceptions : First Year is always the toughest in any medical college in India because the course is to be completed just within 9 months and I am quite sure for first 1\u20132 months you will have no clue what to do, how to do and settling problems and it's completely normal. Regarding weekly tests, I know it's tiredsome and 2019 Batch had the worst of it because a new system was being tested. Numerous feedbacks were given to admin and I am quite sure it will be looked into and made into some middle ground. You do not have any clinicals or PG preparation in 1st year, so tests are OK.Most probably the answer is written by my 1st year junior, so he/she have not seen the 2nd year onward life. You don't have tests then and academics is smooth. 5.5 Years of MBBS is not same throughout.Regarding restrictions: They are put foreword by Govt of India not me or admin. Still I know my first year juniors who performed in annual day events and even for college teams.Ragging Scenerio : it's almost near nil; all I have seen is juniors interacting. If asking what your hobbies are, a few here and there questions is called ragging you can simply sit in your room; pretty sure no one will bang your door & force you. I always recommend my juniors to be very careful while talking to a fresher because you never know which crackpot feels too embarassed and complains. Few of my juniors have been suspended and it's very difficult to defend the charges.Social Life : Do you really think approx 1000 students are living here without a social life. Comeon. Just because you are in a protected environment doesn't mean you can't enjoy. Tons of photos I see of first year going to trips, outings, food, restuarants and their is no such bar on it.AIIMS Bhubaneswar do have flaws like every institution and criticism is always welcomed but saying that we create \u201ca fake image of goodness\u201d to promote just my college is something I don't accept. My seniors taught me not to bluff; before faculty, before patients, before the world. ",
