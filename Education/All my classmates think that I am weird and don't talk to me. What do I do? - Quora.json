            "answer_text": "Both of my kids were considered weird in highschool. They actually were not. They just had their own personality. The rest of the kids chose similar clothes, similar styles, similar attitudes, nobody wanted to stand out. They almost looked like clones. Now my kids are students in a multicultural environment. They enjoy the diversity a lot and they can be themselves. Classes are more interesting because everyone has a unique perspective and hanging out with each other is never boring. So, you stand out. Try to advertise it instead of hiding it. Do you have any skills or hobbies that could interest your classmates (eg programming, gaming, music, a good understanding of some classes)? Be generous, let them exploit you but make it clear you are doing them a favour. Is your style different? If you are confident you can make it a trend. Take a close look at the other kids. They don't want to stand out because they are afraid of becoming the outsider. But they are losing their personality in the process. I just saw a video on YouTube \u201cTom Sawyer the fence scene\u201d . It is a good example of how one can turn a situation completely around. Weird is good. Enjoy it! ",

They now have great careers and their salaries are outstanding.. \u201cWeird\u201d individuals in school are free thinkers, think outside of the box and that makes for a great employee or leader. They make great bosses because they learned compassion for others because of their earlier circumstances. Some of the greatest musicians were considered shy, insecure, and found music to be their escape. While performing they could be anyone they wanted. Read about some of the current, popular singer/songwriters. You\u2019ll see most were considered \u201cweird\u201d when they were young. So you see, \u201cweird\u201d can be a blessing in disguise. Good luck and I look forward to seeing just what exciting things come your way. ",

Search out one or two people in your class that you like and develop a friendship with them. On a practical side, you can have fun with this.

I had same situation in my class on guy just didn't have friend. Not because he was bad. Just because he didn't find place in our classe..don't try to change if you feel good with who you are. Different means \u2014 maybe more intelligent ? Maybe closed , maybe people feel bad next to you because you are looking at them.. ",
