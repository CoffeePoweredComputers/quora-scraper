            "answer_text": "I see a lot of people answering that punishing your kids for getting bad grades is a horrible thing to do, and no one should ever do it, but I would like to offer an alternate answer, that, in my mind, makes sense. I am the youngest of 3 girls, so I've seen both of my sisters go through school and make mistakes. One is a junior in college, and the other is a freshman in high school, and I've learned a lot from paying attention to them. The three of us have always been naturally smart kids. We learned to read at a fairly young age, we got good grades without really trying too hard, and we just applied ourselves well in school. When my oldest sister got to high school, she had a rude awakening. She was so used to not having to study, and just getting what she learned, that she started to get bad grades, because the coursework was harder and she wasn't putting in the effort anymore. The same thing is happening, now, with my other sister, except this started in eighth grade for her. My parents did punish both of my sisters. They didn't do anything drastic, but they've yelled at them and grounded them and taken their phones and whatnot. And, I think, in this situation, that's what needs to happen. So, it really depends. Some kids aren't naturally as school smart as others, and getting a B or a C or even a D is fine for them. But, others, who, if they just worked harder, and actually put in effort, instead of slacking off and hanging with friends like my sisters did/do, could get the grades, easily, then they do need to be punished, because they're not living up to their full potential, and they're not doing as good as they should be. I wouldn't worry about it as much if your children are in elementary or early middle school, but late middle school and high school are when they need to understand that grades are important, and colleges need to see what they can really do, not their half-assed schoolwork that gets them Ds and barely allows them to pass the class. But, like I said, some kids aren't naturally going to be able to get straight As. A lot of kids have to work hard to pull out Bs and Cs, so that's when it's not right to punish your child for bad grades. If they're putting in effort and trying their best, then that's fine. It's only acceptable when they're not. ",

            "answer_text": "So this is a college story, but I think it illustrates the point. It was junior year. I was a full time student who was also working 20 hours a week, and who was also a fundraising chair for a club and running weekly fundraisers. It was a hard year. I had this class. CMSC417. Networking. I had no prior networking experience besides setting up ethernet, but thats not the same thing as understanding protocols.The professor made the class insanely hard. Like start the class at 70 students, end with 15. We were doing networking in C. We weren't allowed to use ANY http libraries. We were building fucking http requests from SCRATCH. in C. Two days before it was due, a Saturday, id spent 8 hours working on it that day 2pm. Id spent all the time I could working on this project for the last week, starting immediately after it was assigned. I was on the verge of a nervous break. I just couldn't get it to work and I couldn't figure it out. I was hysterical. My dad called me out of the blue that day, wondering what my plans were for the weekend. Immediately knew something was wrong. Asked about it. He's also in the tech field, so he understood just how hard what I was doing was. Hell, he'd done it back in the day. And ya know what he told me? \u201cDrop the project for today. Come home. Leave your books and your laptop and come for dinner. If you stay the night, I've got cold beer. I know you're worried about grades but you're doing your best. Just please take a break\u201d. I felt like a load had been taken off my back. I could breathe. My dad understood. He believed in me. And he believed that I wasn't just not working hard enough or just not smart enough. He believed me when I said it was just that gosh darn hard. So I came home. And then my mom entered the picture. She started asking why my eyes were puffy and why i looked like Helena Bonham Carter in Harry Potter (crazy hair included). So, riding on my faith in my dad, I told her. And that was my mistake. She tried to punish me. I must be stupid. I never should have tried to go for CS. They shouldn't even be paying for me if I can't pass a darn class. Shes gonna ban me from attending my club\u2019s events. I'm not good enough. You know, the works. So off I went into a full nervous break down. Because she decided i needed to be punished bc I wasn't taking my education seriously enough. I'm now two years from that incident. I did end up passing that class. I fucking CRIED when I found out. My mom thought I was unhinged for being so happy about a C, but my dad got it. And he convinced my mom to just go with it. A year later, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from a top 15 CS program in the country (Go Terps). I just got into a competitive MBA program, mostly thanks to my manager's recommendation. I work for a darn cool startup as a Software Engineer. My point is, I got some bad grades along the way. Ive had some incredibly low grades. I nearly failed calc in high school, despite having an amazing teacher. I dropped a class in college past the drop date because I was failing so bad. Ive received more D assignment grades than I can count. But I'm still doing pretty darn well in life, career wise. Punishing grades doesn't get you anywhere. It doesn't address root causes. It doesn't help the kid do better. You know what will help? Addressing the root cause. Was it just a bad time and their mind was elsewhere? Forgive them. Did they play too many video games the night before and bomb a test? Punish them for the video games, not for the grade, and talk to them about handling their time well. Are they taking on too much? Talk to them and see if they need help, or if they may want to drop something. Are they suffering from some kind of illness (depression, migraines, really bad periods) in silence and having a hard time dealing with it? Talk to them and help them find a solution. Did they have a big sports game the night before the test? See if you can do something to help, and maybe talk to them about not going to such games if they're not super dedicated to athletics. If they are, see if something can be worked out with the teacher or coach. Did they not study at all? Figure out why, and potentially punish them for not preparing, and try to frame it in a way that puts the skill of preparation into context for them long term, and how it could help them achieve their dreams. Punishing seems like an easy solution, and it is. But more often than not, its the wrong one because it doesnt address WHY the bad grade was earned. In my life, I was always punished. Even when the punishment (like being driven to nervous break on my way to school because I got a low grade on a homework, on a day where I had a test in my first class. The screaming was a near daily occurrence junior year of high school) was the REASON for the low grade. It made me terrified of mistakes. It made me emotionally fragile. It showed me I could never trust my mom. I have seen success as a young adult not BECAUSE of those punishments, but IN SPITE of them. ",
