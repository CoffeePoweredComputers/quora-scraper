            "answer_text": "Lovely Professional University strongly believes in the fact that monetary constraints should not be an obstacle for a student to have access to quality education. So, the University extends Scholarship Scheme to students on various parameters. Scholarship can be availed in all the Programmes of the University, ranging from Diploma to Ph.D. Students have been awarded with scholarship worth Rs. 100+ crores in last year only. Scholarship Categories: Scholarships are awarded to candidates based on their performance on any of the following categories: Eligibility Qualification: (for example 10+2 for Under graduate Programmes and graduation for PG Programmes)LPUNEST: (LPU National Entrance & Scholarship Test)Certain National Level Tests (like JEE (Main), NEET, UCEED, CAT, MAT, GATE, GPAT etc.)Performance in Sports, Cultural, R&D, Co-curricular, Social Service and Bravery AwardsSpecial Scholarships and/or Fee ConcessionsFor Ph.D. Applicants (Scholarship phases as mentioned below are not applicable)Defence and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) personnel and their dependantsToppers of Education BoardScholarship for Orphan ApplicantsScholarship for Person with Certain DisabilityScholarship Brackets: For each category mentioned above, three brackets of Scholarship (Bracket 1, 2 and 3) are defined. Each bracket represents specific criteria (for example scores in qualifying exam) which an applicant has to reach for him/her to fall in that particular bracket. The criteria in each bracket decreases as it proceeds and so does the scholarships. So, the students meeting the requirement of Bracket- 1 gets the highest Scholarship and those in Bracket - 2 or 3 gets relatively lesser scholarship. Scholarship Phases: The amount of Scholarship also depends on the Phase in which the candidate takes Admission in the University. Admissions in LPU is done in different Phases, which are bifurcations of the Admission time period. Phase I starts as early as January and continues till the end of April. The subsequent phases (Phase II, III, IV) are conducted only if the seats in the concerned Programme remain vacant. The amount of Scholarship reduces with each passing phase. ",
