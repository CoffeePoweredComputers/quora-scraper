It sounds like television is what you\u2019re most interested in, so check out opportunities with stations near you.Watch and/or read all the news you can. You need your work toward your goal to be packed, busy. Of course leave time for some recreation with friends, but don\u2019t let that sidetrack you. Would you rather be drunk at spring break for a few seasons or would rather have a career you can be proud of and happy in?",

            "answer_text": "If you are interested to become a journalist, you should definitely opt for a Journalism and Mass Communication program after grade 12. These courses offer you specific subject and even more importantly skills like reporting, editing, anchoring, video shooting, using drones, mixing and editing, layout, publishing, public relations, media laws, et al. At the same time, its very important that you carefully choose a college. Prefer a college that gives you hands on experience, for it is a completely practical course, and there are plenty of colleges out there which do nothing more than theory. I have done my masters from PCTE Group of Institutes, though I am not from journalism department, but I often saw these students covering campus events with drones, gimble, and other sophisticated gadgets. Also visited this sound proof studio one day with a friend. It had this mixing and editing computers, software and equipment, with which students were working. Later in my final year I saw several videos which were shared in our WhatsApp groups, which were shot and made by Journalism dept students. I was really inspired. I am certain you can find one such college in your city, or try my college also if you want. ",
