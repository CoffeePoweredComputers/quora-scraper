Hate to break it to you, but it never ends up happening that way. There\u2019s always that roommate who barges in to get food, or guests decide to show up unannounced or nature calls. So unless you have an actual clock ticking which you can\u2019t change at will, you would most likely be sidetracked. Hence, you are generally better off attempting the papers in a timed setting where you can\u2019t hack the clock and the pressure is really on. You can download pdfs if that\u2019s your style or attempt the UPSC Question Papers 2014 - 2017 online on Exambazaar for free. PS: It\u2019s also an excellent excuse for avoid unannounced guests. :) ",
