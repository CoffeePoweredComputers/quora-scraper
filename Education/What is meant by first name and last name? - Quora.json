Generally speaking, Burmese names have no surname at all and have no serial naming structure. This means Myanmar people often have just one \u2018name\u2019 and they often change at will. Three-syllable and other more complex structures in Burmese names basically started in the 1890s. Most usually, Burmese names include some kind of \u2018honorific\u2019 such as \u201cU\u201d in names like U Thant and U Nu. A possible Indian misinterpretation Over the years, I\u2019ve noticed many instances of people from the Indian subcontinent misinterpreting \u201cfamily name\u201d to mean the name used in private family settings. It doesn\u2019t mean that. A person named Nikita Shekar might be called \u201cNik-Nik\u201d at home, but her first name is Nikita and last name Shekar. I get asked this all the time in private, so this might or might not be common situation there. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many excellent answers here so there isn't much I can add. Nevertheless, I will add my 2 cents.  \"First Name\" in Western European and North American naming construct means your given name - the name that your friends and your family identify you with against your sibling or parents. It is not your nickname. For example, names such as Robert (Rob, Bob - nicknames), Elizabeth (Eli, Elize .. - nicknames). \"Last Name\" is the surname or the family name in WE and NA. In South Asia, the surname might sometimes be the community or the caste name or a father's or husband's name. So, everyone in the family will have the same last name. (Unless, the spouse does not change the last name after marriage). Say, Robert and Elizabeth are siblings and they will have same last name, let's say, Thomson so they would be written as Robert Thompson and Elizabeth Thompson.  Now, the \"last names\" are (and were) not universal across all cultures and many cultures have only adopted them recently as a Westernisation trend. The need for last name arose like this. Say, you have two Robs in a town, people might tend to differentiate them with their occupation or other features. Let's say, one might be, Rob the accountant and Rob the salesman. Or, Rob the Short one, and Rob the Tall one. Or, Rob from Hillwoods and Rob from Riverwoods. Or, Rob, son of Thomas vs Rob son of Richard. Obviously, what applies to Rob would probably apply to all his descendants in the age when professions ran in a family or live in the same area or inherit the same characteristics. Perhaps, Thomas, Rob's father turned out to be a very rich and influential person that everyone in Rob's future generations wanted to identify with his legacy. Thus, arose the \"Family names\" or Surnames. Of course, this is just one of the few different types of last names.  The reason they are called \"last names\" is because in Western tradition, the family names are added at the end of the given name and hence the last name. This is not the same in all cultures and many East Asian cultures have them in the front of the formal full name.  To the OP: In your case, Chan will be your last name. If you move to North America or Europe, you may have to change it to Xue Wen Chan to prevent people from addressing you Chan.  ",
