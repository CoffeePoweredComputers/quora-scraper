            "answer_text": "1. I stare at it for a full 5 minutes.2. Continue staring.3. Think 'my teacher surely made a mistake grading this, let me go through it and compare answers with the guy who got a 100!' Then, one of two things happen: First scenario: 4. (Sees solutions look different, but actually equal the same amount) Goes to teacher.5. Shows errors, gets points back (I had done this in math class three times, getting about 4-5 points back each time).6. Realizes that now it's a good grade, time to chill. Second scenario: 4. Realizes mistakes made.5. Practice what I did wrong.6. Thinks of what to say to parents, knowing that they will chide me for not doing good enough.7. Stay away from people I know during that time period so that they don't ask about the grade. Change topic if necessary.8. Chill. As you can see, a bad grade means that as long as I practice the things I got wrong, I'm good. The #9 for both scenarios is to work out what grades I must get to make my grade great again (example, go from 98 to 100 in math, which I was successful in doing).I hope this answered your question!!

            "answer_text": "I beat myself up over it. I go into breakdown mode and freak out. After that, I'll go into work mode. I fix up my act and polish it up. I plan out exactly what I did wrong and what I can do to fix it. Last year, I flunked a big math test. I thought I was screwed. I had a D in the class. My parents were going to kill me and I had just ruined my chances of going to an Ivy League with an academic scholarship. I was going to die. I cried in the bathroom for 15 minutes during English class. After that, I went home and pulled out my calculator. I was going to end this year with an A in this class. I calculated the minimum grades I would need on the next assignment and test to end with at least a A- in the class. I studied extra hard every night after that and kept my grip strong after my failure. I ended with an A. I used the bad grade as an opportunity to turn my act around. I did it, even if I had to cry a little to make it happen. ",
