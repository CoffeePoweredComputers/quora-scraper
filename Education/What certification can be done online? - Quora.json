            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say a TEFL certificate! With a TEFL certificate, you can move abroad, teach English and travel the world! What could be better than that? I\u2019ve taught English in China and South Korea and obtained my TEFL certification from International TEFL & TESOL Training! The certificates are internationally recognized and accredited. They offer a wide variety of courses and also have a lot of online options! I took their 120-hour online TEFL/TESOL course with tutor support and videos. It was great because I could study at home at any time and could also ask my tutor when I had questions. When you sign up for their 120-hour course with tutor support, you\u2019ll also get a FREE 50-hour course in teaching Business English or teaching Young Learners! I ended up taking both 50-hour courses and found better teaching positions with these specializations! If you sign up through my link, you can save 20% on their courses: International TEFL & TESOL Training Courses ",
