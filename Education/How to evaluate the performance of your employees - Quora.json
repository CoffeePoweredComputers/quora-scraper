            "answer_text": "Ensuring individual performance of the team members is the responsibility of the team leader.   The best way is to take a feed back from your team leaders / project leaders.  You can ask them often to inform you if they have a performance issue from their team members.If they say there is no performance issues, it is well and fine.  But once they report performance issues ask them to find out the reason.  It will also help you to have a talk with the team member.  If the team member was a good contributor in the past try to understand the real problem.  It can be an ego issue with the team leader, or the member may not have clarity on what to do.Have the right reporting structure.   Usually it is good to have a person responsible for the performance of 5 developers.  Let the project leaders include them in all discussions with the team members.Never assign a work direct to a team member.   Always assign works through the project / team leaders.Performance is not about the number of lines written, it is about finishing the work.Quality of work is important.  The finished works should not attract attention every now and then.  You will be able to forget about a work that is properly done.Monitor project progress continuously, but bring up the issue only when it is necessary.  Feel free about sharing your concerns about a project with the project/team leaders.",

            "answer_text": "My way is to work with them, in their team. Involve with the project and see how they are performing. In their team I am just another employee. They can share their problems, bottlenecks and anything related to the project with me. I normally check their performance on these points -  - How much they knew before starting the project and how much they know now? - Are they loving the work? - Do they help their colleagues in solving problems? - How much do they share? - Are they making any improvement on their own to the project? - How much are they leading the project? - Do they spend time in learning about new technologies in their free time or do they spend time on chatting with friends? (Chatting/facebook is OK for me at work to a limit.) - Are they fun to work with? (I like being surrounded by people who love to take a joke and keep the environment happy) These are just points on how I evaluate their performance. The major portion goes to how much did they improve while in our company. ",

However once the business grows larger you will need to let go. At  that time you need a formal appraisal system. Depending on the culture you want to set you have a few options:1. Peer review in addition to review by the boss.2. Random review by the boss's boss of a few employees.3. 360 degree review. ",
