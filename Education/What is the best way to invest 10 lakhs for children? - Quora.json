            "answer_text": "10 lakh is a huge sum and it won\u2019t be advisable to invest all of it in one place. You can bifurcate the whole amount and invest it in different places. The first things I would suggest is to save money for their higher education. You can invest 35% of the given figure in fixed deposit for a minimum of 5 years. The tenure can be higher depending on the age of your kid. If your child is a toddler, you can invest for a higher period, maybe for 10 years or so. If your child is older than that, find out when will he/she be needing the money and invest accordingly. After that, there are a couple of special schemes backed by the Indian government which allows the investor to invest a significant amount of money for the welfare of their children and attain the benefits without any tax deductions. You have to find those schemes and invest at least 40% of the amount in respective schemes. The third important thing would be to secure your child\u2019s health with a good health insurance. Lastly, you can invest the rest of the amount in fitting fixed deposit schemes under your name and list your child as the beneficiary. However, you have to be very calculative while doing so and invest in a way to reduce the taxation limit to a minimum. Also Read : Fixed Deposits For Securing Your Child\u2019s Future ",
