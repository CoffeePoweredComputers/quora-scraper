            "answer_text": "I started Kindergarten in the fall of 2006 and stayed back. I recently found out that my teacher (I had her for both years) held me back because she thought I had a learning disability. Needless to say, I was embarrassed my second year because the first graders who were in my class would point fingers and talk about me and since I reside in a fairly small city, we ended up going to the same middle/high school so sometimes I would run into them. Growing up, I had friends who were always younger than me and when I explained my situation, they would say \u201cdude how do you stay back in Kindergarten\u201d or \u201cno wonder you're smart, you stayed back a grade\u201d and it did cut deep sometimes because it made me feel less than. I never tried to work on getting in the right grade, but instead I joined the Dual Enrollment Program and was able to get my AA in economics 2 months before I graduated with high honors from my high school (and was in the top 25% of my class). I'm currently earning my bachelor's at the University of South Florida and I recently declared my minor in Criminology. All in all, it bothered me sometimes when people asked about it, but I know for sure I don't have a learning disability\u2026 maybe I just needed an extra year to learn the basics. ",

            "answer_text": "In the U.S.A. children are generally allowed to enter public school when they are 5 or almost 5. In many states they are not required to enter school until they are 6,7, or 8 years old. If the parent chooses to start the child at a later age, the district may use certain criteria to determine in which grade to place the child. If the child has already completed a year in the public school, and the teacher recommends that the child repeat kindergarten, request a meeting with the kindergarten teacher and at least one first grade teacher at the school. Find out reasons, look at the pros and cons, and, if you are so inclined, make a case for your child being retained or promoted as you think best for your child. Try very hard to do what is best for your child, and not what is best for your socially. If the child is retained in kindergarten, try to get a different kindergarten teacher the second year, so it is not just a re-hashing of what the child has already done. ",
