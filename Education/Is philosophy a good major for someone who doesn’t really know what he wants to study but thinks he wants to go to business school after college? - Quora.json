            "answer_text": "Yes. If you take lots of ethics, epistemology and analytical philosophy courses you will have skills in reasoning, thinking quantitatively, parsing through complex chain of reasoning , understanding ethical dilemmas and the complexity of it. You will also learn how you \u201cknow\u201d something is true and the rigorous process you need to put things through to mentally accept that it is something you know. Your reasoning skills will be off the charts, your writing skills should be absurdly good. Take some courses in communication or sociology to understand the idea of group dynamics (one on one communication, small group communication, and public speaking). But beyond that, if you truly commit yourself to deeply understanding philosophy you will come out the other end with strong skills. ",

If you goal is an MBA and you intend to major in philosophy, I recommend you minor in economics and use your free electives to take computer science, mathematics and statistics courses. However, there is no Plan B with this recommendation. Because philosophy has a very limited job market and most MBA programs want to see work experience, I believe a better combinations would be to major in economics, minor in computer science, and use your free electives to take philosophy courses.
