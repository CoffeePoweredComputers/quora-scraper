Seriously though, it\u2019s never too late to work on a college degree, especially if you are in the US. That being said, sometimes, being older brings more responsibilities and less freedom to work on degrees, so in that sense, the younger the better, but 20 is still really young. Unless there is some detail about your personal life that isn\u2019t part of the question, I would say go for it and don\u2019t look back! ",

            "answer_text": "No, because education can be acquired at any stage of your life. One real problem is the money you may have lost by not graduating earlier with a BA degree and receiving an appropriate salary for future tax and retirement purposes. Furthermore, when you attend college you will notice people of different ages around you \u2014 especially if you go to a community college or big university. So the experience will not be too jarring. My real question to you is what will you do when you reach college? Will you reach out to your fellow collegiate colleagues, will your preserve your pride and not hate yourself and fellow kin amongst this new environment, and will you pay-it-forward once you are finished?
