            "answer_text": "I got mine many years ago, so it may have changed. In fact, I\u2019m sure there have been changes. I remember it being a long day of testing. Probably 5 or 6 hours. The reason for it being so long is that it covers an extremely wide set of knowledge and skills. To be fair, a test needs several questions for each learning target. Otherwise, one mistake could hide a lot of knowledge. For example, if I were testing someone for their entire math skill set, and only had one long division problem on the test. A student who is great at long division might miss that question. Maybe that student only makes a mistake once out of 200 long division problems, but that one was on my test. Since there is only one question on long division, that test shows a big fat ZERO for that student\u2019s long division skills. Not fair to the student, and not useful to anybody relying on the test to make decisions about that student. Maybe you are wondering about the preparation time. Again, there is a huge span of knowledge being tested. A GED is the equivalent of graduating from high school. That theoretically means 12 years of prep. It is, by design, easier to go through school and graduate than to succeed at the GED. Of course, if you are taking the test, you probably have most or all of the knowledge and skills already. In my case, I had to take the test because non-academic factors prevented me from graduating. I did not study for the GED, other than making sure I was rested and had a good breakfast so I was ready to give it my best shot. The theory at the time was that there is so much material that there is no way to study for it. Now people do study for it. It makes sense to study at least a few areas where you need improvement. One thing to remember with testing is that the goal is not to trick you or make a fool of you, it is to accurately find out what your knowledge and skills are, usually with the goal of helping you fill in the gaps, or finding where your strengths are so you can expand on them. Test designers (if they are any good at it) are there to help you prove that you have knowledge and skills. ",

            "answer_text": "Here's the short answer: It takes you however long it takes you, and then once you're done, you're done! Really. IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES YOU! The important thing is to just find a way to pass! Most students don't like this answer, because they want to know a specific time frame. It's hard to give a specific time frame simply because everyone is different; if you've been away from formal education for a while, it's probably going to take you longer than someone who's only been a way for a year or two. I've known some students who took about a year to pass every section. That being said, I think 3 months is a very reasonable time frame to aim for for most people. While 3 months may seem like a long time right now, it's really not so bad if you think about it this way: Time is going to pass one way or another, so you might as well spend yours doing something worthwhile! What's one thing you can do today or tomorrow to get you closer to your goal of passing the GED test? One really easy way to sneak some GED prep into your daily routine is to get in the habit of reading everyday! Whether it's books, newspapers, magazines, or blogs, one of the fastest ways to improve your score on all sections (yes, including math...) is to simply read more! The more you read, the better your reading comprehension skills will get! The majority of the GED test is reading comprehension, so you can start counting your reading time as your study time! Grab something interesting to read, and try to have some fun with it! Oh, and if you're really efficient, you can definitely finish the test in under three months! You just have to work really hard! Good luck with your studying! Go bring home the gold! ",

It will cost you. I paid $50 bucks. In most states you half to be 16 to drop out and take it. In most states if you are underage you will be require to take a TABE test and courses. A TABE is a test to see what levels you at in those subjects. They give this to the underage because they want to help and don't want you to waste time and money. If you are above age or your state doesn't offer this you can ask for it. Its free 98% of the time. You take your GED test any local High School that offers night class's or at a local community college.  ",
