            "answer_text": "Hi I had nearly the same situation. Short answer: Yes you can. Chances are the same as if you applied as a fresh applicant. However,Chances of having ALL your credits transferred and saving on a year are incredibly low (a year doesn\u2019t really matter anyway- lifes\u2019 not linear). You will probably need to repeat many courses that you already took at your previous university. There are two cycles in which you can apply for a transfer. There are several clauses that apply to the credits that you want to transfer so just be mindful of it. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "LUMS do have the policy of accepting credits transfers from other universities but I think just the universities like IBA, LSE, BNU, etc. And also you can only transfer those courses which are taught at LUMS and are not amongst the core courses. The outline needs to be approved by the relevant instructor for transfer. ",
