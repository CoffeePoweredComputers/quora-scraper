            "answer_text": "eventually of course you will; dont freak; plenty of brilliant people sometimes flunk out and pass later and its okay; this is not a tragedy; dont let anyone make you feel it is; its only the 8th grade; and some people flunk out sometimes; you should try to figure out two things; is there anything upsetting you or anything bad occurring that is bringing this about? anything you need to do to be emotionally okay or safe? ( and there may not be ) and maybe to get tested; even very very very bright people sometimes have a little neurological disability like add or adhd or dyslexia; which is different than intelligence; its like one wire in a tv set out of thousands being broken? and you may want to see if you have this going on; because there are protocols; exercises; special ways to study that can pretty easily fix this? so those two things you need to look into; talk to mom and dad about this? the other thing is for the next semester? start studying first week study a little every day; also you can probably go to summer school so you dont lose the year or half year; ask about that now if you think you are going to flunk out? also if there is something a little different with you either neurologically or emotionally you may want to consider an alternative school or alternative classes in your schools where the classes are smaller ; 5 - 10 kids; 2 teachers?; good luck; this is a difficulty; this is not a tragedy; you can still have a brilliant happy life; it will be okay i promise; but look into the stuff i suggested above with mom and dad or other reliable adult?

            "answer_text": "You have to check your middle school\u2019s academic handbook. If you get F\u2019s in the major core subjects, it\u2019s less likely you\u2019ll even pass the 8th grade. First off, why are you failing? Are you not putting enough effort? Or are you struggling to understand the material? Identify the problem before it gets out of hand. If you\u2019re getting F\u2019s in middle school, it\u2019s a big wake up call to work hard, and do whatever it takes to pass. The classes will be harder in high school. If you don\u2019t pass your classes, you might not graduate on time. Or even worse. Unlike 8th grade, this is a very high stakes environment. ",
