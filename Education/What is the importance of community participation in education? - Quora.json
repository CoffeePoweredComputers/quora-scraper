            "answer_text": "A community that is involved in the school system does much to make sure that their children are getting a better education than might otherwise be the case. Whether is it by fund raising so that the school has more books, computers, teachers have more supplies, it can be many things. If a community realizes that the school needs special classes for whatever reason, they can advocate that what they want happens. Without the community a school is a building that holds students who are getting and education or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Community participation allows one to understand how their actions outside of the classroom can macroscopically affect a greater populace. Community participation gives students great experience in terms of helping others, builds strong character and mental habits, as well as developing relationships between students, teachers, community members, and other organizations. Ultimately, students can see how their work truly applies to the real world and how they can help and impact people. -Andrew :) ",
