            "answer_text": "I wouldn't say there is a worst student; each student has his/her own challenges that prevent them from reaching their full potential.  I would say however say i have had a most frustrating student. In college, I taught a youth band every summer (Kids were aged 11-14). I taught kids how to march and play instruments in parades. I taught the drums. In this camp I got the 7th and 8th graders. And because i taught the section as a whole (the entire drum line), any student that had difficulty learning their part stressed me out because it meant that i would have to take time out of my teaching the group to teaching the kid alone. well the most frustrating student i had was one of those slow learners. And this kid displayed signs of having a mild case of Autism. Well the only reason why it was frustrating is because he challenged me in every way possible. He tested my patience. He tested my communication skills (trying to teach rhythm and temp and all that can be really difficult when your student doesn't have great hand-eye coordination or enough focus to count tempo); I had to think of new ways of explaining concepts. I had to think of new ways to help him practice - new exercises and new focus activities. He tested my creativity (as mentioned about the exercises). He tested my ability to draw relations between the music and something that occurs with him everyday (in reference to help explain music).  I am glad I didn't give up because at the end of the camp, he could play quarter notes for an entire song on tempo - yes it was that bad.... he could barely play a stead tempo of quarter notes when coming into the camp. And when he came into the camp his attention span was all of 10-20 seconds. at the end of the camp, he was able to focus for 2-3 minutes. It is truly humbling to see someone struggle and then little by little see drastic improvements like that.  ",

            "answer_text": "My focus has been elsewhere. Not focused on who is good or who is bad. Not enough time. My time is better spent on focusing on who is falling behind, who has it all done and needs an extension to the lesson. As stated elsewhere that is not to say there have not been challenges to my assisting, supporting, or mentoring a student. They usually have one or more of the following traits: They didn't pick the class and they aren't interested in what I am teaching. So they have written off me, the class, and any form of any part of what is being taught. They won't do the work in class or as homework.They have decided they are not going to participate during class discussions or anything else the class may be doing. So they eventually get bored and become disruptive.A group of them have decided to take the class because it is the only one open for all of them to take during the same hour. They are interested only in huddling together and socializing.The most difficult ones are those who have very supportive parents who really believe it is the teachers problem that their kid is in 1,2, or 3. Their response for any assistance with their kid is along the lines of the teacher needs to do better.For example, I had a student who refused to read anything. Obviously if you don't read you can't follow written instructions. If the class was to read something for class and discuss it during class. And you refuse to read what are we supposed to do? It got bad enough the parents were called to meet with us. At the meeting they told us that we should not be making their kid read. He doesn't like to, it is hard for him. So he shouldn't have to do anything which involves or stems from reading. The teachers ( all of us in this case) were supposed to find a way to teach him which did not involve reading or writing. ",
