            "answer_text": "This is basically what makes you a successful teacher. If students do not understand what you teach, there is no point of being a teacher, although it is something blunt to say. To make sure students understand what we teach, we might as well inquire into students\u2019 learning preferences first. For instance, some students may learn faster when they receive information visually, and some would learn more effectively by listening to the instructor (auditory learners). So, as a first step, when we meet a group of students for the first time, it is worth asking how they like to learn, and the rest is in your hands. Mostly, since a classroom possibly consists of learners with multiple learning preferences, it is smart to combine all of the approaches in delivering the lesson. For example, making the students watch videos and analyse them (visual) and delivering power-point presentations (both visual and auditory) would be better. On the other hand, for the students to understand your content, first the teacher needs to be well aware and and cognizant of the content that she/he is going to deliver. For example, if we are going to teach \u201c English transition markers\u201d to students, we have to be knowledgeable about it. This may be a challenge for some novice teachers. Another way to make sure students understand what you teach would be to ask reflective questions while and after teaching. Then we can understand whether students are able to grasp what we teach. Teacher should also give students opportunities to ask questions and discuss any specific area of the lesson with the classmates. Classroom discussions that facilitate different viewpoints from students could enhance students\u2019 understanding about a topic. There are a lot more :). ",

            "answer_text": "This is not a trivial question. Students are great actors and so it is very difficult to work out if they understand anything that you are teaching them. Generally you find out that they do not understand what you have taught them by trying out some lateral thinking on them. What you do if you find your PhD student understands nothing, including their PhD project I honestly do not know. ",
