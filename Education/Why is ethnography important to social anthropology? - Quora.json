            "answer_text": "Ethnography is either the science or the art (there\u2019s quite a bit of debate on that detail) or accurately observing and describing someone else\u2019s culture (beliefs, actions, traditions, ideas, clothing, technology, etc.) Because social anthropologists study culture and social interactions ethnography is the primary skill set developed by an anthropologist. Ethnography is important because human beings are notoriously bad at describing and recording other groups of people accurately. Our own prejudices and beliefs color how we describe others, often without us being aware of what we are doing. The fields of history and political science improved dramatically with the development of ethnography because the conversations involved in developing ethnography also helped develop a sense of reliability for descriptions of other cultures. Rather than simply take historical sources at face value we now have a very good set of questions to ask to test how well a source is describing or misdescribing the people they observe and discuss. A field which has benefitted from this is Witchcraft studies. Because we are aware that Early modern theologians and legal experts were highly biased to distort their descriptions of alleged witches we know that their accounts cannot be taken at face value. This has led to a situation where historians have had to work creatively and think critically to tease out what is and what is not reliable in any account of alleged witches. With the crosspinization of witchcraft history and ethnography frantically clarified the cultural and social phenomenon that contributed to the era of European witch hunts. A similar example of how ethnography is employed in other fields would be the American military\u2019s use of human geography. Rather than blasting their way into unknown communities assuming that they share the same values and motivations as the soldiers, human geography had helped the military prevent engagement and deescalate conflict by making soldiers aware of the values, beliefs, triggers and hot-button-issues, as well as social factors like familial alliances, that they will likely encounter in a given region. By developing an ethnographic awareness of the groups and people they are interacting with the military has been able to reduce potential conflict and deescalate tensions and conflicts which had already begun. https://www.westpoint.edu/academics/academic-departmen Human Terrain System - Wikipedia The Human Terrain system developed and utilized in Afghanistan is an example of this. The program has been highly praised in military circles for dramatically reducing engagements and civilian casualties. However, it is also highly criticized by the American Anthropological Association. Anthropologists associated with the AAA have been prohibited from aiding military and intelligence services since Vietnam due to the military\u2019s unethical use of ethnographic data to heighten the efficacy of psychological torture during the Vietnam War. The AAA has a high standard of \u201cdo no harm\u201d in regards to the people the anthropologist studies and from the perspective of the AAA it is not possible to live up to that standard at the same time that one is actively aiding and abetting any military or intelligence agency, regardless of national affiliation. That said, the positive impact that ethnography has had on reducing conflict in war zones demonstrated the importance of ethnography beyond anthropology. Inside of the field ethnography is the central skill of any socio-cultural anthropologist. ",

            "answer_text": "Because social anthropology is about lived life and human experiences. People\u2019s actual life, interpersonal interactions, behavioural patterns, and relationships are what inform our social theories and our understanding of what it means to be human (both in general and in specific places at specific times). We build out theories from the ground up, so to speak, meaning that we need to document detailed descriptions of how people live their lives in both ritual, ceremonial, and everyday situation. This is why ethnography is so important for social anthropologists. What is ethnography? In short, it is detailed descriptions of lived life: cultural patterns, social relationships, material culture, rituals, daily activities, gender dynamics, child rearing, the whole shebang. In that sense, ethnography is the bread and butter of social (and cultural) anthropological analyses and theories. That is also why most sociocultural anthropologists do fieldwork. The anthropological fieldwork is what gives us first-hand experiences with a given society/culture/population/group (or whatever one\u2019s supposed to call it these days), and where we collect our own ethnography. That said, fieldwork is not a necessary prerequisite to work as an anthropologist. There are several great figures in anthropology who have made their careers engaging mostly with theory, such as Marcell Mauss, Claude Levi-Strauss, Marshall Sahlins, Tim Ingold, and David Graeber. While most of these did their own fieldwork early in their career, they work mostly with the ethnography of others. Hence another key aspect of ethnography for social anthropologist: When it\u2019s detailed and illuminating enough, it can be of great importance for other anthropologists as well. Moreover, detailed ethnography allow readers of anthropological texts to engage critically with the author\u2019s arguments, which also means suggesting an alternative analysis for the presented material. So, yeah, ethnography is important for social anthropologist, and I hope I managed to explain why. ",
