            "answer_text": "I will assume you did the ask correctly by making clear what you needed and when you needed it by. They are doing you a big favor so you get to go back once to ask again.  The best way is something like this... I appreacite that you are taking the time from your busy schedule to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf. There are some dealines that are coming fast. I on't want to bother you, but would it be possible for you to complete the letter by (put in the date)?  If the persona does not do the letter after the second ask you should move on. In fact you should ask more people. If you require 3 letters of recommendation ask 5 people to write them. This way you are covered.  Some people cannot say no to someone's face so they say yes and don't do what they promised. Some have good intentions about doing you this favor, but are too busy to get it done.  Best of Luck. ",

If you want to give a friendly reminder, then talk to them privately (not in front of other students) by asking if you can provide anything that would make it easier for them to write the rec letter, such as a summary of your projects, work in their class, or personal attributes. If they say no, then thank them and remind them of the deadline date. ",

Partly because I\u2019m ADD and need help focusing but also because I could ask them questions to personalize the letter and show more depth in the recommendation. When I asked bosses for letters I always gave them a list of my achievements to have something to refer to and either inform/ or jog their memory. ",
