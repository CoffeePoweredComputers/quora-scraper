            "answer_text": "Your motivation to learn languages is awesome, and I was in a similar boat when I was in high school some years ago! I have a history of being on the patient-end of speech therapy, so I prefer to learn from an instructor in a classroom or office environment. My suggestion would be to do some quick Web searches of local community colleges to see if they offer classes. Another place I\u2019ve found classes offered are businesses operated by folks of Arab origin or descent; I live close to a vegan restaurant owned by a Syrian man who teaches classes with the Alif Baa and al-Kitaab textbook series. I suppose that\u2019s a logical segue onto the topic of books. In Penn State\u2019s Arabic program, they use the Alif Baa for the introductory course and move on the first and second parts of al-Kitaab. Problem is that these books are not particularly cheap - even if they\u2019re used. If you\u2019re willing to deal with some dull, institutional writing characteristic of US Government publications, the Defense Language Institute, Foreign Service Institute, and Peace Corps have produced language guides which can be accessed for free, as they are in the public domain. I found these on LiveLingua[1], but they can likely be found elsewhere. This medium naturally don\u2019t cover speaking, which is where videos and audio comes in. YouTube ends up being an awesome asset here; there are playlists and occasionally full Arabic movies. There\u2019s \u201cShort Arabic dialogue for beginners[2]\u201d as well as the \u201cCERCLL Native Speakers Series[3],\u201d both of which feature offer some insight into Arab culture. You can also find movies on YouTube with ease, though they\u2019re probably \u201cvintage\u201d at this point, as in \u201ca ton of movies from the seventies.\u201d More recent films of note include Wadjda, about a young schoolgirl in Saudi Arabia, and Theeb, which is centered around a young Bedouin boy in modern-day Jordan during the First World War. I hope these resources can hold you over until you can interact with some native speakers. Arabic is, like you said, a truly beautiful language, and - perhaps more importantly - allow you to communicate with many other people and better understand what\u2019s occurring in the world.
