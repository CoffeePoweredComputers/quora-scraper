            "answer_text": "To be so engrossed an idea or concept that all of the decisions they make surround it. Not unlike a cult where people join thinking it's one thing but then if and when things change for the worse, they are already \u201cpot committed\u201d (a poker term) meaning they've already gone this far and have put so much of their life into this ideology that it has become a part of their core identity. Is basically like how everyone scrambles to make this money we've been programmed to desire to the point where it's almost the only thing most people think about. Causing them to worry and fight with those they hold dear. The amount of money a person makes then suddenly becomes his identity as if perhaps the more money one has acquired could ever actually equal being better than any other human being. But society seems not to have a problem with our world this way because otherwise we would fix it. Now this person who owns all this stuff,and gets to tell other people what to do day in and day out-who listen intently and then carry out his/(or her) instructions to the letter becomes overwhelmed with a sense of power over others which then allows he or she to now think that they are better than others who also now acts that way as well separating themselves from those who do not have, speaking condescendingly to employees, spouses, children, those employed to take care of their children. Because honestly if you're worth hundreds off millions or billions of dollars what billionaire is changing diapers, these people believe they are better than that this ends up in divorce and mistresses and the power/ money possesses them. Ruining families, and not even just their own if cutting costs means firing people over fifty right before they can get their full pension to save a few more dollars then they'll do it. They end up losing old friends, good friends because these people with tend to think others use them just for their money and get paranoid about who they surround themselves with. So eventually they make friends of the same approximate socio-economic standing. Others with similar lifestyles that they and their fellow like-minded comrades ones they can stand to be around without hating one another to each other's face because the things a person needs to do to get ahead in this world requires alot more stepping on and over decent folk which stains the soul and tarnishes a person's sense of how people actually are. (Similar to the cheating spouse who always thinks their spouse is cheating only because they are themselves.) (Projecting) They then hoard their money which could help tons of needy people throughout the world but then they would need to lose their ideology, but they cannot because they also have developed a feeling that their ideas are better and they're smarter then others too which comes with the money and the power\u2026 ideologically possessed by Greed and money\u2026.

            "answer_text": "On Ideological Possession That an ideology can \u201cpossess\u201d a person strikes me as a fruitful way of revealing fundamental errors in the way people think about their world. The word ideology literally means the logic or study of an idea, a formulated thought. If I say I have an idea of a chair I can oppose to that idea the fact of the specific chair in which I am sitting. The idea of a chair is a concept that references a class of characteristic objects. This distinction between the idea of a chair and a chair whose physical existence can be verified in prescribed ways instantiates the broad philosophical contrast between relations of ideas and matters of fact. When the geometer, for example, measures the earth, what he actually measures, for a host of practical reasons, is a planetary model. The model itself arises as a consequence of collecting appropriate and relevant data. Beginning with a rough idea of the planet, data modifies the developing model as the model guides further productive inquiry. In principle, there is no theoretical end to this dynamic reciprocity; inquiry ceases when understanding \u201cis good enough\u201d to accomplish the original purpose. Without the restraints imposed by scientific method, political philosophy roughly mimics the distinction between relations of ideas and matters of fact. Without such method, of course, ideas cannot be verified as objectively true. That lack, however, does not lessen the significance of political philosophy; nor does the lack suggest that facts cannot be urged in support of one perspective over another. What is sought in politics is a convincing narrative. Arguments are advanced to support specific claims, but the narrative itself must reflect an embodied knowledge of the culture if it is to persuade. Ideologies clearly reflect relations of ideas, and while facts are cited, in politics they notoriously admit of any number of competing and even conflicting interpretations. That Marx\u2019s labor theory of value is demonstrably false hardly diminishes the enthusiasm of his supporters and followers. When errors multiply without affecting the credibility of an ideology, we know we are in the presence of ideological possession: the ideas themselves, in some fundamental sense, are conceived to be true independent of observable experience. Indeed, the traditional relation between the relations of ideas and matters of fact are inverted: what can be admitted as \u201cfacts\u201d are exclusively those phenomena posited by the ideology. Ideas are held to constitute the real; there is no room for empiricism, for the correcting of error. It is, admittedly, not the job of politicians, or even public intellectuals, to admit error in fundamental propositions when legislative action is demanded. That is the function of a society\u2019s highly educated academic elite, its philosophers. Unfortunately, the academic elite can be corrupted by the lure of power, money, and privilege provided, intentionally or not, by government. The only way to avert such corruption is by funding the academy from private, competing resources. A college or university funded by a large corporation, to take a  \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario, may reflect that organization\u2019s parochial interests; multiple academies funded by different private groups, however, is more likely to provide a basis of self-correcting inquiry within academic life: no one group will command monopoly power over the what counts as knowledge, a situation that characterizes the universities and schools today in the United States.
