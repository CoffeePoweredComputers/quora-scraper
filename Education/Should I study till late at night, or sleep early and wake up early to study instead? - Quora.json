            "answer_text": "You should do both - with a focus on getting up earlier.  To cut a long story short, our willpower (and ability to focus) is a finite resource - which degrades throughout the day. When you\u2019re tired late at night, the quality of your study drops. However, we do also form memories in our sleep. [1] A perfect way to utilise study time at night is for light revision of topics that you\u2019re already familiar with - something that will be easy and comfortable for you to do, but which would also benefit you to remember better. Spaced repetition [2] style flash cards are the simplest and most efficient way to get some light but super effective studying at night  Mornings are where we\u2019re freshest and most ready to take in new information (specifically, 2\u20134 hours after you wake up) - so use them to tackle your hardest (or scariest) subject. This is when your mind will be clearest and your ability to focus at peak levels. Taking down the task you were dreading most will also give you a huge confidence boost to ride on the rest of the day, and make working on the rest of your topics seem much easier!  Just to wrap things up - I\u2019ll also mention afternoons. As the sort of balancing point between the freshness of the morning and required relaxation of the evening - an afternoon is typically best spent revising material more thoroughly than you would at night. Ideally, this would be in the form of past exam papers. Revising something that does require effort - but that you\u2019re already familiar with - is a far easier task to get to work on during the afternoon: when you\u2019ve still got enough thinking power, but not quite enough to start taking on those scary exam topics that you wish would just somehow go away.

            "answer_text": "That really depends on you. I\u2019m a morning person, and if I go to bed late I\u2019m tired all the next day. But if I get up early, I feel refreshed and alert. But you might be more of a night owl who happily stays up past midnight but gets grumpy when he has to wake up early. The only adivse I CAN give is to study in 15-minute intervals, then have a 5-minute break during which you get up and walk around to get your blood moving again. And of course, to begin studying way earlier next time so you can afford to go to bed on time AND wake up at a normal hour! ",
