            "answer_text": "Hi, I am Sibon. I am working as a teacher since last 1 year with Vedantu.Let me clear, I am not working at Vedantu, because I never go to office \uf04a rather, I work with Vedantu to share my knowledge with kids around the world. I do my job from anywhere I want; I do my job whenever I want; I decide how much is too much or how much is too less for me; I can teach the way I like; I don't have any one who is so call supervising me and ya, there is no one who instructs me n how things need to be done... This what my workplace is like, this is what Vedantu is all about... Vedantu gave me all the freedom I wanted.  This is why I love to teach at Vedantu, it gives me full freedom to teach, full control to communicate freely with my students and full support, wherever and whenever needed. I must mention Vedantu\u2019s backend support, Vedantu gives us prompt and complete technical, academic, management support, which is really awesome and worth a mention... Even the founders are very approachable to share your thoughts and feedback and are on their toes to help you.  I think it is very enlightening to interact with them directly. Also, they never make you feel that you are talking with the founder... REALLY awesome! ",

The team is extremely helpful and great mindsets to work with. Be it the first day of work or the later days the energy remains the same and can\u2019t get any better than experiencing it myself. It feels like working with someone whom we\u2019ve known for years now! Thank you Vedantu for letting me experience this every day! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m Ujwal, Working in Vedantu as a Visual Designer since Nov 2018. The sole reason I choose to work here is that Vedantu provides education and I love to work for the education sector using my skills in media. Vedantu is actually making a lot of difference in India by providing quality educational content to students who are in need of teachers and mentors to crack important exams but have no access to them in their areas or the coaching institutes are too pricy. Work in Vedantu as I\u2019ve experienced, on any given day you walk into our office you\u2019ll experience that vibe of work, focus, targets and deadlines. Some occasions when I\u2019m about to feel like we are overworking, things start changing, we start playing snooker, we organise badminton games using playo, We\u2019ll have some celebrations through various achievements that we achieve as a family. I love what Vedantu is doing for the betterment of students and I\u2019m glad to be a part. In my opinion, it doesn\u2019t matter which company you work for as long as your attitude is to make a difference [even if the smallest] and have fun every day you\u2019ll surely have a great work experience anywhere!
