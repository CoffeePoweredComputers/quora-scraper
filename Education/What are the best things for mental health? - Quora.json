            "answer_text": "I'm not a mental health professional but having Schizophrenia myself has given me an opportunity to meet Dr.\u2019s and other patients who suffered a huge variety of mental illnesses. My particular Schizophrenic diagnosis is considered a life long illness. There is no cure YET. Unfortunately mental illnesses really have no CURE per se. What you can get is RECOVERY. A cure implies that the illness is gone forever. Mental illness even once recovered can be triggered and started again. I've met people who have recovered from Clinical depression and no longer need treatment. They have gone years without a reoccurring episode. However the risk of another episode his high. I've met people that were currently experiencing a depressive episode they had not experienced in years. That's just how it works sometimes. I've met people who claim they have been cured of Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder no longer requiring treatment. I myself lasted just over 7 months without treatment before my symptoms escalated beyond my control. 7 months was a good run. My illness came on so quick after that. I didn't even have time to notice I was psychotic again. I woke up in the Psych Ward at our state mental health hospital in lockdown. Strapped to a bed. I still don't remember exactly what happened. I read the police report that stated I was pulled over for exceeding the speed limit. When officers approached my car I had all the windows up and the doors locked. I refused to open the doors. While 1 officer was left to monitor me the other officers went back to their cars to do who knows what. Apparantly I had just filled my Xanax prescription and I proceeded to swallow them all by handfuls. The Officer left to monitor me witnessed this and radioed his partner about the new developement. EMT's were called. I'm not sure how they got me out of my car. According to their report I was transported to the nearest ER. I had to get hospital charts to find out what happened after that. I had my stomach pumped and because of my history of Schizophrenia that landed me in their psych ward before, I was transported to our state Mental Hospital. Nothern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services. I was given a Haldol cocktail injection to calm me down and to assist in bringing me back from my Psychosis.The entire point of my long drawn out story is this. Mental illness cannot be cured but you can recover from it. Know that at anytime it can comeback with a vengeance. It's like it never left you. It starts right where it left off. If you are one of the fortunate that gets a permanent or long term recovery, get down on your knees, clasp your hand together in front of you, and give thanks to the powers that may be because you are very fortunate. Most don't achieve that result. ",

            "answer_text": "Don't try to stay strong all the time, it's not necessary! Give yourself a break. Mental health is more important than faking 'I am strong' all the time.Embrace your anxieties and fears, don't run away from them. Once you accept them, it's easy to get rid of them.If you have a toxic parent, friend or sibling, whom you can't leave out of your love or responsibility, accept them the way they are. Don't hate them. Because hate is way too dangerous. It makes your turn in to the same toxic person you are hating now. On the other hand, when you accept them, it's easy to find ways to deal with them.We always become happy to find the advice \u2018 cut toxic people from your life\u2019. But how many times have you realized you also might be toxic to someone? So, please be mature enough to understand that it\u2019s you who are toxic at times. It\u2019s not always the other person. You will realize half of your problems are now solved.Don\u2019t feel lonely even if you don\u2019t have anyone to share your problems with. Scientists say a person who has been experiencing prolonged periods of loneliness is likely to face a reduced life span, not different from that of someone who smokes 15 cigarettes a day. Enjoying your own company is always not easy as well. If you go deeper into this, you would find you don\u2019t need to feel lonely at all. Talk to Universe/God. You might not believe now but God/Universe listens and responds. You need to carry that faith along with you. Your faith will not let you feel lonely.Connect with your divine energy self. Discover your spiritual side.Don't confuse your sadness with depression. Every time when you are sad, it's not always about chemical imbalances in your mind. Just bcoz you have been sad for a long time, doesn't mean you are clinically depressed. It may be situational sadness. Please make yourself aware, depression is not always clinical.I agree depression is a real illness. Rather I would call it a real illusion. It hurts and hurts. And acknowledging it a real illness is good because then you can find the treatment. But if you are always busy talking about it (I am depressed), it makes you feel more ill and weak. It\u2019s both underrated and overrated at the same time (it\u2019s my personal opinion).Try to find some anxiety buster activities for yourself. They help you a lot to curb daily stress. The stress which if not taken care of on a regular basis ends up developing angry behaviors in you.Try to practice healthy activities that hath already know: yoga, meditation, exercise.Thanks for reading! Stay healthy, stay happy :) ",
