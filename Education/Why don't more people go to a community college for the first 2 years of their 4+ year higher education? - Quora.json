            "answer_text": "The simple reason is many educators and parents are really doing a disservice by still holding onto the beliefs that community college is only for poorly performing students or losers that can\u2019t get accepted into a traditional 4-year school. Although there are higher education institutions that claim to be non-profit, this is anything but the case and it is in the best interest of many educators to endorse 4-year schools. It keeps the propaganda alive that higher education is the only path to any type of future and financial success. Social circles and bragging rights also support the falsehood that attending a 4-year college from the start provides a better education. You only need to look as far as the recent news with wealthy families being found guilty of bribes to get their children into certain universities. These families already have the money and inside benefits most will never be able to get. They already have a head start on providing an advantage for their children. The only reason to get their children into a certain college is for bragging rights and telling their friends where their child goes to school. There are also some parents and students that believe a traditional 4-year college education is their right. They believe in some way the college experience at a 4-year school should be something every young adult experiences no matter what the cost might be. This is a big reason the student loan debt in America is now reaching 1.6 trillion dollars. The truth is more people should attend a community college for the first two years of school particularly if it means the difference in a lower student loan balance at the completion of college. Strangely a lot of people still also believe that a community college does not offer the same quality of education that a 4-year college does. There are good schools and terrible ones. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is a community college or a 4-year university. Community college professors might often be newer to the profession. However, they might be more up to date on teaching compared to a 20-year tenured professor. Community college class sizes also tend to be much smaller compared to many of the 4-year schools. It is hard to argue that larger class sizes offer a better education. There is a reason in grade school most parents don\u2019t want their kids in a class with a lot of students. The same holds true at the college level. A college education today is much more about networking and just getting a diploma as a prerequisite for a professional job. Many times even Ivy League schools are not offering a much better education compared to state schools or even some community colleges. The networking is where the true value could potentially lie. The problem today is a college education can be a much larger gamble than it ever has been. Just a few decades ago student loans and getting any four-year degree had good odds for success. The odds are not as good today. A few decades ago the goal was to just get a college degree and this was even when it included student loan debt. The goal today should still be to get an education but to do with the least amount of debt. For a lot of people, this goal should include going to a community college for the first two years. As a note to readers, I write about money and life. Spending several years in the financial world I have learned there is no blanket answer when it comes to finance. If the subject is about money and life or questioning the so-called experts, I write about it. There is also a podcast that can be heard at Podbean,Apple Podcasts and YouTube.

            "answer_text": "I considered it in high school. Both my parents went to community college. My dad ended up transferring to UC Berkeley and my mom to Cal State East Bay (previously Hayward). My dad lost his job when I began high school (during the recession). So we weren\u2019t doing well financially. I wanted to keep my debt low. I wasn\u2019t athletic enough to attend of the military colleges or join an ROTC program, but I did go to their booths in high school. I was also hesitant because of mandatory service afterwards (I thought I might want to go to grad school). I had pretty good grades, extracurriculars and test scores. I applied because most of my friends did and I told myself that I would decide in the Spring what I would do depending on what colleges I got into, etc. I paid for half of my college application fees with my summer earnings and my parents paid for the other half. I\u2019m a California student. I ended up getting into all my state flagship universities (UC Berkeley, UCSD, etc.), USC and Cornell. I really loved Cornell. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to major in, so I loved the \u201cAny person, any study\u201d motto. I knew whatever I majored in, I would find the resources to study it there. I loved the trees, the sprawling campus, the wilderness and fell in love with it from a far. It was my chance to travel across the country, meet new people, live in a dorm, interact with people around the world. When else could I have this experience? I think if I had gotten in to only California schools, I would\u2019ve considered going to a community college. But I wanted to travel \u2014 to this day, I\u2019ve never been outside of the U.S. This was my way to get out of my town, explore and learn so much. That was the main reason why I decided to go to a 4-year college. So we got the financial aid packet and they gave me a $30,000/year grant, but it still wasn\u2019t enough. My mom really wanted me to go. She agreed to take out loans for me to attend and I ended up winning a lot of money in scholarships that year. She proudly wears her \u201cCornell Mom\u201d hat around and has a \u201cCornell Mom\u201d mug at her office. I remember we couldn\u2019t afford for me to come visit before I accepted. So my first day ever visiting Cornell was on move-in day. I moved in by myself because my parents couldn\u2019t afford a plane ticket for either of them to go. There\u2019s something to be said about the college experience \u2014 this evolution from freshman year through senior year. I\u2019m glad I went to a four year college. I feel like if I went to community college, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten this chance to meet, live and interact with so many people with so many diverse experiences. My first year, I tried-out and joined an Indian dance team, was a staff photographer on the same newspaper that Kurt Vonnegut was editor-in-chief and went on my first backpacking trip (and became a wilderness backpacking guide the same year). If I went to a CC, I imagine I would\u2019ve taken a part-time job, lived at home and took college classes. Then transfer to a university for two years then find a job. It\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s a certain magic to the freshman experience and going away to college you don\u2019t get by going to a community college. I would choose the same thing if I had to do it over again. ",
