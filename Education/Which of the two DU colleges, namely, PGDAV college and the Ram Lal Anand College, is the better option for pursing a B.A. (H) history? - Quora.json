Not just talking about the favouritism but the faculty there is very supportive, energetic and there you won't only study but explore your life. You will start na new chapter of your life. One of my friend was in B.A history hons. And he was very happy with the course structure and with the faculty as they play an important role. The infrastructure is very good. Important news- Attendence is not an major issue. You will lI've your college life in main campus . Satya niketan the beauty of South campus. So rla is much better option. Go for it. Thanks. ",
