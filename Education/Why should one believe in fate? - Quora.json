            "answer_text": "The abrogation of personal and social responsibility has consumed, both philosophically and theologically, outstanding proportions of attention. Whether we\u2019re speaking of a pure savior martyring himself for the mistakes of others or the hands of the gods invisibly directing the course of human events, the resulting feeling that one is no longer entirely responsible, is the same. Belief is not an avenue to knowledge, so believing in anything does not guarantee any accuracy and of course it has no bearing on what is actually real. Belief, though, like fate offers its own psychological psychological comfort, in this case of avoiding the sense of doubt or ignorance. Too often, the human mind in its quest for absolute certainty takes short cuts through the back alleys of beliefs, only to find neither certainty nor any strong urge to continue searching for truth. So, if you don\u2019t want to know anything or be responsible for anyone, especially yourself, by all means believe in fate. It should be noted that one could philosophically counter the idea of freewill, either completely or by degrees, and still disassemble fate because while freewill questions the autonomy of selfhood based on the context of birth and conditioning, if not on an firmer ontological grounds, fate presumes itself to freely operate without addressing fundamental questions, especially when approached as a belief system.

            "answer_text": "Hi, I'm the questioner, I want to make it clear, so I want to say a few more words. When we are in the process of doing something might happen some things, these things may contribute to a good result can also be a bad result, but people tend to believe that god's will that could make things to pay more attention to the bad results, but often overlooked something could produce good results! Phase, for example, have seen a real documentary about a pair of lovers, men marry a football match in the scene, is, of course, be full attention, embarrassing when out of the ring ring off the ground, men together with the people around me some time to find the ring, long continuous media reported the couple later, after a period of time they married, and after a period of time together as a couple they invited to a television show and won first prize, prize of $10000, then the report is that they have divorced two years, the reason is that she found men in tying unwittingly unauthorized use of the $10000. And the two sides have expressed a view to the reporter - that the other is not suitable for themselves! Ok, see this, I was thinking that the fall of the ring was really providence? ",
