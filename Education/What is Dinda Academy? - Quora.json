            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Dinda academy hahaa\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. It happen not in this year.After Umesh Yadav\u2019s stellar bowling performance against KXIP, RCB\u2019s official tweeter account tweeted: \u201cDinda Academey? What\u2019s That?\u201d. Later they found that the tweet has a bad taste and deleted it. But the tweet was already noticed by the fans and it spread on social media. Tweeted By Official Account Of RCB after Umesh took 3 wickets(Later Deleated) Seeing an IPL franchise\u2019 official Twitter handle trolling him, Ashok Dinda found this unmanageable and he came up with a post on Facebook to shut his haters.He shared his T20 bowling stats and a pic showcasing him the leading wicket-taker of Bengal for the last 9 years.After that incident Ashok Dinda said.. \u201cHaters, helping you get your statistics right. Stop and stare well your opinion is not my reality. So shut your hating selves and keep me out of your mouth\u201d. You might be thinking what is Dinda Academy and why Ashok Dinda is getting trolled for the bad performances of other bowlers. The thing started a few IPL seasons back when Dinda conceded too many runs in few games also his IPL record is not that good that\u2019s why he has always faced trolling from the fans. In IPL 2018 and 2019 auctions he didn\u2019t get any buyer. But this year trollers came up with a fictional thing called Dinda Academy. Whenever a bowler concedes too many runs in his spell, they include him in this academy showcasing with memes. Umesh Yadav, Jaydev Unadkat, Mohammed Siraj get trolled for the same. Ashok Dinda has not a very good IPL record but he has done well for India in T20s. In 9 matches for India, he has struck 17 wickets. Also, he has a great domestic record for Bengal. ",
