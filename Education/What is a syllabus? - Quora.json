            "answer_text": "A syllabus is a document containing information students need to know about a course. Students can expect college professors to give out a syllabus for the class at the beginning of the academic term. Some high school teachers may also hand out a syllabus, especially in high schools that are considered to be \u201ccollege prepatory\u201d-preparing high schoolers for college.  A syllabus will often include: The professor's name, office hours, and contact informationThe course name, and maybe the academic term (e.g., \u201cSpring 2017\u201d)The schedule of topics to be coveredImportant dates: exams, essays, and projectsRequired/recommended textbooks and other materialsNames, office hours, and contact information of Teaching Assistants (TAs)Grading scale, especially when different from the school's standardGrading weights (adds up to 100%), e.g.Final: 30%Midterm: 25%Quizzes: 15%Homework: 20%Participation/Attendance: 10%Important policies specific for the course, professor, or school, e.g. :late policyaccomodations for students with disability I would recommend using your syllabi to stay on track, if not get ahead by taking note of the schedule, and of the aforementioned important dates. Also, it would behoove you to look to the syllabus first when you need questions answered that might be answered by the syllabus, rather than asking your professor first. After looking at the syllabus, if your question is not answered, contact the teacher. ",
