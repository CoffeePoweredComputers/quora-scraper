            "answer_text": "According to me regular http://m.com is much better than the IGNOU because The student who do http://M.com as a regular course will get an opportunity to attend class room sessions.. They will get more exposure to practical sessions as well. They will get proper guidance under experienced teachers or faculties that will help them to be thorough with the subjects covered in course. More over they will interact with the class mates that will help them to get along with the studies. But IGNOU is helpful for those ; For students who have difficulty in attending regular classes , they can pursue their degree through IGNOU. The students with family constraints or those who are working and wish to pursue academic degree ( http://M.com) can fulfill their wish by doing the degree through IGNOU . Their will be options to access the class notes via post or else through online mode as well. Finally it is advisable for a student to do http://M.com through IGNOU only if he/she is working(job). And Doing http://M.com through regular mode is better for a candidate who is not working. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are valuable, distance learning will consume more time for updates have to depend on university website about the marksheet and other issues, in regular degree will take less time to get updates about the marksheet and other issues. If you are employed somewhere, you can do distance learning, but if you are not doing anything you can go to regular college recognised by affiliated university. In some cases distance learning programs may be possible not approved by UGC, AICTE (mandatory for all universities established in india) and other approval authorities. In case of regular, there may be less chances of these problems, but you should check for approvals in this case (especially in case of private), IGNOU and state regulated universities like Delhi university so, in case of government it\u2019s all approved but in like 4 percent cases you need to check.
