            "answer_text": "JEE Advanced ( formerly IIT JEE) is quite tough but still it is not competitive. It is very predictable who will make through and those who would not. Scoring pattern prove this: 250 marks or above: hardly 250\u2013300 students each year. These students are marked out well in advance. 200 -250 marks: 1500 students. Their selection is also quite predictable. It is close to almost 50 % marks out of total. Almost all leading streams in main IITs in general categories get filled up through these students. Just approximate 2000 students who manage to score 50% marks. In SAT, the number of students who score 50% or more is far more than this number. The breadth of talent is far too much there. In US Universities, the margin of SAT score is very minor in almost all top universities for all streams . In IITs, the difference of marks in JEE for CS branch compared to Mettalurgy in same IIT is even quite wide. The question is quite pertinent and relevant in understanding Why we are lacking in having high number of institutions at par with these 6\u20137 IITs and also why we lack in research, developing advanced technologies to solve our fundamental decade old problems. We are producing a very little amount of high end talent. Almost all focus of schools and coaching institutions is on polishing these already predictable students to become more and more distinctive. All course module, coaching pattern etc. is being designed to make these few thousand students more and more distinctive. There are hardly efforts to work to improve the skills of those lakhs of students in a way that is suitable to make initial sequential improvement in their skills. Rather than they have been pushed in the high powered system which is suitable and biased towards those who have these skills already developed and those lakhs fail to make any improvement as that system is not aligned to the way they should be initially trained in. These lakhs of unprepared students are used & exploited to make money by schools and coaching institutions knowingly and there is hardly anything they get in return. After undergraduate, almost majority of that little high end talent that is developed in our country almost from all institutions get exported to top US universities or to US companies. In the end, we are left with almost nothing. The ground situation here in India is same even after 50\u201360 years of the existence of these 6\u20137 institutions. We have to change this system and there are ways to upturn this situation now. It is for sure that in next 2\u20133 years, the current pattern of exploitative coaching and even schooling will be broken down and this has already begun subconsciously. ",

It is tough to choose books over games , study table over movie theatre , a table lamp nighout over night blasting sleeps. These very small things eventually make a difference and separate a JEE aspirant and IITian. ",
