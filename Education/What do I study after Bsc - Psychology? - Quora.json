            "answer_text": "It depends on what career you want. A psychology undergraduate degree is a good background for many lines of work including sales, human resources, teaching, research, and therapist some of which (in the US) you can enter with only the Bsc degree and some of which require additional graduate study. Career requirements differ from country to country. My recommendation is first to decide on how you want to earn your living, then arrange what in the US are called informational interviews with several people who have been successful in the work that you want to pursue, and finally \u2014 if your preferred profession requires a license \u2014 check with your own government licensing authorities to find out the exact license requirements. Good luck! ",
