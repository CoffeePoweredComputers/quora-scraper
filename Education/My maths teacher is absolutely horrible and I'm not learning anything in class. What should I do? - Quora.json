While your math teacher is not teaching and wasting your time, spend some time over looking at the example math questions on your math textbook. You can also learn a lot by going over the steps on the sample problems. If you don\u2019t understand a subject, you can always find help online. Khan Academy is a very good resource that has tutorial videos and practice problems as well. ",
