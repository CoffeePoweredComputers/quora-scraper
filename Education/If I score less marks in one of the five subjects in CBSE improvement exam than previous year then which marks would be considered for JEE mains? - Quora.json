            "answer_text": "I gave improvement this year and JEE Main 2015 too again So I am sure about my answer Basically you have the choice which marks do you want to be considered for JEE Mains.  You have to enter marks of entirely or previous year or entirely of current year. if you are entering marks of improvement year then the only thing which is taken from your last year marksheet is your practical marks Which marks would be considered in JEE Main ?  It depends on which roll no. and year of passing you enters on JEE Main Website (Registration of Roll no. and marks are after JEE) Generally students fill those marks which are greater but i suggest you to fill those marks which may help you to get higher percentile. For Example:If you get 89% previous year and 90% in improvement year then generally it is better to fill the marks of 89% as there are more chances that it may help you to get a better rank in JEE main ",
