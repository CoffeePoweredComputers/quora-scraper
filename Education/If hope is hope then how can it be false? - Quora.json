            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say I am in a relationship and we break up. The break up happened due to a misunderstanding, and I am hoping we will clear things up and reunite. Hope is the remnant of a feeling, often after you believe everything is lost, that you can still have what you want even when it hasn\u2019t happened. Now imagine the break up actually took place because my significant other doesn\u2019t love me anymore. He doesn\u2019t feel a thing. Whatever we had is gone. In a misguided attempt to avoid hurting me, he says \u201cmaybe someday things will change and we will get back together\u201d. This then is him giving me false hope. Suggesting I can still have something when the truth is that it\u2019s unlikely to ever happen. ",

            "answer_text": "If a guy buys Axe spray deodorant  because he hopes bikini clad women will come chasing after him exactly like it\u2019s shown in television commercials, that is a great example of false hope.  Marketing gurus play to the fantasies and deep seated needs of people.  They make false exaggerated claims their products cannot fulfill. For their gain. Sales = profit. Money.  A guy who buys Axe has fallen for the hype.  His primal desires are triggered, so he sprays.  The poor guy keeps hoping. He sprays. Over sprays. Nope. No bikini clad women run through jungles or run on sandy beaches to bang him. He ends up in his darkened room in front of his computer. Alone. His door is locked. And he watches\u2026Axe commercials! What did you think? It\u2019s either that or blue balls. Please have compassion for him. Him. A hope filled dreamer. ",
