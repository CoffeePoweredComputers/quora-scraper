            "answer_text": "You first need to build your sense of direction in your studies. That means you need to be constantly aware what are the topics you already know and what are the topics still require you to spend more time to study. In order to build your sense of direction in your studies, you need to study to understand, which provides for solid memories, rather than studying to remember/memorizing. This is what I will suggest you do On school days or any busy days, allocate a fixed time for homework and studying in each day. This will give you an idea on how much time you need each day to do both which makes you more organized.For each day, ideally before you go to bed, allocate 1 hour to finish your homework and the next hour doing some short revisions from what you learned during school.The short revisions include writing some short notes of what you know and what you still need to learn from today\u2019s lessons.In the final 5 minutes of that one hour revision session, you do a reflectionon what you have learn in all your lesson today. This meaning making a summary of what you have learned today and what you still need to learn or not sure or seek help from the teacher on the next day.By doing a reflection, you get a clear idea of what you know and don\u2019t know which then gives you direction on what you need to learn in school. This will naturally give you a sense of purpose in studying as well as keeping you engaged in your study session. Thus, you will naturally have the motivation to keep learning and studying.During the weekends (or any full day), allocate a 2 or 3 hour study session, with a 15 minutes break in between, on each weekend for a study session. The most ideal time to do this is in the morning when you just had your breakfast. In the last 15 minutes of each study session, you also do a reflection on what you have learned and what you still need to improve on. This will give you a sense of direction on what you still need to learn in class for the next week. If you repeat this step, you will realized you are studying more efficiently by constantly focus on improvement. You may add one more 3 hour study session on a full day if you do not have anything else on. All this allows you to study efficiently and still have time to have fun, doing your fitness/exercises and have a good night sleep See Timothy Soo's answer to What are some good study habits? ",

That\u2019s when I\u2019ll give myself a 15\u201320 minute break where I literally find something to do that is not studying. If the weather\u2019s nice I\u2019ll take a walk at the nearby park and listen to some music to help take my mind off the topic at hand. I usually always have a book I\u2019m in the middle of reading so sometimes I\u2019ll peruse through it before the break is over. The important thing is to let your mind completely rest before jumping right back in. I\u2019d also recommend looking into methods of studying that aren\u2019t traditionally exhausting like reading notes over and over. Some of my favorite methods are: Study Groups - get just two or three good friends to go over problems and solve them together. What\u2019s great about these is it keeps you active while letting you immediately correct misunderstandings and learn content you might not have caught yourselfSelf-Assessment (can be in person or conducted in a group) - get friends and yourself to generate questions that are similar to what you\u2019ve seen before in the subject/class your learning. Take advantage of flash cards if you can or even better, see if you can find an existing set from a prior year!Summarization - look over your notes and try to boil things down as far as you can. Key formulas, terms, etc. Take advantage of illustrations as well!Separate Perspectives - YouTube has a plethora of great, bite-sized explainer videos for certain topics. Try to compile together relevant material and review when you\u2019re free (eating, commuting, etc).",

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhat should you do if you can't study?\u201d You should handle the primary reason students become \u2018unable to learn\u2019, become unable to study. So, you get some other person to work with you to do this until you are able to learn to do this for yourself. This is done by another person, called a Word Clearer, or more commonly a study partner or tutor. I have found teachers are not in general able to do this. The word clearer helps you locate the exact words that have caused the inability to learn and then helps you clarify them with a dictionary. This returns your ability to learn or study in each subject. The word clearer is trained to help you locate the exact word, the exact location, the exact meaning for the word that you do not understand, that will return you to doing well. When this is done systematically it is called Method One Word Clearing, or M1. I have been trained to do this. I estimate it will take 8 to 16 hours for a high school student to complete this and become able to learn again in all subjects. One can be doing well in all subjects again. This is the way I define \u2018doing well.\u2019 Doing well is when a student is flying along, feeling brilliant, enthusiastic, fully able to understand what they are learning, without stress or strain, and able to recall and apply what they have learned.This is based on the principle that the only reason a person becomes \u2018unable to learn\u2019 is that they have gone past a word that was not understood. When that word is located and properly defined they are then \u2018able to learn\u2019 again. One can learn to properly define a word with a dictionary with this book:  You should be able to locate this book at your local library, book store, ebay or Amazon. If your local library does not have one, donate one when you have completed it. Then you should take good course on how to study like The Student Hat Course (80 hours) or The Basic Study Manual.  You should then be able to return yourself to \u2018doing well\u2019 whenever you need to. For example, if a student is not \u2018doing well\u2019 for as little as 15 minutes, they should stop, locate the words they missed, clarify them, and return to \u2018doing well.\u2019 This is the correct way to study each subject.

            "answer_text": "The question is very generic, and open to several interpretations:- Is your question that you want to study (because of exams, better career goals), but cannot? Or is your question about other alternatives to studying? If it is first. Think hard and introspect, why are you not able to study? Is it because lack of interest / finding it boring? Is it because the study topic is too complex? Is it because of other external factors ( environment, personal and family life ) are affecting you? If it is because of lack of interest:i) Try to make study interesting. Read other surrounding books \\ Attend other lectures on the topic. Find out why the people who spend all their life in those fields are crazy about the those subjects \\ fields.   ii) If that does not work (I have had occasions like this: I hated social sciences to the core in my class X, or biology in class XII), just bite the bullet, and go through with it. There are greater rewards after that.iii) Take frequent breaks (BUT make sure you are disciplined about your timings - put an alarm if the discipline is hard to come by). In those breaks, perform activities that you really LOVE to do, something that you are really passionate about. Those breaks are very refreshing and invigorating. Of course, this varies person-to-person (some might want to cook, knit, write, play videogame, checkout quora / FB). You will come back to study with much fresher mindset. My ideal advice is to go for a short 10 minutes walk / exercise. If you find it complex:Start slowly, refresh the basics as many times as you need to. Understand smaller steps first, and then slowly feed complex stuff in your brain. NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING is complex if your brain is given adequate preparation.  If there are other external issues. Try to eliminate those issues, if you can. If noise bothers you, go to library.If you feel lonely, find study buddies. Making your study environment fixed (i.e. a comfortable chair / table, or a sofa - in your room) and developing a fixed routine also helps (wake up at 7am everyday, take shower to get ready, study for X minutes/ hours (or until you get bored). Go for a walk, study some more, take a break come back watch a TV show for 30 minutes, study more for X hours ... sleep at 11pm ). ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a list of suggestions which will help you improve your power of concentration: Study at the same time each day. A regular schedule can help you frame this as \u201cstudy time\u201d. Set a timer for an hour, don't allow yourself to stop studying until it goes off. Take breaks. A three minute break for every 30 minutes of study is a good guideline. Take a longer break after 90 minutes. Set goals for your session that are realistic (number of problems to solve, pages to read, etc.) When you have met one of your study goals, reward yourself with a short break. Then, return to your study area. Study in an area away from distractions such as a library, study lounge, or an empty classroom. Make sure you have everything that you need before you begin. Make sure your environment is conducive to studying, no TV, no telephone, no roommate, no boyfriend/girlfriend. Make studying an active process; take notes and make review sheets. Intersperse different kinds of study into one session, e.g. reading, writing, taking notes, memorizing, etc. Identify how what you are studying is relevant to your life. Draw connections between things you already know. Ensure that you are sleeping enough, eating well, and getting regular exercise. Your mind will be more alert, and you will be less likely to fall asleep or daydream. 83% of our sensory input comes from our eyes. To truly concentrate on something, shut your eyes and you will remove much distraction. ******************************************************************************** Some tips for studying : To memorize anything\u2026. \u2022\tFrequently write and rewrite the notes. \u2022\tFind a partner and study with \u2022\tWalk around while studying.

            "answer_text": "Two aspects to cover. Why to study?Frustrationresolving 'why to study'. That's actually very simple. Purpose of study. Complete school, get a degree, (or professional qualification) go for a job or do what you feel that suits you. Lack of motivation makes you to think like this. For studying, the reason could be, surviving in society, looking after parents and siblings, for your own happiness like earning on travel, earning to eat, earning to donate etc., Apart from this following your dreams. You will gain an ultimate happiness when you follow \ud83d\udcad and achieve it. Example, you want to go Himalayas as traveller as your dream. You don't have money. So study and earn money. Fetch your dreams in reality. Find your passion and jump into it. Even after this if you can't study, just move on. Take a job. Follow your passion.. Don't stick on it. But don't forget to put efforts. It's the ultimate failure. \u201cYou can't do that\u201d doesn't mean \u201cyou won't do that\u201d. Put more efforts and try. After that Take a decision. (I'm not saying only you can earn by studying. You can earn without studying) Secondly, stress. Frustration. For me frustrations are because, I planned one but happened something else.I came to speak one but mistook in other wayI couldn't do somethingNo job, no money, no relationship or problem in these things..For these things, my stress bursted is, What normal citizens do, smoking, drinking, other immoral things. But I have other ideas\u2026  Yes guys FOOD. IIt can be any food which should not be pizza burger sandwich( which I feel harmful for body) I eat a full meal at afternoon. I don't consider any situation. Ill forget all my issues. I'll forget the whole world. I'll go to a hotel. (My fav choices are Annapoorna Hotel Coimbatore, and Geetha canteen) Take a meals token. Eat as much as I can. Take my bike come back to room. Switch on the fan. I'll sleep until I myself realize and can wakeup. (Normally it will be an afternoon time. After a meal, exactly after 20 mins, there comes a sleep. Heaven\ud83e\udd70 south Indian readers can understand this) Advantages of selecting FOOD as stress bursted Food doesn't cost much ( a meal cosy \u20b9100 min \u20b9250 max. Drinks and other stuffs costs 500 min) and available everywhere around you. If you are at home, when you are in high stress, as your mom to cook food more. Especially in afternoon. Eat high and sleep more. Mom's food surely bring impact. Trust me. You will appreciate in future.Food won't cause medical issues.Nothing wrong in getting addicted to Food.Don't need to wash face, use mouth freshener, don't need to conceal that you are drunk, don't need to pay fine for DrunknDriveFood is absolutely safe for everyone.You will surely get an idea after that sleep. Because you don't have stress. Just sit for a while and think positively \u2018what's next?\u2019 Never think about past. Or else you need to start the process again :P Personal experience: A week back I was really frustrated. I don't know what to do. Went to a hotel. Ate as much as I can. Came back and slept. I slept for around 8.5 hrs. All my stress went. I got the thing what to do and what was the mistake I did.Not but not the least. Speak with patents that will be the extreme pills for stress. Speak with only one friend who is loyal to you and console you. Never think of relatives. (Personal experience) Thank you \u270c\u263a ",

Just I need to reach a logical end. And I am done\". I finished my engineering, joined a MNC, had good time. But today, afrer 5 years, I am back to college! doing my doctoral studies.  So much water has passed by. When I sit back and think again those days and the place I am in now, I feel like laughing at myself. Immaturity, frustration, disgust, dissatisfaction and many more feelings made me to think like that, on that day. Ambition, goal, motivation and practicalities brought me back to where I am today. Here is the thing, when I feel 'I can't'  I should ask myself 'why I can't?' . This is very important. You are the right judge of yourself. There might be many reasons for someone to think  why I can't study? Like, subjects might be boring, it might be difficult to compete with peers, results are not according to the efforts or my interest lies somewhere else. Then the next question \" if not studying, what else? What is goal of my life? How should achieve it?\" This is very subjective and you have to figure it out and make a priority wise list of it and plan of action to achieve it. Now the important one, In your plan of action, \"where does the current study fit in?\" If it does not fit in, don't worry. Its time for you to change the path. But before that make sure you reach to a logical end of whatever you are doing now. Because we never know when that will be handy. For me at that time, I felt like working is better. So I choose that. Then, I felt, \"I need to learn more\". So I am back to school now. ;-) It might be different for you. So choose accordingly. Finally, I would like to say \"Follow the heart, in the lights of Brain\" ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on what is your age and why you want to study. A person at 14 or 16(class 10, 12) might think of opting to study to score good marks and impress any teacher, be their pet student, win a competition, or simply to pass so that he is not humiliated in a class. At graduation level, one might want to clear all the present papers, sometimes backlogs, get into a better workplace, etc One who is already working, wants to elevate his standard of living even more, and thus he too studies. There may be more, but since you are asking this question, I believe you will fall in one of the above categories. But at all the above stages, one thing in common is if you dont study, you will remain the same of what you were or in the worst case your graph may even take a sharp turn downwards. But if there is a slightest chance that you study, you may elevate yourself in terms of everything. So why to even think of not studying.  Its wonderful(to study), believe me!!  So, my answer is; you should \"study\" when you think you cannot study. I have defined \"study\" below. PS: Studying does not mean only read the books and memorize. Example: Instead of doing nothing, you have taken a step to ask people and know about this. You can consider this studying. This is also part of study i.e. plan your study. Cheers! ",

Make sure that you mention the \u201ctime\u201d in your to-do list. While studying take short breaks of 5 min after every 30 - 45 minutes of study (NO phone during 5 min break). If it's difficult for you to sit at one place for 30 minutes, use a Timer (not stopwatch), Trick is to make your mind see time reducing. Give yourself some reward every time you completely follow your to-do list. You can always make someone accountable, especially if you lives with your family, ask a family member to keep a check on you during your study hours. Keep yourself motivated, watch video, listen to the person who inspires you most. The most important thing to remember is that it's not compulsory what works best for any other person will work for you too, so listen to all the suggestions and follow what works best for you. And being a professional education coach it's my personal suggestion that give a try to these recommendations and modify them the way they suit you best. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a clear situation that your focus is not on studies. Focus and interest two are very important ingredients to do anything. So first you need to see whether this is the case of interest or focus? If you don't have interest in doing study then it is very difficult for you to engage yourself in studies. Why interest is not there? Interest generated from the aim and objectives in your life. So find out what is the aim in your life? Once you are clear what is the aim of your life, you will try to get the same. This will create interest because you will be doing something which you like. If you don't like something and try to do it you will not find it interesting. And without interest if you do anything be it study, games or any hobby, your performance will be poor. So in life aim and objectives are important. And interest is there you will do it with joy. If you have everything in place still not able do it. Then it is the problem with focus. When your mind is running here are there, it becomes very difficult. You start something and think about the results. It creates the fear of failure and worries. And this worry will not let you focus on your work. So need to enhance your focus, so yoga and meditation. Keep away from negetive people, read good books ",

But believe me without getting into this trouble,you can never feel esctasic about learning and acheiving your goal because to resolve the problem,you must know the problem\u2026. Why do have to study? The first answer that comes to the mind can be; 1.For becoming great(a noble reason that seeds comparision). 2.For the sake of our parents..(a reason that sometimes veils challenges in the name of its novelty.A social acclaimation) 3.For fighting hard times(Making hay in the sunshine) 4.For discovering our latent potential. 5.For the sake of a promise that we made to someone. The reasons you choose can fall under this category or be an amalgamation of many. Its ok to keep these reasons for standing in front of the society as a statement of ypur petsonality.But the moment you come in front of books and sit before your study table,let go off these reasons considering them dirt\u2026 Try and know which methods help you to learn well:reading,highlighting,taking down notes or discussion.Then make yourself a pro at it\u2026\u2026\u2026.Attach all your beliefs to success and get up everytime you fail. Millions of thoughts will flutter in while you decide to study but don\u2019t let them pull your motives down\u2026..Only you can do it for yourself. Try to make friends out of books.Read words as if they are a compassionate address from the author.. Feel the changes in your body and mind while you attempt to learn something.Meditate over your thoughts and actions.. Apart from all these factors ,there might be non-academic reasons that couldbe pulling you down like peer pressure,insomnia,other health issues,relationship stresses etc.. Address them judiciously  All the best\u2026. May God bless you ",

            "answer_text": "Majority of the students end up in this situation and it\u2019s completely normal. What you need to realize is that you can\u2019t study continuously for one hour and above. Follow the 45:15 rule i.e., 45 minutes of thorough studies and 15 mins of break. This will help you study something as compared to getting bored and studying nothing at all. The ratio I\u2019ve mentioned above is suggestive and you can make changes as per your comfort (after all, you\u2019re the boss of your studies). However, try not to reduce the study time less than 30 minutes, and you can also reduce the break time. For example, 30:10. You\u2019ve got to also realize that preparing for the exams will only benefit you and none other. If you feel demotivated listen to some inspirational/your favourite music. If you feel scared/anxious, perform the mindful meditation exercise wherein you should sit in a comfortable position and breathe in and out, and while doing so concentrate only on the movement of your breath in and out through the nose. At times you may get distracted, but revert your attention to the breathing. You can perform the meditation for max 10 mins. This exercise has been proven to be highly effective to reduce anxiety. Lastly, what matters the most is your study preparation and your performance during the exam, not the result. So stay calm, have some faith in yourself and you\u2019ll do great! BEST OF LUCK!!! ",

Without a decent degree its very diffiult to make a good living, unless of course you want to become an Entrepreneur. Then that would be a different story altogether and even to start your own venture education is very essential. People respect you more if you are well educated and your knowledge also improves with education. Don't fall for the stories of Steve Jobs or Bill Gates who discontinued their studies! They did so only because they had a strong business idea/passion to pursue and aren't bothered about the consequences of not studying. If you don't have any such passion/idea then it would be futile to have them as \"inspirational models\"! ",

Now let's come back to the solution. We don't like studying textbooks but contrast it with the stories or a comic book. You'd accept that everyone loves reading interesting stories and comics. But where does this interest go when it comes to reading the textbooks? What's the difference? The answer is, Our perspective. Till the day you will take study as an mundane duty, which you gotta do just to pass your exams, you'll never enjoy studying. But the day when you start enjoying study, you'll find it to be the most soothing experience. Of Course, this is not going to happen in a day, it's a gradual process. You can start reading the interesting modules of ACadru to enjoy learning. They have some immensely interesting as well as informative modules that will teach you a great deal of thing about topics across different streams in a succinct manner. For example, Anthropology is considered to be one of the most complex branches of Humanities but this interesting module on ACadru will give you a completely new way to approach the subject. This is how, by making the studies as an instrument of enjoyment, you will start culminating interest in studies. You can do also take the help of the following methods listed out hereHow to Get Motivated to Study: 23 Tips for Students Who Procrastinate to amplify your interest in the studies. ",

And then, do not stop reading, for it is like a catalyst that would facilitate your journey of developing your study habits. (3) Find reasons why you have to study - Here are a few reasons. To become more intelligent.To increase your mental capacity, IQ (Intelligence Quotient).You study to know, (i.e to have knowledge), to pass exams, to graduate, to develop yourself, to secure a better future, etc.Once you have found the reasons why you have to study, pick any area that you are curious about or have an interest in, and start to study based on the interest, please start slowly, and be CONSISTENT.Please do not compare yourself to and/or compete with anybody because those who you think that are better than you, at one time started to develop and themselves and they became better - you know, it's not something that could be done overnight :)So, challenge and compete with yourself.Become a better and greater YOU!Thanks :) ",

Setting milestones, thinking about the consequences of gaining good marks will also help you study better. Muting your phone is important. You can even go out for a walk just to refresh yourself. This will also help you. Controlled dosage of coffee or energy drinks and rock music ( like that of Linkin Park) will also enable you stay awake in night for studying.

Take a break for a reasonable amount of time, do something not at all related to the study, such as playing a game or listening to music or dance or something. Then when you feel the break is enough you can resume the study. But if it is because there is a lack of interest in the subject or having too many questions on the subject, then you need to find out the exact reasons. Is it because it hasn't been taught well, or there are too many questions then it is time to get them answered well. Because there is no point in just studying while there are too many questions on the subject in your mind. Your next actions on finding difficulty in studying depends on the exact reasons why you are unable to study. ",

First thing is jot down all the subjects syllabus and note down the time you have to study. After doing it set the priority for each subject. What I suggest is first finish of the subject you find difficult so that you will concentrate more and devote more time on hard subject. Some of my friends have this psychology that if they finish the easy subject first they feel motivated to study difficult subjects. You can go either ways.But firstly you should have self motivation to study. Unless you get that you cannot give it a start. Be motivated and work hard you will definitely study gonna achieve your goals. ",

Study is useful when done with correct intensity otherwise it's just wastage of time which could have been utilized constructively elsewhere. One shouldn't study just for the sake of it. Rather one should study because it in itself is an interesting phenomenon. One might get goosebumps when one comes to understand the philosophies, science, art forms prevalent in the world. ",

So it was like 2 hours or so of studies, then half an hour of reading. It's a great stress buster. You can try your hand on any of the books out there. Now there are a lot of good Indian authors who write on a wide range of subjects.Not only will you enjoy reading, but if you pick up reading, I can assure you its a very enjoyable and a rewarding hobby to have.

Try touching your feet without bending your waist. Do some squats as well. After you are done , sit on the bed and try to concentrate on something which you like. It can be an object , an animal or your crush. Try thinking on it as long as you can. Slowly use your right hand and touch the book which you were studying. Without much hesitation you shut it close. Then you keep it back in its place. Then you go out and play ( or do anything which relaxes your mind ). ",
