            "answer_text": "Alright slow down. I'm gonna teach you how to tackle this question yourself.  Let's start with some background knowledge. College admissions officers are not the same a graduate admissions. They are educated people, but not much different than you or I.  And I don't know about you, but I'm lazy. So are these people. There are literally thousands of applications to look at; you can't expect them to forgive your B in English because everyone at your school got a B. It just doesn't happen.  So what's the good news? You can help. As a really lazy person, I love when people do things for me. So do for them.  How do you do this? Show them that you're top notch without them having to dig for it. This includes GPA, test scores, IB grades, etc.   It is for this reason that SL scores aren't looked at often times. SL establishes that you know how to handle college level material, but aren't quite ready for it yet.  HL shows both.  They're both good to have, but SL courses are no harder than an honors high school class. HL is the real deal. Most colleges won't even consider credit for an SL class, but will allow credit for HL.  Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions Cheers  ",

            "answer_text": "Elite colleges (at least in the US) like to know you can cope with hard work. This means that course rigour is indeed one of the admissions criteria. Course rigour includes, but is not limited to, the difficulty of your high school course, which includes, but is not limited to, the higher levels you chose, and the number you took. Admissions comprises many criteria, one of which is course rigour. In other words, elite US colleges demand a fairly ridiculous amount of excellence from their candidates. Taking hard higher levels and a lot of them will definitely make you better\u2014but those things make up only one thin slice of the cake. (Thanks for the A2A.) ",

            "answer_text": "So, typically getting a good grade in an HL, for all intents and purposes, is better than getting a good grade in an SL. On top of that, many universities (especially top ones) require you to take specific HLs for certain majors.  The only thing that's a bit weird is how many universities take a 4 or 5 in an HL versus a 6 or 7 in SL. I think this case is almost exclusively for Math, since there is such a huge difference between SL and HL in terms of the difficulty of the exams. I've seen people who were getting 3s and 2s in HL effortlessly get 7s in SL after dropping down. That just shows you how much of a difference there is. A 5 in HL Math IMHO should be held in higher regard than a 7 in SL. However this isn't the case for the vast majority of universities, sadly; especially for science-related majors. Apparently, especially when talking about top universities, the issue is that you will often be competing with people who actually have a 7 in Math HL, and so a 5 quite literally doesn't stand well against that. However, a 7 in SL shows that you might, just might, be able to get a 7 in HL if you wanted to. You have that benefit of the doubt. So if you can't get as good of a grade in an HL subject, the best thing is to take it SL in terms of university acceptances. HOWEVER, I personally believe that's a pretty stupid thing to do. If a subject is related to your major and you really like it you should strive to get a high grade in it as an HL, and if you can't, then take it HL anyway, because in most cases all of the extra knowledge you will get will be worth it. If a university can't recognize your worth because they only care about numbers, then you're likely not meant to be there in the first place ;) ",

            "answer_text": "For credit? Depends on the college. Most prestigious colleges only give you credit for HLs if you received a 6 or 7. Some recognize both HLs and SlLs. However, there are a few colleges who will let you skip an entire year if you are a full diploma student and received a certain score.  In terms of admission the IB gives you a leg up. Admissions teams know you've challenged yourself as much as you can. If you have good predictions it's a bonus. I strongly believe that my IB diploma was one of the most important factors in my acceptance.  ",
