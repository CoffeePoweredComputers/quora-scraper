            "answer_text": "Hey, I am assuming that you are a person who worries a bit. Urm so the options are: -retake that subject -if there was a reason, beyond your ability to control, you might talk that through with the ui/college you had applied to. But, to be very very honest, come on you are not going to fail! People say IB is so hard and all that but in the end those people who go scaremongering are the hardest workers and able t cope with it. All I am trying to say is that you would have to really try and to fail. I know like an army of people probably have said this to you -try to do your best and it will be fine. Try not to worry, and try to look on the bright side. I know, when people tells this to you, in the inside you beg them to shut up but\u2026. its true. Instead of creating scenarios in your head or fearing, work to your best ability and ace that SL paper. Have confidence in your self. Talk to your teachers, higher ed people or parents or friends. In the end like Lloyd George have said, \u201c Hope for the best but be prepared for the worst.\u201d But keep that balance and don\u2019t let fear win over your potential. ",

You have to pass all of your HL classes and get the total points for the diploma. (I received a 3 in Theatre SL and still earned my diploma; there is hope!) ",
