            "answer_text": "You might have no choice, if where you live there\u2019s a mandatory schooling requirement, and most developed countries have it until age 16 or so. You really should get your high school diploma somehow, but you don\u2019t necessarily have to go to the same school you\u2019ve been going to, or you can also look into home schooling. If you hate your school, I think you really need to get out of there at all costs. Force your parents to find a better school for you or get you into home schooling. You can refuse to go to school and force them to find a solution to your problems. Good luck. ",

You could get yourself and your parents in trouble with the law. The schools in America are a shambles. But since you can't legally make the choice till you're 18, you are kinda stuck. This is a life lesson for you. Sometimes you have to do what others want you to do. ",
