            "answer_text": "Let us assume the definition of \u2018fate\u2019 as the \u2018occurrence of events in one\u2019s life beyond their wish and control \u2019. Since \u2018fate\u2019 is considered as a \u2018plan\u2019 of a \u2018super natural power\u2019 (SNP), let us also assume that the SNP would plan and execute the critical events in one\u2019s life with specific goals (or causes). If we discover such goals or causes of SNP are \u2018meaningful\u2019, then we can agree the existence of \u2018fate\u2019. What is the meaning of \u2018meaningful\u2019 ? Imagine a mad man throwing stones on others. Can his act considered to be a \u2018meaningful\u2019 one? Although it can be a \u2018meaningful\u2019 act for the mad man, it can\u2019t be for the rest of the society. So, only when any plan and action is intended towards the \u2018Welfare\u2019 of others, then it can be considered as \u2018meaningful\u2019 plans and acts. Is the society currently living in peace, harmony and happiness ? We see that the society has not yet developed up to the ideal level. Only when the society is fully developed to the ideal level of peace, harmony and happiness, we can consider that the \u2018Welfare\u2019 of the society is fully accomplished. In my opinion, all people in the world keep learning in a big way to attain the \u2018Welfare\u2019. They are learning about the hindrances against our \u2018Welfare\u2019. The hindrances are Egotism, Selfishness, Attachments and Lust. This world is designed in an ideal way to make the people learn about the evil effects of hindrances that block them attaining the perfect \u2018Welfare\u2019 . Critical events of life of all people do make them understand the evil effects of hindrances and ultimately make them identify \u2018Good\u2019 people, \u2018Good\u2019 intentions and \u2018Good\u2019 attitudes that provide them the perfect \u2018Welfare\u2019. People keep learning to differentiate and defeat the \u2018Evil\u2019 from \u2018Good\u2019 through the \u2018critical events\u2019 inserted in their lives. The \u2018players\u2019 who trigger such critical events can be our spouses, children, parents, friends, relatives, bosses, colleagues, evil people etc. They trigger others through the aforesaid hindrances called Egotism, Selfishness, Attachments and Lust. These \u2018players\u2019 become instrumental to initiate \u2018critical events\u2019 in specific 'environments' are forcefully inserted into our lives without asking our choices. Let us now refer our initial statement about \u2018fate\u2019 mentioned in the third paragraph: If we discover such goals or causes of SNP are \u2018meaningful\u2019, then we can agree the existence of \u2018fate\u2019. The aforesaid \u2018players\u2019 and \u2018critical events\u2019 triggered by them in specific 'environments' become \u2018meaningful\u2019 to make all of us differentiate and defeat the \u2018evil\u2019 from \u2018good\u2019 in order to accomplish the \u2018goal\u2019 of perfect \u2018Welfare\u2019. Fate = Meaningful Plan using Players * Events * Environments We could have understood many learnings acquired by us through the Players such as spouses, children, friends, partners , bosses etc. after they became the key instruments for creating critical Events in our lives using the specific Environment. Without these Players, Events and Environments, our lives would have become meaningless. Fate brings these vital parameters in our lives without our wish, request and control to make our lives meaningful. Every day, we learn through Mistakes, Reactions and Challenges posed by these Players, Events and Environments and upgrade our Wisdom. Very surprisingly, all the three parameters (Players, Events and Environments) are planned and inserted well in our lives in such a way, they either provoke our weaknesses or reinforce our strengths in order to make us upgrade our wisdom. I hope that we have discovered such important goal of SNP and their plan towards accomplishing our perfect \u2018Welfare\u2019 which is termed as \u2018fate\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "You studied hard for examinations and was confident of excellent results. You did your \u2018karma\u2019. You fell ill or you met with an accident or anything like that and you could not appear in the examination. That is your fate which is not in your control. You worked hard, earned money and built a beautiful house. There was earthquake and your house crumbled. That is your fate which is not in your control. You plough the land, sow the seed, water it regularly, give it nutrients and fertilizers, take care of it. The plants grow and seeds appear. Just before you were to make a good harvest, there was a massive storm and your whole crop was destroyed. That\u2019s your fate which is not in your control. Shri Krishna says, \u201cKarmanya wa adhikarastey ma phaleshu kadachinna\u2026\u201d Karma is in our hands but it\u2019s outcome is not in our hand. That is the fate. No matter what the proponents of various theories may say, nothing happens by chance and nothing happens haphazardly. Whatever happens, it happens through a scheme of Someone Who is The Best of Planners, The God. If you accept that, you will always be happy, contented; if you deny that, you will always rue for the outcomes. ",

Fate or destiny hangs on events that have probability on it.. you can never be 100% sure about anything unless its in a perfect controlled environment and hence you are always subjected to Fate or in other words probability.
