            "answer_text": "I would strongly recommend the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS). I learned combinatorics initially through the Art of Problem Solving books. The two books Introduction to Counting & Probability and Intermediate Counting & Probability will definitely teach you about permutations, combinations, counting, summation, generating functions, and recurrence relations. If you don't want to buy the books, do problems on Alcumus and work through solutions. I'm definitely a strong believer in learning mathematics through doing problems. Learning asymptotics is actually pretty simple, and once you have a good foundation in combinatorics and mathematics, look at Introduction to Algorithms (also known as CLRS) to learn more about asymptotics and the application to computer science.

            "answer_text": "As a textbook, I like Prof. A. K. Lal's lecture notes on discrete mathematics (pdf link). It starts from the very basics and treats even advanced topics like P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem and generating functions. There is a Topcoder tutorial on the topic too, with links to a few contest problems. For a list of individual topics you would have to learn in combinatorics, see my answer to What are some must-know topics in discrete math and probability for competitive programming? ",
