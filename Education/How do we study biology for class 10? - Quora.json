            "answer_text": "First of all understand the concepts , biology is not about cramming but understanding. Read the NCERT properly and make your own notes. Writing while studying is important and helpful . It's fact that the writing once what you have learnt is equal to reading the same for 5 to 7 times. Understand the diagrams well and practice them too. Diagrams are key for good marks in biology. Revise regularly all yours chapters after a definate time may be on every weekend or after 15 days as you find apt for yourself. Many people have a misconception that biology being a theory subject doesn't need practice questions but in my opinion one should. I know it's boring to write long answers n all. Alternative to this is read the question and try to figure out what could be the answer this will help you learn better . Hope it works .ALL THE BEST!!! ~Gun ",
