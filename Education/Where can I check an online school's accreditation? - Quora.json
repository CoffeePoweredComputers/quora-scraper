            "answer_text": "One of the simplest (but most valid) ways is to contact the legitimate university to which you will want to transfer for final awarding of your degree. For example, here in Nevada I would recommend you contact UNLV or UNR, the two biggest and well known universities in the state. You simply ask them if your courses from \u201cUniversal Online University and Stormdoor Company\u201d (or whatever it calls itself) are recognized and transferable to THEM. Their approval or disapproval will tell you whether you are wasting your time and money with that online college. Many of the online schools will make BS claims that they are accredited by \u201cFancy Sounding Accreditation Authority\u201d. Guess what? That accrediting authority is total BS. It is simply a club or association of online colleges that provides a fancy sounding accreditation to ANY ONLINE COLLEGE WHO IS A PAYING MEMBER OF THEIR ASSOCIATION. It has ABSOLUTELY NO VALIDITY. So, don\u2019t be suckered by some fancy accreditation title. Your absolute BEST way to know if you are wasting your money is to contact the admissions and accrediting department of a REAL university in your state. ",

            "answer_text": "Go to Council for Higher Education Accreditation and you will find all accredited programs of higher education in the US. These programs are approved to make federal loans for higher education. They certify that schools and programs meet basic standards. Licensure for a profession requires that training is from accredited schools. Professional accrediting organizations must meet CHEAs standards to accredit a profession like social work, teaching, nursing and many others. There have been many fraudulent programs online. They say they are accredited, but it is a sham accrediting organization. What they offer has no real value to employers nor will legitimately accredited schools allow transfer of credit. Often they offer minimal to no instruction and loans are through private lenders. They use aggressive marketing practices. There are many very fine online programs which will give you a baccalaureate or masters degree and sometimes a doctoral degree through a state or private university. The cost is pretty much the same as attending classes in person, but you have flexibility in time and commuting. ",
