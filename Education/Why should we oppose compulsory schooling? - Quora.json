            "answer_text": "Our schools should represent Freedom, \u201cThe Land of the Free.\u201d I would be surprised if every parent had not observed these two things: What happens when a child is eating a food they like, and someone forces them to eat more. This happened to my brother-in-law about 80 years ago. He loved to eat butter. His mom \u2018trained him\u2019 by forcing him to eat a whole stick of butter. He has not eaten butter since. He will not eat anything he feels might have butter in it. One restaurant has \u201cButter Burgers.\u201d He can\u2019t stand to go near it. If there is butter in his food he doesn\u2019t know about, that is fine. He eats mashed potatoes, if his wife prepares it right. (Doesn\u2019t say it has butter in it.) This is a mental condition.What happens when a child is sitting in someone\u2019s lap happily playing and enjoying everything. Then someone constrains them slightly by putting their arms around them just a little too tightly. My wife accidentally did this with a new puppy. She asked me to pick up the puppy, and give it a little hug. She had the best of intentions. Bang! Instant rebellion and two teeth deeply embedded in my right thumb. Lesson learned.I think this is what compulsory education does. It enforces education, when things should be learned as freely as possible without the student being compelled to learn it. It constrains education, when education should be where people learn more freely, without spatial (space and location), temporal (time) or physical constraint. Thomas Jefferson opposed Compulsory Education. He supported the idea people should be free. He supported the idea that a high level of education was necessary to the long term survival of a Constitutional Republic for a free people. That is what America is. He asked two people for their ideas on education, much like your question. One was Pierre DuPont (The Most Able Man in France.) the other Joseph Priestly (The man who discovered the element Oxygen.) DuPont\u2019s answer in April 1800 was later published in a book, National Education in the United States of America, 1812. Preistly sent him a suggested grammar book to standardize across America. DuPont said, in his answer to Jefferson in April 1800, that America currently had the highest level of education in the world. He said only 4 people in 1000 in America can not Read well, Write well, and do Math well. He listed the lower literacy levels of Russia, Poland, France, Germany, England and Switzerland. He said this was done by a non-compulsory educational system as follows: A father would read to the family for 45 minutes a day while breakfast was being prepared. If the father did not choose to do this, the child was sent to a Grammar School for three years to learn these skills. He said the purpose of education is work. I call this The Basic Purpose of Education is Work. Compulsory Education has not, has never, equaled this high level of quality by Third Grade. Freedom under compulsory education has suffered grievously, and hardly exists. I agree more education is needed after third grade in our age of technology. But are the goals for 3d Grade so very different? Shouldn\u2019t kids be able to Read well, to Write well, to do Math well and have the ability to apply these things to Work and their life, at a third grade level when they graduate from 3d grade? I say, Yes! In 1994 the National Assessment of Education Program (NAEP) said, \u201cIn America 50% of students drop out of Math each year, and by 12th grade only 5% are at grade level.\u201d This trend then continues to college and universities. I made this into a graph, actually four graphs; one for Math, one for Reading, one for Writing, and one for Science and gave my four graphs to our local School Board and asked them to fill in the information for our students and publish it to the community, to see how it compares to my estimate. They wanted to think about a new school building, so they did not publish my four graphs. This would have been the graph for just one compulsory education school, of how many kids are failing doing something called, Social Promotion. If the student is failing the students are moved forward a grade, instead of finding the problem and correcting it, before they graduate first-grade, second-grade and third-grade. The NAEP does not use the same standard as DuPont for what is an acceptable level of quality by the end of third grade; to Read well, to Write well, and to do Math well. Where all of that is compared to Work, the type of Work they will be doing in life. They use something called a level of Proficiency. Instead of 996/1000 being at DuPont\u2019s level, the NAEP says about one-third of fourth-grade students in America are a level called Proficient or above, in Reading. They do not say how many are at Proficient or above, in all four of the areas I asked for; Reading, Writing, Math and Science. They also have said 50% of students have dropped out of (are no longer learning the material, or understanding) those subjects, each year, by the end of third grade. And that doing well in Reading at the third grade level is the best indicator of success for the remainder of their education. Education has to be made more relevant to the world of work, and compulsory education has utterly failed and continues to fail at this. In Michigan every Governor since 1970 has said in their State of the State Address that there is a gap between the quality of Education (Compulsory Education from age 6 to age 16 or or more recently 18, with intentions to reduce the minimum to 4 years old.) that is supplied by public education and what is needed by the state (the economy) to be internationally competitive. Compulsory education has failed to align what the student learns to what they will be doing in their life, to what they will be doing in the economy. I made up a little course about how to learn better and gave it to a fifth-grader, who was also being compelled to attend public school. I made my course free. Her school was not free (I am not talking about money here.). She completed the course. I learned a lot. The school increased the amount of homework for students in her class to three hours a night to improve test scores. She learned how to solve a math problem so tough CalTech Freshmen had uniformly failed to answer it the 1950\u2019s. She learned to solve similar problems more or less instantly. She learned what her Basic Purpose in life is. Before my course I asked her: \u201cCan you recall a time you were happy?\u201d She could not. Why should we oppose Compulsory Education? Let me outline my thoughts: Learning should have the benefit from what we know about being free, from what inevitably happens when learning or work, is enforced, or restrained. Learning freely may be three or more times as effective as compulsory education.Learning should be about things the student will use in their lives, about when they are contributing to the economy, about when their contributions are contributing to the kind of society that makes them happy.Learning should first of all be about how to learn, how the individual learns for their own uses, not only about what others want one to think, or how they want you to think.Learning should consult the understanding of the student. This is not being done. In a system using Social Promotion, it is not required that the student understand.One would think Compulsory Education should result in the student acquiring the ability to Read. According to a recent court case, ACLU vs Michigan State Board of Education, 2015, there is NO provision in the Constitution or complied laws, or the compulsory education laws that says the student has to learn to Read, or that the state is obligated to provide this. The state is required to fund, and the state is required to supply programs. It has no responsibility if the child does not learn to Read. If compulsory education does not do this, then why should we NOT oppose it? (Spending 20 billion dollars a year and wasting the time of 1.6 million students.)Learning should result in happiness.When Compulsory Education fails, we should not blame the lack of funding.When Happiness fails, we have every right to blame Compulsory Education.Best regards, Leon ",

            "answer_text": "Read the 10th Plank of the Communist Manifesto, which states \u201cFree public education for all the children\u201d. But what it really means is, government-run education, and \u201cpublic\u201d schools are in reality, government schools, because that's what they are! They are taxpayer-funded, and the government decides the curriculum and what they want your kids to learn. Taxpayer-funded = government-run. Am I against education? Absolutely not, and I believe all kids should be educated. In this respect, I support \u201ccompulsory\u201d education, that all should be educated and study hard. Are there good public schools? Sure. The problem is, since the government runs education, they decide what your kids learn. And schools have adopted \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies, which are disastrous. Why should students be punished for expressing interest in weapons? Additionally, students used to bring firearms to school all the time, but why not today? If firearms endanger our kids, why were there fewer school attacks when guns were allowed? The curriculum is another problem. Every student has different interests and strengths, but why are they all being pushed into the same system? Don't get me wrong, you get more options in HS, but not nearly as college. In college, you are allowed to be more specialized in what you do. Your classes depend on your degree program. A piano performance major does NOT have the same classes as a pre-med student. At the Juilliard School, for example, it's a specialized school for performing arts, and students are not FORCED to go there, but voluntarily do so, through a rigorous audition process. The classes there are specialized towards shaping them into artists and musicians. In other words, the students are permitted to specialize in what they do, and not be forced into one mold. Not to mention, colleges have a wide variety of classes to select. In contrast, elementary schools are too uniform in nature, where all students are forced to take the same classes. The worst method to raise a child is a one-size-fits-all approach. All kids are different, and this mass production approach has resulted in kids being diagnosed with various mental disorders simply because they don't fit. Many ADHD and Asperger's kids would do fine in non-conventional environments, such as arts music, etc. Their symptoms would become less bothersome and more of, say, a blessing. Same with gifted kids. Being placed among average peers holds them back and makes them bored. To summarize, the main issues with compulsory schooling are: One-size-fits-all approachGovernment run, which means students learn from government decided curriculum.",
