            "answer_text": "Let's see, you have a date of release. Mine was 6.19.2013, but I was granted a parole with the stipulation that I attend a domestic violence class. When the date arrived, I reported to the control center and was processed for release. I was issued clothes, a debit card with my money and paperwork. While I waited for my ride, the Detroit police arrived and took me into custody for a 10 year old warrant. I had just served 8, fucking BS. I was taken to jail, reprocessed, video arraigned and released the next morning. The last part isn't typical. Usually you have family or friends that can pick you up or you're given a bus ticket and a ride to the greyhound station. End of story ",
