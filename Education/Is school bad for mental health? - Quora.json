            "answer_text": "All personal questions about anxiety and depression, and in this case mental health, should be answered by a trained professional in a clinical setting. I can only give you my opinion based on my personal experience. My latest book \u2018Anxiety is not Depression - Questions and Answers\u2019 includes hundreds of answers I have written to questions here in Quora. This book is sold at below cost. I thought the same thing. I thought everyone was against me. First of all, school is an intense environment. In the US you have to be there until you are considered to be an adult. This can seem like incarceration. Second, it is a very large organization on a budget, with laws that regulate how schools are run. In order to run a large organization you need rules that everyone follows. The list goes on. Everything seems to be fixed. You can do this, You can\u2019t do that. You must do this, etc, etc. Large organizations simply cannot deal with an individual who does not fit into the framework. I had issues with anxiety and depression. The personality and intelligence tests they performed on me told them what I should be, a \u2018good\u2019 student, a leader. When I didn\u2019t perform that way they didn\u2019t know what to do and started playing with my head. They lectured me, threatened me, reported me to my parents, detained me, punished me, cajoled me, etc. Did this exacerbate my issues? Yes, definitely. I rebelled and got into trouble. It goes on. I wish I had someone to give me this advice. Start getting good grades ASAP. The reason why is that grades, your transcript is the only thing you are going to take with you when you leave school. Graduate, or you are hurting yourself. Separate your school life from your real life. Find a balance with something else that will enable you to tolerate school. Get evaluated for your \u2018mental health\u2019. Find out what\u2019s up. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s your life - not theirs. Don\u2019t let them get in your way. Get started. Take over your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Being in school is like being in a cage. So many restrictions are placed on your behavior that you eventually believe you are flawed somehow. To be praised, you have to follow someone else\u2019s script. Follow your own script and you are reprimanded. It\u2019s hard to come out of that with a positive self image. ",
