            "answer_text": "I really enjoyed being a school counselor! It is a Many faceted job! I worked in Middle school, and 6th grade was my favorite. I felt like I was \u201cmother\u201d to the 6th grade. I helped them with all kind of problems which became much deeper as time went on! I spent a lot of time on scheduling at the beginning of the school year. I changed a lot of schedules. I had to balance class sizes etc. for about 3 weeks I worked from at 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM. with a little time out to eat lunch and dinner and drive home because between 5\u201311 PM I was working from home. There was such a time crunch to have it all right and as many students as possible happy by the first day! The thing I disliked the most about being a school counselor was demanding parents who thought their child must get what they wanted regardless of what anyone else wanted. An example of this occurred my last year before retirement. A father came in the first day of school without an appointment and demanded that my clerk get him in to see me because he told her that there was a big error on his daughter\u2019s schedule because she didn\u2019t get her 1st choice of electives and her friend did. I told him I couldn\u2019t help him at the moment because the class was closed and the computer actually would not let me make the change. It could only be unlocked by the administrator who was in a meeting scheduled to last at least two hours so he plopped himself in the chair across from my desk stating he would not leave until he got what his daughter wanted. I had a boy in the waiting area with his mom crying because he was afraid of starting middle school. The teacher break room was right next to my office so I took the boy and his mom in there to talk with them. I got the boy feeling better and off to class then I reassured his mom that I would look for him at lunch to be sure he was ok which he was. The father was still sitting in my office so I went in and got my lap top and took it into the break room to work on other scheduling issues. That man sat there until near the end of the school day when the administrator returned to her office. She knew what was going on because I talked to her at lunch. The father said he wanted to file a complaint because I made him wait all day so she gave him a form to fill out, and when he handed it to her she ripped it up right in front of his face. She told him I was just doing my job and furthermore there was a waiting list for that class, and we would gladly add her to it! He was pissed and we had a good laugh. I digress from the question. There are many duties as a school counselor. I had to plan a huge awards banquet at the end of the year. It was almost like planning a wedding, and this was outside if school hours. I also planned a huge orientation for new students. the thing I liked the most about being a school counselor was helping the kids with their problems some seem trivial to adults, but they are very important to the kids, and they also had some really serious problems. to learn more watch for my book coming out in about 3 years (I hope).

            "answer_text": "Extraordinarily frustrating. I was a school counselor for all grades at one point or another. It has the potential to be an incredible, awesome, rewarding, and impactful job. BUT, administration has the school counselor handling schedules, special education, cumulative folders, response to intervention, and any other miscellaneous task they can\u2019t figure out who to give it to. The modern school counselor has a degree only slightly different than that of a counselor who can bill insurance. This means that most kids in this country have access, every school day, to a masters level mental health professional. Children are dying from suicide, drug overdoses, abuse, and school shootings. They cut. They suffer from eating disorders. They are abused and neglected. But administrators would rather the counselor take care of anything but the student. I remember a specific situation in which I was speaking with a second grade student, trying to decide if I needed to call social services due to possible abuse, while a staff member was trying to rush me to chair a special ed meeting. So, like I said, frustrating. And hard. Real hard sometimes. About once per school year I had to lock myself in my office or step outside the building to have a good cry. You can only hold it together for so long after working directly with a little girl who had been raped by her cousin. Or with another who was sexually assaulted by a neighbor boy\u2026only to meet with her older brother later who admitted to being raped by the same boy. But, as the school counselor, I helped all these kids. I helped the boy with rope burns around his neck and the girl with the cuts on her arms. I helped students through the deaths of parents, teachers, and pets. I taught hundreds of kids in classroom lessons. I could rant for a long time, but to sum it all up: It\u2019s a hard job, especially if you\u2019re there to help kids and not be an administrator. ",
