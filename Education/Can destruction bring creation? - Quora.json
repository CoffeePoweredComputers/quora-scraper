            "answer_text": "I think so. Nature gives humanity many examples where destruction creates something more beautiful and diverse. Think of the creation of a butterfly; the cocoon has to be broken before the butterfly can slip. Think of a new born baby, the amniotic sac has to rip before the most creative being on earth can emerge - a new human.  Destruction brings advance in many fields. Think of politics, economy and science. Sometimes the abolishment of a former believed political system and or a scientific idea opens your horizon and you suddenly find yourself confronted with an immense spectrum with new possibilities.  The aspect that is often forgotten is the time span that can lie in between the process of destruction and creation. A burnt field for example won't be able to bear crops in the following years. But in some years later the ashes will have a positive impact on the nutrients in the ground and a new landscape will have been created.  Lastly talking about personalities, destruction of weaknesses, misbeliefs and doubt will lead to a better and a more self-determined self.   ",

            "answer_text": "Everything is just a change of form. The substance is Energy. A dead body is different from a live body because the life energy is gone. Maggots thrive in the dead body, converting what they eat into Life again ! So destruction is just a push towards a change of form. A kind of space is created for new forms. That is the work of creation. Between these two events, there is another activity called preservation or sustenance of the embodied form of energy. These 3 forces are active everywhere and always. ",
