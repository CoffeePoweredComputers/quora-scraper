Climb trees as fast as possible. That\u2019s school. Everybody is different, but marks are given for certain tasks. If marks were given for climbing trees as fast as possible, then the monkeys would do really well. The elephants to pull out the trees - fail. The cheetahs who climb to the middle - they get Bs, Cs. The mice who make holes in the trees - also fail. The birds get to the top faster, but didn\u2019t climb - they get D or F depending on the tutor, sometimes A. Your job at school? Try your best. One day you will find your self worth and what you\u2019re really good at. Maybe you already know. ",
