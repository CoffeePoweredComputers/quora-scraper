            "answer_text": "Ofcourse they are. Practicals in class 12th are really important. They carry a lot of weightage in making up of your 12th marks. Unless you don't want to pull down your grades, you must learn to perform them so that you don't lose those precious marks. Also viva question are based on them and they can be deadly. I have seen my friends giving dumb answers because they did not pay any heed to practicals and this brought their total score down. So you must study them properly so that you can perform any experiment you're asked for. Therefore, they are really important in building up your total score. Hope this helps. :D ",
