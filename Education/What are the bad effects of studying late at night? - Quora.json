            "answer_text": "I am certainly the wrong person to ask that question! I always did my best studying late at night! There were fewer distractions and I could really sink into what I needed to learn. However, I knew how I would be studying, so I would typically have a nap in the afternoon or early evening. In order to learn, whether in the classroom or while studying, you have to have adequate rest. If you don\u2019t make sure you get enough proper sleep, your mental acuity will suffer - and it will not only be harder to retain what you study but even if you DO retain it, you won\u2019t be able to use that knowledge effectively during exams if you are operating through a fog of exhaustion. Another drawback is that most other people DON\u2019T do their studying then, so when I reached a point where I needed help, I didn\u2019t have anyone I could ask. The internet has changed that dramatically - but back in the dark ages (the BC era - Before Computers) I kept a note pad just for jotting down issues I needed help with so I would remember what I needed to ask the next day.

            "answer_text": "The disadvantages: Poor sleep quality due to intensive study late at night.Little retention of study material.Poor focus/short attention span.Greater vulnerability to distracting stimuli, thus resulting in poor quality produced, eye damage (not present in all cases).Holistically health declines- chances of heart disease, muscle deterioration, metabolic diseases increased.Diminished results of the healing process of sleep (less cells rejuvenated/restored/repaired).Possibility of failing to meet scheduled events throughout the day.Poor functioning the next day due to the lack of sleep; cognitive function impediment.Repeated process.It may feel like you\u2019re studying, but there\u2019s no point if you don\u2019t retain it. Why be inefficient when you can get greater results by studying in shorter periods more often? Better yet, health should always come first. ",
