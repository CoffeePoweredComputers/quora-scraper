            "answer_text": "It depends. Sorry about the trite answer. In a typical high school graduation (my experiences only) everyone walks in to the auditorium (or gym, football field) gets a program, sits down. Then, they play music (pomp and circumstance) the faculty comes in and sits (sometimes in their own gowns from college) then the graduates come in and sit. In no particular order they may do a convocation (prayer) the principal or emcee speaks. they do speeches from top two students and/or guest speaker, then call up students one at a time to give their diplomas. (it is usually a diploma cover, or rolled up scroll, they get the actual diploma the next day) The the principal or superintendent presents the students and they change the tassel from one side to the other. Then walk out to music. I went to my brothers graduation in Sacramento CA. They lined up at the base of the stage, half on each side, walked up the stairs, someone said their name, they walked to the principal and got the scroll, then walked down the front stair. With over 3000 graduates, it still took over two hours and every speech was short. Most boring graduation I\u2019d ever been to. My class was 76 students so the speeches were longer and extra music was played. I went to one where they did a slide show of all the kids when they were little. Sometimes yearbooks are passed out. Anyway, their will always be variations, but I say, the smaller the better. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically seniors, their sponsor, and administration work together to put on a gala event parents, family, friends, underclassmen, board, teachers, and staff will enjoy for graduation. Seniors will walk on stage to get their diploma and the principal certifies that in getting the diploma that seniors have the appropriate classes that the district and state requires. At that point seniors take the tassel from the right to the left, and just like that students have graduated from high school. ",
