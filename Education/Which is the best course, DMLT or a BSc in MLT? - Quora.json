            "answer_text": "BSc MLT indeed is good in the longer run. You'll have a bachelor's degree instead of a diploma certification. Even if you want to pursue a PG degree you'll need a bachelor's degree. BSc degree would cost you a year more than DMLT but it's good in the longer run as you can see in majority fields that the diploma graduates are being replaced by the bachelor graduates and the pay scale also varies.
