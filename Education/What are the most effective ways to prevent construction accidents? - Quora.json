            "answer_text": "Construction is dangerous work, no doubt.  There are some ways to prevent accidents, though. The 4 most common accidents in construction are: falls/tripselectrocutioncaught instruck byOne very important method that prevents falls is housekeeping.  Contractors with an organized and \"clean\" jobsite tend to have less accidents.  Electrical cords are put away neatly so nobody trips over them.  Ladders are put away when they aren't in use, or they are fastened properly to prevent tipping over.  Trash is put where it belongs to prevent it from causing tripping hazards and possibly electrical hazards.  Housecleaning prevents the majority of trips and falls. Another method of preventing falls is fall protection such as railings, or harnesses when workers are over 6 feet off of the ground.   Struck-by hazards include falling objects, flying objects, swinging objects, and struck-by hazards on the ground. One method to prevent objects from falling from work platforms is kickboards on the edges of the work platforms.  This is usually just a 2x4 fastened to the outside edge to prevent workers from slipping and to prevent tools from rolling off. A couple of very important methods to prevent struck-by accidents is to wear high visibility clothing and to be very aware of what is going on around you.  Equipment operators often have blind spots.  Workers need to stay out of these blind spots, whenever possible.  If you can't see the operator, they probably can't see you.  High visibility personal protective equipment such as vests help the operator to be able to see you better, but not when you are in their blind spot.   When working around heavy equipment keep your head on a swivel.  Listen to backup alarms.  Know where everyone is going.  If you have to walk behind a piece of operating equipment, get the operator to acknowledge that they see you before walking behind their equipment. Wear a hard hat and steel toed boots, if required, to prevent injury in the event that you are struck by something. The best way to avoid electrocution is to stay away from it if you don't have to be around it.  If you do have to be around it, be aware of the dangers.  Follow lock-out-tag-out procedures.  Let the professionals do the electrical work. Caught-in accidents can include confined spaces and trenches, for example.  Do not enter a confined space without proper training and without a \"buddy\" watching out for you.  Do not enter trenches unless it is stable and has a trench box, if necessary, with proper access and egress. I could go on all day, but these are a few ways to prevent construction accidents. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A In construction safety, almost all accidents boil down to personal responsibility, and common sense.  I have yet to find an accident in which one of these two elements is not present.  Almost always I try and explain the why of a safety rule at least once, a good time to do this is during your weekly/monthly/daily toolbox talks.  Pick the topic, explain the why.  Usually if someone understands the why, they can appreciate the common sense behind most personal safety choices.  I.E.  We don't smoke when filling up gas cans, because gas is flammable, and we don't want to be lit on fire.What I have found across many different jobsites, working with and around some pretty impressive companies with some very qualified safety professionals is that accidents happen when processes are unfamiliar, when personal safety choices are ignored or bypassed for convenience.I attended my OSHA 510 class in preparation for an OSHA 500 course later this year.  The week after I got back, I was working with a framing crew and since I started in the trades decided to throw on my toolbelt and help out.  I was nailing a top plate and had just finished explaining to one of the guys that we don't lean A-frame ladders against objects, we open up the frame when I proceeded to shoot a 3 1/4\" framing nail into my forearm.  I had the trigger depressed on a pas-lode nailer (which has a 3 finger trigger) when I was used to my hitachi (1 finger trigger).  When I nicked the top plate coming down I shot a nail almost 2 1/2\" into my arm.  Not my finest moment as a safety officer.  So, from personal experience, I was untrained with this particular piece of equipment, and I did not use it safely and so I got hurt.  Another, when I was in college I worked on a sprinkler crew installing landscape irrigation on campus. I didn't then as a habit wear eye protection.  I was spotting a trencher and we hit an old pepsi bottle buried in the ground from a previously installed system.  The chain of the trencher shot the glass into my eye before I could blink.  I spent the next 4 hours in various doctors offices and a great ophthalmologist took the glass out of my eye and lasered me right up.  So there, I was unaware that I needed eye protection, so I could plea ignorance, but my supervisors knew I should wear eye protection, and by god I wear it religiously now and encourage everyone around me to wear it.  If an employee is under my direct supervision and consistently does not wear their personal protective equipment (hardhat, vest, eye protection, gloves, welding helmet, etc.) I will tell them exactly once before I will no longer let them on my jobsite.  If you are not responsible enough to protect yourself, then I can never protect you.  I think that's what it comes down to eventually.  If you're not responsible, trained, sensible enough to work safely for yourself and be aware of your surroundings then no amount of safety officers or equipment protection devices will ever keep you safe.For more on this line of thinking, you might try looking up Mike Rowe's video on \"safety third\" where he talks about common sense and personal responsibility.
