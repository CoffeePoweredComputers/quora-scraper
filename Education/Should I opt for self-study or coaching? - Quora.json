For example i did not take coaching in my first attempt and i grabbed Inspector (CE) POST. Next year i took coaching of maths to improve my rank however, i scored only 9 marks more than the previous one. Also my marks in English section got reduced by 10 marks due to giving more time to maths at cost of English. So my advice would be if u can afford study seriously for 8 hours per day at home then u Should go for self study. You can go for coaching in following cases: If u think you are weak in one particular subject like maths for me.If your basics are not clear.If you are taking much time in solving practice papers.Hope it helps! Good luck. ",
