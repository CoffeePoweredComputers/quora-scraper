            "answer_text": "I come from an era (60's) when my public high school in a small remote Minnesota town prepared me very well for college. In fact, in the era before AP courses, I was able to bypass several of the required college courses, languages and writing, due to the test scores I received on entry tests like CLEP. Here's why. I was taught mostly by teachers who themselves had been educated in the 30's and 40's. Many of them were veterans of WWII who had used the GI Bill to get teaching certification. They were content-oriented rather than process oriented, so math courses were hard, physics courses were as challenging as college courses and the expectations were that students would study many hours each evening or, in my case, early in the morning. I realized that it had worked when I received my ACT and SAT scores and started to get scholarship offers from colleges. I was not unique in this. In my close group of friends, many went on to competitive colleges and pursued careers in medicine, law, higher education, and related professions.  That very same high school struggles in 2015 to meet state testing standards and definitely leaves children behind. Some of that is due to educational changes but most is probably because of incredible social changes: single-parent families as the norm, crystal meth, movement of former labor middle class positions into lower class just-above minimum wage jobs.  I would hesitate to raise children of my own in the community where I received an education and background that served me well in college and beyond. ",

            "answer_text": "I was very well prepared for history and writing classes, but I was not nearly as prepared for science and mathematics. I went to two different high schools, and in my first one, my algebra teacher told me that I should not try to achieve anything higher than a C, because as a girl I was naturally going to be bad at math and I wouldn't need it in life anyway. My geometry teacher was very difficult to understand, and he refused to stay after to help struggling students because he was a coach. My parents didn't worry, because I was passing my classes. I didn't know that I wouldn't have a strong enough foundation to understand higher level math. In my other high school math classes, all I had to do was apply the steps as taught, and I could get As.  When I got to college, the science classes required math skills I didn't possess, and I couldn't even do the first homework assignment in my first college math class. I ended up going to tutoring twice a week in order to learn the math so I could be successful.  I ended up enjoying math very much once I understood the principles behind the processes. It also made my science classes much easier. My son is in college right now. He was very well prepared for the content of college courses, but he wasn't as prepared for the freedom. He discovered very quickly that professors don't care if you read the text or not. It isn't their problem that you aren't prepared. In high school, students are given study guides, review sessions in class, and multitudes of other types of assistance to ensure that every child is as ready as possible to pass that test. For higher level students, it just ensures they get perfect scores. That doesn't prepare them for college...It just helps them get in. ",
