            "answer_text": "That they are not your second home . Yes they are not your home as many teachers and parents may say . And the teachers are not secondary / third / special parents , Ok . This bullshit propaganda has been used to motivate students to feel comfortable at school and so that teachers become more approachable . Teachers are there to help students understand concepts , become your question bank and possibly clear doubts . They are not directly responsible for an students behaviour , actions or language as parents are . If you behave irresponsibly, distract your class , have anger issues or any other problems , its not because of your teachers influence , its because of your environement at home . They are not responsible or required to make sure that their students basic needs are met . Your teacher is not supposed to make sure that you come with all the materials neccesary for class . They are not supposed to ensure that you have shelter , food , eduacation and all other necessities your parents are to care for . Next a school is not your home . A school has it's own set of rules and guidelines whereas at home an student is free to do whatever he/she likes to do with their guardian's or parent's permission . You do not have an \u201c uniform or dress code \u201c at home unless because of your beliefs . You do not have to do everything on time in a certain way at home . A school , public or private , gives no or hardly any say in decision making . At your home you have an decent say on what happens . I have seen it happen . Our school ( name not mentioned due to privacy ) had conducted \u201csurveys\u201d to make \u201cour opinion\u201d be highlighted and agreed to . Before summer break an survey was conducted about whether the corridors should be repainted or our class rooms . Out of the 6 sections 5 voted classrooms . Seriously their are tape , pen , marker , stipex , uneven blobs of paint and such a poor colour choice on the walls . The floor tiles are at least neat . On 5 consecutive field trips , We had an option movies or water park per grade . Out of the 8 sections , always an vote of 0 movies : 8 water park and guess what we went to some shitty movie in some poor quality cinema . It not an matter of entitlement but when you have voted and not delivered to it you will get negative responses . Sorry for the rant but I have seen such things happen all over Middle East and India . They raise your hopes with promises and later break them . So 1) Schools are not your second home 2) Teachers are not your secondary parent 3) Schools don't give a shit about their students . ",

            "answer_text": "Schools can give you a leg up in realizing that there are decisions in everything in life. It can help you communicate better, understand math, and even develop social traits that can help us advance through life\u2019s events. With all of that, you need to mix a cup of common sense, two cups of compassion, and a whole lot of listening to others to really reach where you want to go. ",
