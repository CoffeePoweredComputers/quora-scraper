            "answer_text": "To me \u2018school activities\u2019 means school life. A school is a community, the question is what kind of community. Is it one in which our children are obedient, passive, competitive, objects for training and measurement? Or is it one that reflects what values we claim are important in our adult communities, equality, respect, democracy, justice\u2026 As the New Ideals in Education community stated from 1914 onwards, and Earl Lytton stated in pushing the second reading of the H.A.L. Fisher Education Act 1918, that our schools should reflect, express and develop our concepts of freedom and humanity. Participation is vital in our schools for our children to express and develop their humanity, and for us to have a society founded on freedom, democracy, justice and equality. ",
