            "answer_text": "Maybe the biggest problem for the growth of the language community of Esperanto are the misperceptions about it. So try to help against them, inform people about Esperanto. Write to newspapers when they misinformed about Esperanto. Inform the Esperanto community about texts with misinformation, so that others can write to them as well. I wrote \u201cinform people about Esperanto\u201d and I mean: about the language Esperanto. Leave them in peace with any ideas about a general introduction of Esperanto. This is rather difficult, as this leads to discussions. Other people may have other opinions. They won\u2019t enjoy the discussion. To bother with discussions about that subject is just not necessary. Even if you convince someone about the need to introduce Esperanto - will that change anything in the real world? The interests of the language lobbies are against Esperanto, probably we do not have any chance at the moment. On the other hand, we have a good chance to win more people to learn and speak Esperanto. Esperanto is now offered on more than fifty learning websites (Listo de ofertataj Esperanto-lerniloj - Vikipedio) - so people are more and more aware that Esperanto exists. What is necessary to get more people learn Esperanto, is information and the removal of misperceptions. So, please, if you want to help the Esperanto community to grow, help to remove the misperceptions. When you do it, respect the rules for debunking, see The Debunking Handbook: now freely available for download . It\u2019s not a \u201cbook\u201d, it\u2019s just 9 pages, you\u2019ll read it quickly. Main thing: Put the correct information on top (or in the beginning) and at the end of what you say or write. Try not to repeat the error. If you have to repeat the error, put a \u201cthe following is false\u201d or similar immediately before it. Try to use the trick with \u201cnot\u201d, a word which is not very well understood by our mind. So it seems better to write that the others said, Esperanto would \u201cnot be a living language\u201d. Do not express this idea without \u201cnot\u201d, with the contrary of \u201cliving\u201d. - Don\u2019t forget to repeat the correct information after this. It\u2019s not easy to make an estimation about the number of Esperanto speakers, but probably some hundred thousand people are using Esperanto regularly (I mean, at least once a year). It is the native language for more than thousand people. Probably some million people learned at least the basics of Esperanto. So it\u2019s astonishing, that some people still believe the error that no one speaks Esperanto, even some linguists (not very familiar with Esperanto). This is completely false. Up to now there have been at least ten thousand Esperanto books published; every year there are at least 120 new books. Yet even some linguists have the misperception that there is no Esperanto literature. For them this is a logical conclusion - no speakers, no literature. But the contrary is true: Because there are speakers, there is a literature which has its authors and its readers. There are more than three thousand Esperanto songs with text available on the internet. There are some hundred theatre plays in Esperanto, there are many thousand Esperanto videos on youtube. All this is part of the Esperanto culture. Only people not familiar with Esperanto think that this doesn\u2019t exist. They are just wrong - they live in a sort of \u201cparallel world\u201d, where all these Esperanto things don\u2019t exist. There are some more misbeliefs about Esperanto. Maybe the most dangerous one is the thought that Esperanto was created only to serve as a general international language. This is false. Zamenhof clearly put as one of his goals, Dr. Esperanto's International Language : To enable the learner to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality, whether the language be universally accepted or not; in other words, the language is to be directly a means of international communication. So the fact that we all speak Esperanto and are happy with this, is not just a little thing, because the big thing didn\u2019t succeed - it\u2019s one of the uses Esperanto was made for. It is not our task to make the world happy. It is the task of the others to do what is necessary to make them happy. If they do not want to learn Esperanto, if politicians do not want to help its spreading, if people do not want to help the movement for the spreading of Esperanto - well, this is their decision. If they do not want to do this, no reason for us to be unhappy. We just use Esperanto, we are ready to inform others about the language - but I do not see any reason, why I should make out of the decisions of others a cause for me not to fully enjoy this wonderful language without any regret that the number of speakers is still relatively small. (One main reason for this is the misinformation going around.) As a language Esperanto is very successful. Maybe it has even the most successful language community in human history: In 1887 there was just Zamenhof and some family members who spoke Esperanto. Esperanto had the smallest language community out of about 7,000 languages. Now you usually find Esperanto between the first 5o languages of the world. No other language had such a success. But some people still do ignore the reality. I just came across a scientific article where two professors for accounting, Stella Fearnley and Shyam Sunder, spoke about Esperanto as a \u201cfailed\u201d language. http://faculty.som.yale.edu/shyamsunder/research/accounting%20and%20control/published%20articles/131.global%20reporting%20standards%20esperanto/standards-esperantopub.pdf A tale from this parallel world I spoke about :-D They just mixed up the two concepts of the language on one hand and the movement for introducing the language as a general international language on the other hand. They obviously also didn\u2019t understand how Esperanto works: \u201cDevelopment is bottom-up, driven by users of language, not top-down, controlled by lexicographers. Esperanto failed because its promoters ignored the fundamental nature of language in their search for uniformity.\u201d Here Fearnley and Sunder ignored that the development of Esperanto is driven by the users of the language and certainly not \u201ccontrolled\u201d by lexicographers (even if they have some influence as in every language). I was a bit surprised about this presentation, as Shyam Sunder is professor at the Yale School of Management. Probably they got their information about Esperanto from hearsay and they didn\u2019t check the facts. It is very difficult for us who know the Esperanto community to understand that other people, living nearby, reading similar newspapers, really think that Esperanto is not a living language. But, as a friend of mine said, for some people the fact that no one speaks Esperanto is so true as the fact that in the summer it\u2019s usually warmer than in the winter. I think, it\u2019s as obvious as the fact that the sun turns around the earth :-) It will take a lot of time to inform all linguists about the true state of Esperanto, to inform scientists and journalists and teachers and all the rest of the population. But this is a task that has to be done. Every little step helps - and information of people who write articles, scientists and journalists, helps even more. As I said: Don\u2019t loose your time to convince anyone about the value of Esperanto as a general international language - just inform them about what is today. Things that can be easily seen and veryfied on the internet. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. ",

            "answer_text": "Esperanto's growth will inevitably be a very gradual process, but already this growth has accelerated enormously in recent years thanks to the Internet. The vast majority of people in the world have never heard of the language and most of those who have heard of it have heard of it only so fleetingly that they believe that it has died out. However, as more and more people discover it, use it, tell other people about it, it should gradually penetrate the universal consciousness of the world in the same way as many other ideas have succeeded in becoming known and accepted and adopted, albeit over a long period of time. The breakthrough could come when international organisations such as the European Union and the United Nations realise how cumbersome and expensive it is to operate using many official languages, all of which would be superfluous if Esperanto were adopted as an official auxiliary language for those who do not share the same mother tongue this could mean that all discussions and documentation could be handled in just one language which would be an enormous increase in efficiency, comprehension and clarity. So the brief answer to the question is to learn the language, talk about it, write about it and use it. ",
