My dad forced me to take up state board as the choice . I didn\u2019t had any other option. let me tell you that Karnataka pu board and cbse 12& 11 th board prefer same books NCERT TEXT BOOKS , except languages (english & regional language ) no regional language in cbse board . some language teachers are so worst they just keep on telling some cock & bull stories never finish the syllabus on time , there's no importance for grammar section in 10 th grade(barely, 10 marks for grammar , 10 marks for letter writing, 25 for essay writing) but, in 2nd pu there is no essay writing some shit grammar that u would have never heard during your school days if studied icse syllabus . Karnataka PU exam paper leak: All you need to knowpaper gets leaked since ages , students are allowed to copy during final examination in some rular.any decisions may be taken regarding syllabus or exam pattern ,may not be shocked but even before 1 month gap for annual examinations PU science 'blow-up' syllabus junkedthey just play in your life (the invigilator who corrects your annual exam papers II PU students may not get grace marks for maths paperPU results: Top two ranks in science stream change after revaluationits all left to you , whether u would like to go for cbse syllabus or state boardi prefer you to choose cbse syllabus .",
