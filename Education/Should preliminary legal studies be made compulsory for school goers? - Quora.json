            "answer_text": "Should preliminary legal studies be made compulsory for school goers? Without question. As one who became a legal professional later in life, I really like this question. I have believed for years that school goers should receive some sort of legal education. For me, the entirety of my legal experience, starting with paralegal school and continuing through several years of completing legal work for attorneys in multiple legal specialties, gave me a far superior education than I received in thirteen years of public school and four years of college. Law honed my critical thinking and analytical skills. It improved my comprehension, writing and communication abilities. I collected an enormous amount of knowledge. I learned a great deal about people, with much of it not being good. In short, I grew significantly, thanks to law. I am a proud beneficiary of that growth. As an estate planning, probate and elder law paralegal, I absorbed a great deal of knowledge. I leaned upon that knowledge years later when my parent could no longer handle her affairs. From estate planning work I knew all about powers of attorney and how to act as my parent\u2019s agent. Later, when my parent passed and I served as personal representative of her estate and trustee of several trusts, I picked up from where I left off seventeen years after leaving my estates and elder law firm. I completed nearly all the work myself to probate my parent\u2019s very complex estate. I needed little help from counsel. My accountant helped me with the financial and tax aspects of my parent\u2019s estate. At some point, a person can be injured on the job. Workers\u2019 Compensation law can be extremely complicated and convoluted - way above the pay grade of most people. Cases can require an attorney in many instances. If one learned about workers\u2019 comp basics in a preliminary legal studies course, one would have grasped the rudiments of workers\u2019 comp sufficient to speak intelligently with an attorney if s/he is injured at work. Exposure to the legal reasoning process, learning about sources of law, the various legal specialties, how law works and receiving practical legal education applicable to the entire life cycle together with the critical thinking skills acquired through the study of law is empowering. But, no, taking preliminary legal studies courses would not equip a person to play lawyer - simply to know when to call one, how to speak to one and to understand the legal process. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe it should be part of the curriculum for anyone who thinks of themselves as educated. It is important to know the world in which we live; how it is governed (and why), and why and what laws are made. There are historical factors students should know, as well. In today\u2019s world, fewer and fewer students, at least in the USA, know the geography of the world and how it affects law and civics. For example, there are no laws about shoveling snow off your walkway in Madagascar, and no laws about flooding in the Atacama Desert. Fewer and fewer students know the primary documents of this or any country, which means that it is easier to be misled by those with the loudest voices. We can begin with the easy stuff, like where you live and why you cross the street where you do and with the light. From there, gradually encompass the state or province, the country, travel and language, documents, and why they include what they include. If you mean should any person be able to be their own lawyer, then\u2026no. But know when you need one and for what purposes. It is important to know both your rights and your responsibilities and when they are being compromised. ",
