            "answer_text": "My high school, and my elementary school for that matter, should have taught us how to talk about sex. We were taught sex ed from about grade 6 upward usually as a part of either health class or phys ed class and usually those were one in the same. We had quite comprehensive education, being in Canada, when it came to childbirth, birth control methods and contraception, and STD\u2019s, now more commonly referred to as STI\u2019s, anatomy, reproductive anatomy and sex itself. But the manner in which it was taught was most often by a red faced teacher at the front of the room reciting facts and handing out sheets of paper and using Velcro on parts and pointer sticks pointing at charts and playing birthing videos and PBS after school specials that teach us the dangers of teen pregnancies and herpies. We were to submit our questions into the question box either at the beginning or the end of class anonymously because God forbid someone voice a real concern out loud at the time it occurs to them or at the time it is actually relevant in class. After a certain age sex ed was taught separately to males and females because, as we all know, this is an issue that happens in isolation and never together between the sexes so we shouldn't concern ourselves with learning about each other's issues or questions. As a result we were taught to be embarrassed to speak of these things, not only around each other, but around grown ups who had the information we needed, and around people of the opposite sex with whom many of us would be engaging in sexual activity. So, even though we had the statistics and information we needed, which is much more than many schools in many countries, we were mortified to actually discuss it when the time came. This is almost as dangerous as not teaching it at all. I have some friends who, to this day, still get embarrassed to speak about sex. Luckily for me, my own mother used to teach sex ed and brought home her full lesson plan including the Velcro on parts. She had condom talks at dinner when we had friends over!! And she felt the need to educate most of my girlfriends about tampons when summer rolled around - a fact none of them have ever let me live down. I thought she was deliberately trying to ruin my life - as most teenagers think of their parents lol. But I quickly realized she was saving it. If it weren't for my mother sticking her neck out and embarrassing the hell out of me and the entire neighbourhood we could have all ended up much worse off. Instead, my friends and my sisters friends often came to us for advice and even to our mom and some still do. They now come more for relationship advice and pregnancy advice but they still come. This is practically unheard of. And we will be forever grateful. I also find it interesting in our society, while writing this I discovered that my iPad readily recognizes the word \u201cfuck\u201d but not the word \u201cherpes\u201d. It also recognizes the word \u201cKardashian\u201d which is disturbing on a whole other level\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "So my high school sex ed was in a semester course called Life Skills, where the teacher had to cover: Drugs and alcoholCoping skillsMental illnessCollege planningBudgetingSex edAll in a semester. Because of this really packed schedule, we didn't learn much. I ended up taking another semester of what was essentially sex ed (but wasn't required) when I was in high school, and I learned so much more. Between that and Quora, I think I've had a pretty thorough sex education. Here's what didn't get covered in that first semester: Enthusiastic, informed consent I'm fairly sure we got the \u201cif they're drunk, they can't consent\u201d type of talk, but we never heard what consent can and should look like, and that it can be revoked at any time. Types of contraception I learned that condoms exist, thanks to our guest speaker from the health center, and that there are birth control pills but we didn't discuss them in depth in any way. I didn't think that, as a woman, I had a lot of options. Now I know that there are tons and tons of kinds of birth control, and that I'm not helpless as a woman. I also never got to put a condom on produce, so it's not as much that I learned less because of this, but that I feel I missed out on some fun. Sexuality We were never taught against any sexual orientation; we just never discussed it. Contraception and safe sex take different forms in different combination of genders, and that has to be taught. We got the general lesson for heterosexual kids, or people having sex with others of that genital setup. This is why I didn't know I was bisexual until high school- no one told me I could be! Everything about relationships that one would learn in a Franklin Veaux answer Polyamory? That relationships are entirely optional and you don't have a right to someone? That all sex is normal? That sex isn't shameful and shouldn't be hard to talk about? Yep. None of it. But we should've. It's amazing how much healthier my views on relationships have gotten since joining Quora. ",
