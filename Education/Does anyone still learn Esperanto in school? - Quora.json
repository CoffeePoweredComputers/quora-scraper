            "answer_text": "Yes, in many schools around the world. I know that Esperanto is taught in some schools in China, and in UK they have the project Springboard to Languages, Esperanto, explained in this video:  The principal of an elementary school in Taiyuan, capital of the Chinese province Shanxi, told me that before the students had to spend much time studying English, and the results were disappointing. Since they started learning Esperanto first and then English, the students started getting better grades in English and also in other disciplines (most probably because they are not so focused in English as before).

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately there are few schools that teach Esperanto around the world. In China several universities teach Esperanto. In Hungary, Esperanto is chosen among the two languages that are necessary to know in order to get a diploma. Students choose Esperanto, because they know that they need much less study-time in order to pass the test. In the USA there has been a university-intensive-summer course for about 50 years. The first 30 years it was at San Francisco University. Then it moved to several other universities. The last few years at William Peace University in Raleigh, North Carolina. The next one would be from June 28th, 2020, (arrival of students) to July 4th (departure). Classes will be held from June 29th to July 3rd.
