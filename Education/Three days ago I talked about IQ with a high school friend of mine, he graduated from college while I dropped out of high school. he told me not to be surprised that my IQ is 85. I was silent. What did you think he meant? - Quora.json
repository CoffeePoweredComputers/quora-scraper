Let' s assume he is right, I am not for one second suggesting he might be, but let's just say he was. When I was 18 years of age I was tested & scored coincidentally 85. That was before I obtained Craft skills. Long before I went to university. Long before I went back to university. Before I'd acquired a lot of life skills & professional career, which at a younger age, wouldn't have even dreamed about. Twenty five years later, the test was re-applied (serruptitiously in what is known as a 'blind' experiment) by a chartered Psychologist. I scored nearly double 160. So even if he was right & it was true (which I honestly do not believe), IQ is not fixed, it is fluid. After a person has acquired life skills, their IQ likely be much higher. My advice: move on, high school is history. That was then, this is now. BELIEVE in yourself: Go back to college & prove him wrong! A Degree is not for people who have high IQ's, but through undergraduate study , one's IQ grows. Peace & All Good ",

Generally speaking, ignore data and discussion of IQ. IQ is NOT what matters. OQ.
