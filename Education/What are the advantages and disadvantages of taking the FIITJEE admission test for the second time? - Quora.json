In my first attempt i was in 10th as I am belongs to lower middle class family I filled the application form of fortunate 40 (Fiitj\u00e9e scheme for financially weak students) and I was offered 100 percent Scholorship in Fiitj\u00e9e south Delhi centre but unfortunately not joined it because of some valid reasons .. So as like you I was thinking during filling application form in 13th (dropper) about the benefits of previous test \u2026\u2026 But in this time I was offered 65 percent Scholorship this time \u2026stop \u2026before concluding something \u2026the highest percent of Scholorship was 75 . Now you can conclude. In my opinion(advantage and disadvantage) there is no relation between your previous results with new one . Thank you , ",
