            "answer_text": "Ask people. If you want to take a job after graduating, talk to your seniors in various companies about the kind of work they do, what technologies they work on, what skills they require and so on. Ask your recruiters themselves what role they are hiring for. Try to drill down into specifics. Ask them what team they are leading and where they plan to fit you in. They will appreciate the interest and passion that you are showing and the fact that you aren't just another fresher who will settle for any job that pays a decent salary. Introspect about which subjects in CS you truly enjoyed. Did you like Algorithms? Well, every software company requires a decent understanding of that subject. The \"dream companies\" like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. will test you primarily on Algorithms and Data Structures. They require a deep understanding and mastery of these subjects. If you liked hardware, computer architecture, microprocessors, operating systems, look for companies developing embedded software (ST Microelectronics, Samsung, Robert Bosch etc.). You will be exposed to the internal nuts and bolts of complex systems and get an opportunity to work on system software. For computer networks, you have Cisco, Novell, Bell Labs etc. Operating systems - Microsoft, Sun Microsystems. E-business software - Trilogy, Oracle. EDA - Synopsys, Cadence, Mentor Graphics. EDA is a great field where you get to work with beautiful algorithms that operate on transforming hardware designs. I'm sure you can find out more through Googling and asking around. If you truly have a passion for CS, the best idea would be to go for further studies, preferably a Ph.D program. If you have done good project work with a Professor and published something, you have a good chance. That will be your best bet to explore the subject, since you will get to work on a field of your choice, and tackle a research problem that no one else has solved. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "You're approaching this backwards.  You're starting with the masters as the ultimate goal and working backwards to justify it.  Instead you should be considering getting a masters only when you've worked enough to know what you want to pursue and know that a masters will be necessary to achieve it.   Maybe you'll graduate and start working and find out you like what you're doing just fine.  Maybe you'll find out you hate tech work in general and switch careers entirely.  You'd be surprised how often that happens! Anyways- the point is if you have to ask what masters degree to pursue, a masters isn't for you.  It will be really obvious to you once that degree is necessary. Stop worrying and work on your undergrad. ",

Analyse to the level, whether it was learning the concept or getting the work done with specifics of the subject you dug into. Another advice is to go deep/advanced into the study of that field and keep a check on your interest level.  Keep doing this for some months, while exploring different fields. Then read it and identify the moments you felt most joyous in, even more excellent if these moments are while you were studying advanced concepts in a field.  Help you, this should, young Jedi. ",

[The rest of this answer is directed to those who are pursuing a BS or equivalent in CS.]  An undergraduate degree is only intended to survey the state of knowledge in your field of study. Getting familiar with and developing an interest in many different areas is a good strategy. If you decide to do graduate work, your advisor can guide you to areas of active research that might lead to employment in a specific field. But when you graduate with a BS, your first and only job is to find full time employment. You can focus on places that do the work you happen to be interested in, and choose which offers you will accept, but the actual work you do is going to be up to your employer. ",

Computer Science is fun after all :) ",
