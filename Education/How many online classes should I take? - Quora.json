            "answer_text": "Do you mean in self-directed learning, such as MOOCs? You can enroll in as many as you like and have the time for. Be aware, though, that the commitment can become overwhelming, especially if you have not studied online before. You will receive a welcome email from each course, and usually follow-up emails as well. I would recommend taking just one or two at first, so you can see how well they fit into your life. One time, I enthusiastically enrolled in 6 courses at once. I found it very difficult to keep track of them all, and actually forgot to finish one of them! These days, many MOOCs are self-paced or have very flexible deadlines so if you have a busy week, you can catch up the next week. On the other hand, it\u2019s easy to fall behind because there are no hard deadlines. It takes some self-motivation. ",
