            "answer_text": "I have lots of happy memories, I don't know what specifically your question is about, I remember the time during summer vacation we use to go to our grandparent's place and all our cousins use to come over as well. We used to tell stories to each other and enjoy a lot. I remember my grandmother has asked everyone of to study for 2 hrs daily and all my cousins including me use to sit at 7pm to 9pm together and trying to studying and ending up gossiping or dozing off. As my father has a transferable job, I had to change my school every 3 year and to go a different place, make new friends. I didn't like that then but now I enjoy moving to a new place. I love dancing and singing, I used to always participate in every co curricular activity in my school. I'm was the teacher's favourite student. I was good in academics also in school. ",
