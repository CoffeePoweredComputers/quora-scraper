            "answer_text": "I used to search the same thing just one year ago- \u201cWhat are some good IA topics for Math HL?\u201d. But in the end, my IA topic wasn\u2019t from any of the mentioned topics on the sites or web pages. It was purely based on my interest in a unique probability problem and I expanded it from there. I suggest you do the same thing - find something that truly intrigues you. Since you prefer calculus, just search problems/interesting applications of calculus on the internet. And if you find something there you can delve deeper into it and explore it for your IA. I think this would be the best option. You already are interested in the math surrounding orbital trajectories and intercepts, so you can probably search for calculus applications in that. However, if you need a little starting point then you can maybe give these ideas a try, all are calculus related (they are already given on other websites): Surface area of egg/ water bottleDistance of a curved pathCalculating probability using 3D graphs (that\u2019s what I did)Hope this helps! If you have other questions just ask! Good Luck with your IA! :D ",
