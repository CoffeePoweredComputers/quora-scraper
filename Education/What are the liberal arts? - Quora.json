            "answer_text": "From Wikipedia (Liberal arts education): The liberal arts (Latin: artes liberales) are those subjects or skills that in classical antiquity were considered essential for a free person (Latin: liberalis, \"worthy of a free person\") to know in order to take an active part in civic life, something that (for Ancient Greece) included participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military service. Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were the core liberal arts, while arithmetic, geometry, the theory of music, and astronomy also played a (somewhat lesser) part in education. Notably, it generally excludes the technical arts necessary for a particular profession, or which are not generally necessary for civic life. The \u201cliberal arts\u201d are often wrongly conflated with the \u201chumanities\u201d; while the two categories overlap, the latter excludes the natural and social sciences that are properly included in the former. In today\u2019s world, the list of \u201csubjects or skills essential for a person to know in order to take an active part in civic life\u201d has likely expanded to include Englishlogicethics / history of philosophycivics / governmenthistory (American and international, including history of religion)biology (including some basics of public health)mathematics (excluding calculus, including statistics)technological fluency (not necessarily including programming)economics (micro- and macro-) / game theorypsychologyIn the category of \u201coptional, but still arts worthy of a free person to study\u201d: fine artsother languageslinguisticsliteratureother natural sciencesother mathematics, including theory of computationSkills which I believe are properly excluded from the liberal arts include engineering, programming, accounting, marketing, finance, nursing, specialized legal studies, specialized medical studies.

            "answer_text": "Liberal Arts is a multidisciplinary system of education that includes a diverse mix of subjects from various disciplines including humanities, sciences, commerce, and technology. One can say that Liberal Arts is the disruption in the field of education in India, however, there is a huge lack of awareness about the scope and benefits of such a program. This blog aims to provide all the information about the program. The Liberal Arts curriculum provides a learning experience that empowers students with the skills to deal with change, diversity, and complexity, to make them problem solvers, critical thinkers and responsible members of the society. It gives you the flexibility to design your degree. The program is such enormously diverse that it allows you to combine research and academic-focused programs in the fields of Physics, Biology, Mathematics Economics, Public Relations, Archaeology, Advertising, Public Policy, Sociology, Training & HR, Psychology, International Relations, Academics, Social Work, Civil Services, Journalism/Media/Mass Communication, Corporate Communications, Research and Writing & many more.
