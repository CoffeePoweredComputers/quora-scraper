            "answer_text": "The most important reform we could make in public education is to align what we teach, and how it is taught, with the insights offered through the sciences of neurobiology, developmental psychology, and neurodevelopmental psychology. Compared to twenty years ago, we know exponentially more about how humans naturally learn, how children learn, what is likely to promote learning, and what is almost certain to inhibit it. Here are some changes I would suggest in the light of new understanding. Don't misinterpret this as an argument against rigor: 1. Failure should never be stigmatized. In a way, it should be encouraged. People learn by making mistakes. Lack of effort is what teachers need to be concerned with. Those who fail more will often end up learning more. 2. The time element for learning must be minimized. People learn in different ways, at different speeds. and at different speeds for different subjects. Some people take more time to learn something but they learn it more completely. They can generalize what they have learned and apply unifying principles to other matters. Perhaps they have made more mistakes and those mistakes have contributed to learning more deeply. This implies that grade levels need to be eliminated. If one person has been accessed to have learned what he or she needs to know, they graduate. If another takes an extra year, it is unimportant. Passing scores, however, need to be close to 100% for all students. 3. Play needs to be re-associated with learning. Play should not be a reward for the work of learning. Learning should be, as much as is possible, enjoyable. Even learning the times-tables (rote learning) can be made more fun. To assess whether the learning in a classroom is being disassociated from fun, assess the level of curiosity. Incurious children, and adults, learn only what they feel they need to, to get to where they feel they need to go. In school that means grades. The likelihood of the kind of deep learning that results in the student mastering a subject tends to be directly proportional to the driving force of learning; curiosity. It is not natural for the level of curiosity in children to tend to diminish in public school from Grade One onward. 4. Learning to connect the dots is more important than accumulating dots. By dots I am referring to factoids, or the quanta of data or information, such as the USA entered World War II in 1941. We have a public education system that has evolved little from its 19th century roots. In fact, with the present obsession with high-stakes testing, rote learning has come back into vogue. We are back in the 19th century. The attempt to roll back the, so called, \u201cradical educational experiments\u201d of the nineteen sixties have succeeded. That needs to be reversed. Minimal rote leaning might be occasionally needed to prime the educational pump, but it is so much more beneficial to learn facts as a by-product of learning methodology. In other words, learning general principals seems to naturally precede learning details for our species. The key skill taught in school, therefore, should be methodology for how to determine what you need to know to get a task done, and how to access that information. You can find out in less than a minute which English king ordered the waves to retreat by googling the question. Knowing what that tale implies, that is deciphering its meaning, and understanding how that lesson can apply to life in the present; that is learning from history as opposed to merely learning history. That is also a higher form of intelligence, often referred to as \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d, while specific or specialized intelligence is what we are already beginning to get from A.I. computation and falls far short of the intellectual capacities that humans are born with. 5. Homework and cramming need to be eliminated or minimized. Or homework should become schoolwork. Since so much of the average school day is demonstrably nonproductive in terms of true learning - meaning the kind of learning that lasts longer than a few days after a student has taken a high-stakes test - most of what is now homework could be done within a seven hour school day. Educators and parents need to recognize that non-school activities, peer socializing, and just unstructured knocking about, can be as conducive to learning as being in a structured classroom. 6. It's not that there is too much nor that there is not enough structure in today's classroom. Its the kind of structure that matters. Students have to be allowed to take tangents and long-cuts. Students have to be not just allowed but encouraged to question assumptions and fundamental premises. To challenge conventional thinking and the 'consensual reality' is a human and student right, perhaps even a duty. This defines a natural process for human learning and results in new discoveries for the student, It even occasionally results in new insights or discoveries for the rest of us as well. Incorporating the process of individual discovery into a curriculum should be a no-brainer. If students are allowed the time to play around within a given project they will find out who they are and how they learn largely, although not entirely, on their own. Certainly there are times when minimum supervision is for the good. The structure within a classroom needs to accommodate not just the various ways people learn but the fact that it is play more than necessity that is really the mother of invention. 7. Tests should be only one instrument of assessment, and as much for assessing the teaching as the learning. Since it is the process of learning, and the process of thinking, that is most important (again connecting dots rather than accumulating dots) that is what most needs to be assessed. The student's teacher, not the test creator, is best equipped to assess that. This implies class sizes small enough and enough one-to-one time for a teacher to get to know his or her students. 8. Every student must feel protected, comfortable, and unconditionally accepted in the class room. Every child deserves to be there and every child needs to get that message. Behavior needs to be studied to determine why a given student might tend towards acting out inappropriately. There is always a reason. Compassion needs to be the guiding principle. Punishment needs to be rare and shaped by a compassionate knowledgeable teacher or administrator. (All children will act inappropriately some times.) Reflexive, top-down, dictatorial authority will result in oppositional psychology for a healthy individual. The possibility for a positive change in the behavior of a child is chained to his or her understanding that the adult, or authority figure, dishing out consequences is motivated by concern for the student, not vindictiveness. That cannot be faked. Students can instantly sense the difference. Teachers who are constitutionally incapable of empathy for the students they are entrusted with are in the wrong profession. Fear does not motivate deep learning. If there is any foundation for creating a learning environment, that is it. All of the above is congruent with the findings of current developmental science. Children react to implicit memories and inner emotional turmoil, often without much self-understanding. Especially in the first few years of life, but continuing throughout life, the brain wires itself and rewires itself as a consequence of environmental factors. Neurons that fire together tend to stay together. The brain should no longer be viewed as a fixed thing but as a plastic thing, an organ that will physically change for the positive in response to an attentive carrying environment, or to the negative in an inattentive uncaring environment. Immaturity is to be expected of children, by definition. That stated, children act out impulsively for a reason. The blame game must stop for the learning game to continue. Emotional health is not a side-issue for education, but its foundation. The unifying concept here is that anti-social behavior, or self-destructive behavior, or self-aggrandizing behavior, or self-deprecating behavior, all tend to be emerging from an underlying source. Almost always negative behavior relates to the child's deep-seated feelings of inferiority and his or her lack of mental well-being. All of that is best understood as the consequences of a negative environment, probably at home more than at school. The misbehaving child is defending herself, albeit poorly, but that is her underlying motivation. Misbehavior isn't to be tolerated, of course, but consequences need to be designed that are in the best interest of the child. The blame game is to be avoided, If a child has been largely ignored in the first two years of life, is she or he to be blamed for acting badly in kindergarten? A child might need to be removed from the proximity of other students,but that step has to be understood as temporary. It has to be understood that way by the child. The trick is, I think, that freedom should be granted in direct proportion to the responsibility taken. For example, after a certain age, students should not be punished for being absent from class. But the consequence of missing classes is that he or she will have to put in the time to meet course requirements. (Remember every students needs to earn the equivalent of an \u2018A\u2019 before being allowed to move up the ladder.) This kind of social contract, obviously, is something that a student matures into. The freedom and responsibility threshold needs to advance over time, but that process needs to happen. It needs to be an educational goal, and a conscious and ongoing process involving teachers and students. Grade ten students should not be required to ask a teacher for permission to go to the bathroom. This transition into adulthood where freedom is conscientiously balanced by responsibility needs to be designed into the school experience. (In California, moving out of high school and an atmosphere of what feels like to many students a minimum security prison, and then abruptly moving into the institutional freedom offered in a college, requires a psychological transition that at least 50% of students fail to make.) Obviously the above means that I take a radical view that our public education system needs to be fundamentally reinvented if we are to expect student outcomes to radically improve. And they must, if we are survive as a democratic nation and if the ecosphere is to be conducive to future life on this planet. The solution to a failing school system, however, is not offering less carrot to students and applying more stick to their rear-ends. The solution is equally not union busting, nor is it upping the education standards - although they need not only upping but a thorough rethinking. It is also not soft or corrupt teacher evaluation that is the central problem, although retraining of teachers may have to be made a national mandate. The truth is that scapegoating teachers or blaming lazy or undisciplined students will only make matters worse. To go on mistaking symptoms for causes will invite further disaster.The worst thing we do to students in the public education system is convince them on an emotional level, where it counts most, that we adults don't really care about them, and that school is the opposite of fun. That must be changed.Suggested related reading: Scattered, In The Land Of Hungry Ghosts, Gabor Mate MD ",

            "answer_text": "I am surprised that no one has mentioned this, but what about the American culture of negative attitudes toward good students. In many other countries, if you are a good student, you are respected by your peers (at least, I know this used to be the case in Russia, but I cannot say for sure what is going on now). The same cannot, even remotely, be said about most public schools in the U. S. I came to America as an immigrant, but attended public school in NY starting from elementary school, and I can say from vast personal experience that other kids do not tend to look up to you if you do well in school. On the contrary, they are quite hostile and very willing to make fun of you, calling you names such as 'nerd, geek, herb, etc...' (and please don't think that this was simply because I was a huge loser in school :) - I was in fact very sociable, and had plenty of friends). My parents told me that back in Russia, they didn't even have a concept of a nerd. Apparently, when they were growing up, good students were popular and respected. Naturally, it was a big surprise for them learn about this American culture of nerds and geeks. Nowadays, these concepts have become deeply rooted in our culture, as they appear in TV shows (Disney / Nickelodeon), commercials and movies. The issue is that kids grow up with these ideas of nerd and geek, and this has quite apparent negative effects on their willingness to do well in school. As far as solutions go, normally it is very difficult to change culture in a society, but in this case it may be doable, since we are specifically discussing the preconceptions of young students. I imagine that I will get no up votes for the following idea, but I say we should be stricter with kids. I know it sounds radical in such a \"liberal, modern society\" (I apologize in advance for poking fun.), but hear me out. All I am saying is, if a teacher hits a kid on the head next time he doesn't do his HW, not only will all the notions of geek/nerd go flying out the window, but he will also make sure to do his HW (To clarify, I don't necessarily believe we should beat students; the idea was strictly to illustrate a point).
