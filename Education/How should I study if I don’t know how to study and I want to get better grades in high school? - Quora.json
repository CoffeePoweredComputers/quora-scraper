            "answer_text": "Based on the question above, I believe that the best solution for you is to start with how you are studying. When you study, do you just look glance over your notes and do some practice problems? If you were anything like me this was your primary way of studying then I can point out a couple of ways why this is not efficient. This is not using your time wiselyWhen you do this do you check your phone every couple of minutes or use Facebook?How many times do you catch yourself losing focus during an assignment?Do a couple of hours ever pass and you wonder to yourself what you have accomplished and frustrated with your progress?The solution What worked really well for me was implementing the pormodo technique. You can research more yourself but basically you focus for 25 minutes and then give yourself a 5 minute break. You repeat this process 3 times then reward yourself with a 15 minute break. Why did this work for me? It allowed me to truly focus on the task at handThis in turn allowed me to understand the material rather than just memorize itI felt as though I was using my time more efficientlyThis allowed me to get into the \u201czone\u201d and was able to become super productive with my timeWhen you first begin this process I would try to gradually work up to 25 minutes. You could try to focus for 15 min then give yourself a break. Remember developing good studying habits will not happen overnight. Gradually work on them and before you know it you will be getting the best grades in your class. Good luck on studying! ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I use Quizlet. It\u2019s free and a huge site, so odds are someone has already made a study set for whatever you need. It offers a few great features, and options for effective studying. My personal favorite is the \u201c\"learn\u201d option which gives you a definition or a phrase/word. You then type the correct word/phrase or definition, depending on what you set. If you want, you can do a mix of both. A great feature within this feature is a button you can hit if you get the term technically wrong, but you understand next to the answer labeled \"I was right\u201d which marks the question as correct. There is a flash card feature, that's self explanatory, basically you click and it shows the definition. Among the other options, there is a test feature, that configures a mock test for you to take. You can also play a matching game that lists words/phrases and definitions and you try to match them as fast as you can. This one is really fun and very effective at the same time. Lastly, there is a spell feature. It's mainly for learning languages where our type what you hear. Quizlet is all I need for effective studying, and I hope it is for you too! Thanks for reading and happy studying! ",
