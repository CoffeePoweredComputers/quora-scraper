            "answer_text": "Generally, people start with an Anthropology major. Most archaeologists have a Ph.D. so you will need to pass proficiency in two foreign languages related to your area of specialization, so you could continue training from high school and start another one. I learned Latin, French and German, plus some Spanish. Multidisciplinary programs are becoming more usual. I did secondary training in ethnobotany, how plants are used by humans. If you think you might want to do CSI type forensic anthropology, chemistry courses would be very important for all the testing of evidence. Anatomy and statistics courses are very useful. ",
