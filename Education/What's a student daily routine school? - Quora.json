            "answer_text": "Here was my daily schedule in my second semester of last year (freshman year). 6:00 AM: I wake up after my dad comes into my room and turns my light on. He then won\u2019t shut up until I get up and take a shower. 6:30 AM: I am done with my shower and I usually just lay down on my bed and either rest for longer or get on my phone. 7:00 AM: I finally get completely dressed and go downstairs to take my pills, clean my glasses, grab what I need for school, etc. 7:10 AM: I arrive at school around this time. I put my things in my locker and head to the band room. 7:30 AM: Band starts. Depending on how much sleep I got, I sometimes get winded by just playing a few measures. 8:25 AM: We get dismissed. I head to first hour, which is English class. I then quietly sit and class starts at 8:35. 8:40 AM: The breakfast cart comes around and I get my usual of juice, chocolate milk, and a banana chocolate chunk breakfast bar (yum). 9:34 AM: English ends and I just move back a few rows for Freshman Seminar, which is basically just a reading class. Since I usually finish everything quickly, I frequently take naps in this class and sleep through the obnoxious bell, which rings at 10:37 AM. 10:41 AM: I am across the hall in Algebra class, where I already know everything and where everyone screams and yells at each other constantly. I watch the bell eagerly for 11:40. 11:44 AM: PE. I just do what I have to while hanging out with my friends and putting up with my PE teacher\u2019s extra bullshit. 12:44 PM: Lunch time, where my friends and I either sit in complete silence or constantly talk to each other. 1:14 PM: Lunch ends and I head up to art. I love art class. 2:17 PM: Art ends and I head to science class. Depending on what we\u2019re doing, I either hate or love this class. 3:20 PM: School is out! But\u2026 if it\u2019s Monday, I have to go to the library for Library Advisory Board and shelf books until 4:00. But sometimes I just go to the library for fun after school. But otherwise, this is the time my dad picks me up. 4:15 PM: My dad usually picks me up if I stay after school at this time. Then we either go to the grocery store or the pawn shop (so he can look for new synthesizers). 4:45 PM: I am home usually. I don\u2019t have homework, but even if I do, I never do it right after school. So usually, I just watch YouTube or Netflix until I have to go to sleep, which is around 10 or 11. 6:00 AM: I wake up and have to do it all. Over. Again. ",

I don\u2019t like online classes personally though, it\u2019s way more tiring than normal real-life classes ;-; Here\u2019s my routine: 7:00 am - 7:10 am: I wake up, scroll through my phone even though I\u2019m not supposed to, but, screw rules, I still do that. During this time, I scroll through Twitter, reply to comments in Quora, and read BBC to catch up with the news. 7:10 am - 7:15 am: I pull myself off my bed, slouch towards the washroom, do my \u201cthing\u201d and usually sleep again (inside the washroom yes. It\u2019s gross ik but meh I don\u2019t care) 7:15 am - 7:20 am: I get out of the washroom, and make my bed. 7:20 am - 7:30 am: I tidy up any mess I made last night on my study table, clean up my brother\u2019s mess, do the dishes (yes, from last night). 7:30 am- 8:00 am: Due to cOrOnAviRus, our housemaid has been sent home, so we do all the cleaning by ourselves, so during that time, I sweep the house and run a marathon with a wet mop in my hand. (weird, ik) 8:00 am - 8:15 am: I shower. 8:15 am - 8:30 am: I make myself my breakfast (usually its fried eggs on bread, a glass of milk and a banana, or if I\u2019m feeling extra energetic that day, I make a bowl of pasta) 8:30 am - 8:55 am: I sit on my table with a hot/cold mug of of chocolate milk shake and my laptop, finish homeworks I\u2019ve left last night to complete in the morning and turn them in. (My parents didn\u2019t wake up YET) 8:55 am - 9:00 am: I get up, and pee because I don\u2019t want to miss any part of my class, and scroll through social media one last time. 9:00 am - 2:00 pm: I do my online classes. 2:00 pm - 2:30 pm: I talk a bit with my mom about random stuff, do some exercises, clean the mess my brother made (smh), lay the table for lunch (yes ik I\u2019m late for lunch) 2:30 pm - 2:45 pm: I finish eating my lunch. 2:45 pm - 3:45 pm: I sleep cos by that time I\u2019m heavily exhausted from sitting on screen for too long. 3:45 pm - 8:00 pm: I complete my homeworks and assignments, occasionally taking small breaks in between. 8:00 pm - 8:30 pm - I finish eating my dinner and usually spend a bit of time with my family. 8:30 - 10:30 pm - I study. And study. AND study. 10:30 pm - 10:55 pm: I make my bed, do my facecare routine, comb my hair into a plait, pee (obviously) and go through social media. 10:55 pm - 11:00 pm: I go to sleep [although not always and end up contemplating my life, staring at the wall and cry :)] I purple you, boraa~~ ",
