            "answer_text": "It was a disaster for me. By the time we broke up, we were both so miserable it wasn\u2019t funny. If I could go back and change my decision to stay with him when we started going to different schools, I totally would. It had nothing to do with us being a bad match. We never fought or argued; we were just miserable because we were trying to date each other but our lives weren't compatible anymore. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with our relationship, and I think if we continued going to the same school we would never have broken up. But it became painfully clear that our relationship was making us both very unhappy. We both wanted to be fully engaged in the places where we were, and it\u2019s hard to do that when the most important person in your life is somewhere else. It is really really hard to be engaged in your new exciting life at college and still be hanging onto a significant other. I was constantly texting him and trying to find time to go visit while making new friends at school and taking hard classes. You don\u2019t give any details on whether or not you will go to the same school eventually. That would have changed things for us; if we had known there was a point in the future where we could be together. But if neither of you know your future plans and you\u2019ll be living in different cities, it\u2019s really hard to stay together. Of course it is your choice, and if you think she is the one for you then of course the hardship is worth it. I\u2019m just saying it was so much harder than I though it would be. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have a reason to not stay together, then consider breaking up. Have a chat. If you want to \u201cplay the field\u201d at college, that\u2019s certainly a bit douchey, but also understandable. It is true that a relationship can distract you from your studies. It\u2019s also true that you will have plenty of other distractions, if you allow them. Consider distance, consider \u201ctiming\u201d, consider the 5 and 10-year plans you BOTH have. See if what you have together is worth tossing out, or has value. The best thing you can do is be honest and respectful of yourself and your girlfriend. Stringing her along while you go to college is extremely inappropriate. There is no inherent reason you would have to break up to go to college, but also staying together for no reason other than staying together is probably invalid. ",
