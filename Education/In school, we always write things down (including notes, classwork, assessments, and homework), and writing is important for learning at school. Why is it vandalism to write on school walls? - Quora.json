Have you ever tried taking a wall into your class with you?Have you ever carried a wall home to study from?Don\u2019t you find it inconvenient to write around all the things on the wall? Switches, pictures, mirrors, moulding, etc.?When you\u2019ve filled both sides, what do you do? And where do you store the first one.There\u2019s the possibility of painting the wall when you\u2019ve finished the year or course and reusing it, so that\u2019s a point for sustainability as long as you use water-based paint.Using a wall in class is also difficult as:You can\u2019t write notes to friendsMake spitballsMake paper aeroplanes.While walls may last longer than paper, they get crumbly, and the surface isn\u2019t particularly good for using a biro or a fountain pen. Painting out mistakes is easy, though.Some research would need to be done to see what walls are best to write on.cinder blocklime plasterwallboardbrickplaster on wood lathplaster on metal lathIn light of the above, how are you going to ensure that you\u2019re writing on the best type of all.I think you\u2019ll find that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. They must do, otherwise what I read on walls wouldn\u2019t be so sloppy, badly spelled or just illegible.",

            "answer_text": "For the SECOND (it\u2019s not TWO, it\u2019s SECOND) time, IT IS VANDALISM to write ANYTHING on the school walls. School walls are the public school\u2019s property AND they are NOT your property. Thus writing on school walls is considered DEFACING public school property and is considered property damage. Regardless of what you write and/or what you use to write on the school walls, it is STILL VANDALISM. Whether you wrote something good or bad on the school walls, and whether you wrote it in pencil or not, it is NOT OK. PERIOD. When you do your schoolwork -- like classwork, worksheets, quizzes, tests, homework, and taking notes -- do you EVER write your notes, work, answers, and ideas, or even your name and the date on the school walls? NO!!!! You always write them on paper or in your notebook, and NOT on the school walls!!!!! You do not write ANYTHING on school walls. If you want to write something, WRITE ON PAPER OR IN YOUR NOTEBOOK FOR GOODNESS\u2019S SAKE. Paper and notebooks are yours to write on, but school walls are not. Regards, Aaron Chao ",

            "answer_text": "The school walls are not something that you take with you at the end of the day, writing on the walls usually requires an expenditure of paint and a worker to remove, and as painting a small area usually enhances the attention to that space (paints don't match due to fading) the entire wall needs to be painted. Due to allergies and space constraints this cannot be completed while school is in session so that writing has to remain until there is a break. Many don't realize that it is vandalism to write on any property that is not your own, it's just that building that are not currently occupied rarely find the culprit and prosecute while schools usually have cameras in the common areas and can discover the culprits without too much trouble. It is a crime and punishments can range from jail time to having to pay for repainting or having to actually repaint the area. ",

            "answer_text": "So let me break this down for you. Writing is important; I would argue the most important skill. It is often said, \u201cWriting is thinking\u201d. However, each example you provided is done on paper you purchased, and is for your eyes only. It also has a specific purpose in that it furthers your education. Did you buy that wall? No. Did you put what you wrote there for educational purposes or for self-expression? Did it cost money to remove what you wrote in notebook? No. If writing is thinking, what are you thinking with this logic? So, it is a case of vandalism and nuisance behavior over actual writing. Want to write on walls? Buy your own or become a muralist so people will pay you to write/express yourself in walls. Until then, keep your work in your folder. ",

Writing on school walls is usually profane or otherwise inappropriate, and does nothing to stimulate the mind like taking notes or writing essays would. If it\u2019s something inspiring, artistic, or would otherwise make the school a more positive place, either do it and be prepared to explain yourself or maybe even ask permission first! Admins are sometimes way nicer than they look, and if you can present a well-reasoned argument about why this particular wall decoration is not vandalism and how it could improve the school in some way, they might agree with you!
