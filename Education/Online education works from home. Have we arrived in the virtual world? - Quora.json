            "answer_text": "Yes of course. We have already started the virtual world long time ago but as the technology advances, more and more virtualization will be taking place. I remember 25 years ago when was the first time I use the internet. It was really challenging just to get connected. Today, we have the internet 24/7 with very fast speeds at our finger tip. I also remember the first time I use mobile phone, that was at the start of 2000. It was very luxurious to use a mobile phone at that time. Now everybody has it. So the same applies on the online education. Started as luxury and now everybody is looking for it and everybody is trying to implement it because it provides real benefits and high value to its users. It\u2019s very obvious that the online education already took its trend and at a certain point in time, it will completely replace the traditional education. ",
