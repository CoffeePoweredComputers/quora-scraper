            "answer_text": "I honestly do NOT think very highly of Malala. I don\u2019t mean to take anything from her and she is incredibly accomplished for her age. She is a brave young lady who is well intentioned. And she definitely deserves some respect. Having said that, I don\u2019t see how she is qualified to win the Nobel peace prize. But then again, what did Obama or Kissinger really do to deserve the honor?! Her receiving the honor doesn\u2019t make me think high of her but rather low of the award. There are millions of mothers in this world who go through absolute desolation for the sake of their children and for their education. These women withstood so many atrocities to educate their children and I don\u2019t see how their efforts are any less meaningful and praiseworthy than Malala\u2019s efforts. While she is a brave, well intentioned kid, she hasn\u2019t nearly experienced life the way so many others have. It is a travesty that someone who has worked for a time longer than this kid\u2019s life is sharing the award with her. This doesn\u2019t make me think any low of her and I don\u2019t wish to take away from her what she has achieved but rather suggest that she might be overrated. Aung San Suu Kyi was under house arrest for 15 years and the Nobel committee is trying to imply that this little kid who got shot and was flown to and cared for in a fancy hospital while expenses were taken care of by her father or the hospital, deserves to share the same honor as Suu Kyi. I don\u2019t have anything against her but I feel that she is grossly overrated and by honoring her, I am disrespecting the service and sacrifice of millions of other men/women who have done so much more.

            "answer_text": " Malala Yousafzai . She is a Pakistani activist for Female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. She is known for human rights advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending Schools. Now I will give you some examples and everything would become more clearer to you . FREE HIJAB CAMPAIGN Wearing the Islamic hijab veil is mandatory for women in Iran, and in 2014, Iran's morality police warned, fined or arrested 3.6 million women for inappropriate dress. Masih Alinejad, an Iranian journalist and activist living in the U.S., wants to change this, and she's started by inviting Iranian women to send in pictures of themselves enjoying their unveiled hair. All women of Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq started their Campaign . Malala Yousafzai Preach about Feminism and Rights all over the World but she never said \u201cSINGLE WORD \u201c for these Women or supported campaign . While she herself wears \u201cHIJAB\u201d and preach Liberty and Feminism to Western women which is Kind of JOKE . 2. While Second Example is few days ago in New Zealand attack happened . Malala heartBroken about that she Tweeted out Full Sympathy for that which is Good also. She also Claimed it as \u201c Terrorist \u2018 Attacks . But after that 2 Hindu Girls Kidnapped, Raped and Converted to Islam on eve of Holi in Pakistan but Malala was \u201cTight Lipped \u201c . No Tweet . No Words nothing !!  Converted Girl\u2019s Father Shia People and Masjids are Targeted and Killed in Pakistan . No Words for them from Nobel Prize Winner .  Attacked Shia Mosque . 3 . She always says \u201cPakistan is SAFE and HEAVEN \u201c . But Actually Living in London enjoying Life , making Millions of Money and getting fully funded Education hiding behind British Imperialist . Views on Malala - She is Hypocrite and Pseudo Feminist in Purest Form . She is enjoying her life making Millions of Money . Getting everything Luxurious from the hands of British Imperialism and she is using her Powers . She is having some Hidden Agenda . Speaking on Selective Issues and herself wearing HIJAB and Lecturing Western women about Feminism and Liberty is Kind of Joke . Claiming NZ attacks as \u201cTerrorist attacks \u201c but never said a word for Attacks on Shias in Pakistan . Always say \u2018Pakistan is SAFE and Heaven sorts of things but herself living in London . Doesn\u2019t Talk about Treatment of Minority(Hindus) in Pakistan (Rape, Kidnap and Conversion) . Neither Talk about Iran, Iraq women Campaign nor supported them . Tells the Low of Malala Yousafzai .
