            "answer_text": "I know you said you hate reading, but there has to be something you\u2019re passionate about. Whatever that is, there is something to be read about it, believe me. Maybe it\u2019s a magazine or a short book, but there is something out there. Reading is a great sleep facilitator. I would also say you set some hard rules and keep to them. Stop all texting/posting 1 hour before bedtime, there could be something that\u2019s said, posted or occurs when you check your phone that will keep you up for hours. I am a chronic insomniac, I\u2019ve tried just about every single thing there is to try out there and those have been some of the most effective changes I\u2019ve made to get to sleep quicker. Also, if you\u2019re doing those things 30\u201345 minutes before bedtime, why not just slowly move your bedtime up by 30\u201345 minutes. You don\u2019t have to stay awake until a certain time, your bedtime is your own. ",

As epileptic, both left and right sides can work independently. Yours is likely to just be a pushover until you find you are exhausted. Then you look to dream and that ceases to exist for awhile. Like a coffee junkie or a crack cocaine addict. more more give me more. balance is important. hello both brains controller has arrived. both must be watched to get the perspective.  everything will be okay Fabio, just the full psychic weaving an idea, then see how is the day and the night to you. looking still for that space elevator I know someone near has the idea which is needed?
