            "answer_text": "There is probably no good use for this sentence. I would start by wondering what you mean by \u201cpassed way\u2019. I think you meant to say \u201cpassed away.\u201d If that is true, then \u201cmy uncle is passed away\u201d is an odd archaic usage and may actually never been correct: I honestly don\u2019t know. It might be genuine or it might be a false archaic form. Can you explain the meaning of what you are trying to convey with your language? In other words, are you trying to say that your uncle has passed away (a report of his death) or that he is simply dead (a current state of affairs, hence, perhaps, \u201c is passed away\u201d) I think in most cases outside of certain and probably bad poetry, we would want to hear \u201chas passed.\u201d but I don\u2019t know the context.\u201d ",
