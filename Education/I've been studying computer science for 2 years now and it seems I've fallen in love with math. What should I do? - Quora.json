            "answer_text": "I came at it from the other direction.  As an undergrad I was a mathematics major.  I had almost completed all of the math requirements for my degree and I was already making plans on grad school.  As a requirement for my major, I had to take an intro CS class.  In taking that intro CS class I saw the perfect way to use all of the mathematics that I had learned and I really enjoyed the programming assignments.  The bottom line, I changed my major to CS.  I graduated with a BS in Computer Science and was given a free ride to grad school, along with a small stipend that barely covered living expenses.The whole point of my story is the simple fact that if it is what you really want to do, a switch in majors is possible.  It may not be easy.  In fact, it may be rather difficult.  You might have to spend an extra semester in school, but a degree in mathematics is an option.  You will need to consider your job opportunities after graduation, unless like me you are planning on going to grad school.  You might find it easier to get a job with a BS degree in CS or Computer Engineering, as opposed to a BS in Mathematics.  Even if you continue with your current degree plans, you might be able to take more math classes, which might satisfy your love of mathematics.  Also, you might want to consider a double major, both CS and Mathematics.My career has worked out so that I have been able to apply a lot of the math I learned to the programs that I code. Something like that might be an option for you as well.The bottom line is that you are still in college and there are options that are open to you.  Definitely consider all options carefully, perhaps talk with your advisor, professors and trusted friends.If I might suggest, do something that you enjoy with your life.  A career lasts many years, far to many years to do something that you don't enjoy.In my case, I have spent far more hours on the job having fun and far fewer hours that seemed like work.  Many times I refer to my job as 'playing with computers' and indeed that is how I feel about programming.No matter what your choices, I sincerely hope that those choices will ultimately allow you to be able to say that you enjoy your work. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You should look into the field of Data Science.  Your undergraduate degree could be either CS or Math. If it is too late to switch out of your CS major, just go heavy on the math (statistics) for your electives or minor in math if you can.  Then you can pursue an MS or Certificate in Data Science. If your school allows transfer credits, you can even take some of the Data Science classes online.  Harvard Extension School has some and UC Berkeley has a complete online MS program.  Maybe these could count as electives and would give you a great head start.  It sounds like you might be very well suited for this field based on your interests. Good Luck! ",
