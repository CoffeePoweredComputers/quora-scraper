            "answer_text": "If you look at the list on Wikipedia, there are 132 institutions listed as having university status in the UK. But this doesn't necessarily answer the question. This list does not include, for instance, University College London \u2013 which is a college of the University of London and not actually a university, despite being listed in all major university rankings (this situation isn't unique to Britain, the rankings also list campuses of US university systems, e.g. UC Berkeley). UCL, along with 11 other London colleges, is currently applying for university status after s change in the law last year that allowed them to do so while remaining part of the University of London. The number does include the University of Wales \u2013 which is effectively merged with the University of Wales Trinity St David but still legally has a separate existence. Removing Wales and adding in the 12 London colleges that have applied to become universities (and are pretty much guaranteed to succeed) gives 143 institutions. These aren't the only institutions that can award degrees, however (and not all universities can award all degrees). There are also five university colleges and 12 other colleges that can award degrees (including, confusingly, Richmond the American International University in London, which is not a UK university but can award UK degrees). If by 'university\u2019 you mean an educational institution that can award degrees, there are 160. Which are the best? This is hard to say, but there are seven that feature I'm the top ten of all three national rankings (these are more reliable than global rankings as they're not limited to data's that's available everywhere in the world and can therefore make use of the rich data available on British universities). These are (in order of their average position, given in brackets): Cambridge (1), Oxford (2.3), St Andrews (2.7), Imperial (5), Loughborough (5.7), Durham (6), andLancaster (6.7). ",

            "answer_text": "Lots and lots. Here\u2019s a list from Wikipedia: List of universities in the United Kingdom - Wikipedia I\u2019d guess that since the UK is a popular study abroad destination for a lot of international students, there is a huge demand for mostly every course (this is especially true for business degrees). But, when it comes to actually considering where you\u2019d want to apply, I\u2019d advise you to look at the rankings. Each university has different areas of strengths - some are good with languages, some with business, others with psychology. Because of that reason, when you are comparing rankings, make sure to look at the rankings in your specific field of interest rather than the overall rankings of the university. Hope this helps and good luck! ",
