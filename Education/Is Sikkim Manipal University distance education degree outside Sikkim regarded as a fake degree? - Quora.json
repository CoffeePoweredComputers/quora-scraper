            "answer_text": "[1] As per territorial jurisdiction clause of UGC, a university created out of a State Act can't operate out of its state i.e. SMU can't have study centres or examination centres outside Sikkim. So it is not valid for a student in Delhi as per territorial jurisdiction clause of UGC. Your friend may just be lucky in not being questioned so far as awareness about these minute details is too low. However all these minute details will matter if and when the issue reaches a court of law and it is likely to be rejected by court then. https://www.ugc.ac.in/deb/notices/UGCLetterTerritorialJurisdiction.pdf Footnotes[1] https://www.ugc.ac.in/deb/notices/UGCLetterTerritorialJurisdiction.pdf",

            "answer_text": "Actually Sikkim Manipal University is a private university as per details given on UGC website. And as per the order by supreme court Sikkim Manipal University has off campus which is not following the guidelines of UGC in terms of off campus. That's why the degree of SMU is not valid for admission in government college. But it is not fake. I have done BAJM from SMU and IGNOU has rejected my degree for masters programme. I enrolled in SMU in 2011 when there was no problem but later as I got to know this happened. ",
