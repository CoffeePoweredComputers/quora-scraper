            "answer_text": "14 & 16-year-old dating I come from an older generation where the entire world was different. This same situation happened in the late 1950's to my generation. I was a lot more stupid at 14 than I was at 16. Two years is a little too much difference for dating at age 14. Two years is not nearly as big a difference between 16 and 18. It was much more common for the guys to date girls one year younger when I was growing up, not two years difference. In a high school I attended with about 500 kids in each grade in suburban New Jersey in the late 1950's, I know of several boys in my class who eventually married girls one year behind them in school, including myself and my wife who started dating at ages 16 and 17. And I think all of us high school sweetheart couples I know are still married over 50 years later, but it was a different world back when we started dating. So I know that real love relationships can start young and still last, but what I felt at 17 was not love - it was just a sexual attraction. This encouraged me to date and explore male-female relationships, but it was not real love until we had both matured a few more years and we had gotten to know each other WITHOUT any sex. Back in those years in middle-class suburban areas, there was a lot less sex during young dating years as there is today - there was some teenage sex, but it was not the usual case. I don\u2019t know about the other long-term married couples I have referred to, but there was no premarital sex with most \u2018Good Girls,\u2019like I was dating. If you let the relationship get sexual, I am sure that the sex will seem great at those ages, but it will cloud your judgment, and the sex may prevent you from developing into real love. My wife and I dated almost five years before we got married and yet we were both complete virgins on our wedding day. We had not even had oral sex. This was hard for us dealing with our sexual urges during those five years, but it was well worth the wait - we have a \u2018One-in-a-Million-Marriage\u2019 as a result of taking our time. We still have a great sex life in our 70's. Everyone will think that I am a sexist male and don\u2019t treat women as equals, but I need to point out that to have such a wonderful relationship like we have it is up to the girl to set the rules of the relationship. Boys and girls are different. Boys want sex, just like I did, but girls want intimacy in non-sexual ways. Boys want a girl to \u201cProve your love,\u201d but having sex that way is actually the fastest way for a girl to lose a boyfriend. I \u2018Proved my love\u2019 for my girlfriend by being willing to respect her desire to wait until marriage to have adult style sex. A girl should ask her boyfriend to \u2018Prove your love\u2019 by respecting my wishes. My sweet 16-year-old girlfriend quickly let me know that she was a traditional, old-fashioned girl who believed sex should only be between a husband and a wife after marriage. That was not what I had initially wanted to hear, but I really liked her, and I was willing to get to know her. The more I got to know her, the more I liked her. This turned into real love. I wanted her, and I wanted to make her dreams come true. Her dream was a big church wedding and to deserve wearing that beautiful white wedding gown, which symbolizes purity and virginity. I wanted to make her dreams come true, and once I really liked her, I made her dream, my dream. I never once tried to attempt to make her or talk her into doing anything that would destroy her dream before our wedding. When we were dating, she was passionate, and she told me that she loved me and wanted me sexually, but that she wanted to wait. After two or three years dating, we would \u2018Make Out,\u2019 or neck for hours - just kissing and cuddling. But I never once did anything that she did not want me to do or to push her into anything that she didn\u2019t want to do for almost five years. Then, once we were married, she has never turned me down for wanting to have sex. She has proved her love for me, just as I proved my love for her by waiting. She has never begged off for a \u2018headache\u2019 - in fact she discovered that a few good orgasms are the best cure for a headache. If a guy at any age really likes a girl, he will be willing to wait and earn her respect and long-term love. Any guy that refuses to do that is not really looking for a long-term relationship or seriously interested in that particular girl - he is only looking for quick sex. A girl who loses a boyfriend by asking for respect this way is lucky; she is avoiding a short-term relationship, and she will not just become another notch in that guy\u2019s list of conquests. You can have a lot of fun in a proper dating relationship without ever having sex - this is what is appropriate for teenage years. I can vouch for the fact that a horny guy can get by on just kissing and necking and making out in those hormone-fueled years of growing up. It was a lot more important to our long-term love that I earned my girlfriend\u2019s \u2018Respect\u2019 rather than pressuring her to have sex she did not want yet. I think 14 and 16 are okay if you both agree to limit your activities to being just kids and not getting too serious and trying to get into adult sexual activity. Just understand that dating at these ages is supposed to be a learning experience. It should be young teenagers enjoying being teenagers and having fun while you learn how to be mature. Don\u2019t get too serious because you are not ready to be adults yet no matter how mature you think you are. Science has learned that the human brain is not fully mature until at least age 25. The odds are that there is very little chance you are in a long-term relationship in those teenage years. If you get sexual, the chances of being long-term are actually reduced, not increased. Use these years to earn each other\u2019s \u2018Respect.\u2019 Learn to be each other\u2019s \u2018Best Friend.\u2019 Learn about each other\u2019s likes and dislikes. Learn what sort of person your partner is. See what your partner is like when they are angry, upset, sick, have been drinking, or if they are using drugs. If your partner ever gets upset and becomes either verbally or physically abusive, you should break up. Some of these negative aspects of a personality take some time to develop and for you to discover. If you are serious sexually it is much harder to break up when you see such negative traits. For girls, it seems to be particularly difficult to break up with the first guy you ever have sex with. There is a natural \u2019Bonding\u2019 that occurs with the first time that you have sex. Sex at these young ages is only setting yourselves up for future regret for your sexual activity. The most common sexual regrets of any over 30-year-old individuals are having sex too soon in a prior relationship and/or with the wrong person. It is very rare for an older person to look back and think that they missed out on anything important by waiting too long to be sexual. I look back and understand that the hardship of waiting for sex during those teenage years was one of the best things I did to ensure the happiness of our long-term marriage. I did not want to have to wait when I was young, but it was well worthwhile in hindsight. You each only have one chance to have a first sexual experience. Take the attitude that you want that unique first experience to be as special as possible. You also do NOT want that first sexual experience to be with the wrong person. There is nothing more special than to share that first mutual sexual experience as newlyweds on your honeymoon. Due to following my girlfriend\u2019s rules we had the most wonderful first sexual experience possible. Don\u2019t mess up your personal first experience by having to sneak around to have sex, doing it a little too drunk, doing in the back seat of a car, or in some other poor place, and later realizing that you did it with the wrong person. If you are not sexual under age 18, then there is also no fear of any legal problems no matter where you live. Sex is always a serious activity no matter how casual some people treat it. I hope that your young love feelings can lead to a long-term relationship that is as wonderful as what my wife and I have, but the odds are against it, and If you become sexual at your ages, too soon, those odds are a million to one against you. If you date without letting sex get into the relationship, it can be a way to learn about relationships and become more mature while you are having fun just being a teenager. ",
