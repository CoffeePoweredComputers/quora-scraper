            "answer_text": "I can understand ur situation as i am also giving boards this year.Take a deep breath,don\u2019t panic as it\u2019s never too late\u2026. 1.listen u have sufficient gap such that u can score above 50 (atleast in chemistry) if u know basics,just go through ncert for physical chemistry (as u have less time) .solve numericals (it consists of 12 marks and 1 mark for just writing the formula).then for inorganic just go through your tution copy nd previous que..read nd write .. now for organic section i would strongly recommend u to solve ncert intext que,iupac nd exercises again read nd write all the name reaction in a separate note book and mug up these reaction. U will definitely score above 50 . 2. I would not give u false hope. If u know basics nd some of the chapters of physics then obviously u can score above 50 by trying hard , by solving papers (previous). But in the extreme case that u don\u2019t know basics of any chapter then it will be very tough for u so i would suggest you to work on electrostats , current, magnetism,optics, dual nature, atoms nd nuclei, electronic devices.these chapters are scoring specially last those chapters. Study for 16 to 17 hrs per day with a gap 5 to 10 min nd after this u are left with 1 nd half day ( I guess) give these time to rivision and solving previous que ans.. don\u2019t do other chapter apart from these, just keep revising \u2026 3. Now maths , strictly talking u don\u2019t have time just mug up ncert twice .. don\u2019t go deep in previous que paper solve 2 to3 previous question paper. Doing this u will definitely score 40 \u2026. Now just relax you should remember always remember one thing \u201cIn order to succed, ur desire for success should be greater than ur fear of failure. So don\u2019t scared\u2026. Best of luck\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can get 40+ if you just study between the boards.. 4 days physics gap:- Day1:-electrostatics,current electricity, magnetic effect of current+magnetism, EMI Day2:-Ac, emw, ray+wave optics Day3:-modern physics+communication system Day 4:-devote at least this day for complete revision. Now u don't have enough time to go through every single line of ncert so its better you focus on question bank(oswaal/arihant/together with) because you can expect 80\u2105 paper from such material. Same stuff goes for chemistry and maths too.. Relax and study still you have 4\u20135 days for each of the exam.All the very best for your boards. Do well..God bless you!\u263a\u263a ",

(if u don\u2019t then great, if u do then it is the biggest dis-tractor of studies.) pls be sincere at least for next few days. Promise ???!!! ",
