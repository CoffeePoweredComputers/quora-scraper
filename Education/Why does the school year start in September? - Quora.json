            "answer_text": "Well, mine started on August 27, soo\u2026.. Anyways, I still think that school officially starts in September (because for me, there are a lot of half days/no school in August/early September). I think the answer is simple. School ends in June (for most people anyways) so the students can enjoy their summer. That\u2019s the whole point of summer break. I think of it like this: Winter DecemberJanuaryFebruarySpring MarchAprilMaySummer JuneJulyAugustFall SeptemberOctoberNovemberIt makes sense. 12 months/4 seasons = 3 months for each season. Even though the exact dates for when each season starts is slightly off, the main idea is the same. Summer is June, July, and August. Therefore, for summer break, students should get part of June, July, and most or all of August off. So school should start around the time September starts to roll in. Simple, yet interesting question. BOL, Sreeteja ",

            "answer_text": "It traces to the farm calendar to maximize kids helping with the planting/harvesting at home. The hours of operation of schools evolved with the same thing in mind. It did not solve all the labor issues, but it spoke to the biggest ones. Not really necessary now, but people do not embrace change, and a reasonable consistency across all states and communities is needed. A 9\u20135 day would make more sense for most families than 7:30\u20133:00, but suggesting that change causes a major social media firestorm. ",
