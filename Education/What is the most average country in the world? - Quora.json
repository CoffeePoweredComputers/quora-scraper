            "answer_text": "Okay. Let\u2019s look at the stats of Averagabilia, a (hypothetical) nation that is dead in the middle of the scale of everything (using mean average, where applicable). These are using the countries listed on the relevant Wikipedia articles, so there are some dependent territories, Chinese SARs, unrecognized states, etc., etc. fitting in the equation. Additionally, the numbers of those vary from list to list. Be careful when swallowing. Population: 32,310,825 GDP (nominal): $454,506,385,417 Government System: Presidential Republic Continent: Africa Area (calculations included Antarctica, because f*** it, I\u2019m not adding the area of all the countries listed): 1,932,090 square km Legislature: Two houses Driving side: Right Now, the country with the closest population to Averagabilia is Afghanistan, listed on Wikipedia as having 32,225,560 inhabitants. The country with the closest nominal GDP, according to IMF estimates, is Iran, at 458,500 million USD. The nearest country in area, by area, is Indonesia, at 1,910,931 square kilometers. All the rest of the data is non-quantifiable. In truth, there is no average country. Every country has its own uniqueness. Just find the one that suits you the best, because it\u2019s impossible for every single one of these stats to fit your expectations. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematically speaking, China would be the most average due to its extremely large population. Averages are constructed by adding up parts of a cohesive whole and dividing by the sum of all the cohesive parts. Since China has the largest population in the world, its safe to say that they are the most average country in the world. ",
