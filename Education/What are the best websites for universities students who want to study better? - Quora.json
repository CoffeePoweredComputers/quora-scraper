            "answer_text": "My personal favorites are Khan Academy and Quizlet. Khan Academy has really good videos that explain complex concepts in a simple and straightforward manner. They can be very helpful if there is a concept that you are struggling to get or have a problem that you can't figure out. Quizlet is both a good study tool and learning resource. First off, to allows you to make a set of flashcard to help you learn the material you are currently working on. Second, it allows you to look up sets other have made over the material you are working one and see what they felt was important. In both instances it gives valuable practice answering questions and checking for understanding. ",
