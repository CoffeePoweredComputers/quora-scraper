            "answer_text": "The simple subject is the noun or noun phrase that the sentence is about. In other words, it is the person, place, or thing (tangible or intangible) that does the action or that is being described. The complete subject includes the articles (a, an, the), adjectives, relative clauses, and prepositional phrases that modify or describe the simple subject. Therefore, the complete subject is everything in the sentence before the predicate, which is the verb, along with any adverbs that modify it, as well as any prepositional phrases, objects, and complements. Look for the main verb in a declarative sentence. The complete subject is everything that precedes that verb, except for any adverbs that modify that verb, which sometimes precede and sometimes follow the verb. e.g., The beautiful, blue flowers on the top shelf have begun to wilt. e.g., The engagement ring that I gave my fianc\u00e9e cost me thousands of dollars. It becomes more complicated for interrogative sentences (questions) and imperative sentences (commands and suggestions). The former has the verb or part of the verb appear before the subject. The latter does not have an actual subject in the sentence but is assumed to be you (singular and plural). ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cComplete subject\u201d is not an official grammatical term, but some use it to specify not just the noun that serves as subject, but the entire noun phrase. In reality, in a sentence like \u201cThe empty-handed painter from your streets is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets\u201d, the subject is \u201cThe empty-handed painter from your streets\u201d, as all of that is part of the noun phrase that is performing the action of \u201cdrawing\u201d. More narrowly, however, the subject could be considered as just \u201cpainter\u201d or \u201cthe\u2026 painter\u201d, as that would be the bare minimum to create a noun phrase, which hypothetically could be the subject. All the rest (\u201cempty-handed\u2026 from your streets\u201d) are just qualifiers that could be left out. So the \u201ccomplete subject\u201d simply specifies the entirety of that noun phrase. ",
