            "answer_text": "There are many ways you can develop new skills and gain knowledge for free in your spare time. Many universities and other educational institutions offer free online courses, complete with tests, quizzes, reading material, study guides, and even textbooks. Here are some tools that will have you hitting those e-books. Code YearIf learning computer programming sounds way out of your reach, best left to the geniuses of the world, you're wrong. According to Code Year, anyone can learn the basics of computer programming in just one year. Code Year lessons are presented in an interactive format that doesn't necessarily feel like you're learning code. It's certainly the opposite of listening to lectures and reading dry books on programming. Budding programmers start off with JavaScript and move quickly through the subsequent lessons. W3SchoolsThe largest site on the Internet for Web developers, W3Schools is a fantastic resource for those interested in brushing up on their Web development skills\u2014or learning them for the first time. Want to make your own website? W3Schools offers tutorials and references on a large range of subjects, including HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and more. TEDI guess most of you have seen at least one TED Talk by now. The nonprofit started out as a conference in 1984 with the intention of \"bringing together people from three worlds: Technology, Entertainment, Design.\" (It even saw one of the first Macintosh computer demos that year.) Fast-forwarding 28 years, TED now features more than 1,114 free, award-winning talks, with more added each week. iTunes U iTunes U hosts content from more than 800 universities and distinguished organizations. Stanford, Yale, and Oxford are on the list, as well as MoMA, the New York Public Library, Public Radio International, and PBS stations. iTunes U offers audio and video of lectures, plus slideshows, PDFs, books, films, exhibit tours, and audio books. iTunes U, which supports both the PDF and ePub file formats, allows educators to distribute schedules, syllabi, lecture outlines, study guides, notes, maps, and even entire books. Khan Academy Sal Khan, former hedge fund analyst and creator of the nonprofit Khan Academy, has made over 2,700 free educational videos and aims to continue until the day he dies. Hoping to make several tens of thousands of videos available in nearly every subject, Khan Academy currently covers K-12 math, and science topics like biology, chemistry, cosmology, astronomy, and physics. The site also dabbles in finance and history, and a recent partnership with Smarthistory added hundreds of art history videos to the library There are many other platforms also where one can learn to enhance his skills like Edu4sure, Coursera, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, not counting the free Google search engine, the most stupendous free education resource in the universe is called YouTube. YouTube has nearly 1.5 billion videos. No matter what you are studying, you would probably need days or weeks to look at them all. And most videos have lots of comments, which can often be a great source of wisdom in themselves. I think it would be easy to set up a school where all the courses rely entirely on YouTube as source material and library. Teachers would tell students how to search and use YouTube intelligently. I am still amazed when I talk to an adult who has not used YouTube. I want to exclaim, \"Are you nuts?\u201d Personally, when I wanted a break, I used to play scrabble or chess on the computer. Now I look at YouTube. For example, people can visit YouTube to relive early experiences with rock'n roll. All the songs are there. Interviews. Biographies and historical stuff. Car lovers? You can see all the most beautiful cars manufactured over the last 125+ years. Amoeba? Watch them eat everything. Sporting events? Many are now posted within a day. Showbiz? Lots of actual performances and thousands of interviews with famous people. People should understand that YouTube remembers what you searched and brings up more of it every time you come back. This is very convenient. Pretty much, whatever you can imagine, you can find, and quickly. What did Elvis look like in the beginning\u2026? Elvis 1954 ADDENDUM. Something new on YouTube is the reaction video. People watch a famous person performing, and react to it. Some of these reactors are people from the music business and their judgment is often quite helpful. If you don't know YouTube, you probably don't know Angelina Jordan, considered by many to be the best voice on the planet. Here she is only 12, singing \u201cit's a man's world.\u201d I promise you will never forget the first four notes. ",
