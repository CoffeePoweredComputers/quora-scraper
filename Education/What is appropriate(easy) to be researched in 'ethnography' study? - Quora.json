Including me. Don't be intimidated by the language barrier, use it to your advantage. A lot of ethnography involves getting people to explain mundane things that most people take for granted. People are more patient in explaining these things to an outsider, because the need for you to understand it is more obvious. I'm sure if I was Chinese, a lot of the Chinese people I interviewed would think I was an idiot for all of the obvious questions I asked. What makes a good ethnographic site is pretty hard to pin down, and its really all about places where you can get people to talk to you. What themes, ideas or activities interest you? First get an idea of that, and then find a place that fits it. When I taught a class where students did ethnographies, they looked at dumpster divers, supermarkets, farmers markets, thrift stores, concerts, weddings, libraries, homeless shelters, etc.. There's really no limit to where you can do an ethnography, so start thinking about places you find interesting. ",
