            "answer_text": "Most of topper in JEE say in their interview that they used NCERT books completely to follow their dream and achieved it. Many of my friends also said the same sentences in the interview. But reality is very much different which they rarely share in interview. One day we had chat on same topic between us and reality revealed. Most of us told that we said about NCERT books in interview because we don\u2019t have a small answer for this. We didn\u2019t follow any book completely. Also told that NCERT books are not sufficient for competing in JEE. According to me, NCERT is not enough for JEE. You really need something extra. However, you must read chemistry from NCERT which will surely help you in JEE(mains). Maths and Physics of NCERT will really not help you in competing in JEE. You need some extra from your side. I will prefer you to follow some coaching materials which are really good as they are prepared for JEE point of view only. ",

And that too with a dedicated approach of studing ie reading NCERT thoroughly.... Practice all its questions as well as from guides which you refer during CBSE preparation... But if you are thinking of jee advance... Then you must rely on more things.... Go deeper into the concepts.... Practice different and interesting questions related to the topic... Go for a bit higher level.... And yes in both the cases go for previous years questions.... It will help a lot... Judge what will be more helpful and meaningful for you... And get yourself started to prepare for it... All the best:) ",
