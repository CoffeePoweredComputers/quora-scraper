            "answer_text": "Each teacher is different. Each has specific strengths and particular weaknesses. I think I was best at teaching Pre-AP Pre-Calc. I knew where all of the bits and pieces were going to be used later on. The students in the class wanted to be there, so I didn\u2019t have as much classroom management stress (managing stress is one of my weak points). I talk fast, but I can explain things differently each time. It was a junior level class, so the dreaded \u201csenioritis\u201d wasn\u2019t a big issue. I got to focus on the math, which was the point of my greatest strength. My administrators thought I was best at teaching Algebra I. I\u2019m precise in my language, and I can diagnose misconceptions quickly and accurately. I enjoy test writing, so it takes some work off the rest of the team. Freshmen are more likely to have simpler discipline problems than upperclassmen, although they have them more often. I knew the standards like the back of my hand. The math itself was trivial to me, but I could break it down into the tiniest steps to show how each property was used. I know teachers who excel at Geometry. I know teachers who excel at Statistics. I know teachers who excel at 7th grade math. We are very different kinds of people. However, ultimately I suspect the easiest grade to teach is the one where you have the most experience. I would probably crash and burn in a 4th grade classroom, for example. ",

            "answer_text": "During my career I taught every year group between nursery (aged 3/4) and year 6 (aged 10/11). Each age group has its pluses and minuses but I wouldn\u2019t claim that any one is easier than another. Familiarity with the curriculum for a particular year group may make life a little easier, but at the end of the day teaching is a very stressful job no matter how old the pupils. ",

The students are bright and highly motivated, so the instructional component (challenge) is almost nonexistent. All the students need is to be pointed in the right direction; most of the time that\u2019s not even necessary. I always said that a monkey can teach an AP class. Sometimes they do. ",
