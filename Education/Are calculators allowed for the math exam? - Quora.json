            "answer_text": "It depends. First students need to learn multiplication tables. Period! Then learn basic math and algebra the long hand way. This is simply a learning method to instill an ability for problem solving and to know the steps needed to solve a problem. Then with working harder problems like \u201cword problems \u201c then use a calculator to reduce simple errors like multiplying 2 2 digit numbers or finding a square root. I graduated high school in 1975. This is how I learned math. Calculators barely were out when I went to college. Because of the steps I took in learning math i can do some more complex problems in my head whereas high school student going into college can\u2019t multiply 6 by 7 without a calculator. A calculator is for accuracy in solving problems and not for side stepping the need to learn HOW to solve problems. The educational system in this country has gone to shit over the past decades by not teaching kids how to learn. And don\u2019t get me started on SOL tests that kids are taught how to pass multiple choice tests instead of them learning the subject. ",

            "answer_text": "In many classes calculators are allowed. In Algebra I and Algebra II, using the calculator is one of the skills you are supposed to acquire. So it\u2019s actually mandatory. And the school should supply them, both for class and for end of course exams. But calculators are not encouraged when you are learning algorithms for arithmetic, when you are combining fractions, when you are converting between decimals and percentages, and lots of other places. During these kinds of activities a calculator would replace practice and reduce your exposure to numbers and values. Practice and exposure to numbers and algorithms create in your brain something called number sense. Number sense is that part of your brain that looks at an answer and thinks \u201cthat can\u2019t be right.\u201d It\u2019s the feeling you have both when a sum or product makes sense and when it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s the hugeness of large numbers and the smallness of tiny numbers, and how they fit together, turned into an intuition that you will apply throughout your life. You develop number sense by playing with numbers. But if you use a calculator, you are not playing with numbers as much. Your number sense will develop slower. If it develops at all. Plus, calculators can be expensive. It would hardly be fair to let only the rich students use calculators. ",

            "answer_text": "Not only should calculators be allowed, but things like Wolfram Alpha, used to quickly integrate or differentiate functions, should be allowed as well. This is my personal opinion. Integrating x4sinxx4sin\u2061x with respect to xx by hand is akin to finding 90\u2212\u2212\u221a90 without a calculator. This doesn\u2019t mean that integration by parts shouldn\u2019t be taught; just like it doesn\u2019t mean that the identity (x+y)2=x2+2xy+y2(x+y)2=x2+2xy+y2, used to derive the square root algorithm[1] , shouldn\u2019t be taught. We live in a world where our students have a computer in their pockets that can differentiate or integrate functions in seconds, yet mathematics is still taught like how it was taught 50 years ago.

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is quite difficult. The use of calculators for elementary school students should be restricted; students rely on the calculator rather than themselves; once students are studying algebra, calculators could be used AFTER the paper and pencil methods are mastered. Basically when working on math w/o a calculator , a student is mentally engaged in the step by step process ; when using a calculator students use steps to get to the end often w/o knowing the reasons why . To solve more advanced math topics the calculator can be an excellent tool . It supplements mental activity; it should not replace it. Math students need to develop good deductive reasoning, critical thinking and problem solving skills with reliance on themselves. Human beings learn very quickly that calculators are a fast way to get things done. If we want to grow more solidly mathematically successful math persons the foundation must be based on solid self-reliance , rather than a tool that does things for you quickly. As for accuracy , that's another story. ",

Yes, I can do the division on my phone, but I don\u2019t always have my phone right next to me. But that is the point: why have students doing the work their phones will do? I grew up in a time where weeks were spent on how to calculate a square root by hand. I had no idea of WHY I would want to or have any senses of a square root being the length of the side of a square, but I got good at calculating the square root by hand, out to many decimal places. NOBODY calculates a square root by hand anymore! (I\u2019m not talking about square roots of perfect squares, folks!) Teachers need to conduct Number Talks regularly and build students\u2019 capacity for flexibility with numbers. And, teachers need to stop asking questions that can be answered by the student\u2019s phone. Let\u2019s develop students problem solving abilities and get them to think critically and creatively. Leave the mundane stuff to the calculator. ",

But, as quadratics go, it is relatively simple to solve by hand. And there are many such equations for which finding the solution can be performed by hand. In addition to knowing *how* to do this, and many other relatively straight forward math problems that require some actual *understanding*, it helps to be able to think through things like this mentally without a calculator. And that is what reqiures development. Not using a calculator actually helps to exercise that skill and develop. Once developed, knock yourself out with a calculator. ",

I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with letting the calculator do the mundane stuff.

It\u2019s just like grammar: the reason there\u2019s no grammar-check on most word processors is because grammar can be somewhat subjective; the rules aren\u2019t hard and fast with English grammar, at any rate. You can spell check until your heart\u2019s content; what you can\u2019t check for is less concrete ideas, like form, content, flow, dangling modifiers, sentence structures, repetitions, main ideas and supporting ideas. Or, for that matter, superfluous ideas. ",
