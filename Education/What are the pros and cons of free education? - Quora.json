            "answer_text": "Of course it shouldn\u2019t be free. Funding college availability for all would create a huge tax burden while encouraging attendance by many who simply are not higher education capable. This encouragement is likely to result in the degradation of standards in higher education as administrators attempt to achieve a higher graduation rates. It would create a mass of individuals who not only did not have the true gumption to achieve but also chose vocations that have no long term value to employers. Free college would quite simply be a waste of taxpayer money while likely creating a mass of individuals who have no particular useful skill set while feeling privileged due to their attainment of a degree. College should be free or at least highly subsidized. One of the basic tenants of a successful democracy is that the citizens be educated to a degree that supports the systems of productivity while being able to be fully engaged as self-governing members of society. On that basis alone college should be free in recognition of the evolution of educational need that has seen supported education migrate from upward from primary school to through high school. Although advanced coursework has migrated downward with what not that long ago was college level training now being common in high-school the needs of business have increased faster creating a demand for incoming employees with far greater education backgrounds. This need is often stated as a need for technological skills but it is equally exhibited for skills necessary for other business activities such as marketing, product design, customer service, human resources, inter-industry liaison, and international relations. The work world has become dynamic in many ways where individuals must not only continue to be open to and welcoming of learning/growth opportunities but also strong in their pesonal intuitions about their capabilities and confidences. These are traits that college enables not only by the atmosphere one is exposed to while attending but also simply by being in that atmosphere during the mental maturation inherent in the early adult years. College educated persons not only out-earn those who do not attend they also cause a general expansion of the economy due to their increased capabilities as those skills are deployed by employers making any increased costs of free college recovered many times over by increased tax revenue. Free college is simply a best option for a society that believes in the individual as the primary contributor to a successful future. ",

            "answer_text": "Free education? There is no such thing. Someone is paying for it! IT\u2019s called the taxpayer. North America has \u201cfree education \u201c paid by the tax payer who owns property or pays rent. Part of your rent is property tax so you are contributing to the education system. Regardless whether you have children or not you own property you are supporting the \u201cfree eduction\u201d for the children in you township, and city. So education is NOT FREE. There is no such thing as free anything. Someone is paying for it to make it free!! Having been involved in \u201cfree education\u201d there is no accountability on the students part to do the best job that they can and to take school seriously. But the how can they when 70% of the elementary school through to gr 10 parents see it as free babysitting service. They say that to the kids or they hear them talk with other parents and relatives and the children learn that school is a baby sitting service and not to take it very seriously. With that attitude kids think that education doesn\u2019t need to taken seriously and those who are not strongly disciplined by their parents think that it\u2019s ok to be disruptive in class and make silly remarks or disliberately challenge teachers and waste class time. That will prevail into free university/college education. Because of the increased bad behaviour the curriculum will be down graded. Universities in Canada have already done that because of the withdrawal of Gr 13. There is no 3 yr degree program anymore and no honours 4 yr degree program Everything takes 4 yr because the 1yr is now a general year and you start a specialty program in yr 2. Profs realized that the students were not mature enough nor sufficiently prepared for advanced learning and were not doing the work at a university level nor with the maturity in class behaviour. As with the elementary school and early high school students just are not serious enough about their education because there is no accountability when it comes \u201cfree\u201d. At 18\u201322 students just want fun. They want to socialize and play not sit and study and read and research. There is no ownership In getting your education. Having seen thousands of students in a \u201cfree\u201d education setting. there are at least 40% of students who do not try hard or to their very best ability. They really should be out doing something else but not in school. The pro to \u201cfree education\u201d in university is that more students would be not burdened with student debt. I would say middle class students have parents that can help and an education plan from parents and grandparents to fund their education. The students who fund themselves work really hard supporting themselves and a part time job and study and manage their time very well. They have a bigger stake in their education. IT is not a high percentage of students who actually fund themselves The conversation about going to university/college should have started when you were 10yr old with your family. In 8 yr your family could manage to get at least 1/2 the cost of tuition saved 28K. But since most students are not serious about their education, they don\u2019t start thinking until it\u2019s too late at age 15 gr 10. That is 2 yr to try and save and earn enough money to just cover part of the 1 st. Throwing the burden on Taxpayers to support \u201cfree university/college\u201d is wrong! The tax payers have already paid enough for students to get a basic education and in North America we have provided more than a basic education. At 18 its time that the students need to carry the burden for your choice to go on further. University is for the academically minded. ITs a specialty. If you have \u201cFree education\u201d then very few students would even try to work hard and be the best that they can because someone else is footing the bill just like elementary and high school. Taxpayers should not have to foot this bill so students can get a free ride nor should the taxpayers who have no children need to be paying more for advanced education of choice. Students must understand that countries where there is free university education are much smaller than Canada and USA. France, Sweden Norway. their tax base is high because of their socialistic stand on health care, education, housing. Good luck! ",
