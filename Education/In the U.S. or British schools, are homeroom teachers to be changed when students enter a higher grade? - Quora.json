            "answer_text": "I hope the term \u201chome room \u201c has the same meaning to you as to me. At middle school, grades six through eight the home room teacher is the person to whom a defined group of students reports at the start of the school day. This is also true in high school, grades nine through twelve. There are variations on this theme, but it is essentially correct. The home room teacher is responsible, before classes begin to take attendance, and make sure the students know any news of the day. This person almost always teaches a subject but not to all or even any of her/his home room students depending on the size and structure of the school. In grade six the home room teacher may be the primary teacher for the students, teaching major subjects such as math, science, geography, etc.. The students may have specialized teachers for subjects such as music, art or physical education. In the higher grades, the home room teacher usually is responsible as mentioned above, teaches a specific subject, and may or may not have any of his/her home room students for that subject. Indeed, may not even see any of them except in passing until the end of the school day, just prior to dismissal. In the lower grades, the home room teacher usually is responsible as mentioned in grade six above. In the USA the 50 States are primarily responsible for education, and often have differing requirements. My first teaching job was in a school for kindergarten through sixth grades, and had 700 students. One of my early administrative jobs was Principal in a rural high school of 75 students. I mention this so you can see how the term \u201chome room teacher \u201c may take many forms. I am not familiar with the British system. ",

            "answer_text": "I am guessing that \"homeroom teachers\" equates to UK form tutors. As far as I know, there isn't a regulation about this and different schools take different approaches. In the school I was closely involved with the aim was that the form tutor would stay with a class from year 7 to the end of year 11 (the end of high school). In reality that didn't happen very often as teachers moved on to other jobs or were promoted and given other responsibilities or, in a couple of instances, died. TLDR: Form tutors do not change every year (grade) as every effort is made to provide stability and continuity but sometimes circumstances lead to changes. ",
