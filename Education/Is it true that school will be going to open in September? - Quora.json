            "answer_text": "Schools planning to reopen in the fall are weighing what's called the \"pod\" approach, in which middle and high school students remain isolated with their peers in the same classroom all day, said Dan Domenech, executive director of The School Superintendents Association. The traditional between-class hallway jam \"really is conducive to infection, as opposed to isolating them in the same room for the whole day,\" Domenech said during a HealthDay Live! interview. It's one of many ways that schools might operate differently in the days of COVID-19, if infection rates in their communities even allow them to reopen next school year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that middle and high schools consider adopting the elementary school model, in which \"high school kids remain in the same room and the teachers move around,\" Domenech said. Staggered school hours would make sure hallways remain relatively empty as students enter and leave the building. There's even talk of keeping the cafeterias closed and serving the kids lunch in their classroom \"pod,\" so they remain in the classroom nearly all the school day. A CDC checklist holds that schools should feel safe reopening if COVID-19 outbreaks are contained in their communities; teachers and students have been drilled on the importance of hand hygiene, face masks and social distancing; and ongoing monitoring is in place to detect and respond to an outbreak at the school. \"It's not a question of if, it's a question of when there will be an outbreak, because there will be outbreaks. We know that. We can expect and plan for it,\" said Dr. Dimitri Christakis, director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute. Most kids not vulnerable to severe COVID-19 Parents should feel reassured about their child's safety in going back to school, said Christakis, who also spoke with HealthDay Live! \"If a child gets COVID, there's a one in 1,000 chance that they will be hospitalized with it, and there is a one in 100,000 chance they will die from it,\" Christakis said. \"Those are long odds, as they say. Your child's risk of getting hit by lightning over the course of their lifetime is one in 15,000, to give some perspective.\" Precautions put in place at schools to prevent outbreaks are instead designed to protect adults -- teachers, parents and family members, Christakis explained. \"We know children themselves are at very low risk of getting sick with COVID. We don't know how big a risk they pose to pass COVID on to either teachers or family members,\" Christakis said. \"It's unfortunate we don't know that, because that would make our decision-making a lot easier. We don't know how contagious they actually are.\" The CDC recommends that schools reopen with plans to routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, stagger arrival and dismissal times for students, avoiding mixing students in common areas, and increasing the space between desks. Time-honored traditions like \"Career Day\" likely will fall by the wayside, as schools are being encouraged to limit all non-essential visitors. It also could be some time before kids attend group events that promote school spirit, such as student assemblies, school sports, student concerts and dances. The CDC is asking schools to reconsider any event that would bring kids in close contact with each other. Parents also should be ready for the school to be closed at a moment's notice, in the event of an outbreak. The CDC recommends students and most staff be sent home at least two to five days upon finding a confirmed case at a school, so health officials can perform contact tracing and staff can disinfect areas used by the infected person. All these changes are going to take place amid ongoing turmoil at schools related to both the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the economy, Domenech said. Schools may face shortages in funding, teachers \"School districts that are already going to be suffering financially because of the economy may not have the dollars they need to implement the guidelines as they should be implemented,\" Domenech noted. Further, some schools are likely to have a workforce shortage because teachers are afraid for their health, Domenech added. \"We already heard from quite a few teachers who are older and who have medical issues saying that they don't plan to come back,\" Domenech said. \"They don't want to take the risk of being in an environment that's going to make them sick.\" Elementary school teachers are going to be particularly challenged, since it's nearly impossible to make first-, second- and third-graders wear masks or adhere to social distancing, Domenech and Christakis said. \"You cannot expect kindergartners to social distance,\" Christakis said. \"That's how children that age learn. They need to play with their peers. They will not get a meaningful experience if they're not hands-on with their peers.\" That makes the \"pod\" strategy an even stronger option, the experts said. \"If there's an outbreak in classroom A, it's less likely it will spread to classroom B or C or D,\" Christakis said. There also will need to be a sea change in the way health care is provided at schools, the experts added. \"School nurses are not allowed to do much in terms of medical practice,\" Domenech said. \"They can't even give an aspirin unless the students bring their medication with them and it's in the office and the nurse can administer it.\" To check sick students and detect potential outbreaks, schools are going to need health specialists in the building who can check temperatures and monitor symptoms, Domenech said. \"It has to go beyond what the nurse right now is allowed to do,\" Domenech said.

            "answer_text": "It is highly unlikely. \"Reopening of educational institutions in unlock 4.0 unlikely,\" said the officials.[1] \"No decision has been taken yet over reopening schools.\" The health ministry has confirmed.[2] The cases are increasing, the graph is not yet flat and a vaccine is yet to be found and administered. Although some states (Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka and Rajasthan etc.) are eager to reopen the schools and colleges, the nod from the centre is a must. A school in West Bengal has gone as far as to reopen without the permission of the government and the education department has sent a notice to them. West Bengal education department sends notice to west Midnapore school for restarting classes.[3] Two more schools have done the same and faced similar consequences. Total confirmed cases (red) Active cases (yellow) Recoveries (blue) Deaths (black)  Exponential growth of COVID- 19 cases in India Source: Wikipedia[4] Moreover, it is not safe to do so. The government plans to reopen and implement Switzerland model but, it will fail tremendously as the total population of Switzerland is 8.5 million (30 June 2019 est.) and the total population of India is more than 1.3 billion. The education minister of Karnataka Mr Suresh Kumar has stated, \"Won't reopen schools till Covid-19 crisis is under control.\"[5] Parents won\u2019t be comfortable to send their children to schools. In a survey conducted by \u2018Localcircles\u2019 only 33 parents support reopening schools in September.[6] In a letter to the HRD minister last month, the Delhi Parents\u2019 Association wrote, \u201cThe order to shut all schools had been made on March 16 when the number of infected cases was in the hundreds. Now, it has crossed 10 lakh cases. To deliberate upon reopening schools in this situation is in itself laughable.\" [7] Can our schools enforce the guidelines stated by WHO and other institutes?[8] This thing will not get eradicated by itself:  Source: Legacyias[9] Many countries like Denmark, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Israel are reopening the schools[10], but we must note that their caseload is far lower than ours and also their population is just a fraction of India's population. What has worked there will seldom work here. Some places are showing a resurgence in cases after reopening: School Coronavirus outbreak in Georgia; over 900 students and staffs are quarantined.[11] Have a look at these: U.S schools reopen and at least 97,000 children test Coronavirus positive.[12] COVID-19 cases have been detected in 41 schools in Berlin.[13] Many schools close again in South Korea due to surge in cases.[14] Ultimately, it is up to the Central government to decide and anything may happen before September 1. Nobody knows for sure. But in the meantime, stay alert about fake news like this: Schools not to open before December?
