            "answer_text": " Because, as a society, we are beset with \u201cCollege Mania,\u201d which in many aspects mirrors the Dutch \u201cTulip Mania\u201d in the early 17th century. One of the symptoms of this syndrome is the inability to face reality. Not every high school graduate is capable of doing serious, college-level work. There, I said it. Do you remember reading about French sociologist and political theorist, Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), when you were in high school? He visited the United States in 1831. Upon his return to France, he documented his observations in the two volume, \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d which became one of the most influential books of the 19th century. He was most impressed by America\u2019s spirit of egalitarianism\u2014the doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. \u201cAmericans are so enamored of equality that they would rather be equal in slavery than unequal in freedom.\u201d Egalitarianism is at the heart of our post-secondary education crisis. Many, many Americans, at heart, believe every student should have the opportunity to go to college. Half of Those Matriculating Today Aren\u2019t College Material. Employers want graduates who can write a coherent paragraph, speak extempore, interpret qualitative and quantitative data, and do research. To acquire these skills, a student needs to have above average intelligence and be highly motivated. With forty-five percent of high school grads going on to college, more than half of them don\u2019t fit that profile. I was a very mediocre high school QB. Fortunately, I had the good sense to understand that I had no future on a college gridiron. If I had \u201cwalked on,\u201d the coaches wouldn\u2019t have wasted five minutes embarrassing me into an ignominious retreat. But when it comes to \u201ccognitive ability,\u201d it doesn\u2019t work that way. Most colleges in the US don\u2019t hold to a rigorous standard when it comes to the \u201cacademic walk-ons.\u201d For example, of those who matriculate, twenty-five percent are quietly ushered off to the side for remediation, in the hopes they can be rescued and restored to the path of academic achievement. Why do you think most colleges and universities actively lead on academically mediocre students? We don\u2019t need more students attending college. We need, on average, better academically qualified college students. Two Thirds of Those Matriculating Don\u2019t Get a Job That Requires a College Degree Today. Forty percent drop out. Twenty-six percent graduate, but find they can\u2019t get a job that requires a college degree because the market is saturated, i.e. there aren\u2019t enough well paying professional jobs for all the college grads today. Free Tuition Will Undermine Our College and University System The politicians are proposing making our public colleges and universities tuition free. Twenty-five percent of students choose private schools today. There are scenarios where private schools are competitive with public schools, but often families are opting to pay the premium for prestige. When the tuition at the private school is $25,000 versus $10,000 at the public school, that\u2019s one matter, economically. When the tradeoff is between $25,000 versus FREE, that\u2019s an entirely different matter. The elite schools won\u2019t be affected, but many second tier private schools will have to close their doors. The Quality of a College Education Has Deteriorated Sixty years ago only 7% went on to college. They tended to be the academically elite. The unwritten rule of thumb was the top 10%\u2014an IQ of 120. Imagine you are teaching that class. Today every Tom, Dick, and Harriet goes to college.  Look over your right shoulder. That guy behind you in English 101 thinks Catcher in the Rye is a book about baseball. Now, imagine teaching that class. Opening up college to everyone is just going to exacerbate the deterioration of the quality of a college education. I suggest you read Academically Adrift. Repeat after me, \u201cCollege is NOT for everyone.\u201d However, I can think how the US can have free college tuition. It\u2019s just that you aren\u2019t going to like how I would implement it.  Why don\u2019t we emulate the Swiss? Mia comes home from seventh grade. (I\u2019ve done the translation from German to English for you.) \u201cHello, sweetheart, how was school today?\u201d \u201cOh, it was OK.\u201d \u201cJust OK, didn\u2019t anything fun or exciting happen?\u201d \u201cWell, Ms. Bosch told me I wouldn\u2019t be going to college.\u201d Yes, around age twelve, the Swiss make the first cut at who is going to be accepted at their highly subsidized unis. Switzerland is organized as a federation, like the US. We have fifty states. They have twenty-six cantons. Every Swiss canton is a little bit different in their system for identifying the \u201cbook smart\u201d kids. In Geneva pupils need to achieve a grade total of 14 over Maths and two French subjects to get on the path to university.The grading is similar in Vaud with test marks from 1 to 6. If a student fails, they get another shot the following year.Zurich has a different system, equally challenging. Only 19.7% of Zurich-based children will qualify.Their secondary school system has several tiers oriented towards different professional tracks. The top tier, leads to the Matura graduation, preparing its students for direct entry to university. Approximately twenty percent qualify to attain the Matura every year. (Each canton administers the Matura test with their own set of rules.) As a US taxpayer, I\u2019m perfectly fine with paying for college tuition. However, I want the system administered at the state level and restricted to the \u201cbook smart\u201d kids. Each state should develop a merit based scholarship program for free college tuition. For an example, see Florida\u2019s Bright Futures. Florida Student Scholarship & Grant Programs The Florida students are required to have some \u201cskin in the game,\u201d e.g. an SAT score of 1290 or better. And as opposed to being focused on \u201cjacking up\u201d their college readiness stats, high schools could be counseling their students on the most suitable post-secondary education path that would lead to a well-paying job. In most cases that\u2019s NOT a college degree. Notes Thomas B Walsh's answer to What percentage of people should attend college?

            "answer_text": "Roughly, because there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, and for the same reason the US cannot hand its citizens bars of gold for free. Education, much less higher education, much less quality higher education, is not a cheap commodity\u2014 someone has to pay for it\u2014 who? But let\u2019s take a different tack. (Are you aware that most states in the United States spend more per capita on higher education, after adjusting for inflation, than ever before?) Because \u201chigher education\u201d in the US is useless to the rough bottom half of the Bell Curve in intelligence, however you define it. A great deal of people (regardless of where they fall in intelligence) are likely better off as plumbers, electricians, CAD operators, or any of a large variety of useful, practical trades and endeavors. At this point, the United States has created a very large pending student debt crisis. At least $1.2 trillion is owed by borrowers, nearly 1/3rd of borrowers are in default\u2014 and probably half of this will not be paid back. It did this by telling its population that higher education was the answer, that by studying French Literature (with copious amounts of beer) you would get a better job, and that the practical trades are lesser endeavors\u2014 that a bricklayer is somehow not capable of being equal to a professor of anything. Put in more specific historical terms, the US did this by progressively making \u201chigher education\u201d of all types, closer and closer to \u201cfree\u201d to pursue, largely by expanding guaranteed low-cost student loans and other subsidies to \u201cinstitutions of higher education.\u201d The result was that students loans in particular were essentially guaranteed, easy to get and easy to get again, interest on the previous loans deferred, as long as you enrolled \u201csomewhere,\u201d regardless of the merit of the institution or program of study. The natural result of this is that those who could not find a job to pay the rent, took out government-backed loans to pay the rent, and took courses on the side as a requirement of remaining on the dole. And they did so the next semester and the next semester and the next and the next, often right into their 30s. No doubt, as their left-leaning professors continued to teach them that money, capital(ism) and business were evils. As this occurred, of course, the costs of higher education in the United States also skyrocketed. Increase demand, price must go up, and it did. In many cases, dramatically (note: in constant dollars, elites like Williams and Harvard cost essentially what they did in 1972, and in some cases, less due to cost-control by their administrations.) In Germany, for comparison, only the relatively top 1/3 by achievement, has access to a low-cost (taxpayer funded, that is) university system. In the US, the first tier of institutions, and most of the elites, essentially are free for those in financial need, who have the same level of achievement as the top third in Germany\u2014 and absent public funding, the financing comes from families with enough wealth to pay for all. On the other hand, the handouts above caused the sprouting of huge secondary and tertiary tiers of higher education in the United States. For instance, at the third tier, the US has a large number of public universities which charge $20\u201325,000 per year (in loans; there are often also the hidden costs of public subsidies) and graduate only 2/3rds of their enrollees in 8 years. That\u2019s roughly $150\u2013200K, plus subsidies, plus lost income, to spend 8 years pursuing degrees. A scourge of for-profit colleges, charging as well if to fit a variety of budgets, often selling nothing but dreams to students whose abilities mean no employment in the field of dreams will come\u2014 many of the latter, have collapsed from mismanagement or been closed down for fraud. I\u2019ve actually discovered students at some of these institutions, assigned coloring books to fill in. (The students in question, were drawing their crayon assignments on the porch of a bar). As long as the financial aid checks are rolling in, and the administrators are paid, who cares? Administrative positions and salaries have, of course, ballooned at all levels of institutions, along with climbing walls (which are cheap), gelato machines and all sorts of creature comforts which are not. (The new dorms at Cal cost nearly $20K/year for a room\u2014 they do have saltwater pools, right?) Now, let\u2019s try to imagine what would happen, to this already ludicrous system, if instead of cutting off the spigot of public aid (in essence, student loans are free for the bottom tier that will never pay them back), we pour yet more water into the sieve?
