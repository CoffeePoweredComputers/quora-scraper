            "answer_text": "Besides the oft-quoted need for Filipinos to never forget the lessons of history and that it\u2019s a duty and service to the country, I\u2019d like to cite three other reasons: Studying history allows us to gain valuable perspectives on the problems of our modern society. Many problems, features, and characteristics of modern Philippine society can be traced back to historical questions on our colonial past, as well as our pre-colonial culture. Our export-oriented economy, for example, can be traced back to the ending of the galleon trade and the subsequent liberalization and tying of the country to the world market, coupled with the lack of industrial advancement in the islands. This and other lessons can be uncovered by digging deep into the country\u2019s past. This also applies to other countries\u2019 histories, and while studying the past may not actually present a solution to current problems or directly answer questions, they lend new and alternative perspectives to current situations and allow us to further understand current problems. History as a discipline allows us to see beyond textbooks and see the past through new lenses. There were times in the Spanish colonial period where the clergy and religious orders assigned to the country were the ones causing misery to the Filipinos, while there are times when the Church truly cared for the natives and the government was the one doing the people harm. This is an interesting part of our history that sadly reaches the textbooks in a boring, oversimplified version that says all the Spanish were bad. If we cling to what the textbooks tell us then we will already have a wrong understanding of Philippine history. The study of history allows us to see beyond the standard textbook and to the primary source itself, interpreted into new and alternative viewpoints. Philippine history is in and of itself very interesting. Philippine history is a unique narrative of colonialism, reaction, and revolution. It is also a culturally diverse country from precolonial times. There\u2019s an emerging trend to study the social history of the country (i.e. more on the day-to-day experience of the Filipinos during certain periods) and uncover more stories beyond the usual stories taught in schools across the country. The country\u2019s experience of colonialism, the rise of nationalistic feelings, and the people\u2019s subsequent reaction may allow us to gain more perspectives on nationalism and revolutions. ",

            "answer_text": " I remember I had the same teacher for 1st and 2nd grade, and she did great. She\u2019s a great teacher who helps me learn to read, build a strong foundation and to do my best. Oh boy I remember reading book about the history of the Philippines in my early age. It\u2019s great to know such stories of how our forefathers lived and sacrificed together to create the foundation of our country. We got the country because of these people. I believe that they deserve respect and admiration for their accomplishments. Why Philippine history is important to learn? Are our schools failed patriotism? History is important in education and should be studied for several reasons. First of all, if you take a moment to think about it, the past has value to our society. It helps to show how we\u2019ve gotten to where we are now, and understand why our country is not progressing for many decades now. Our view of history shapes the way we view the present, and therefore it could be easier for new generations to preserve history and pass it on into the future generations to know what has really happened in the past. Just by doing this, as a result, it dictates what we should do. Philippine youths should be aware of their own respective culture to know the history of their own country. Therefore, the country\u2019s history should be kept in mind by educating the youths about this awareness so it will then keep fresh in their minds at all times. Maybe this will help Filipino people why they keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. I strongly believe that we must show every child in the Philippines what they need to learn and know about their own country\u2019s history, so that our children and our children\u2019s children can live by the truth. I think it\u2019s definitely crucial for Philippines youth to have a good understanding of our history. To understand the importance of being truthful to others, especially young ones, there is no doubt that our future leaders will become competent and honest to its people. If we want to help make sure our country a better place to live, strengthen growth and confidence, we need to create a better honest society. We do need to do all of that, it\u2019s vital to the future of our country. \u201cThe life of a nation is secure only while the nation is honest, truthful, and virtuous.\u201d Frederick Douglass said. In my opinion, these people who do not know their past and heritage are not as patriotic as those who do. Simply stated, patriotism is a personal display of love and devotion to our country. It\u2019s very obvious patriotism is not enough in our schools. Our schools must teach Filipino children patriotism and be given patriotic exercises. Learning more about the history of your country will not only strengthen your love, but it also displays a deeper longing to understand your country. I do question our Philippine leaders and anyone else\u2019s patriotism with a most humble heart, have we been displaying patriotism? For example, where was the outrage of the Filipino people during the Sabah standoff?? Our so-called leaders do not have the courage to make the tough decisions handling this kind of situation. The word Patriot has different meanings to different people. Bur for me the term \u201cPatriot\u201d simply means an intense love of one\u2019s motherland and a passionate devotion to it. In my personal opinion, yes, patriotism still does matter to me. I have never seen a more embarrassing example of the government current administration actions regarding this matter. It\u2019s a sign of leadership failure. It seems like everything is wrong and is so untrue. It seems evident to me that most of our leaders don\u2019t know a lot about our country\u2019s own history. These are the things that bring disgrace to us all. Well, I think it\u2019s much more better than pretending to know things that you don\u2019t know. In this regard, they should blame themselves for their ignorance of the Sabah claim. Because of this ignorance they cannot protect the security of Filipinos overseas. It\u2019s the government legal duty to protect them. As leaders, their most sincere responsibility is the security of their own people and to defend the country against any threat. The public has lost faith and trust in our political leaders. Barely one has confidence that our leaders and the government have the ability to fix our ongoing problems with our country today. We need to correct the government\u2019s conduct. To show love for our country, it\u2019s our responsibility to questions our government leaders, and most importantly we need our leaders to do the job required of them. Every citizen can be patriotic, everyday citizens can make wonderful patriots. And to be patriotic means something different to everyone. Being a patriot doesn\u2019t have requirements, but it does require a love of country. Patriotism is not simply showing up to vote. You\u2019re voting because the best opinion you can voice is at the voting place. It\u2019s the people\u2019s right to free themselves of a government that becomes unhelpful for the sake of our children, our children\u2019s children, our future, our country\u2019s future, our freedom and yours.
