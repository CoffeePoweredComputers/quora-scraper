            "answer_text": "If you want to learn Arabic in order to understand the Quran, then no worries. Allah will gradually give you the understanding which you seek, as there are many apps and e-books which contain Bilingual Quran in most languages. As a western Muslim, I can attest to the fact that you do not need to know how to speak Arabic in order to practice Islam. If you are looking to learn for travel, business, or to communicate with friends and family, then in this case, there are many websites which you can learn Arabic. First, you must figure out which form or dialect it is that you wish to learn. Two major dialects are Maghreb and Levantine Arabic, as well as each specific country having its own subdialect and accent. (Ex. Egyptian Arabic) My recommendation is to start with YouTube. There you will not only find lessons to learn Arabic, but this way you can also see the way the speaker moves their mouth, as well as their body language. Also who doesn't like free? After you have a basic understanding of simple phrases and words, I would recommend sites such as Mango Languages, Langfocus, and Duolingo to start learning grammar and writing structures to gain an advanced understanding of the language. Aside from that, the best way to learn a language is always human interaction. Visit a local Middle Eastern restaurant or supermarket, talk with native speakers. Social media is also a great way to meet native speakers. I wish you luck on your endeavors and inshallah you will gain the knowledge which you are in search of. ",
