            "answer_text": "Question: Whether you can change the Date of Birth in your Tenth Certificate? Answer : It depends what evidence you have to substantiate and corroborate your claim that the date of birth mentioned in your tenth certificate is incorrect and the one you're looking to amend is indeed the correct one. Once you have accumulated the requisite documents to prove your case, send a legal notice to your school as well as the concerned board of education of that particular state or whichever board was applicable. The notice should contain the averments of your claim, photocopy of supporting documents and a time frame within which they must reply or make amendments asked for. If within the specified time frame you don't receive a reply, you can approach the Hon'ble High Court having territorial jurisdiction over the school / relevant board by way of Civil Writ Petition under Article 226 and 227 of Constitution of India or Hon'ble Supreme Court under Article 32 of Constitution of India, to direct the concerned school / board to make amendments to your certificate. Prove your case on merits before the Hon'ble High Court or Supreme Court, as the case may be, and the Court will direct them to make amends. For further information on relevant laws in India, visit Advocate Saif Mobhani. P.S. The aforementioned information is not intended as a legal advice and should not be treated as such. Further, it does not entail any client-attorney privilege. ",

If they do do well and good other wise the alternative lies in getting the same corrected by means of a civil suit thereby obtaining an order from the court directing the board to make the said correction.
