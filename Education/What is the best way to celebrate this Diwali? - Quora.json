            "answer_text": "Diwali is a festival of lights that is generally celebrated only one day.     I have read many stories and essays from my childhood that why this Diwali is celebrated and what happened all.... Something good won on Bad or evil. Go and have a nice head bath, Sit alone for sometime and have a peace of mind for new thoughts to arise from this day that makes you grow yourself better than yesterday. But it's just still celebrating Diwali is something that burning crackers in the evening with heavy sounds and lights making lot of pollution. Children are must enthusiast in burning crackers because they are still children and don't know much about this environment.. And pollution... So, what I meant to say is crack less go green more... Enjoy with the family spending along with them.... Have Pooja in your home that makes all your relation bond go strong with no evils. Go green go clean... Crack less. Thanks for reading. ",
