And while my attendance record was probably somewhere in the 90 percent range it was definitely under 100. I\u2019m a college dropout and I\u2019m very anti-school. But I love learning! Reading is my favorite thing to do (almost). So why am I telling you all of this? Especially since I was one of the laziest people in college? Because right now I\u2019m working 12+ hour days trying to get my business off of the ground. Most of my breaks from it is for other work and I\u2019m happily expecting to be able to work longer per day on it in a month or two. Why the change? I went from uber lazy to happily being a workaholic. Was it some inspirational change? Did I force myself to do it? Is it voodoo magic? Nope. It\u2019s actually insanely simple. I care. That\u2019s it! I care about my business and I have a lot of different reasons to care. I believe in what I\u2019m doing and that it will help people. I also believe that I can make it into a success, which by extension means that I will be a success. I didn\u2019t give a rats ass about school. In fact, studying or doing homework was quite literally one of the most excruciatingly boring experiences back then. My study schedule was something like 20 minutes of forcing myself to get ready to do it 10 minutes of self-loathing 30 minutes of reading while my mind wandered elsewhere 5 minute break 10 minutes of not knowing what the fuck I just went over earlier Another 20 or so minutes of self-loathing Anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes of anger about having to deal with this stupid bullshit Like, seriously, you\u2019re literally paying thousands of dollars in debt for the privilege of having a full time job. And if you live in America they\u2019re also going to tell you how racist and sexist everybody else in the world is. It honestly pisses me off just thinking about it. Unless you\u2019re going to be a doctor or a lawyer or something like that, college is worthless. Find a technical school or just go network for the job you want. Or even start a business if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like to do. Sent from iPhone ",

Discover what works for you; there\u2019s different ways of organizing. Some people are visual, some more kinesthetic or intuitive. Maybe doing the most difficult study first works for you, so you feel the next part is a kind of relief/reward (the veggies are eaten, now I get dessert). As an example, some people organize books by size; others by color; others by subject; kinesthetic, aesthetic, or intellectual approaches. Different streaks for different freaks. ",
