            "answer_text": "Your question is contradictory .. there is the basic theory you need (Electricity, DC circuits, AC circuits).  You need to have basic calculus to understand AC circuit theory. If you want to build real projects, you need to understand electronic devices (resistors, capacitors, transistors) and electronic design and construction techniques.  Most EE textbooks skip any construction details, as they assume you'll learn it in lab.  Most Hobbyist books focus on a \"cookbook\" approach that depend on you having access to the specific parts. If you are in North America, the best book for electronic beginners is the Forrest Mims series from Radio Shack (Getting Started in Electronics).  Don't try learning/building projects from \"Make\" magazine ... they are slopplily done and full of errors. If you're in Europe or India, I'm going to have to defer to people that live there. After you've mastered the basics, the absolute best text for non-Engineers is the \"Art of Electronics\" book by Hill & Horowitz.  No math needed other than algebra. ",

Here is suggest a good for practicals and some basic concepts. https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://electronicsforfun.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/6/5/17652675/practical_electronics_handbook_sixth_edition.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwjs2P_ZzfPTAhVKto8KHfA0BE8QFggmMAE&usg=AFQjCNGjmFqlnnexu4HXr8oEdJyNA0oPDQ&sig2=m_TNNsS4dwDAieBQWMMEPw But still i believe that we can\u2019t learn such things from books. Now we have everything availabe on you tube. Here is some links for practical electronics which are very useful. Please learn all this with doing it practically BASIC ELECTRONICS TUTORIALS: BASIC ELECTRONICS TUTORIALS - YouTube Beginner Electronics: Beginner Electronics - YouTube NPTEL Basic Electronics - Prof T.S.Natarajan: NPTEL Basic Electronics - Prof T.S.Natarajan - YouTube This last one is comparatively hard and big one but it is worth. \u270c Good luck !!
