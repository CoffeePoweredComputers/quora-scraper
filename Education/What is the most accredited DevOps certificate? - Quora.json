            "answer_text": "There is not just one correct answer to this as most certifications that you will find from institutes and online courses are all accredited. There is Intellipaat which is a renowned training institute with experienced subject-matter experts available 24/7 and at the same time, very affordable, Coursera with very good trainers, Simplilearn with blended learning, etc. All of these are great but I would suggest you to go through their online tutorials first as you might be having certain expectations out of the kind of training that works best for you. For DevOps training, I came across this tutorial which is very popular on YouTube:  You can reach out to the team and see if they have something suitable for you. Finally, I would like to add that in addition to taking up a DevOps course, you will have to be open to learning from various resources as well. There is always something new and interesting to learn on the internet. The world is your oyster. Good luck! ",
