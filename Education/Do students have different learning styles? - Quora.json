            "answer_text": "No. It is true that there are numerous theories suggesting that Learning Styles exist, but to date, there is not a single theory that is actually grounded in science. Of course, every learner is different and unique with preferences, attitudes, behaviours, interests and so on, but none of this can be tied to concrete learning styles. Where most Learning Styles theories suggest that there are somewhere between 3 and 16 different learning styles, the truth would be more like either of the following: 1. All learners are the same. We all have the same evolved brain that works the same way. We all receive information and process it the same way. We all have the same internal, neurological mechanisms for storing memories and recalling those memories. Thus there is only one type of learner. 2. Every single learner is unique. We each have a unique combination of an incredibly complex set of characteristics, traits, preferences, behaviours, interests, attitudes, intelligence, experiences and so on, such that no two individuals could ever be put in the same box. Every learner has a unique style. Thus, there are literally billions of types of learner. Whichever position you take, the idea of categorising learners into 3 or 4 or however many groups and teaching them according to this designation based on no real scientific evidence is absurd. ",

            "answer_text": "Howard Gardner popularized the idea that we have learning styles and in many ways it\u2019s helped educators recognize the learner as unique. However, learning styles are not grounded in the learning sciences. What we do have for sure are preferences, based on our past experiences. If a learner is used to taking notes, for instance, doing something radically different may make them uneasy. Change is scary for some people but learning is by definition a change in the brain. As a learner who generally gets anxious with new learning experiences I\u2019ve had to train myself to embrace change and understand that that is how we learn. As recent Nobel prize winner Richard Thaler points out in nudge, \u201cchange is how we experience life.\u201d So hopefully thinking in terms of learning styles won\u2019t keep learners from embracing change.

You have to discover it to maximize your potential..Here are the different learning styles: Visual learning well through images Auditory learning well through music, sound, rhyme, rhythm, speaking or listening Reading/Writing learning well through reading or writing the material you want to learn Kinesthetic learning well through body movement / sense of touch Students will easily survive in school if they are aware of these things.

Then, I\u2019ll take down notes and use my pens to join related topics. However, it was only recently that I learned about learning styles. According to VARK\u2019s Model, there are four different learning styles: Visual, Auditory, Read-Write, and Kinesthetic. If you want to know more about it, then you should take time to read this one: 4 Different Types of Learning Styles: Which Learner Are You? ",
