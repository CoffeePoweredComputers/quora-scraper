            "answer_text": "Oh did they ever\u2026 I\u2019m 63 years young. When I was in school at a young age, teachers were allowed to hit students and back then, most parents were okay with it. I think it was somewhere around 7th or 8th grade, just before I went into high school in 1991, that they began handing out permission slips for your parents to sign, giving permission for teachers to hit students. Back then, the majority of parents signed the consent, allowing educational personnel to meter out punishment, but that situation has since changed and in my humble opinion, it is for the worst. My first experience of a student fighting back was while I was in grade school. I\u2019m pretty sure it was either fourth or fifth grade, and that would have been 1964 or 1965. Our physical education (P.E.) coach had taken names for kids interested in joining the basketball team and although I had signed up, I really wasn\u2019t all that serious about joining since I didn\u2019t really like basketball, but being on a team was a cool thing to do, so I had signed up. One of the other kids to sign up was a kid named Carlos Signs. He was a Mexican kid who was in a local gang and he was one tough cookie. I don\u2019t exactly remember what happened in this instance, but somehow the coach was offended by something Carlos had said and the coach grabbed Carlos by his neck and forced him against the wall, getting ready to give him a good walloping. Carlos broke free and proceeded to kick the ever-living crap out of the coach, getting the coach down on the ground and kicking him in the face with his pointy shoes until the coach was a pathetic, bloody mess. None of us did anything to help the coach and personally, I don\u2019t regret it. Reason being, just like cops, he was a so-called tough guy who was over exercising his authority on somebody who was smaller than him (this uttered by a retired parole officer, by-the-way). This is an on-going problem, especially with cops then and even now, where some male jerk who has control issues is given a job of authority and can\u2019t handle it in a reasonable, humanistic way. Carlos was a tough guy and all he was doing was protecting his reputation. The coach clearly had overstepped his bounds and got what was coming to him, and more\u2026.a lot more, since Carlos broke his jaw in several places and fractured other facial bones and an orbital (eye) bone. The other situation I remember very well was also around the same time period. We had this coach; coach Prince, who also had to teach Social Studies. And, as you can imagine, the big jerk taught his Social Studies class just like he taught his sports classes\u2026with an iron fist. Coach Prince carried this \u2018paddle\u2019 with him, which was a piece of oak wood with holes drilled in it, every half-inch or so. I once asked coach Prince why there were holes in his \u2018spanking\u2019 paddle and his verbatim quote was, \u201cSo the meat of the spankee\u2019s butt will suck through those holes and the paddle can make complete contact with the flesh. It\u2019s also for speed, sorta like a flyswatter!\u201d he answered. One particular day, two of our most rowdy students, Pat Grimes and Jimmy Donahue, were doing what they usually did\u2026disrupting class. Coach Prince had had enough and so he pulled both of them up to the front of the class and bent both of them over his desk. He paddled Pat Grimes first, hitting him so hard he nearly threw him across the desk and onto the floor. But, when he tried to hit Jimmy Donahue, Jimmy lashed out and began hitting coach Prince, first hitting him in the neck, totally disarming him, and then simply trouncing him. Not two seconds later, half the class was involved in kicking the sh*t out of coach Prince, since everybody hated his guts. And yes, I was included in that gang who jumped on him. Coach Prince was the worst damaged of the two. He ended up in the hospital from that incident and no, I had no remorse then and have none now. The majority of students I knew back in that time were sick to death of the unequal distribution of punishment some of the teachers were capable of unleashing upon us. And yet, if you ask me today, I\u2019d advocate for teachers to have the right to kick the sh*t out of unruly students who act like jerks. The inherent problem with corporal punishment is in the individual doing the punishing. Nine times out of ten, the person doing so has issues, and most of those issues involve dominance, control, and revenge. If you don\u2019t agree with me, all you need to do is research the history of society\u2019s police departments and the psychology behind them. Thank you for your question! ",

            "answer_text": "This happened in the fifth grade decades ago. A fellow student had lied about me. My teacher believed him and not me, so despite my protestations of innocence he took me to the principal\u2019s office. From there the two of them took me to a small room off of the nurse\u2019s office (who was gone that day) where \u2014 in front of the principal \u2014 he had me pull down my pants and shorts, bend over and grab my ankles and then proceeded to beat me with a belt until my ass was striped red, and black and blue in spots. The shocking thing was after the end of the beating when he put his belt away (after ordering me to remain bent over) and then reached his hand around and fondled my balls briefly and grabbed my cock and stroked it once. I was so stunned I didn\u2019t think to either say anything, or check to see whether the principal was watching or had left. I just remember being frozen in shock and fear. He left and I got dressed and returned to class. Later that night as I lay on my stomach I swore that if he ever hit me again I would fight back. The opportunity came several weeks later. We were at a secluded park, about an hour from my home town, for a weekend field trip. He had somehow maneuvered me into a cabin where he ordered me to take off my clothes. I complied, wondering what he wanted and how I was going to escape. He told me that I had gotten hard as he had whipped me with his belt and he knew I liked being beaten so we were going to have some fun. He said I had done nothing wrong today but he wanted to have some fun anyway, and he loved beating kids until they got all red and began sobbing. He ordered me to lay down on the bed on my stomach, and spread my legs wide. He reached down and started fondling my balls and had me get up on my knees and he stroked my cock until it was rock hard. (This is how I know arousal and consent are not the same; I was scared and never turned on). He then had me lay down again, took his belt off and told me I was getting \u201csix of the best\u201d and if I took them \u201clike a good boy\u201d and did not move or cry out he would make sure I enjoyed myself. I knew he was dangerous, so I played along waiting for my chance. He hit me hard six times across my ass and then I heard him taking off his clothes. He got on the bed behind me. I knew what I had to do; I spun over in bed and I kicked him in the nuts hard and he fell onto the floor. I grabbed my clothes and shoes and escaped. I got to the park ranger station. Told them a stranger had tried to rape me. They called my mother. When she arrived I ran out and got into the car. I told her I was sick. She left and took me home. I threw up when I got there. Nerves. She never asked about what had happened. I stayed home for two weeks feigning sickness, too afraid to return to school. When I finally did I found out the teacher had been fired; in the interim he had raped one boy and two girls. One of the girls had a powerful father who got him fired. The outcome? This was decades ago at a private religious school. The church sent the teacher overseas (I think somewhere in East Asia). In only found out the latter information several years ago. My last memory of him was him writhing and moaning on the floor. One item: in my haste to leave I forgot my socks. I never did have the courage to go back to the park and find out if they had been turned into lost and found. I wish my innocence could have been found and returned to me, but I lost it that weekend as well. That\u2019s why when my mom\u2019s friend molested and spanked me later that summer I became a willing participant. Given what we now know (with massive abuse in Catholic schools and nearly every major New England Prep school admitting to decades of sexually and physically abusing their students) I\u2019m surprised more teachers and school administrators were not attacked by their students. End the Culture of Cruelty: end corporal punishment in schools everywhere. ",

            "answer_text": "There should be no need for a student to ever fight back because a teacher has no right hitting a student in any way. Anyone has a right to defend themself, but many individuals in today\u2019s society think they can do what they wish and get away with it. Look at how bad bullying has become. Back over 50 years there was a guy that sometimes picked on guys smaller than him. He was a year behind so he was a bigger guy anyway. He picked on a kid that ended up on the floor and a certain teacher saw it. This teacher gave the guy crap and then told him to pick on someone his own size, like him. The guy went on how he could be expelled. The teacher, (An Ex-cop) said he would give him the first swing and gave his word no action would be taken against the student. This guy only flunked one year, but should have known better. When someone is willing to let you have the first swing, without consequences, there is kind of a \u201ccatch\u201d to it. This kid must have thought, wow I can knock his lights out and he can\u2019t do shit. In mid swing the teacher caught his arm and flipped him over a few desks. Back then, everyone felt the kid got what he deserved for picking on kids when he felt like it. In the world today, I don\u2019t think their actions would go over very well. The violent acts against people today are ridiculous. Someone does something, that person gets mad and brings a gun over, if he doesn\u2019t have one in his car and kills the other person because that person disrespected them or something equally stupid. Two families pay the price for years to come. I hope I live long enough for people to realize violence isn\u2019t always the answer. ",

Let me State first, that the school where I teach we do not use corporal punishment. There are no reasons to at this point in society, and due to the constraints of law it would be a bad idea. I personally would not want to do this as a teacher, although I admit to this day their are kids who could use a good \u2018ole spanking. However, I am disgusted by the multiple remarks here regarding the complete acceptance of hitting a teacher back because they \u201cdeserved it\u201d. How incredibly hypocritical! If a student shouldn\u2019t be hit, then neither should a teacher! One \u201cbad apple\u201d teacher can\u2019t possibly equate to the entire barrel of \u201cbad apples\u201d dealt with on a daily basis by every teacher, every where, every day. That does NOT mean a teacher should hit or physically hurt a student, but even MORE SO, a student should NEVER hit a teacher - with the rare exceptions of defense in a situation gone Very very bad. In today\u2019s society, more than likely the teacher would be suspended or fired after investigation. And the student - depending on the situation, probably EXPELLED, as they should be. Hit a teacher, and you are a threat to the entire community. You are not \u201ccool or justified or even anywhere near being right\u201d in doing so. One wrong does not negate another wrong. If there is a single adult in this forum advocating or expressing any kind of acceptance to this form of behavior, likely you yourself need help in your thought process, and God forbid you raising kids to believe the same. If my children were to hit, or even smart mouth a teacher DESPITE the teachers behavior they would be in big trouble at home. I have faith that the administration and school board will deal with the teacher . . . But you can bet your bottom dollar that my child would NOT be told that hitting them back was ok. I am not responsible for the teachers behavior, but I AM responsible for mine AND my child\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "Back when teachers hit students, did students ever fight back? Some of us grew up much differently, compared to the last 30-years. I\u2019m going waaay back to 1968 through 1975. I did thru the years see students thrown out of class, literally, it was great! Many of the male teachers were WW2, Korea and Vietnam vets. I never saw or heard of a teacher hitting a student. We did get wack\u2019s though from the Vice Principal. Sadly, speaking from personal experience, it hurt. Twice in middle school after getting into fights, my options were 3-day suspension or 3-wack\u2019s. I took the wack\u2019s, better that then suspension. Clearly I must have enjoyed wack\u2019s, I went back for seconds. I don\u2019t know if school districts started to paddle again. All through school, I never saw a teacher touch a student in anger. Once I saw a student challenge a male teacher, Vietnam combat vet, bad idea. The student took a swing, the teacher, well, he gently grabbed the student and held him a foot off the ground on the wall. Surprisingly, when a male student felt violence was a answer, other male students shut him down. Reminding the student, punishment would be very harsh. When a situation was becoming tense, the teacher would buzz the office. Within a few minutes, two men would arrive. If the student became physical, they would be expelled from all schools in the district. I suppose someone had different experiences. Teacher\u2019s hitting student\u2019s, no. ",

            "answer_text": "You bet. I was in Year 3 at school (8 years old) and our teacher was an absolute terror. She was short, barrel-shaped and had a vicious temper. She'd hit students without warning on a regular basis. Everyone feared and disliked her One day, when we were sitting on the mat, our teacher told a boy to leave the class for some imagined infringement of her rules. He genuinely hadn't done what she suspected him of and knew that leaving the room meant getting beaten. So he refused to go. She grabbed him by the arm and, as he stood, she hit him in the side of the head. He lost it, yelled and adopted fighting stance. He literally boxed with her, while yelling and crying. I think our teacher realised she'd gone too far. She backed away and got another teacher to escort him to the principal. This boy was a quiet, friendly and somewhat goofy kid. He'd never done anything violent in his life. But he was tired of being hit for things he hadn't done. This event is seared into my memory. It happened 40 years ago but I recall it well. It\u2019s fair to say the student became a playground hero for quite a while. The student didn't get into trouble in the end. His parents stood by him and it was accepted that he hadn't done anything wrong. He went on to become a lawyer, like his parents. I hope he still has that strong sense of outrage when someone is wrongly accused. ",

            "answer_text": "I did in Third grade. I was in the office for some other offense in a conference room with glass windows. Being a bored kid I stood at the glass making faces to anyone who passed by. A teacher saw me and interjected herself by entering the room in which I was confined and grabbed my arm. She had her thumb nail digging into the pressure point where the bicep meets the forearm at the elbow joint. A pressure point and it hurt. I told her to let me go that she was hurting me. She refused. So I hit her in the same spot she was holding me. She gasped and said you hit me. Again I set let me go, you\u2019re hurting me. She refused. I hit her twice more before she got the message. This was before they knew I was autistic and had issues with people touching me. That should\u2019ve been the end of it. It wasn\u2019t. This model of human scum decided to press charges as some kind of example making of me. I had to go to court and the judge forced me to write an apology letter which I didn\u2019t write, my mother did. I refused to do it. I wasn\u2019t sorry I hit her at that point I was sorry I didn\u2019t punch her in the face. I was in full blown aspie anger mode. Moral of the story, teachers are allowed to hurt you but you can\u2019t hurt them. Okay less bitter. Yes this student did fight back. ",

            "answer_text": "My mother told me a story about a young man in her class when she was a student in Italy in 1987. Her childhood sweetheart, who was also the most well known class clown was using the back of his dog tag to reflect light onto the teachers head and obviously the teacher was infuriated but couldnt figure out who was doing it. The lesson continued until the history teacher finally lost his shit and threw a book from his desk, not at the class clown but at the \u201cDunce\u201d. A little backstory on the young man who took the name \u201cDunce\u201d.. he had a learning disability. Back in the day, my mother told me that unless you were physically disabled, you were treated the same as any other kid in the class, no adjustments would be made. You\u2019d just be classed as a \u201cDunce\u201d. Because this young man was fidgeting during the lesson (as usual), the blame was immediately put on him and the teacher began to unleash his rage onto him. He started to hurl punches at the students head and finally grabbed him by the ear and proceeded to drag him from his desk when suddenly the student let out a scream. He put his hand behind his ear to find blood all over his finger tips. The teacher had pulled on his ear so hard that it had started to rib his lobe from his head. The sight of his own blood caused him to body slam the teacher into the desk and run out of the classroom screaming. Of course, the student got the blame and ended up being kicked out of the school. The history teacher continued teaching until my mom left the school a few years later. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in 8th grade, we had a principal who was a monster. I can only remember him hitting a student once. Every other time, he would kick, punch, grab violently etc. One day, he grabbed a student by the scruff of his neck and started to take him to the office. He would have been 13 or 14 at this point and a bit short for his age but also very strong. He was holding him so tightly that it was getting difficult for him to breathe. Out of nowhere, he suddenly twisted around and absolutely whaled him in the face with a punch. Of course, he let go of him right away and this kid ran like hell and didn\u2019t stop until he got home. Now, I was not a major fan of this kid. He was sort of a bully and many times just unpleasant to be around. But I and everyone in the class was thrilled at what happened, of course. We were in a private religious school. In the mornings, we had religious studies and in the afternoons, we had secular studies. The next day, the principal came in to our classroom right before secular studies was to begin. This kid hid under the Rabbi\u2019s desk when he hears the principal coming. Now again, we\u2019re talking about a 13 or 14 year old here. Not a 3 or 4 year old where that behaviour would be normal. The Rabbi realized right away that something was amiss and we filled him on the details. When the principal came in, he asked where the kid was. The Rabbi looked at him straight in the face and told him he didn\u2019t come in today. He later told us that it was permissible to lie because he was protecting someone from being hurt. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh yes. Now I never experienced corporal punishment (it had been banned a decade before I was born here in the UK), but my mother did. She was born in the 1970\u2019s, and went to a Catholic school which had nuns as teachers. I think this happened when she was in Reception (which is the class for four to five year olds). I can\u2019t remember exactly what happened, but I think somebody farted or something like that, and the Sister who taught them demanded to know who had done it. Nobody confessed, so she lined up all the boys and girls and made them hold out their hands. Then she went along whacking their hands with a ruler. Now obviously being hit by a ruler will hurt at any age, but when you\u2019re four or five it\u2019s going to really hurt, so obviously everyone started crying. As my mother stood waiting to get smacked, she told herself that she would not cry. So when the Sister got to my mother and hit her, my mother defiantly didn\u2019t cry. Apparently this Sister was somewhat sadistic because she noticed this, and then made my mum stick out her other hand, or maybe turn her hand over (I can\u2019t quite remember the details). Whack went the ruler, and once again my mother didn\u2019t cry. At this point the Sister was clearly annoyed by the defiance my mother was showing her, and so hit her with the narrow part of the ruler (which would hurt a lot more). At this point my mother lost her shit and kicked the nun, before running to the headmaster (who was apparently the sweetest person ever). While she obviously got in trouble with Sister Sadist, apparently the headmaster was understanding and gave her chocolate. ",

            "answer_text": "Our Principal \u201cSugar Bear\u201d never physically hit anyone. But, he was a stickler for the rules. Example: I drove to school one day. The parking lot was covered with snow. Later, the snow began to melt. I was called to the office. \u201cSugar Bear\u201d said I had to move my car. Why? Because it wasn\u2019t parked between the lines! When I parked the lines were obliterated by the snow! One day we were all crowding onto the school bus, pushing and shoving to secure a seat. Out comes \u201cSugar Bear\u201d yelling, Single file, Single file! He got knocked to the ground. The students were literally walking over him. As he lay on the ground getting trampled, he continued to yell, to no avail. The closest I came to hitting a teacher was in 3rd grade when I turned around to make the class laugh and was whacked in the back of the head with a book. I turned around with my hands balled into fists, ready for action, until I found out the culprit wasn\u2019t the girl in front of me, but the teacher. My friend told me of a fight between a student and a teacher where they were knocking over desks. I never witnessed any such confrontations. A few got paddled, but never did a teacher slap or punch. We never dreamed of hitting a teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "Teachers in bangalore had permission to hit students twelve years ago. Personally I never fought back and took the punishments and cried like crazy, but there was someone I know who did fight back. He was in second grade I think at the time, and he had done something naughty, so his teacher took out the wooden scale to smack him with. He took out his equally long plastic scale and swashbuckled with the teacher. He lead his very frustrated and angry teacher around the room, all the while swashbuckling while jumping on his mates tables. She chased him around the room with the scale, until she was too exhausted to do anything. She gave up and called his parents who turned up at the school heard the story and started laughing. They gave him a pat on the back for fighting back, but I think he was disciplined at home any way. I don't remember,well because his parents recounted this to us a long time ago during a get together. Till date, they recount it with pride. It was pretty funny, and alwaysade me wish I had the guts to fight back to my abusive first grade teacher. I got her sacked, but my parents did most of the fighting. They stopped hitting students three years after that. ",

This occurred at the Merchant Taylors School (which still exists), and it\u2019s part of the school\u2019s long and colorful history. At that time, there was a headmaster who liked to cane students; to be fair, the students tormented their instructors, too, making little paper darts and shooting them so that they stuck into the back of the teacher\u2019s wig without him knowing. Kid stuff. One day, when this guy was going on a rampage, there was a mass student uprising. Since all the boys took classes in the same large hall, it was the whole student body vs. the entire faculty. The boys overwhelmed their teachers and literally threw them out the school windows. They then ran riot trough the school until the watch was called in to quell the uprising. The upshot of this was an investigation, by the board, of how the school was run. Sweeping changes were made. First, corporal punishment was ended at the school. Second, the curriculum was modernized; Biblical Hebrew, for instance, was replaced by French, and practical modern sciences were introduced, alongside basic business skills, without displacing the liberal arts.

            "answer_text": "Yes they did though I never saw it in any of my schools as only the principal could paddle with parental consent and there had to be a witness. I have never had a job ask for my diploma, so I could have lied that I graduated and no one would know. I failed 2 grade in school and didn\u2019t graduate till I was 20. School was very rough for me and I experienced bullying from both students and teachers with my 3rd grade teacher being the worst. Looking back I wish I would have punched a few more kids in the mouth and told off a few teachers. If I did things may have escalated and I might have hit them. While some teachers discipline because they care, often it is about control or because they don\u2019t like the student. My family was poor and I was very skinny so I think I was targeted more. Sometimes teachers want you to cuss them out so they can get you in trouble. It\u2019s better to be smart about it and report it to the principal and the school board, sometimes if all else fails make it an epic event no one will ever forget, call the teacher out on their BS.

For example, my senior year in high school, I made two trips to the car because I had my hands full. New female vice principal decided she was going to threaten me even though I explained my reason. When I told my mother what happened, she just said, \u201c I want you to give this message to the vice principal. The jist of the message was that if you put your hands on my son, I will come to the school and rip your hair out.\u201d This was in 1985. The principal walked by as I was delivering the message. He stuck his head in the room and told the vice principal, \u201cshe's means every word of it.\u201d Then he kept walking. Needless to say, the vice principal never threatened to paddle me again. ",

Although prohibited ( a few years earlier this barbaric Victorian practice had finally been banned), some older \u201cold school\u201d teachers (this one was such a teacher, in her late fifties) still did it. I was a very big 8 year old (often mistaken for 11 or 12). I told her she had no right to force me to use my right hand. She came for me again. By this time I\u2019d had enough, threw a chair at her, hitting her hard on the head. Was suspended for 2\u20133 days, then transferred to another class, with a younger more law abiding teacher. Corporal punishment was legal at that time (1960s), but only a headmaster or vice headmaster could administer it, not teachers. I got my fair share of \u201csix of the best\u201d, to be fair to the school usually well deserved :). I don\u2019t recall ever being punished for something I didn\u2019t do. ",

As with being arrested by the police, being locked up, even (in an earlier age) being given a dozen lashes on a ship of war, it was how things worked. You knew that there was a possibility of being given corporal punishment and that it was part of school life, and if you actually raised your hand to a teacher then you would not be staying at that school and would probably end up at a worse one. On a visit to my old school with some fellow Old Boys, a generation after leaving, we took a look at the punishment book from the mid 1970s which the Head had kindly dug out along with some other memorabilia. I saw with interest that one pupil had received three strokes of the cane for \u201csquaring up\u201d to a teacher - and I contrasted this thoughtfully with the conduct of schoolkids in the modern age.

He was a small guy when I knew him, so he must have been absolutely tiny as a freshman. Regardless, he knocked the teacher to the ground. That was his last day of school. He dropped out. He got into being a mechanic and did okay for himself. When I first heard this story, I figured he was just a blowhard making himself sound tough. My mother verified the story. She went to the same high school at the same time. I would suggest that something like this is something of a rarity. Students likely just took their lumps. I should point something else out here\u2026 there are still states in the US that allow for teachers to hit students. It happens hundreds of thousands of times per year. I don\u2019t agree with it.

My husband did cut the teacher\u2019s cane up and attempt to smoke it like a cigarette.His teacher never did discover what had happened to the cane till they met up as adults. When I began teaching, only the Principal or his Deputy could use the cane.Each incident had to be carefully recorded in a book. It was rare for someone to be given the cane and was the \u201clast resort\u201d where all else had failed.Caning was finally stopped sometime from memory in the late 1980s where I taught. Since that time, discipline in schools and general respect for others has gone down the gurgle hole.Life is now about Rights, but no accompanying Responsiblities. ",

I can't remember the story very clearly, but somehow they ended up outside, in a full on brawl, with everyone watching from the windows. If I remember correctly, the student won. The teacher never bothered her again, and maybe not any other student, either. She got suspended for a few days, I believe. But that was it.

There was plenty of reason to fear him, but no reason at all to respect him. The one lesson the boys learned from him was that if you are bigger and stronger than someone, you can beat them and hurt them. One day, some of the older boys - eighteen years old - saw this Brother beating a younger boy, and they realized something. They were not little boys any more, they were young men. They were bigger and stronger than their teacher now. They took him behind the bike sheds, and let him have a taste of his own medicine. There were no repercussions. The tough guy teacher who instilled fear into the boys was not about to admit that the boys had instilled fear into him. ",

Not the normal zoomed in breast photos I\u2019m talking full on up skirt photos (don\u2019t ask how I don\u2019t know) so naturally we were livid we confronted him he denied it so we went to the superintendent he said it was probably just a mistake so after a month of trying we gave up or so I thought, the next day some of my friends had posted the pictures on the schools main board with some letter above it. (I\u2019m not stating details it\u2019s brutal) and about an hour later I see the same guys beating the ever loving shit out of this guy ",

Because the bottom line was, at our private Christian school, we knew our teachers hit us not so much because of whatever infraction happened or they believed happened, but because they enjoyed it. Being elementary students and their favorite victims, we could only hope they eventually got bored of hitting us or that their arm got tired. Trying to fight back would only anger them into what could very easily be a lethal rage. We were told it was \u2018discipline\u2019. I realize now that we were dealing with sadistic monsters who took the job just for the joy of brutalizing children. I do remember one vice-principal who paddled me for desperately biting someone who was crushing me so badly I couldn\u2019t breathe, and God help him if I ever run into him again. ",

ADHD maybe, but I can\u2019t really remember and I can\u2019t be bothered to ask my mom. Anyway, the student didn\u2019t face any charges. ",

My Grandfather was a veteran from WWI with four years in the trenches. He was also from a volatile Northern Irish family. He was a quiet gentleman most of the time and small and wirey. He obviously knew how to fight as I understand the teacher never dared touch Dad again. ",

Primarily one of the most important reason for this, according to me, was back then there was a sense of fear among students for teachers probably because they would think that getting beaten up by a teacher is a part of a student's life and there is nothing they can do about it. But now things have changed and students are more aware of their rights and now you can't just punish a student by beating him/her. ",

I wasn\u2019t a particularly badly behaved child, but I could honestly not count the number of times I was beaten (although I don\u2019t think I was ever beaten unfairly - you broke the rules you knew what was coming). During my 10 years there I can only once remember a student striking back at a teacher. Needless to say, he was summarily expelled. ",

If anyone got into a fight with a teacher everyone labeled that person as a troublemaker and you just stayed away from that person. It was never fist fighting.
