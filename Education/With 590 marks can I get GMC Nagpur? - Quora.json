            "answer_text": "First of all I\u2019ll tell you that 590 is a decent score in NEET 2020. You should be assured of getting into a Government Medical College in Maharashtra, provided you hold a domicile and have done your class 10th and 12th from Maharashtra. But my friend, when we talk of GMC Nagpur, its one of Maharashtra\u2019s finest Medical Colleges, and is more coveted than many other Government Medical Colleges. So considering the high demand of this college, to be honest there are very FEW chances of you getting into this particular college, if you\u2019re a general category candidate. This is not to dishearten you, but to acquaint you with the truth. If you\u2019re OBC NCL then there is a chance of you getting into this one. SC/ST candidates can surely make it to GMC Nagpur with a score of 590. Hope this helps. :) ",
