            "answer_text": "Suppose you have a B.S. in Computer Science from Harvard. The B.S. in Computer Science is the certification, Harvard is the accreditation. Certification is the statement that you know it. Accreditation is the statement the person who says you know, knows it themselves. If you get certification from a non-accredited source, then it may raise some eyebrows. Did you really deserve your certification? Is the group who certified you a fraud? Accreditation makes your certifications look stronger. ",
