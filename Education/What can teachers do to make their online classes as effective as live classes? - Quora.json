            "answer_text": "Foremost, the audio quality matters the most. If the students are unable to listen the details, they won't be interested in the session. Also, as a teacher you've to make the session as interactive as you can so that students don't distract from the class and in case they get distracted, they can fall back into class. Ask more and more questions so that the students stay alert. Take daily quiz or tests on the topics covered by you. Also, the timer helps students to keep track of class online. I hope this helps. ",
