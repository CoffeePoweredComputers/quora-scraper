I will not prefer it over vedantu but over all the offline institutes too\u2026no one can withstand with competition with unacademy as soon the the time will pass.. On unacademy top educator of evrything is present \u2026for physical u can approach physical chem expert teacher for inorganic approach inorganic chem expert for organic u can approach diff.. For inorganic unacademy is having top faculty like piyush maheshwari sir and dn singh sir \u2026 Pmmsir who is senior faculty of bansal classes kota\u2026. Brijesh jindal sir for physical ..actually noone can withstand with him in teaching physical chemistry \u2026 For organic , greates of tye greatest Mohammad Kashif Alam ( prerequisite of his lectures : u cannt understand if you are not above mains level , else you have to read topic from ncert before class ) Now coming to maths section \u2026..its the section where there is no end of top faculties\u2026. Like Manoj chauhan sir Mohit tyagi sir Sameer chincholikar Vineet loomba Om sharma parshant jain (especially for kvpy and olympiads..) Now for physics \u2026.. One and only DC PANDEY \u2026is there Kailash Sharma , if u dont even know basics go to his class and stay with him for 1 month , you will see that you are at advanced level. Then Jayant Nagda i have never seen teacher like jayant nagda his passion and simple way of teaching physics\u2026 then we have kamlesh soni sir..aman dhattarwal.. Guyz list of rockstars is endless u cannt even imagine Guyz here u can follow all top teachers and access all there dpps.. I can extend this answer to as much lenght i want \u2026becz unacademy plus platform is unbelievable\u2026.. If u r thinking to join it..then stop think and move ahead and join and see the real teachers\u2026.. UNACADEMY IS UNSTOPPABLE .. Just one drawback is for those students who watch the lectures all day like 12 hrs 13 hrs even 15hrs..actually thats not good and we should avoid that\u2026 # great unacademy Unacademy Uncomparable ",

            "answer_text": "I have not used vedantu personally but I will tell that what they don't have when comparing to unacademy. TeachersUnacademy have the best of the teacher from the country. They have great teachers like Manoj Chauhan, Mohit Tyagi, Aman dhattarwal and many other great teachers. Which I had seen vedantu does not have. They are far behind in terms of best teachers and need to work harder. 2. Flexibility to choose teachers Unacademy provides the best facility to select your teacher yourself for a day , month or a year without any issue . You can change teachers everyday . Vedantu does not provide this facility also. Since it's a great feature to select your teacher yourself . So i think vedantu and other platforms should implement it. 3. Pricing Unacademy provides full year subscription for JEE at only 25000\u20b9 meanwhile vedantu for the same takes around 1lakh \u20b9 which is four times higher than unacademy. So it's also a big edge for unacademy to provide affordable education. 4. Extra features Unacademy along with regular classes provides test series which are discussed live with each and every question discussion. Weekly quizzes , seperate doubt clearing classes , practice session, and teachers provide there material also which is top notch. Vedantu I think does not have all these features. Which is again needed for JEE preparation. ",
