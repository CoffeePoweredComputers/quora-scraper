I cannot speak to whichever job you are applying for specifically, but at least when you apply for anything requiring clearance at least, you need a certified resume. Not to worry, they can and will certify that for you. This not only involves contacting pretty much every company you\u2019ve ever worked for in detail and many people you know, they will most certainly validate any educational claims with the same level of specificity. Calling what they do a background check is like calling a route-canal, brushing your teeth. They can and most likely will leave no rock unturned. That said, if you\u2019re just going to get a job sorting mail, it may not be so bad, but I only have experience with the above. Hope that helps. Good luck. ",

You never, ever had a fake degree. It is not on your resume. It appears nowhere in your employment history or records. You never asked this question on Quora. We never had this conversation. There, now you can go have a successful career without any stupid \u201cfake degree\u201d nonsense lurking behind you like a time bomb, ready to explode and ruin your life at any given moment. I AM NOT KIDDING AROUND HERE. Many people have been fired when it was discovered that they used a fake degree, even if it was many years into their career. The higher the position they held, the more quickly they came crashing down. Nothing saved them. There was no excuse or defence they could make for using a fake degree. Nobody likes a fraud. Don\u2019t make the same stupid mistake so many others have. Don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d a fake degree. Why would you put your entire working life at risk for something you derive little benefit from, that can be so easily discovered? ",
