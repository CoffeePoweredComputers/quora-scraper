            "answer_text": "Scholarship, in general, is accessible fund for those who either excel or have potential in specific study or purpose. Not having high school diploma would appear as not being able to focus and withstand the study and experience, which majority of people commonly go through. Hence, it might put you off the list even if you apply regardless of your side of story. Not to mention many scholarships are prioritized for domestic students over intentional, if you are interested in scholarship from SK, you'd have to prove yourself - life as a grown-up has been constant challenge of proving myself come to think of it. Not knowing what to study is somewhat natural in your age, having various experience might give you some general idea, it is something you need to figure out responsibly over the time. Of course, you don't have to devote yourself in specific subject btw. There are many scholarships available through smaller organization and privately operated fund. They usually have very specific eligibility and purpose, you do need to search for them though - the college/university usually have huge list, amount might not cover entire expense though. If you had your own reason and circumstance for not being able to finish high school, don't be discouraged. There's alternative way to acquire highschool diploma if you ever need one, not to mention it isn't the end of the world. Some industry puts more value in experience over academic history, academic success doesn't necessarily mean general success after the study, although school is great place to develop network and such. If you have trouble keeping up with the study, I'd dare to say that you haven't met descent teachers who can accommodate. Now, if you just dropped out for nothing or due to the behavior, there's huge - almost guaranteed - chance of not being able to survive in SK. Note that level of study is vastly different - I took the same entry level highschool courses in colleges once I moved to US and that's about 20 years ago - amount of time SK students, both post and pre secondary education is ridiculous - I spent 14\u201316 hours at the school in my first year of SK highschool. Competition is absurd, there's would be detailed list to see how well you did in class, entire school, and nationally based on academic success after each test. Minimal physical activity, having fun outside of schoolwork is rare, only to extend that much of effort once you progress into college, where many fail to keep up since there's no longer outside intervention. You are still very young so take your time if you can, and try to see general direction where you want to go with some breathing room, so you can change the direction if you'd like to. However, make sure to keep in mind that you have to earn with hard work and effort unless you are filthy rich, which case you can literally buy your way out. ",

South Korean schools are just as hard and if not harder to get into than regular American colleges. To actually go to school in SK, you\u2019ll have to provide them with transcripts of your high school grades and different test scores. ",
