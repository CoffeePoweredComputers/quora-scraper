            "answer_text": "They should teach in a style recommended for ADHD, along other style, namely get the kid interested in the subject matter. Give the student reminders to write stuff down, including homework, future tests, etc. Give breaks. Ask the student what they\u2019d like as a fidget and don\u2019t penalize them for using it. Give them focus boxes and timers on tests. Give creative time where the student can make leaps between the subjects to form interrsting questions and essay topics. Help the student research those questions and essay topics, because chances are, they will teach themselves the subject matter and then some. But encourage them back to the topic if they\u2019re doing it during another subject, though allow them to do their chosen topics rather than busy work or sustained silent reading (we love reading, but have you ever tried to read when you\u2019re distracted by every page turn that happens in the classroom, or by too much silence, or by people clearing their throat?) Let the student sit how they like, to avoid being actively uncomfortable. ",

            "answer_text": "A good teacher will recognize that immediately and provide some type of physical activity or fidget to offer a degree of comfort to that student. Another alternative is to use proximity and stay near the student. That\u2019s why knowing your students is so important- no child is one size fits all- you have to know what works best for that child, and the only way to find out is to try different options and see what works.
