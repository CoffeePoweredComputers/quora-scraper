Aurobindo do has a more better faculty than PGdav but it lacks behind in proper infrastructure and the crowd that comes there . PGdav's Infrastructure and crowd is far better than Aurobindo College .As one should not only look at the faculty but other aspects also,the mistake that i did . Moreover PGdav is located at better location than any other college ,which also makes a big point to go there . ",

            "answer_text": "Well pgdav is the better choice instead of Aurobindo because it is very close to metro station vinobhapuri almost 50meters apart and nearest to Lajpat Nagar market for better connectivity and you'll enjoy a bigger campus in pgdav and wonderful societies their canteen is largest among all the Du colleges according to seniors and approximately that's true it has good teachers and better classroom than shri Aurobindo and a very big playground. There is no fest takes place in Aurobindo college due to lack of playground area so the better option to choose pgdav instead of Aurobindo . ",
