Of course, it's so uncool thinking and talking about history and you just focus on memorizing facts. You go beyond that: you seek meaning and relevance when you know the context. However, context can only be derived, understood, and used to your advantage if you spend time reading, writing, studying history. I know that's a lot of work, especially if you're already hungry, poorly paid, being taken advantaged of, or being largely ignored. It's up to you.

When you learn very well enough, you have better chances of having a great future.
