            "answer_text": "Good question \u2013 most broadband providers will have you believe that you need unlimited broadband\u2026.they mainly do this to sell their most expensive packages and therefore make the most money from you as a consumer. It is important not to simply fall for the marketing of these businesses, but to be savvy to what you truly need. If you want to save yourself a bit of money you can certainly do this by understanding how much internet you use and therefore find the best package at the best price for you. In your comment, you mention three things: Emails & Internet Browsing For this alone you would probably need around 10GB/month. 5-6 Movie Downloads Movies range from about 700 MB to 1.2GB a piece, depending on the length and quality of the videos. So \u2013 all together you will likely need 16GB for what you mention. However, if you would like the option to stream TV and films as well as the potential to download a few other movies I would look at packages around the 25GB \u2013 30GB range. Although you may pay a little extra for the additional usage each month, it is likely to save you a lot of pain in the long run. Either because your internet will be stopped if you reach the limit or you will be charged extortionately for the additional data. I hope this helps. ",

So it would be a safe to say that you need ATLEAST 5 GB of bandwidth for your connection.  If I were you I'd do a little more than that but atleast 5 GB ",
