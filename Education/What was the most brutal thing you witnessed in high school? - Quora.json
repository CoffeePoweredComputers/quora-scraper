            "answer_text": "This may not be \u201cbrutal\u201d in the physical sense of the word, but I thought this was funny. My biology teacher almost getting into a fist fight with a student in his classroom. We\u2019ll call the biology teacher Dale. He was an old man who rode his bike to and from school every day for a total of roughly 12 miles if I remember correctly. Mind you, I lived in a rich area at this particular point in my life. It was a bit of a shock when a Hispanic gangster kid by the name of Corey moved in with some rich family members or his family somehow came into money, but this kid was straight from the ghetto and was dropped right into the middle of rich, white, suburbia. Everyone took immediately to calling Corey, \u201cGangsta\u2019 Rap (G.R.)\u201d and he somehow thought we were complimenting him. Anyways, one day Dale tells G.R. to take off his baseball cap in the classroom. G.R., feeling the need to represent, I guess, tells Dale he is not going to take down his colors. Dale grabs his hat, throws it across the classroom and G.R. gets up and starts pushing Dale around the classroom and Dale says something along the lines of, \u201cGet the fuck out of my classroom, You\u2019re too stupid to be in my class, you make a maggot look smart on your best day.\u201d The funniest part is, this old, unassuming man would have wiped the floor with G.R. and G.R. knew it because if I remember correctly, Dale begged G.R. to hit him and G.R. wouldn\u2019t do it. So G.R. walked over, grabbed his colors and walked out of the classroom to the principals office just like he was told. ",
