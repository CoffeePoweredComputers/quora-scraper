            "answer_text": "High school has scary moments, for sure. The worst? We had to dance with the opposite sex in gym class. This gets awkward, but everyone turns out okay in the end, and it\u2019s an easy 100% on your report card. Oh, and you might have to talk in front of the class once or twice. Overall, high school is no scarier than middle school and elementary school. The academic expectations aren\u2019t much higher, and within the first month you\u2019ll wonder how this is any different from middle school. The answer to that? You get to choose more classes, and have a wider variety in classmates. That\u2019s it. Social pressure isn\u2019t ridiculous either- a lot of people overestimate it. I worked hard on keeping up my appearance in the first year I went to high school, and then I relaxed and wore sweaters, sweat pants, and the hat in my profile picture most days. Just as they did when I wore tight jeans, makeup, and hair products, my peers ignored me when I changed my attire. High schoolers are generally focused on themselves unless they decide that you\u2019re potential friend material, or unless you\u2019re doing group-work. Don\u2019t believe me? If you asked this question, you were wondering whether you were going to make it in high school, just like the others your age. There is only one big thing to stress about when it comes to high school, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do after you graduate. Be friendly to others, and go to class. If you do that, you\u2019ll be just fine. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what movie you watched but in reality high school life is far from what being always portrayed in movie. High school movies always get dramatized or exaggerated in the story to attract or impress the audiences. These are common things you will find in high school movies in any country : Male protagonist is always handsome or female protagonist is always pretty or beautiful girl.Students in high school can wear very casual outfit. If the students wear uniforms, they will not wear them properly. Girls are allowed to wear revealing clothes like mini skirt.18 year old boys or girls look like 20 or 25 year adult men or women.There are always popular student who dominate the whole school. They can decide what to to do to other students and it seems that they are the rulers in the school.Girls are crazy about bad boys in the school.Teachers almost don\u2019t exists in schoolWhen the bell rings, all students suddenly leave class in no time.Students can make perfect speech as if they know all things about what they say.All students do is making party or having fun.Students talk to teachers like they talk to their friends.Realities in high school : There are very few handsome boys or pretty girls. Most of them have average looks.If your school orders students to wear uniform, all will dress properly and eventually all students look like snob. No girl in any high school would come school wearing revealing clothes.Students don\u2019t look like adult. They look like teenagers and most of them still have childish looks.There are no popular students, some students may be popular but will never reach the same level of popularity like in high school movie. Most students don\u2019t care about that.Girls despise bad boys.Teachers are everywhere, they are the rulers of school and not students.When the bell rings as sign school is over, students take time to clean up their desk before leaving class.Almost no student dares to make speech, if students are instructed to make speech they will be nervous as hell and they will be almost speechless.Students don\u2019t do party or have fun, they study and look stressed.Students will talk to teachers very politely and will not talk in the same way like when they talk to their friends.High school in reality actually looks more boring and dull and not as fun as you always watch in movie.
