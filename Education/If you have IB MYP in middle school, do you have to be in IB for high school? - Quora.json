            "answer_text": "Depends on your school but generally no. In my school, both the MYP and DP programs were mandatory but you weren\u2019t forced to be a candidate for the DP (you took all the IB subjects but didn\u2019t took the exams). There are schools that only offer MYP, some offer only DP and some offer both. They aren\u2019t really correlated. MYP does NOT prepare you for DP. The workload and rigor of the programs are miles away. You\u2019ll suffer in DP whether you come from MYP or not. And not everyone who\u2019s in MYP goes into DP. Hope this helped! ",
