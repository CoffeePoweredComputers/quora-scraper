            "answer_text": "The last 20 years I taught, I had all honors classes. My kids\u2019 test scores were great! My bestie taught at-risk kids. Her kids\u2019 test scores were, well, awful. Does that mean I\u2019m a better teacher? What if the situation were reversed? What if one year my bestie and I switched schedules? Suddenly, she would look like a fantastic teacher based on test scores, and I would look like I\u2019d suddenly become completely incompetent. Another factor to consider is how far you can move students in a year. Let\u2019s go back to my bestie. She was great with at-risk students. They might start a school year reading at the 5th grade level and advance to the 8th grade level by the end of the year. She led those kids up three grade levels! As 10th graders, they were still below grade level, but they made a big improvement. My 10th graders might have begun reading at the 12th grade level and ended the year at the . . . 12th grade level. That doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t an effective teacher\u2014it just means the test topped out at the 12th grade level. I think I learned a lot about my students by studying their test scores; the same was true of my friend. Of course, we weren\u2019t under threat of losing our jobs if our kids couldn\u2019t score at the proficient and advanced levels. When you can see the kinds of questions your student do poorly on, when you can see what wrong answers they chose and analyze them for a pattern, you can fine tune your instruction. Unfortunately, most of the time teachers don\u2019t get that information, and if they do, they certainly don\u2019t have time to analyze it. I like the analogy Marc Mularz gives: kids aren\u2019t blueberries. You can\u2019t send back the substandard ones. You\u2019ve got to work with what you get. Only some of us are lucky and get the best blueberries. ",

            "answer_text": "The use of student evaluation of a teacher to measure a teacher\u2019s performance makes it into a popularity contest which I would definitely have failed since I had a reputation of being a hard, demanding and no excesses accepted teacher but then the students who earned a passing grade from me also did very well on their standardized test and their advance research papers. If a means of gauging a teacher\u2019s performance is essential or necessary and it is, the best may be a combination of average of course grades, mandated test results (given that all core subjects are to be tested and admin teacher evaluation based on a minimum of two different evaluators. Student evaluation is just an added commentary. There is a correlation between class grades (scores) and mandated test result (scores). If the overall class grades are higher and the overall mandated test scores are lower then there is a possible problem there and vice versa. Yes, I\u2019ve heard teacher complaints that students can do poorly on mandated tests but since they are required for graduation purpose, I don\u2019t really see too many students deliberately failing the mandatory testing. Besides, students are not blueberries and how you treat them and teach them makes all the difference even if you are a real hard-ass with them. ",
