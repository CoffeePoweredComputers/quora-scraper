            "answer_text": "Listen if u seriously want to start from now , then there are two ways to do that , First of all, if u are not at all prepared for anything , that means u are not ready with ur syllabus then keep everything aside(including ur gadgets too) and just go through NCERT again and again u should do it for 3\u20134 times then u shall go to the previous year papers and solve some papers of theNTA app frequently.Secondly, if u are prepared with ur syllabus and feel confident enough then also keep everything aside and just head towards the papers . Solve as many as you can , but after every paper spare around 1\u20132 hours for complete analysis. Try to spare atleast 6\u20138 hours of quality study time for urself .That's it , now you can head towards the NEET Examination Hall comfortably and please just don't think about 600+ everytime. Try to stay fresh for your exam . It all depends upon you how you deal with urself and the paper Infront of you.Finally I would like to say \u201c STUDY LIKE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING TO LOSE , BUT ATTEMPT THE PAPER LIKE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE\u201d. Thanks and All the best for neet ug 2020. ",

U should keep on revise the topics what u were already studied. \u2206for CHEMISTRY read rk Gupta (arihant publication ) also solve qns in it.then also if u think you are having more time solve errorless book qns and at last time of preparations revise all concepts and formulas from arihant chemistry handbook. And solve the 32yrs MTG CHEMISTRY. \u2206for PHYSICS it is more important you should not keep on changing your studing materials you should BE constant . Study in DC PANDEY PHYSICS(ARIHANT PUBLICATION) throughly practise the examples also in it.and already I said in chemistry if you have more time after solving all qns from dc than u solve errorless qns(it is more).at last revise all your concepts and formuls from arihant physics handbook .and solve neet 32yrs MTG physics. ALL I ABOVE MENTIONED IS MORE ENOUGH TO CLEAR NEET . ONE THING IF U SOLVE EACH AND EVERY QNS FROM ERRORLESS(USS) EASILY U CAN ACHIEVE 600+++ \u2206ONE THING IS BE CONFIDENT AND CONSTANT IN WHAT U STUDY AND WITH WHICH U STUDY\u2206 And ALL THE BEST FUTURE DOCTOR ",
