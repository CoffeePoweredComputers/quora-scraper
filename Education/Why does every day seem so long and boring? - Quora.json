            "answer_text": "Basically, you are living without a purpose that doesn't excite you. Learn to live towards accomplishing a purpose that excites you. Which helps in stimulating your brain and that keeps you active, giving you a sense of accomplishing something. Your goal/purpose can be about working on your health. It can be about working on your communication skills. Learning a new hobby. And probably you will end up asking why? What's the use? I would only answer that you have to keep growing as a human for this life to be interesting. Once you stop, it will start to get boring. It will start dying. Choose it for yourself, if you want to grow or die a slow death? ",
