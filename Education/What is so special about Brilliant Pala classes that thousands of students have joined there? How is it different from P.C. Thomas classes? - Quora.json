They know that you are already under pressure and they support you. You have your freedom, supportive class teachers with whom you can discuss anything, 4 pillars who are very helpful, a good library, coin boxes to call home. While most of those who have studied in prof. PC Thomas compare the institution to a jail. ",

In my opinion,the teachers for our batch are perfect.We are also allowed to give our feedbacks about the classes to Prof.P.C.Thomas sir and he is available when we students need them\u2026 I dont know what is that \u2018difference\u2019 from Brilliant Pala\u2026But i love our teachers and their classes at P.C.Thomas Classes\u2026.;) ",
