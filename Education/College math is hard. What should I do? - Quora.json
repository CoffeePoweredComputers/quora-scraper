            "answer_text": "What do you want to do? Do you want to keep learning maths? Then keep learning maths. Do you want to quit? (And by this question, I mean, is the subject actually bringing you real anguish?) Then quit. You have to weigh up what the consequences might be for the things you want to do. If you are intent on becoming a physicist, but your mathematical intuition isn't there yet, get yourself some private tuition - seek help and really don't be afraid to ask questions that you feel make you sound stupid. In this kind of stiuation the only stupid questions are those left un-asked. I have a colleague who is just over a year into her PhD in pure mathematics (braid theory, which is quite algebraic in nature). Due to a collection of events and circumstances, she is quite unhappy in her life in this city, having moved here to study. She decided it was all too much and has quit, and is heading home once teaching finishes. Considering what she wants in life and career, this may well be the right option for her. By way of contrast, another has gone between PhD and MS and PhD again because when he weighed it up, the balance fell the other way. He was prepared to change things and stick it out. He is now just days or weeks from submitting his thesis. The key lesson, however, is if you need help, don't be too proud to seek it. Don't be so stuck in a routine to change it. Don't become escapist and turn to anything outside yourself just to cope because it won't fix the problem. Take the time, if you can, to reflect calmly and honestly with yourself and decide what is the right thing for yourself. Keep your head above water, and don't stress too much if you don't have to! ",

            "answer_text": "Life is hard, what should I do? Most things worthwhile, are hard. Mathematics is one of them. The first step is to accept that it's hard, and this is much less trivial than it sounds. We are bombarded by easy-to-understand slogans on tv, in books, etc., and our minds simply reject anything that takes a while to understand.[1] This is, in my opinion, an important reason why people hate mathematics and 'find it hard'.  It's hard when you expect to understand a proof in 2 minutes, like you would any other text you encounter in daily life. It's not necessarily hard if you don't have this expectation, but understand that it may take some time and hard work.  Most college students go through this process of adaptation -- some successfully, some not so successfully -- to a whole new kind of learning, where one has to accept that things are hard. It's very frustrating at first, but necessary in order to become a mature student. So, to summarise: accept that it will indeed be hard, or at least harder than what you were previously used to.  [1] In fact, these simplifying slogans make other subjects, such as politics, history, etc., seem easier than what they actually are. As John von Neumann said, \"If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.\" ",

Don't leave problems unsolved. Understand theory of each topic. Also most importantly take a note of applications of that specific topic.we should learn to apply it.
