As someone who was born in a equally fucked up shithole \u201cwhatever the leading party please\u201d U can do what u want, the more u are someone. U only become someone if u not unplease the leading party folks. If u go for astronomy, maybe something math-ish science related is useful, but this is not necessary. U can also take the approach history-whise, when u focus on the story of great pakistan astronomers or physicist and on understanding there work in regard to whatever brainwash was teached then. This will u help become one of the leading party folks and u can help today astronomers by be there benevolent overseer. I offer u this other way, because if u where a outstanding talent in nature science, u probably would not ask this particular question. Sry if am wrong and upset u. ",
