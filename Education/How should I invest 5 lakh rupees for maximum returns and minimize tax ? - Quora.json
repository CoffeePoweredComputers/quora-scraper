            "answer_text": "It is important for you to understand that maximum returns can only come with maximum risk. Nothing is ever zero risk. No matter how well you understand an investment, equity is always risky. The risk component can be high or low but it's always there. Among mutual funds, equity funds can provide highest returns if you continue investing for long term. However, these funds face highest volatility with daily market movements. Since you are conce about tax saving so it's better you to invest in equity oriented hybrid funds, which are also called balanced funds. These funds invest at least 65 per cent in equity and the rest in debt. The equity allocation of these funds gives them the opportunity for high growth, while the debt component provides a cushion when the equity component fails to perform. However, these funds may look dull, compared to pure equity funds when the markets soar, as they don't fully invest in equity. But they are the best bet of investors looking for a mixture of safety, income and capital appreciation. Therefore choose two good balanced funds and invest in them through SIP. And when it comes to tax savings, There are lots of tax-saving avenues which offers tax savings under the Income Tax Act. These include traditional instruments such as, Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC), etc., which are considered safe avenues however do not generate returns commensurate to meet one\u2019s financial goals. Alternately, you can can park your funds in Equity-Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) to save their tax outgo and accumulate returns over the long run . I hope you find my answer helpful. :) ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to invest Rs. 5 lakhs for maximum and secured returns will be in fixed deposit. A fixed deposit (FD) is an investment plan provided by banks or NBFCs which provides investors with a higher rate of interest than a regular savings account, until the given maturity date. Your money will safe and secured for the entire tenure and you will get your principal amount back at the end of the tenure along with the high interest. But, the problem will arise when you invest the entire Rs. 5 lakhs as FD from one account for 3 years at an interest rate of 7.85%, your yearly interest will be Rs. 43K. TDS is deducted once the interest exceeds the limit of Rs. 10K in one financial year. So, how will you save TDS or tax deduction? You can submit Form 15G/15H, that stats you have no taxable income.You can distribute FD investment in separate banks so that the interest earned does not exceed the Rs. 10,000 limit.You can adjust the timing of the FDs and save TDS.You can invest in FD from different accounts- one from personal account and other from HUF account. This will be treated as different FDs.",

            "answer_text": "Diversification will make sure that you always have an upper hand over taxes and potential losses. So, to be begin with, invest in stocks, mutual funds and peer to peer lending in ratio of 0.5 : 1 : 3.5. I\u2019m giving you this set because stocks are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. Talk to an experienced person who\u2019s been actively invest in stocks for sometime and learn how the market works. That\u2019s the reason for investing least in it. As for mutual funds, they require monthly investments of some amount. Invest the 1 lakh in parts and then keep investing for 15\u201320 years the amount after which you\u2019ll have a substantial amount in your hand. Now for peer to peer, invest the bulk of the cash as this will give you 25\u201335% returns on it. This will be more than enough to satisfy your short term goals. I\u2019m following the same pattern and trust me, it has changed my life. But again, choose a good P2P site where there\u2019s abundance of lenders. LenDenClub is in my opinion the pick of the bunch and that\u2019s where you need to put your bulk. ",
