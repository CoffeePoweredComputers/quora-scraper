            "answer_text": "You don't have to learn everything. Lot of people do not have guts to skip chapters even if they know this is not supporting their intended learning. Learn accoeding to this course http://inex.life/product/inex-results-oriented-learning/ If you still insist to learn everything become a superlearner. You are superlearning when you are thinking about how you learn The definition of word super means exhibiting the characteristics of its type to an extreme or excessive degree (Merriam \u2013 webster). So, superlearners are not just concerned with what they learn, but how they do it. That\u2019s the key to how to become a super learner. I am sure you know that information is not a knowledge. Information is a pure description of an action, but knowledge is action itself. Information is a commodity in this world. The value is in its organization into project structure plans that are supporting your goals. You are superlearning when you take a time to use tools like trello or some other time management tool like monday. When you take your time to pile up the structure that safeguards what information is valuable and what is not. You are superlearning when you are prioritizing what information and knowledge will suit your actual needs and what you can learn later. And especially you are superlearning when you are thinking critically about your subject \u2013 that\u2019s usually the method of first principle thinking. First principles thinking helps you to cobble together information from different disciplines to create new ideas and innovations. You start by getting to the facts. Once you have a foundation of facts, you can make a plan to improve each little piece. This process naturally leads to exploring widely for better substitutes. So, your thinking process may look something like this: An assumption is: \u201cGrowing of my business is gonna cost me a lot of money!\u201dYour thinking process as of first principles can go like this: What do I need to grow my business? I need to sell products and services to more customers! Does it have to cost a lot of money to sell to new customers? Not necessarily, but I\u2019ll probably need access to these new customers inexpensively. How to create a win-win deal? Sell half of my business to a larger partner with a traffic in exchange for access to that traffic \u2013 customers. Whatever your methodology, always think of learning in equation \u2013 Learning = Results that enhance your life.  Superlearning is also about seemingly extrasensory methods of learning I do believe that we should all go back to ourselves to find answers. And I believe that the root of all happiness lies within each and every one of us. It\u2019s in how well we\u2019re able to control of mind for our own well \u2013 being. Do not be afraid to visualize a meditate. Go deeper to yourself to look for the answers. We function on different levels of consciousness. Do not be afraid to experiment with them by learning. There are two great methods: The method of three fingerslistening in alpha modeThe method of three fingers There was a taxi driver who did not use GPS navigation and most of the roads he memorized. He took naps during his shifts and most of the time, in his alpha \u2013 wave mode of consciousness, and he could visualize the whole routes to the destinations. Ti was almost as precise as they were in what we call a reality. He used his visualization skills sometimes when he was not sure how to get to a destination. Then one day a friend told him, that instead of meditation, that involved putting himself into the alpha level, he could use a three fingers trick. If you connect three fingers and command your brain to make a connection, the whole visualization path may be encapsulated into your three fingers. Now, when you put your three fingers together, your brain will trigger the exact reaction, like if you meditated. When a customer came to him, and a taxi \u2013 driver was not sure about how to get to a destination, he put his three fingers together and all of the sudden he triggered the data from visualizations. If you think about it, our brains are creating shortcuts all the time.And we can train our brains to use this shortcuts wisely. Listening in alpha mode This is of course nothing new. I remember watching a cartoon when I was a little kid. Do you remember on Dexter\u2019s lab? In one episode, Dexter wanted to study for his French test. He did not do it the ordinary way of course, but he played a vinyl containing the whole french course and played it while asleep. Being asleep and being in alpha level is a bit different of course, but to finish the story. The vinyl got to stop and it was repeating the whole time: Omelette du Fromage! Dexter woke up the other day and it was the only sentence he was able to say.  So, we don\u2019t want to do it like Dexter, but I had to tell you about this episode. What you do is that you read your information thoroughly in your conscious, beta level state \u2013 rational level. You will record yourself with a deep relaxed voice. Then you meditate, get into your Alpha level (how the hell am I supposed to do it \u2013 click) and play your recording. This method can help you tremendously in effective memorization and storing the necessary information at the deeper level of consciousness. Superlearning is about reading fast with comprehension Superlearning is about speed \u2013 reading and memorizing after all. If you want watch this interview with the Worlds fastest reader Howard Berg There are techniques that help you speed \u2013 read and enhance your comprehension: The SQ3R Method One of the greatest technique that is bound to reading and helps us with memorizing the content and that boosts our motivation and overall understanding is called SQ3R Method. SQ3R stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review. This five-step method is particularly effective for mastering a large volume of technical information from a textbook or professional document. Survey the material by reading through it quickly. Concentrate most on the chapter headings and subheadings, as well as the first sentence of each paragraph, to get an overview. Question yourself about the main points of the text. The more provocative and interesting your questions, the better able you will be to mentally organize the material when you re-read it. Read the text carefully for comprehension, keeping in mind your questions from the second step. Don\u2019t take notes or underline yet\u2014doing so at this stage can actually interfere with your comprehension by interrupting the flow of information. Recite what you have just read, either to yourself or to someone else. Speaking out loud helps deepen your understanding of the material. Now is also the time to take notes. Review the text, as well as your notes, a day or two later. Now, think critically about the information: does it support or contradict other information you know about the subject? Go back to your questions from step two. Can you answer them? Do any questions remain? Review the text quickly several more times over the next several days or weeks to help your brain consolidate and store it. Stop subvocalizing So, one of the great things how to speed things sub is to stop subvocalizing. 5 tips on to stopsubvocalizing. You know, when we were at school , our teachers taught us to read the words out loud, so we get the grasp on them and understand them. We also taught to read the words with our inner voice when we read and basically \u201chear\u201d the words in our head when we read. This is fine, but it is hindering us. This is one of the most crucial technique to work on when you want to speed things up. Simply it takes time to read every word in a head and actually, we do not even need it. Just think about this. When you came across the year 1871 in the text. You would not be probably vocalizing this year Eighteen seventy-one, instead, you would look at the number and understand it just by seeing it. The same principle applies to every word. Words are only labels, the essence of the idea is behind the words. You can train yourself to understand extrapolate just the idea behind each word without subvocalizing the actual word. Therefore, try to be aware of your subvocalizing when reading and stop yourself. It is, however, easier said than done, and it is one of my hardest challenges in learning since it is such a strong habit from school, it does not go out so easily. Rather than eliminating it completely, I tend to think about minimizing it and hoping that one day it will go out completely. There is a great tool online for you to get ahold or to see how a speed \u2013 reading without subvocalizing should look like. It is called https://accelareader.com/ It is an online tool, very simple interface, you just copy the text that you want to read \u2013 and actually, start to read. You actually can set the reading speed in the setting and read the text. There is a no chance of actually being able to subvocalize the words as they go in accelareader. So you get the grasp, that if you want to understand a text at the level of 300 words per minute, which is speedreading, you better stop subvocalizing the words. There are different techniques to help you to stop subvocalizing and they are in the syllabus pdf. One of them is like I said minimizing the subvocalizing not eliminating it. So, instead of a sentence: The boy jumped over the fence.\u201d you read \u201cBoy jumped fence\u201d which is perfectly adequate for understanding it. However, this is still not perfect as it is still subvocalizing. It is a long war, not just a battle, but you probably haven\u2019t even thought about this, as we were all raised at schools this way. So, just being aware of it really can help your velocity in gathering information from reading. Next technique is also very handy. The saccades One of the greatest tool in superlearning when we think of speed \u2013 reading is not reading line by line, but reading by saccades. Reading is done through our eyes and it can be greatly improved. I recommend you that you watch Tim Ferris\u2019s videos on this since he is a well-known speed reader and he is very much focused on saccades. So, every time your eyes are moving, they are sending information to the brain and your vision has to constantly adjust. Reading a line by line takes a lot time to adjust, actually you are adjusting your vision all the time while you read. Your eye has to fixate all the time. This is hindering you again since vision is the most difficult, capacity taking part of the functioning of our brain. So, the goal is to minimize the fixations of an eye. If you cut this down significantly, would it help your speed \u2013 reading? Of course! So, using saccades is really a technique that is chopping the text into three points or saccades where you should point your attention and the text up to that point you should read with your peripheral vision. That\u2019s awesome since by using this technique you will be enhancing your peripheral vision as well. Just, by implementing this technique and working on it, you can probably double your reading velocity. It is a very powerful technique. You should expand your memorization techniques I am not going to write about memorization techniques here. You can watch this presentation. I am collecting memorization techniques here: List of all memorizing techniques that will help you to become a superlearner ",

            "answer_text": "The issue with textbooks is that there's a disconnect between the author, who is a highly respected expert in the given field, and the student, whose knowledge of the subject doesn't go beyond high school classes. For the most part, textbooks are meant to be used in tandem with formal lessons, but don't let this stop you. The best way to actually retain and comprehend the textbook is to translate it from the author\u2019s language to yours. Read the textbook and take notes that YOU understand. Don\u2019t expect everything to make sense right away, but just make sure that you understand the general ideas around the core concepts. Now that you\u2019be finished the textbook, read it again, and take more notes. This time around, since you already understand the core ideas, you should be able to obtain a more advanced understanding of the textbook. The note taking is for you to return to if a concept doesn't make sense or seems confusing. If something doesn't make sense, even after resorting to your notes, use the Internet. Repeat this process until you\u2019re confident that you understand the book inside and out. However, if at all possible, get a teacher to at least be available for when you have questions. ",
