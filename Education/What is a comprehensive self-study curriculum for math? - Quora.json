            "answer_text": "Let's suppose you have the Internet as the only source of materials. These are the sites I would use for start: 1. Khan Academy (from fundamentals to high school and beyond)2. Math is Fun - Maths Resources (covering many Math areas good to high school level - very well organized)3. Arithmetic Practice  (more basic math with a lot of exercises)4. Art of Problem Solving (online courses and many books - all paid) There is this tool that you can use for checking your solutions or getting them during your process of studying:- Computational Knowledge Engine (Step-by-step Mathematical solutions ) You can use this tool whether you need solving: Elementary mathematicsDiscrete mathematicsNumbersApplied mathematicsPlotting and graphsLogic and set theoryAlgebraMathematical functionsCalculus and analysisGeometryMathematical definitionsNumbers theoryContinued fractionsFamous math problems- pretty much everything you can imagine.. After coping with this material you can continue with Calculus. This is more advanced math requiring good books.   1. Calculus - H.Anton, I.Biven, S.Davis2. Calculus with analytic geometry - Robert Ellis, Denny Gulick The last area in more advanced math is Probability and Statistics. I recommend these books: 1. Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers - Douglas C. Montgomery, George C. Runger2. \u0410 First Course in Probability - Sheldon Ross (Prentice Hall, 7th edition, 20052. Probability and statistics for computer scientists - Michael Baron Also there are many books for dummies, that can be very helpful.These resources should be more than enough to a very high level of Math knowledge.
