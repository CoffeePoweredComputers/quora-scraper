            "answer_text": "When you enroll in the verified track for a course, you must use a device to take a photograph of yourself and of a photo ID card that has your photo and full name on the same side. You do not have to verify your identity immediately, but you must do so in order to access any certificate you earn or to take a proctored exam. edX encrypts your photos and uses the highest levels of security available to protect your data. 1.Preparing to Verify Your Identity 2.Verify Your Identity 3.Check Your ID Verification Status 4.Troubleshooting the Identity Verification Process Preparing to verify your identity Before you begin the identity verification process, follow these recommendations to make the process as straightforward as possible. Make sure that you have access to a a computer with a built-in camera, a webcam, mobile phone, or tablet. If you do not have access to these devices, edX recommends that you find out if your local library has a webcam that you can use, or that you borrow a friend\u2019s. Compare the name on your photo ID card to the full name you use in your edX account. Both names must match, including the type of characters used, initials, and spelling. If necessary, you can update your edX account name at any time on the edX account settings page. You also have the opportunity to change your edX account name during the identity verification process. Make sure that your name on your ID card is legible, and that your name and photo are visible together on the same side of the card. If your name and your photo are on two different pages, or on the front and back of a single page, you can copy both pages onto a single piece of paper. Make sure that you have adequate lighting for the photographs. Verify your identity To verify your identity, follow these steps. Go to our secure verification page: https://courses.edx.org/verify_student/reverify At the top of your browser window, a message may ask you to share the camera with edx.org. To see and respond to this message every time you take or retake a photograph for the verification process, select Share Selected Device. To share the webcam throughout the process select Always Share. On the Take Your Photo page, position yourself to take a selfie-type picture with your webcam. Optimal camera positioning varies with each computer, but generally the best position for a headshot is approximately 12-18 inches (30-45 centimeters) from the camera, with your head centered relative to the computer screen. Select the Take Photo button to take a photo of your face. Review your photo to make sure that it is well-lit and fills the available space. If you are not satisfied with the photo, select Retake Photo. When you are satisfied with the photo, select Next: Take a photo of your ID. On the Take a Photo of Your ID page, hold your photo identification card up to your device's camera. Generally, the best position for a photo of an ID card is 8-12 inches (20-30 centimeters) from the camera, with the ID card centered relative to the camera. Make sure that the image of your ID is legible, and then select the Take Photo button to take a photo of your ID. Review the photo of your ID to make sure that it is well-lit and fills the available space. If you are not satisfied with the photo, select Retake Photo. When you are satisfied with the photo, select Next: Review your Info. On the Review Your Photos page, review the photos of your face and of your ID. Make sure that the photos meet all of the requirements listed under Photo requirements. If the name on your ID is different from your edX account name, select Edit Your Name. You must edit your edX account name to exactly match the name on your ID. For example, if your ID shows your name in Chinese characters or Arabic script, but your edX account name appears in Roman characters, you must update your edX account name to match the name on your ID. After you make sure that your photos meet all of the requirements listed under Photo requirements select Confirm. A message confirms that you have submitted your photos. After edX\u2019s authorization service examines your photos, a message on your dashboard informs you whether the verification process was successful. If the verification process was not successful, you must submit new verification photos. You can begin the verification process again by selecting Verify Your Identity. Troubleshooting the identify verification process If you have a problem during the identity verification process, these suggestions might help you find a resolution. Make sure that you are using a supported browser. We recommend current versions of Firefox or Chrome. To take photographs, the webcam uses Adobe Flash Player. You might need to install this application or update to the latest version. ",
