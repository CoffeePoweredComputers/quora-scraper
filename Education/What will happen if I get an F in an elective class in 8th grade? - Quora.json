            "answer_text": "Greetings, Relax! Public schools in the United States routinely practice social promotion. Regardless of their level of academic attainment, students are elevated to the next class. However, once students reach high school, they are obligated to at least pass all of their core courses as well as earn enough elective credits to graduate. Having said that, any student of even the most modest ability is capable of earning high grades if he or she will only hand in most of the assignments, pass some of the tests, and refrain from creating problems for staff. Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",
