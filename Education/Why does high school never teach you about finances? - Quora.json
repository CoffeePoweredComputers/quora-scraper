            "answer_text": "Back years ago I changed schools numerous times. I went to 2\u20133 elementary schools. 1\u20132 middle schools and then 1 high schools (reason for the \u2018range\u2019 is because as my wife points out certain grades pending on the area are considered different things. I.e. my \u2018middle school\u2019 was her \u2018junior high\u2019). In a couple of my schools they taught us balancing checkbooks, budgeting for the week and month. In my junior high they taught us about stock markets and how to follow trends. In between middle school and junior high years, one of my schools taught proper Home Economics. Each school I attended approached the subject differently. So, I went through my education just assuming that each place did things different, but they all did it. Until I got to my high school. They had no stock market classes, nothing for finances not even in their Economics class. They used that class for basically raw definitions and how to pass the \u201cMEAPS\u201d or now \u201cMSteps\u201d in my state. I asked some students and a few teachers about it. My thoughts where maybe it was only a junior high or middle school thing for them. I was informed that it was not a subject taught to their students at all. Shocked, I asked them why? Keep in mind that at this time I was attending vocation school for Marketing Education offered through the county, as well as being a Senior. They told me, they didn\u2019t have the money for it, and some were honest and told me the administration didn\u2019t feel there was a \u2018need\u2019 for it. I felt close to one teacher, he was one of those \u2018everyone needs a second chance, and you only dumb if you think you can\u2019t do better\u2019 types. The teacher talked during a free period and told me that my vocational classes were only offered because the county helped fund it. Beyond that, most of the students, the \u2018administration\u2019 felt would never do more than be; farmers, military, factory workers, or \u2018do nothings\u2019. So they thought it was better to use the money they were saving to buy new sporting equipment, and cheer leading outfits. He also stated that the administration was forcing more and more teachers to drop anything that wouldn\u2019t be on the state test. They needed students to take the test and pass with a certain margin. Some places do teach it, just maybe at lower levels. But more importantly is most don\u2019t feel the need. Schools don\u2019t think there is a need for it, because they don\u2019t believe their students will ever need it. And to some, it\u2019s more important to flood the school with new sporting equipment than actual classes. Sadly in a a lot of schools with standardize state testing, it also comes down to only teaching what will pass the test to get more money. Doesn\u2019t matter if the students will need something or not, but the school needs them to past the state test. ",

            "answer_text": "I have to start by saying that I absolutely despise the insinuation in this question. Honestly, I know that U.S. schools don\u2019t always do the best job with these topics. That being said, it is, and has been even since back in the stone ages when I was a high school student, part of the standard state mandated curriculum, at least where I live. Every time I see this implication on the Internet somewhere I have to wonder where the heck people went to school or just exactly how truant some people were. Granted, this was prehistoric times before the Internet, but I remember learning how to balance a checkbook and make a budget in an 8th grade consumer math class. I took my state mandated 9 weeks of high school consumer economics in the summer to free up my schedule a bit during the school year. It was taught by my Accounting teacher. Yes, I went to public school; and yes, I took an accounting class. I graduated high school with a full understanding of assets and liabilities and have taught those and many more valuable life skills to students over the years. I\u2019m extra excited to have a semester of Financial Literacy on my schedule this year as I feel like I have the opportunity to shift the curriculum for the next generation. I\u2019m currently developing a unit on digital assets for my students as that will likely be part of their retirement portfolios to a much greater extent than preceding generations. Sometimes, even high school education can be cutting edge. There are plenty of exciting opportunities for high school students to engage in and develop strong economic thinking skills in both dedicated classes and woven throughout the curriculum. However, I have to stress this point very clearly. Teachers are NOT financial advisers. It really isn\u2019t appropriate for us to teach students what to do with their money other than to make sure they understand how all the options work. Although, that doesn\u2019t mean we deny them opportunities to simulate those choices. Also, teachers, on average, in America, do NOT make very much money and may not be the best exemplars of building asset wealth. Most of us do this to supplement our pensions; but the small margins we can afford to put into a 403b or IRA early in our careers pale in comparison to the employer-matched 401Ks coupled with social security often found in the private sector for our equally educated peers. Hence, don\u2019t threaten those pensions. They are a public promise to civil servants and the only hope many have of independence in retirement. There is also plenty of online content available to young people to help them learn these concepts and your bank probably has a program for adult learners. Whatever you do, please encourage young people to take this coursework seriously. It has the potential to open up more equitable access to asset growth and generational wealth in ways that can help mitigate many of the ills in our society. ",
