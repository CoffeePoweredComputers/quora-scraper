            "answer_text": "By most accounts, it is the accomplishments of the students that matter rather than the identity of the high school. However (there is always a \u201chowever\u201d in questions like this!), private schools collectively are over-represented by a few hundred percent in highly selective colleges. About 10% of high school graduates come from private schools but fill about 30\u201335% of openings in Ivy League colleges. Adding up all the openings in USNews&WR top 15 universities and top 15 liberal arts colleges comes to about 40,000 openings. This represents about 1% of all college Freshmen. Nonetheless, some private schools and a few public schools send 20\u201350% of their graduates to these schools. What is going on? There are two components to the explanation. The first is self-selection. Many private schools enroll mainly bright, advanced, highly motivated students. The curriculum is tailored to students who have already demonstrated high academic achievement. The second is the philosophy of the school. At my children\u2019s K-12 private school, a meeting was held for new parents. During the QandA, one parent asked why more of our graduates were not getting into Yale. The headmaster gave a remarkably candid answer. He responded \u201cI have bad news for you. Almost none of your children will go to Yale. We are very proud of the one or two per year who do (out of ~45) but we are equally proud of less capable students who are doing their best.\u201d He added that the measure of a school was not the number who get into selective colleges but the number who are doing their best. The school embraced very rigorous academic standards. Grading, in particular, was tough. More students were likely to achieve National Merit recognition (Finalist and Letter of Recommendation) than they were to achieve High Honors (about 30\u201340% of the former, 20% of the latter). Acceptance by highly selective colleges reflected this level of achievement. Most of the students who achieved High Honors earned acceptance at USNews&WR top 15\u2019s. About half of students who achieved Honors (half of 25% of the class) did the same. In one recent class, #1 went to Dartmouth, #2 to Princeton, #\u2019s 3\u20136 to Harvard or Yale and others to UPenn, Pomona, US Naval Academy, Duke and Wellesley. Some of these students achieved these acceptances not only without graduating 1st or 2nd but also without being the top student in even one academic area. The levels of achievement that gave these results would - if carried out at a public school - likely be equally productive. However, only a handful of public schools apply equally demanding academic standards. ",

            "answer_text": "Private schools are generally smaller in enrollment than public schools; in addition to smaller class sizes, it also permits a better opportunity to get to know the student. This may seem like a trivial point until one reads a letter of recommendation for the applicant. Taking advanced placement classes or having excellent facilities and connections may be the lure for attending a private school, but the value is getting increased placement at \u201celite\" institutions for college matriculation. Some families like the prestige of an exclusive secondary school. It presents as our family is doing well completely. It is sort of like looking at how well dressed parents dress their children, to see if they are really doing well. All of this is childish and is why so many children break loose once away from their parents outstretched arms reaching to helicopter around their every move. The other advantage of a private school is the expectation of continuing one's education beyond high school. Just as parents who attended college prepare sooner for their children to attend college; private schools run an assembly line to get all of their students placed at a four year institution. I wish I could say that discipline problems are fewer, but that would be anecdotal at best. Parents may be more involved, or at least someone representing the household is engaged. The money to provide opportunities is not in question. Even if a student is on scholarship, there is something to learn from this mini melting pot that will serve as a sample size of what the next four years will look like on their college destinations. Some will argue that the smaller class sizes make ranking in the top ten percent of the class very difficult. It matters what you want to major in, where you want to go and what combination of needs makes the best fit for you to be successful. Sometimes the larger state schools with the rest of us is actually the beat place for one to succeed, without an extra pressure to live up to an impossible standard and actually thrive. The stereotype says that one must attend the right schools, or else the \u201cstandard\" is broken and someone may actually question your competence to run the family business. I hope this helps and that you are safe and healthy. Good luck! ",

A 4.0 from an ordinary public school carries more weight than a 2.5 from a famous private school. If a student from each school had a 4.0 it could still be a toss up. What other activities have they done? 4H or FFA can mean a lot. Have the parents donated or might they donate? ",
