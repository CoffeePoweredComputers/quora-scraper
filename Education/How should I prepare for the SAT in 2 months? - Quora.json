            "answer_text": "Study. Religiously. All the time. Intensely. Don\u2019t put it off, and work your butt off on it. I took the SAT at the end of Freshman year. I scored decent (1420) but I knew I could do better. I took it two more times, imrpoving to a 1470 and then a 1520. But I never studied. I never looked over what I should have. As a result, I improved in English (which I became better at because of living in the US) but I decreased in my Math score (from a 770 to 720). Then came the January of Junior year. I was signed up to take (my last) SAT for the purpose of taking the SAT essay during May. But I wanted to score well. So well. So I studied. I got the SAT book and cranked out a math test every week. Then I studied with online videos. It was really easy, as I was finishing my Calculus BC class at the time. The math wasn\u2019t an issue- it was formulaic. And when the test came, i felt fantastic. I ended up getting a perfect math score. 1550, thanks to my previously improved english score. But it only came because of studying. I couldn\u2019t do it by walking in and winging it, even though I know so many friends who did just that. I used the same technique to self-study my butt off for the Math 2 subject test (780) and Molecular Biology (750). I don\u2019t think I would get over a 700 without spending a month in the practice books. I also tutor the SAT nowadays. I find a lot of people need someone to help them, either to review concepts they have long since forgotten, or to teach them the ways of smart test-taking. Consider finding a tutor if that floats your boat. And yes, it\u2019s just a test. Other things will weigh more heavily on your application. But you seem to care about the test, so please take the care to do well. And if you don\u2019t perform your best this time? Take it again. Superscoring does wonders. ",

            "answer_text": "YES, very much feasible. You just need about 100+ hours of preparation to ace the test. That can definitely be achieved within 2 months range, even though ideally three months will be a good time. Please review SAT in detail to understand the content / syllabus for each section of the SAT exam. Even if you had taken SAT, it will be helpful if you revisit this and review if any section you had missed out, etc. Refer Which books are the best to prepare for the SAT preparation? and select one for your preparation. I would personally recommend Barron\u2019s. It is a bit harder than the actual SAT, but it is better to write a harder mock test than the easier one. So if you are in a time constraint, don\u2019t get demotivated by the mock test results. You can conclude SAT preparation, by taking Official SAT Practice Tests, published by College Board, one by one and try completing all of them. This gives you practice to remain concentrated for full exam duration and also help you in bridging the knowledge gap. Practice makes you perfect and also gets you used to the rigor of actual test. Take the most recent one, answer as if you are doing in a test center and within the prescribed time. Evaluate your answers, you have scoring sheet and also explanations to answers available.Review all wrong / guessed questions and understand how you can get them right next time. Take the next practice test, adopt this iterative approach, until you complete all official tests and will definitely improve your overall score. ",

            "answer_text": "With dedication and diligence, two months is sufficient for preparing for the SAT. There are many factors involved such as the starting score and the ideal score that the test-taker wishes to achieve. Nevertheless, following a proven SAT program or any well self structured program, any test taker can make improvements on the SAT within two months. The higher the test-taker initially scores, the harder it will be to improve. It is much more difficult to improve from a 1550 to 1600, compared to improving from a 1000 to a 1050 due to the amount of knowledge and luck needed to score a 1600. Simply put, it is possible to prepare for the SAT in two months, and the lower the beginner initially scores, the more they can potentially improve with time. Of course, with a two month time limit, one cannot expect to improve from a 1000 to a 1550. Therefore, any type of improvement that can be made will be relative to the initial score. My estimates for improvement with two months of good practice. 1000 -> 1200 1200 -> 1350 1350 -> 1450 1450 ->1500 Disclaimer: This content is based off of my prior experiences, results may vary. ",

To ensure that your preparation is very effective, you should prepare a plan. List down all the areas of SAT and put them in these 3 buckets: Excellent: No help or preparation neededGood: Little brushing up needed along with some help and practiceNot good: Need lot of help and practice.The last bucket is the most critical one and you should focus most upon. It is important that you ideally get hold some good tutor for these areas who has knowledge of SAT. If the in-person ones are too expensive, then you can go for online SAT tutoring. There are multiple companies that provide this, but one such reputed one is called eTutorWorld. The best part about them is that they will help you make a plan for 3 months with complete personal attention. All the sessions will be 1-to-1 personalized and customized based on your need. Maybe it\u2019s a good idea to get started by taking a free trial lesson with them and then making a call. in the free trial, you can very clearly mention that you are looking for SAT prep help. ",

Begin reading The Atlantic articles. Read them on your phone or print some out and put in your bookbag. They have a written flow that really feels good as you read them. Their articles are interesting, too. That's going to help you with the reading, writing, and grammar for the test. There is much more to the planning of your study schedule, but essentially the key is to take time to learn what you did wrong on your wrong questions and what you did right on your correct questions of your practice tests. Even if you only learn one or two new concepts, it will make more of a difference than you think. Don't time yourself until you have increased the number of problems on a practice test that you get correct by, say, 10% of your original score. Write down each of the math and grammar mistakes you make and re-solve each problem a day later, and then a week later. Do not take any new practice tests within 7 days of your SAT. Just rework a few of the same problems and questions you already took. Relax the day before the SAT. If you are not satisfied with your score, study more, and retake the SAT a second time. Most students do. Good luck. ",

Buy a book or 2, create an account on Khan Academy (an excellent tool that helped me immensely) and do A LOT of practice tests. Initially, start with the basics: revise some grammar, vocabulary and basic Math, move on to more advanced topics and make sure to develop a lucid understanding regarding the test format itself. SAT is all about strategy and time management. You must really learn to focus and maintain that focus for long periods of time. To do that, every day should be filled with some kind of SAT-related activity (read a text, solve a problem or 2,\u2026) You should really intensify your practice at the second month and ease up at the end. Khan Academy is a website that allows you to create your own daily practice schedule which you monitor and you adjust according to your needs. Use whatever tool you have at your disposal and you\u2019ll be fine. Good luck. ",

However, the majority scores much lower. The majority has weaker English skills. The majority is just plain average. Thus, being the majority or average. I would argue it\u2019s a good 2\u20133 years for a beginner to do well. And that\u2019s with diligent effforts. However, for the elite of top test takers, yes 2 months is possible. P.s. you also just ask about whether you can prepare.
