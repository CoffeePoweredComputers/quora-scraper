            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about the rest of them, but this one deserves one billion dollars. I\u2019m kidding. Mostly. No, teaching should pay enough to attract highly talented and capable people. In most states, salaries are so low that lots of people who would be fine teachers pass on that job and go do something else. The nationwide teacher shortage: Why America\u2019s teacher shortage is going to get worse is real and growing. We have more and more students every year, and fewer and fewer people going into education. Something\u2019s got to give. You fix this by paying teachers comparable wages to people with similar education in different fields. Everyone knows the job is hard, but if the pay was equivalent, you\u2019d get far more takers, especially when you throw June, July, and August into the mix. Unemployment rates and earnings by educational attainment Folks with a master\u2019s degree, like me, make about $1836 a week. Multiply by 52 and you get an annual salary of $73,164. Employment, wages, and projected change in employment by typical entry-level education Here, they put the number at $68,090. Teachers in my district at the top of the scale with a master\u2019s degree, like me, make more than this. By a little. But only old farts get this high up on the scale anymore, and our new contract makes it so that many teachers might never make this much money, even with a Ph.D. And this is average. I work in Michigan, which is nearly always in the top five highest paying states for teachers. In some states, folks with master\u2019s degrees make half the national average. How much should teachers make? $1 more than the salary required to fill all of the teaching positions with amazing people. The extra dollar is for an apple - gotta have one of those on the desk, right? ",

            "answer_text": "Given the value people claim teaching holds or should hold, I think teacher pay should more or less match a decent STEM major\u2019s pay. For simplistic numbers based on half remembered (and probably outdated) statistics, starting salaries in the 50k/year range, increasing to 100k/year plus with additional responsibilities, training, etc, sounds about right. I\u2019d be more focused on reducing the teachers outside classroom hours workload than trying to pay them based on the \u2018overtime\u2019 they tend to put in. I\u2019d think that reducing the standardized testing and homework loads would help there. Reducing class sizes could help as well; I\u2019d rather have more teachers working reasonable hours than overpaid, overworked teachers. I also have some slight concern about giving too high a salary attracting people who are only in it for the money. I\u2019d also give each teacher, or maybe each \u2018department\u2019 (create groups for each curriculum, math, science, english, history, etc), a decent budget on a semester or yearly basis to buy school supplies, improvements for their classrooms, whatever (hell, buy some candy to hand out to kids if they think that\u2019s a good use of it). Letting them improve their own rooms and make them \u2018their own\u2019 might encourage teachers to stick around in one place, which could help lower class schools. I\u2019ve heard that some states/counties have problems with retaining new teachers; you create programs to encourage and pay for people to become teachers, they finish up their obligation to teach in your jurisdiction and then move on greener pastures. From what I hear about how much BS goes on in school districts, they could probably pay teachers that much right now without increasing overall costs if the sacked a bunch of useless bureaucrats who are pulling down larger salaries than the actual teachers without contributing much.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve attached a link and several graphs at the end of my response from an article by Eric Hanusek called \u201cValuing Teachers: How Much is a Good Teacher Worth?\u201d He advocates salaries several times higher than today\u2019s salaries for teachers if teachers were compensated based on their effectiveness. He talked about several thought experiments where he developed charts indicating how much the economy would improve if poorer performing teachers were replaced and how much he thinks effective teachers raise a student\u2019s life time earnings. He is really advocating for a radical redesign in how teachers are hired and evaluated that would be more on the business model that industry is based on. Pay teachers what they are worth and justify this increased pay by measuring what a teacher is worth based on how a teacher increases lifetime earnings potential of their students. I feel changing the paradigm of education in this manner would address two long term well voiced complaints about education. Teachers are under paid, and teachers aren\u2019t valued or respected as a profession. There is no doubt in my mind that in our society respect is reflected by compensation. Take the medical profession. The medical profession regardless of controversy is hands down more respected than teachers are. This higher esteem and value is measured by money. It really is. The question is do teachers have the same value and deserve the same respect as doctors? Indulge me a minute and let me answer this question. Most American doctors spend a few minutes to write a prescription for a medication and send you on your way. They don\u2019t discuss diet, activity, habits, or look at you in any holistic way. They focus on symptoms not the cause of symptoms. They don\u2019t try to change behavior or even educate really. You got a problem they will try to fix the symptom. They want you in and out in an assembly line fashion. Even the pharmaceutical industry has a huge influence on the quality of your medical care. They want to sell you drugs for symptoms not cures or prevention. They influence doctor\u2019s treatments. Health insurance influences the quality of your treatment. All these factors and many more have made the American medical business model\u2019s focus to be on treating symptoms for maximum profit. Get you in and get you out. Teachers are concerned with the whole person. Teachers want to develop the individual to be the very best version of themselves by becoming as adaptive as possible and as skillful as possible in whatever academic area is the teacher\u2019s focus. Good teacher\u2019s even go beyond their academic focus to encourage a student to discover what their strengths are and develop those areas of potential they never even knew they had. Teachers are creating the future whereas doctors are trying to maintain a person\u2019s health by treating the symptoms of poor health. Teacher\u2019s even teach what doctors should teach. Teacher\u2019s teach how to prevent poor health. Teacher\u2019s teach what a healthy life style looks like. They teach what a healthy diet looks like. How to make good life decisions. How to find good information. How to determine bias in information. Where to get accurate information. How to make critical decisions. How many times have you ever heard the question, \u201cWho was the teacher who influenced your life the most? Now have many times have you heard this question, \u201cWho was the doctor who influenced your life the most?\u201d How much should a teacher be paid? Several times what they are now would be my best guess. I recently had a discussion with my wife on this very subject. I\u2019ve met so many business people who\u2019ve had wealth in the millions. They weren\u2019t even the brightest or most talented nor worked as hard as a good teacher works. In contrast the very best teachers I\u2019ve ever met never had wealth in the millions at least from teaching. In fact, their salary was no different than the least effective teacher based on experience and level of education. My wife and I discussed what if we used our intelligence and passion and skills to make money instead of how we\u2019ve spend our time working in the service field. How much money would we have? Well the answer is more than we have now. http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-how-much-good-teacher-worth   ",

            "answer_text": "This is very dependent upon where you are working and your level of education. Also the strength of your union is an important factor. Larger cities tend to pay more; however, the cost of living in those cities can make it feel like you are earning less. Also consider, commuting expenses or whether or not you are required to live in the city. Chicago requires you to live in the city but there are some nice affordable neighborhoods. San Francisco seems to be more interested in building public housing for teachers rather than paying them a living wage. San Francisco is so expensive, the city is spending $44 million so its teachers won't be homeless At the end of the day, you need to do the math. If your teaching income is a second for your household, it is usually an economically sound career path. If you are on your own, you need to do the math very carefully. Look at the starting salary; look at your debt burden; look at the cost of living in the community. If you can live comfortably and save for the future in a place where you want to teach, go for it. You won\u2019t likely ever be a millionaire, but you can live well and hopefully retire with a decent pension. You won\u2019t have time to do much other than teach, so make sure you will be satisfied with that. Also consider the pension formula. If you are guaranteed something after 10 years, you may want to teach for 10 years and during the last couple of years pick up a degree for your next career that earns you more money. This can be particularly good if you don\u2019t have a ton of student loans. Pick up extra duties and set aside that cash for your next degree. Again, you need to figure out what makes sense for you. Some districts treat their teachers very well and have a solid tax base and almost never have contract disputes. Other districts make teachers battle for every scrap and don\u2019t fund education very well. Choose wisely. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a great question, what are they asking for? Give them that. Give them what they want or loose them to the commercial community. It takes a lot of guff before a teacher will quit. By the time they organize a walk out or demonstration they\u2019ve been cheated for a long time. If you listen closely money is the last straw, there are plenty of other ways they\u2019d accept additional support and be able to forgo the raise. Teachers are smart, they know how much or how little money they will make, what they don\u2019t anticipate is how very little the profession is respected. Nurses, police, EMS, teachers\u2026 all these people deserve a decent living, a car and a home in their community. And you know what, the community wants them to have these things. Those who represent to community, state and nation are NOT making it happen. Regulate them to find this money first then money for other government programs and maybe other things less dear to us will have to \u201ceconomize\u201d. A teacher should make noticeably more than a loading dock supervisor, a Burger King owner or a entertainer for that matter (nothing against anyone here) according to how deeply they effect the quality of life in their community. It\u2019s just not that way and it\u2019s sad and wrong and it\u2019s not going to change because we don\u2019t demand it. How much is the right amount? The right amount is enough to make them feel valued in their own home town. It\u2019s more than they are getting. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s much easier than people are blowing this question up to be. Teachers should be paid what the market will pay them. If people in Palo Alto want to elect board members to pay teachers 275k a year, then by all means let them. If people in Red Bluff CA (three and a half hours to the northeast of Palo Alto) want to pay their teachers 105ka year, and the people of Reno Nevada want to pay their teachers 85k a year, then let them. They\u2019ll attract teachers of varying quality, but it isn\u2019t as simple as \u201coh, pay more and get better teachers\u201d. Houses around Red Bluff High School sell consistently for 175\u2013250k dollars, and a couple minutes away you can buy five or ten acres with a new custom built home for 450 grand. Because of the variable costs of living, teachers (Who as a whole are usually intelligent) will be compensated roughly equally in terms of standard of living. If some communities want to dedicate more funding every year to schools (compared to the average 1% property tax in CA) then they will, which will attract better quality teachers. Long story short, let the market (community members) dictate what they want to pay teachers, and let the teachers decide if they want those jobs at those prices. Added Ending: My moms a teacher (Kindergarten). At 45k a year (starting salary) with the pay scale sliding up to mid 80\u2019s and topping out at 98k, its still competitive with what other professionals make, year in and year out, given the difficulty of the coursework in college. Becoming a credentialed teacher is nowhere near as difficult as becoming say a mechanical engineer or astrophysicist or applied chemist. It shouldn\u2019t pay the same either. ",

            "answer_text": "Woof. You don\u2019t like to ask me easy things, do you Daniel? This is really hard to answer, because there are so many factors to consider when deciding this. Credentials As the other answers have well pointed out, a teacher\u2019s credentials are a big part of the story. I currently have a BA and a JD. What am I worth, as a professional? As a junior associate at some firm, I might make 45\u201370k starting. With some additional certificates? With some experience? With some reputation? How much credentialed experience does our hypothetical teacher have? Is this a Teach for America grad with an associate\u2019s degree and 200 hours of classroom experience? Is this a 35 year veteran with a master\u2019s or PhD? Are they certified and licensed in multiple disciplines? Where did they get those credentials? Do they have a master\u2019s degree from PrintMeADiploma dot com that required them to \u201cwatch\u201d a four hour video and take a \u201ctest\u201d? Or do they have a master\u2019s in education from UW-Madison like my father? Do they have an in-demand specialty, such as STEM or SPED? Tech ed teachers where I used to live are almost impossible to find. Should the market offer them a premium for scarcity? Or should they be paid the same as an English teacher? Work equivalency Part of the problem with salaried positions is that it\u2019s all well and good until you figure out what the hourly works out to. Salaried means you get paid the same no matter how much overtime you put in. And teachers put in a metric fuck ton of overtime. A 70 hour work week was light for me as a high school teacher. 80 hours was routine. 90 hours was not rare. 100 hours happened about 2-4x a year around the end of quarters or semesters. I put in more hours by the end of a semester than most hourly workers clock in a year. I figured out what I made per hour once in my very first position. I cringed. It was less than minimum wage. I qualified for food stamps. I was once called a glorified babysitter by an angry parent. I wish. I worked with her two kids for 90 minutes a day, each (one each in two block classes.) Let\u2019s say $5 an hour per kid. $15 per day. 183 days in a school year. Just those two kids would be $2,700 a year, just for the hours I had them. Times 120 students for an average of 90 minutes\u2026 let\u2019s see, carry the two\u2026 $164,700. Per year. To watch each student for 90 minutes a day, much less actually teach them anything. At babysitting wages. For a 183 day school year. Actually, does anyone hire male nannies? Asking for a friend\u2026 Cost of Living I\u2019ve got a friend who lives and teaches elementary in Hawaii. She makes a salary that made me want to move to Hawaii. That is, until she explained what her rent is and that a gallon of milk is eight dollars. Where I last taught, I was renting a 1-bed luxury apartment overlooking the river through town with a balcony I could fish off, which had a 1-car heated garage with a private entrance to my apartment through it. It was less than $650 a month. I was thinking about buying a little starter home in the community. At the time, which was not all that long ago, I could have done so for less than $50,000. For a relatively decent one. Fresh produce at the town\u2019s farmer\u2019s market was cheap and easy to come by. I had a deal with a local dairy farm to take a little milk out of the bulk tank every couple of days for a buck a gallon. My annual salary at the last place I taught was adequate for where I lived because the cost of living was almost absurdly cheap. Now, that was for a single man living on his own. If I\u2019d have had a wife and/or kids, that wouldn\u2019t have probably been enough. We\u2019d have needed some supplemental income. But my annual salary wouldn\u2019t have been sufficient to rent myself a 8x12 unheated tool shed, much less an apartment or house where my friend in Hawaii lives. I wouldn\u2019t have made enough money to afford to have indoor plumbing, much less deal with my powerful need to eat sometime each month. That needs to be accounted for in our hypothetical teacher. Where does she live? Alaska? New York? Kansas? The value of education itself Education is an investment by society, not that you\u2019d know it from listening to our politicians these days. There was a reason we started a public education system in the United States and made it free to access for citizens, despite a massive up-front and recurring cost to do so. The benefit to society of an educated populace massively returns on that investment. Currently, state aid and local taxes where I last taught works out to about $12,000 of per-pupil annual spending. That pays for teachers, the building, materials, transportation, etc. Over 14 years of schooling, if you count 4k and kindergarten, that adds up to $168,000. And that is no small chunk of change. How long will it take for a person to earn above $168,000 more than if they\u2019d had zero education at all? No letters nor numbers, apart from which you might have picked up in a trade or if you knew someone literate who could teach you. What can a person do in this country with zero education? Maybe menial labor jobs? Better hope you don\u2019t need to balance a checkbook or anything. Education was what brought the United States well and truly into the industrial revolution as a society. Education is the great leveler of mankind. Education affords a person tremendous opportunities. According to the Census Bureau, a person with a high school diploma earns $10,386 a year on average more than a person without one. Just completing basic free public education in this country provides a complete and plus return on investment in fifteen years. Not to mention productivity. How much more can literate, well-educated citizens provide in GDP productivity? What does it take to start an entrepreneurial small business? How much basic education? How much does that contribute to society? It\u2019d be hard to get a grip on the numbers for sure, because again, they could vary wildly by region, but a good education probably provides between ten and fifty times as a much a return on investment. What\u2019s that worth? How do you value that? And then how much of that value of contribution to society should end up in the hands of the teachers who made that possible in the first place? Millions? Billions? Trillions? How much of the United States economy is the direct result of someone with an education having that education? It\u2019s mind-boggling to try to figure out where to even begin figuring out that number.  Given all these factors, it\u2019s almost impossible to say \u201chere\u2019s how much teachers should make\u201d as a blanket statement. I\u2019d need to know a lot of specifics. Area of specialty. Geographical location. Cost of living. Urban or rural. Experience. Credentials. And more. Altogether, about the only thing I could say for certain to answer this question is just one word: More. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Daniel, That depends on what they teach and where they teach. Abu dhabi is a top choice for licensed teachers looking for a high-paying salary overseas. As an example, with a teaching license and three or more years of teaching experience, you can expect a monthly salary range of around $3,100 - 4,100 USD teaching with local and private schools. Alongside your base salary, teachers also receive an allowance for accommodation, health insurance, your cost of flight covered and ample vacation time. A more urban location such as Abu Dhabi city will be on the pricier side in terms of accommodation costs, but as long as you commit to some budgeting you should be able to save with no problem! Kuwait also is high on the list. I think these countries pay the actual remuneration a teacher deserves. So that would be 4000 USD, monthly. Thanks, All the best teaching. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of it. Teachers have as much right as others to make as much money as they want. However, they must first add value to what ever it is that they are doing. Think of it this way, as a teacher you are the CEO of your class, your students and the subject area you are tutoring. As a CEO, You must be innovative, creative and dynamic. There are three kinds of teachers: Teachers who brings innovations to their career and make money from their innovations.Teachers who are entrepreneurs, but teach others because they want to share their knowledge with others. AndThe ordinary teachers who think they are just teachers who can neither become rich or wealthy teaching.So which of these groups did you fall into?",
