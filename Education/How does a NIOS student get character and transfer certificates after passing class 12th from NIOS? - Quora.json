            "answer_text": "Thank You Amrita for requesting the answer. NIOS only issue Mark sheet & Migration certificate which are issued & dispatched after 25 days of the result declared. You will receive them at the address mentioned at the time of admission. Needless to worry about Character Certificate as NIOS is a Centralised Board just as CBSE or ICSE. All Government Colleges & Universities as well as private Institutions (except a few) accept NIOS students. Any organisation or Institute who questions your eligibility based on NIOS is directly challenging the Central Ministry of Education & Government of India. Upvote & follow if you are satisfied by the answer. ",
