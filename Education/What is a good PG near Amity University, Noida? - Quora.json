            "answer_text": "There are a lot of PGs near Amity University in Noida for students. Most of them are in the opposite PG lane. You can easily find one that fits your budget. They range from 8k to 20k depending on the type of sharing you are looking for and the facilities that are there. Although the PGs that are locally run always end up compromising on the quality of the food or house keeping or other facilities. There are also professional PGs run by new start up companies. I have been living in one such student PG run by Stanza Living - Santorini House. The rooms are quite spacious and have proper ventilation. The quality of food is also good and the menu keeps changing everyday. The wifi sometimes has issue, may be due to network but other facilities like house keeping and security is definitely worth the amount I pay. They keep conducting in-house events like they recently booked movie tickets for all the students, before that they conducted freshers night. Next week we an eye check up camp which I really appreciate since health is my primary concern and they are taking care of it. The market is also right in front of the building hence we do not need to walk a lot. College is also walking. There is one more thing that is super nice that they have done. They have tie ups with shops and restaurant near by like Egg Bistro, Fuelz cafe, Chao Bella, etc. This helps us get a lot of discount on our orders. This helps us save money. ",
