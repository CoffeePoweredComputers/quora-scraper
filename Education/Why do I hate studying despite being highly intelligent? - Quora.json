            "answer_text": "Ooh! Here\u2019s a chance for me to piss everyone off! I\u2019m going to explain why the school system sucks for intelligent kids, but doing so properly will require a detailed explanation of why the school system sucks in general, so hold on to your hat because we\u2019re gonna cover some ground. In brief, the first step to changing the \u201cschool sucks\u201d attitude of our students is to admit that they have a point. The reason school sucks, especially for intelligent kids, is that the whole thing, particularly in the United States, is built on the assumption that you can manufacture a \u201cgood citizen,\u201d whatever that means, the way you manufacture Ford Explorers or tin cans. And if you look at how your average high school routine, it certainly looks like a factory worker\u2019s routine: you sit in a room doing pointless alienating things, until a whistle blows and you leave. Everyone gets roughly the same education: if you\u2019re advanced you might get into honors courses that are ever-so-slightly more difficult, but there\u2019s still a very restrictive idea of what is and is not age appropriate. This is because the school system, as an industry for manufacturing \u201ccitizens,\u201d is built on the assumption that everyone is equal, that people are basically all the same, and this is how a kid who could be tackling Schopenhauer or Plato with the right instruction is forced to sit in a room with all of his co-equal coevals and listen to them struggling to read shitty \u201cage-appropriate\u201d young adult fiction. With the right teacher you could understand Milton, but we\u2019re gonna make you sit here with your equals and watch them struggle with Harry Potter. The underlying problem here is that the school system is not really meant to cultivate the intellect. The goal of a school system is to make children into the kind of people who fit well into the environing society, i.e. socialization. The issue here is that the kind of \u201csocialization\u201d imposed by public schools would have been relevant half a century ago, if every kid there were destined to be a factory worker. The public school system is horribly outdated for socializing anyone in the modern world, it\u2019s arguable as to whether it can even be salvaged, and it never worked for the really bright kids, by which I mean three sigma above average. If you do a little Googling on the subject of test scores between homeschooled kids and traditionally schooled ones and restrict it to academic sources, you\u2019ll find that people who are taught in a more traditional manner, face-to-face by a (parent or) tutor, seems to do well academically. What a surprise! This is where a lot of conservatives will go on a rant about the school system brainwashing kids into a state-held ideology, and while I won\u2019t deny that public education has an ideological slant, I think that Hanlon\u2019s razor applies here. The school system is pervaded by certain ideologies, yes, but it is also an institution full of sinecures, teachers and administrators, who have a nice secure salary with benefits and create little, if any, value. If you had a position in a system that made you nearly impossible to fire by means of a teacher\u2019s union, and you had guarantees about your salary and benefits and all the rest, would you want to give it up? If you were a school administrator with an easy middle-class job as a government bureaucrat, would you want to give it up? If you were a politician who got elected by spouting sanctimonious rhetoric about Our Precious Educational System, would you want to say something that would lose votes? (Because I know some public school teacher is going to pop up and start complaining about that last paragraph: yeah, yeah, public school teachers and administrators can piss and moan about how difficult their jobs are (who doesn\u2019t?) but that doesn\u2019t mean that society really needs them, at least not in their current form. Nor does it mean your job is difficult. Would you rather work in a factory or coal mine? No? Then shut the hell up.) There are some institutions that exist, not because they create a lot of value or have some great social utility, but purely because the environing society is accustomed to their presence and getting rid of them takes too much effort. The school system exists because it\u2019s already there, having acquired enough sociopolitical clout to perpetuate itself. We need the present school system so everyone can go to school for twelve years, and we need everyone to keep going to school for twelve years because otherwise it would wreck the school system. Our precious school system! The sacrosanct institutions of learning that protect Our Democracy\u2122!\u2026 From any positive change whatsoever. To circle back around to the main point, how does this affect intelligent kids? It makes them miserable, that\u2019s how. In Our Democracy\u2122, we have this idea that everyone is equal and that any differences between people are purely the result of some social inequality, so if you remove the social inequality, everyone will have exactly the same needs. This egalitarian pretense makes life hell for anyone outside of the norm, on either end of the distribution. Kids on the far right side of the IQ distribution need, not a more advanced version of the same instruction, but radically different instruction, but we can\u2019t admit this to ourselves because it\u2019s too painful. What, my child doesn\u2019t have access to the best education because they\u2019re not good enough!? But you can\u2019t tell someone, \u201cYour child would not benefit from it because it\u2019s not appropriate for them,\u201d because that will cause a shit-storm. And so the school system marches on, grinding the average kids into an apathetic pulp, spitting the special needs kids into institutions that take care of them, and turning the highly intelligent ones into bitter misanthropes who cannot fulfill their potential because they\u2019ve seen how society is and don\u2019t care much for benefiting it. That\u2019s Our Democracy\u2122! If this answer struck a chord with you, I have a Patreon. The link is in my profile. Donate. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I think a lot of highly intelligent people feel they didn\u2019t really fit in at school, and some may even have hated school. This is probably because most schools (i.e. all schools except those that specifically cater for \u2018gifted\u2019 students) are not designed around the educational, social and emotional needs of highly intelligent students, but around those of averagely intelligent students. And this is entirely logical and understandable, of course. After all, schools do not have unlimited resources, and must expend the resources they do have in ways that benefit the greatest number of students, which means the students in the middle of the IQ bell-curve, who will comprise the majority of the student body, and not the minority of students at the upper end of the bell-curve. Unfortunately, this means that some highly intelligent students may feel that their specific needs are not being addressed, or simply ignored. They might find much of the teaching rather elementary and unchallenging, and feel they are not being stretched and intellectually stimulated by material that is mainly aimed at students of average ability. As a consequence, they might become bored and frustrated, and decide that school is simply not aligned to, or accommodating of, their aptitude or interests, and that it is all a pointless waste of time. These students then risk becoming disinterested in their lessons, disengaged from educational activities, apathetic in their approach to their studies, and even resentful and rebellious towards their teachers and the school authorities. In extreme cases they may even be labelled as \u2018problem students\u2019, and misdiagnosed with conditions such as antisocial behaviour disorder or ADD/ADHD. But they are simply bored, frustrated and pissed-off with their school life\u2014arguably for very good reasons. Added to this, of course, highly intelligent students can often suffer various forms of antisocial and abusive behaviour from fellow students, ranging from verbal insults to physical bullying, simply because they are perceived to be odd, aloof or \u2018too clever for their own good\u2019. As the saying goes, no one likes a smart-arse, and they are often made to suffer for being more intelligent than their peers (and not having the good sense to hide that fact). They might be labelled as \u2018nerds\u2019, \u2018geeks\u2019 and \u2018swots\u2019, and excluded from the normal social life of the school that other students routinely enjoy, so they may also experience social isolation and loneliness in addition to all their other frustrations \u2014as well as being deprived of the normal opportunities for socialisation and the acquisition of social skills that school life is supposed to provide. This is probably why some of these students can go on to become socially awkward and emotionally underdeveloped as adults. And as if all of this weren\u2019t enough for them to deal with, schools often neglect to provide the same levels of personalised educational and psychological support to highly intelligent students that they routinely provide to students who are at the other end of the IQ bell-curve\u2014the students with varying degrees of learning disability. It seems there is an assumption that while low-ability students need and deserve all the help the school can give them in order to achieve academic success, the high-ability students neither need nor deserve such help; they have all the brains they need to achieve academic success, so they don\u2019t require any special assistance, and if they can\u2019t be bothered to apply themselves to their studies then that\u2019s their own fault, and they don\u2019t deserve any sympathy. \u2018You can sort yourself out on your own\u2019 seems to be the message that the school sends them. To summarise, then, highly intelligent students in a school environment designed around the needs of average students can experience one or more of these things: boredom, frustration, disengagement, apathy, resentment, rebelliousness, bullying, social isolation, misunderstanding, lack of support. Is it any wonder that some of them ended up hating school, and look back on their school lives with a mixture of sadness, anger and regret? Of course, I should stress that not all highly intelligent students have such a tough time at school. If they are lucky to attend a school that knows how to cater for their specific needs, and which creates a stimulating, supportive and inclusive environment for them, then it is possible for them to feel excited and stimulated by their studies, engaged in the educational experience, socially accepted and included, and that the school understands and supports them on an individual level. These students will usually achieve academic success commensurate with their abilities and grow up to be happy, well-adjusted and successful in their careers and personal lives. And they will probably look back on their schools lives with feelings of gratitude and nostalgic affection. My own experiences of school (recounted at the link below) were rather mixed\u2014some were happy (mostly involving school friends, or favourite teachers and their lessons), some not so happy (mostly involving boredom, loneliness, bullying or dislikeable teachers), and a few that I would rather forget (sadly, the human brain has a bias towards remembering bad memories over good ones, so my recollections might possibly be distorted, but I will never know). But I was very fortunate that my later experiences in tertiary education (described in the link below) were far happier\u2014in fact, they were some of the happiest years of my life\u2014and they probably managed to undo most of the damage done by my school years, although they could never erase the unhappy memories of them.
