            "answer_text": "I'll be honest and a bit blunt, both of them. SAT's and grades work hand in hand for getting into top tier schools. Especially for the Ivies. One could have a amazing 4.0 unweighted GPA but then having an decent 28 ACT score could place them out of the running. The same could happen the other way around, one could have a 3.4 GPA unweighted and an 2300 SAT and still not get placed into any of the top schools. Frankly, it's important to do well on both. They are both signs of academic success and achievement. The SAT/ACT shows your ability to do well for test taking and reasoning. Your GPA shows your ability to work hard over long periods of time and shows a long term indication of success. However, if we're judging by the admissions of schools such as UC Berkeley and Cornell/other Ivies, it appears having a 4.0 GPA beats out having an amazing test score by a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a significant minority of colleges who are refusing to use test scores as part of entry requirements. Why? They've found that grades are a far more reliable predictor of college success. On the other hand, a student who is a good test taker but has weaker grades can find it wise to seek good scores on those tests - because those scores can help overcome those weak grades. In other words:  For the student, it depends on their situation and what they're trying to achieve. In life? The test scores generally don't relate well to a student's future success. They're just test scores - and life isn't a standardized test.  ",
