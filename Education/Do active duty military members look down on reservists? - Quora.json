            "answer_text": "Do active duty military members look down on reservists? Initially no, but eventually yes.  The career of every Marine begins with the same brutal training. Everyone endures three months of Recruit Training, then School of Infantry, and a varying number of months of advance training depending on their job. But the similarities end upon completion of job training. Reservists will get their discharge papers, know which unit to join, and will do what\u2019s known as Drill\u2019s once a month, where they check in with their units for an entire weekend. At the most, they will go through two weeks of Active Training at some point during the year. Active Duty Marines on the other hand, are at the mercy of the needs of the Marine Corps. Want to get get stationed in Okinawa? Too bad, this unit over at Cherry Point needs a Marine! Selected East Coast for your duty station preference? Sucks to be you, you\u2019re going to the West Coast because this unit needs more Marines! It\u2019s not just the needs of the Marine Corps, but Active Duty Marines live the Marine Corps life 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. It\u2019s our full time job for the best or for the worst. We are constantly busy with safety standdowns, getting a haircut every single week, have to stand duty, clean the daylights out of our barracks rooms, attending half effort social events in the form of Mandatory Fun, and getting stuck on a six month deployment. Reservists on the other hand, don\u2019t have to really deal with all of that. They think that their Drill\u2019s are bad because every Drill is a culture shock to them, along with losing a weekend or two because of Reservist obligations. We on the Active Duty side, don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re complaining. \u201cWhy are you complaining about missing a class? We missed our kid\u2019s birthday while being deployed you stupid moron!\u201d Furthermore, they seem to enjoy their lifestyle as they resume their \u201cnormal\u201d life after a weekend of being with their units. We on the other hand, can have somewhat of a normal life in the form of vacation, granted that our chain of command actually leaves us alone when we\u2019re on leave. But I will give Reservists credit though, as it takes a lot of fortitude to switch from a civilian to a military mindset quickly, along with not atrophying in terms of job knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. In some cases, it is merited but in other situations, the person doing the looking down would be wrong. I served in a reserve armoured reconnaissance regiment. We were under equipped, under supported and under experienced. However when asked to step forward, our members did so in large numbers. Not all were called up, but more than 10% were. They came back with a wealth of hands on experience. They made our training more practical, less \u201cgamey\u201d and more useful. The next time a call went out, our members were that much better prepared. Starting with Bosnia, (First) Gulf War, and Afghanistan all showed that our Reservists were able to pick up what they needed and perform effectively. I got out, went to school and got some civvy work experience. I eventually joined back up, the second time in the naval reserve. I did basic training a second time and then my officer qualification courses along with regular force direct entry officers (mostly lawyers, doctors, nurses, some other Reservists commissioned from the ranks with specialized civilian skills in high demand, etc.) Because I had joined back up as a Reserve Maritime Engineering Officer and there were no Reserve courses - just Reg Force qualifications - I took courses with the Regular Navy and found the course material not very hard, but the Regs memorized what they didn\u2019t understand and could quote the manual. I had civvy experience and understood much of the material quite well because of its similarity to civvy equivalents. I placed in the top ten percent of my academic courses and upper half of the practical courses. I will skip over some. I was qualified as a diver so I requalified as a Reserve Diving Officer. In reality a diver requal course for a Reservist is identical to the Regular Force course and often Reservists and Regulars were loaded on the same course, space permitting. I had to take unpaid time off from my civvy job so I was motivated to successfully requal. That was one of the few times I found that being an officer was not much fun. We worked a lot more hours even though we were physically exhausted and had to be in the top half (really top 10%) of everything. Diving Officers are not allowed any mistakes unless they are in the divers\u2019s favour. Officers also plan all the dives and lead some of the dives (NCM supervisors lead quite a few and plan some as well), and diving officers usually dive at some point each task. The NCM diving supervisors do similar work but the buck stops with the diving officer. I requal\u2019d five times. My Reserve unit supported the local foreign military attache community as well as all Regular Force divers posted to the area (think of a Naval Reserve unit located in the same city as the nation\u2019s capital), plus my own dive team of 10 Reservists. We had Brits, Americans, most NATO countries and by some peculiar arrangement any Soviet block divers who wanted to join us (post Berlin Wall). We also supported Regular Army Combat Divers and Air Force Search and Rescue Technicians. We were resourced for twice a month dives on weekends. We would sometimes have 20\u201325 divers show up for 10 sets of diving gear. We would often dive at an interesting local (ie within 2 hour drive) location and bring our portable compressor and eat in the field. I spent as much time begging for trucks and rations as I did planning the mission. My unit was the only non-army unit supported by the local base so we were not high on their priority. My divers had to dive at least once a month to remain current. Most of my divers (70% or more) dove two or more times a month. We sometimes dived twice a day. At one time my Commanding Officer and Coxswain were both divers and they put themselves in my team\u2019s hands. We never lost a diver. We never hurt a diver. All that to say, when I asked the Regular Force divers for planning and operational input, they were often quite happy to leave the hard work to the Reservists because they trusted us not to endanger anyone\u2019s life or limb. If you are a diver, you will know that trust is earned. ",

            "answer_text": "Reservist no but National Guard yes. And if you don't know the difference, a lot of reservist are Active duty who got out but didn't want to separate themselves entirely. Most of the reserve unit that I was in this was the case. They were like me had done a term on active duty but because they had kids or other reasons didn't reenlist but still wanted to serve. National guard on the other hand tend to mostly have spent their time in Guard units except for their time on active duty as part of training or a call up. Spending time with Guard units at JRTC NTC and in Iraq there are a few things I noticed about them that stood out. They tent to be out of shape, not as big an issue with units that spend most of their time in the rear, but some national guard units are combat arms units and it doesn't instill confidence when you see a guy to fat for his body armor. They tend to be far less disciplined. We shared guard duty with a national guard MP battalion on the main post in Mosul, Iraq. On more than one occasion we found guardsmen asleep of extremely inattentive at their post. It was not unusual to see them with dirty weapons and gear. This I don't know what to call. In country it was pretty easy to spot the national guardsman and some reservist by their constant going around with their rifles slung over their shoulder, barrels pointed strait up into the air. The only time its ok to carry your rifle around that way in a combat zone is if you need to use both hands to carry something. And even then usually you want to use a shoulder sling or tactical sling if you could get your hands on one. Prevalence of I-didnt-sign-up-for-this-itis. The national guards units tend to have a much higher amount of soldiers claiming that's not my job or this isn't why I joined the army. I got to the point that I was gonna slug the next guardist who told me they only signed up for the money for college like they didn't have to earn it. And an overabundance of caution almost to the point of being borderline cowardice. Caution in itself is fine, its what can keep you alive in some situations but if you are cautious to the point of being downright slow then you are an easy target and your slowness if gonna get you and other people killed. That being said the National Guardsman are not that bad and their deficiencies are not from a lack of will to do their duties. They mostly don't live the life or spend the time in the field their military bearing and discipline reflect that. I noticed they tend to have outstanding medical, aviation, and transportation specialist. As usual there can be exception and there was on. The 256th Infantry brigade and the 30th Armored brigade. Both were well led fairly disciplined units that didn't need to be babysat. They were impressive by National Guard standards. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, there are always those who don\u2019t understand the role that the Reserve Component plays within the Total Force. Joint doctrine recognizes the Total Force as the sum of the Regular Component, the Reserve Component, the other two Services of the Uniformed Services (the Public Health Service and NOAA), all retirees of all those organizations (both Regular and Reserve retirees), and the totality of the industrial, economic, informational, and organizational assets of the United States. The last time all of these entities were coordinated in a truly meaningful way was WWII\u2026FDR had entire Councils and \u201cCzars\u201d of Industry, etc., to support the war effort while meeting the basic needs of the American citizens, whose standard of living generally went up significantly even during the war, and even higher afterwards. A member of the Active Component (the common term for the legally correct term \u201cRegular Component\u201d as defined in Title 10 of the US Code) who looks down on their fellow servicemembers as members of the Reserve Component is largely just displaying the usual biases common to EVERYONE in the military\u2026we all have them. For example, I am particularly partial to Marines, both active and reserve. As most servicemembers grow in experience and seniority, especially those exposed to other services and joint organizations, much biased thought disappears, replaced with new found knowledge about the capabilities of Sister Services, Joint organizations, Combatant Commands, the National Command Authorities, combined/coalition/allied warfare, the elements of national power, and the Total Force. And how it all fits together. For the highest levels of Professional Military Education, especially Joint PME, one of the desired outcomes is not only mastery of one\u2019s own parent Service, but a solid understanding of the differences and strengths/weaknesses of one\u2019s own Service Reserve/Guard elements, and the Reserve/Guard of each Service\u2026including the USCG as one of the Armed Forces but not part of the DoD, and the Uniformed Services comprised of the Armed Forces plus the PHS and NOAA, and the rest of it\u2026 The desired pinnacle of the JPME system, along with the equivalent of 36 full months (to the day!) of \u201cJoint duty\u201d which could include Interagency and/or Combined duty with allies, is recognition as a Joint Qualified Officer (formerly Joint Specialty Officer, before the process was thoroughly revamped and Reserve officers were invited into the process), who is supposed to have mastery of the doctrine, operational concepts, systems and programs, and roles/missions/functions of their own Service (active and reserve components), but also the full gamut of the Joint system, bringing the best and brightest of ANY Service, active or reserve, to the problem at hand rather than being tied down with primitive Service (and Component) biases\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Former National Guard NCO, OCS graduate, 11-series MOSs (Infantry) There will always be instances where one group of individuals looks down on the other. Sometimes it's tradition, sometimes it's truly earned, sometimes it's ignorance...there is no one answer there. The tradition part I will accept, because deep down everyone knows that we all wear the same uniform and a bullet doesn't discriminate based on active duty status or MOS. At the reception station for basic training (Ft. Benning, 1984) I was processed with a whole platoon of National Guard recruits from Nebraska. I remember the sergeant leading us through those couple days telling us (paraphrasing, it's >30 years!) that the active Army treats NG's as \"No-Go\"s (NG being used simultaneously for \"National Guard\" and \"No Go\"). But he challenged us to break that cycle. I like to think most did well that cycle. During my service years, we frequently were trained by active Army personnel, many being from the 10th Mountain Division (Ft. Drum). To be honest I didn't detect being thought less of for not being active. The active duty trainers challenged us mentally and physically, and trained \"with\" us (not just \"to\" or \"at\" us). I felt their positive comments after each exercise was genuine; during downtime they would just chat with us like we'd been friends for a long time. Their Infantry was their way of life which presented one set of challenges. Our Infantry was something we managed to balance with civilian careers and responsibilities...in short, not only were we all Infantry, but we all had challenges and difficulties to deal with in our lives. I know I'm speaking from a reservist point of view, and I welcome feedback from active duty veterans on this topic. ",

            "answer_text": "My first \u2018contact\u2019 with reservists was during the parachute course at the German Airborne school. It was our second or third jump and the weather was extremely bad. Our instructors hoped that the sky would clear up during our approach on the drop zone, but it didn\u2019t. It was raining, the wind was strong and we were told that there would be no jumping. However, there was a group of reservists on the aircraft with us and I remember that we all had looked a little bit down on them when they showed up at the airfield: Some of them wore their hair much too long for our taste, others had a beer belly, and they really looked like \u2018weekend warriors\u2019 and not like professional soldiers. While the machine turned around to fly us back to the airport, one of them went to the jumpmaster and told him that they wanted to jump. The jumpmaster thought about it for a few seconds, smiled and nodded his head. All the reserve soldiers on the plane were experienced paratroopers with many jumps under their belt and if they wanted to risk it, it was their problem. Our aircraft made another approach on the drop zone and while the \u2018weekend warriors\u2019 were jumping out of the plane, we were watching them, feeling a bit stupid. What I could always observe with soldiers of the reserve was that they were extremely motivated. Their skills were sometimes a little bit rusty, but they more than compensated their lack of knowledge with dedication and a willingness to work. In the German army, a reserve soldier gets promoted much faster than an active duty soldier and our buddies from the reserve almost always outranked us by at least two or three ranks, but fortunately, most of them were smart enough not to question our authority. Most of the reserve soldiers I worked with had a relaxed and friendly attitude and training with them was much more rewarding than usual. They were thankful for everything we taught them and the best of it, they never complained! Do active duty soldiers look down on reservists? Some of them do, but it\u2019s a big mistake! ",

First off, lets clarify that \u201creservist\u201d are actually Soldier from two of the three components of the total Army - US Army (active guys), Army National Guard and the U.S Army Reserve. Note there is no \u201cs\u201d at the end of Reserve. There was a time (lets say back in the 80s), when the million man active duty army would look at the Reserve Components as a back up to what was going on in Europe. This was basically knowing that the RC wouldn't be able to get into the fight until 30 days after it kicked off. By that time it was theorized it would be over in a bad way. Today, after Desert Shield/Storm, Kosovo, Iraq/Afghanistan and multiple other missions, the Active Army can neither go to war without the additional combat power supplied by the Army Guard, nor without the support structure the Army Reserve provides. As a full time reservist, I work with the Active duty force daily. Most of them wouldn\u2019t know I am in the Army Reserve until I tell them. These perception of \u201clooking down\u201d on the Reserve Components is more of people who don\u2019t understand what the RC brings to the fight because they are so close to the tactic problem; they can\u2019t see the big strategic picture. They are also ignorant morons that probably don\u2019t realize that the beans/bullets, air cover, transportation, security, communications, medical support, and additional combat power to their left and right are members of the National Guard and Army Reserve. They also don\u2019t realize that a chuck if the RC manpower are former Active components soldiers serving their Nation after they left the AC. Don\u2019t fall into that mental trap of looking down on reservist. That\u2019s a great way of getting ostracized by 2/3s of the Army. ",

            "answer_text": "Some do. Back in the 1990s (at the time of the Bosnia upset) my USAR unit, a quartermaster company, did a 21-day annual training at Baumholder in Germany, which at the time was the home of the 1st Armored Division. We were assigned to the division\u2019s main support battalion to help clear a large backlog of incoming Class IX (repair parts) that was flowing to the division to bring a lot of not-mission-capable equipment back on line. It turned out to be a huge backlog and we worked two 12-hour shifts for twelve straight days to move that Class IX along. I was the NCOIC of the overnight shift. Our reception at the battalion was somewhat less than cordial. The general opinion seemed to be that a bunch of half-stepping weekend warriors couldn\u2019t get the job done. My own impression was that the real half-steppers were the RA soldiers who\u2019d allowed the backlog to become so large. I don\u2019t blame the lower-ranking enlisted troops; they merely took their cue from the slackers who were supposed to be their leaders. Actually we reservists were delighted to have been given a real-world mission. It made a nice change from the simulated training exercises that were our usual portion. Within a few days we\u2019d made a huge dent in the backlog. Supposedly the battalion commander was royally cheesed off at his own people, who no doubt had been showering him with a litany of excuses for their inability to move things along. About a month after we returned to home station, our higher headquarters received a letter from the 1st Armored Division DISCOM (Division Support Command) commander, commending our company\u2019s outstanding performance of duty. I like to think that on the flip side, the leadership of that main support battalion was treated to an ass-kicking session for letting a bunch of reservists show them up. ",

When my medical unit deployed to Iraq in \u201804, the 1st ID was just rotating out to be replaced by the 42nd ID, the famed \u201cRainbow Division\u201d of WWI and WWII and now a Reserve unit. We were in an afternoon briefing being chaired by a captain in the 1st ID, who made some choice remarks about Reserve units in general and the 42nd in particular. To say they were inappropriate and not well received would be an understatement, but I found him to be the rare exception\u2014as well as an egotistical, condescending ass. What he failed utterly to comprehend is that a large percentage of Reserve units are ex-active duty and equal or superior to him in training and experience PLUS they bring a unique skill set from being in the private community that active duty units may not have. Yes, we may do things a bit differently, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t get it done equally as well. Whether you\u2019re a Reservist or active duty, you\u2019re judged on your ability to fulfill your mission requirements and work with other units\u2014period. During our extended deployment, we were very well regarded and received first by the 42nd and subsequently by the unit that replaced them\u2014the 3rd ID, a totally professional and highly competent division\u2014and I had no complaints about them, either. I wouldn\u2019t judge the 1st ID solely by the actions of one dimwitted captain\u2014I\u2019m sure they\u2019re every bit as hard-charging as the other active duty units in the Army. ",

We had lots of Reserve soldiers deployed to our unit to help us diagnose and treat our troops who were sick, injured, or wounded during operations in the Gulf. At first, I guess I did look down on them \u2014 especially the ones who were much older than us but had equal or lower rank. Then I learned a few things. Many of those Reservists worked in civilian jobs that matched their military job, and some of those had a lot more experience than my people and I did. Some of them had different civilian professions, but maintained their military skill sets, so they could sometimes do more than we could. We all busted our butts to get the work done, but at the end of a shift, they went back to the barracks (to maybe call home to their spouses and kids) while I got to go home to my wife at our apartment. For me and my people, the war didn\u2019t change a whole lot of things. But those Reservists set aside their regular lives (and some took huge pay cuts) to travel halfway around the world to help us accomplish the mission. And through it all, I heard precious little bitching and moaning from them. Nothing but respect for those folks. ",

            "answer_text": "To some degree, I did. I\u2019d like to point out that I first joined the Army Reserves and then got an Army ROTC scholarship before going active duty as an Infantry Officer. My main complaint with the reserves and national guard is in the proficiency of the units. These guys play Soldier one weekend a month and for two weeks a year. They simply don\u2019t have the same quantity or quality of training available to them as an active duty unit that gets to play Army 365 days a year. My squad leader when I was in the reserves in 1997 was a Vietnam veteran and a janitor at the local elemtary school. During our unit PT test, I was considered the PT stud of the unit after getting an APFT score of 270 (nobody else was even close to me). That\u2019s a solid score, but certainly nothing special. When I was deployed to Iraq, I ran into a National Guard unit where one of the guys was so fat that he couldn\u2019t close his body armor and instead wore it like an open vest. You can\u2019t make this stuff up. Sometime around 1998 my reserve unit was being alerted to go to a humanitarian mission in Haiti. The next drill, after being alerted that we were going to be deployed in a few months, a whole slew of women in the unit showed up pregnant and were conveniently unable to deploy. I was in a medical unit and we were going to be assigned to a nice cushy duty in a hospital. The idea of being deployed so freaked these people out that they were running around trying to find any reason not to be able to deploy! ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly. At least not in my experience. There is concern for their combat readiness. They are often relatively poorly equipped and have less time to train. That is no fault of their own, but if I were a general I would place their elements in places I felt were either less likely to see combat or (if we reached a level of combat we have not seen in generations) in areas that we could afford to lose. They are good. Worthy of as much respect and honor as every other person in uniform. Citizen soldiers. Volunteers. \u2026but given the straight choice between them and active duty? In most military specialties they are best kept in reserve if possible. They just haven\u2019t handled their equipment every day non-stop like active duty soldiers do. (I\u2019d take a reservist unit over an active duty unit in certain jobs. Frankly military doctors lag a bit compared to civilians. IT folks in the military know the antiquated systems better, but don\u2019t have the range of experience that citizen soldiers who work in the IT field at home do. I\u2019d like a mix of reservists and active duty in many Transportation roles; Everyones life experience will teach them different tricks. Military linguists are typically a bit rigid and military oriented in their focus, whereas the Mormon Church does a damned good job teaching their missionaries to speak languages in a way that local populations react better to. MPs can benefit from reservists who are cops in the real world. The list goes on.) ",

While the MPs did their training we cooks went to a DFAC on Ft Bliss for our train up. We had a mix of prior active duty and only reservist time Soldiers who had never worked in a kitchen before.At first the active duty cooks were referring to us as National Guard (not a term of endearment). By the end several of the prior service guys were being asked \"why did you leave active duty?\" and \"any way you could transfer over to us?\". To be fair they had a heavier load of privates and brand new specialists on their shifts than I normally saw. But while they saw me as an Sgt E-5 at first ( promotion to which normally occurs with the first 5 years of service), they realized working with me that I had over 15 years doing that job under my belt. That kind of experience being common is one of the benefits of a Reserve unit. As with anything else, it tends to be easier to make fun of someone/thing when you don't personally know them. Once you work with them a bit, you can often find yourself impressed. ",

Active duty troops often enlist at 18 and have been trained and are experienced in one job, the job the military trained them to do. A Reserve or Guard unit consists of people who all have very different careers in the civilian world. When we trained at Ft Dix, the heat in the motor shops didn\u2019t work. The regular Army guys put in a work request, while next door,we had a plumber who just repaired the boiler. We had everything from plumbing and heating guys to a barber. IT pros to carpenters. Eventually, some of the active Army units came to us when they needed things done. Any that initially looked down on us didn\u2019t after that. ",

They send out for pizza, dink around in the afternoon, and then go home to their wives & families. For that, they get Equal pay and benefits, equal respect and treatment, and all the privileges of rank equal to the guy laying in the mud, being eaten alive by bugs, starving, possibly bleeding, and exhausted from bustin' his ass. Don't tell me you are my \"equal\" until you've walked a mile in my boots, sacrificed what I have had to give, and slept where I have had to sleep. Yes, their uniforms may have the same patches, they may have a shirt full of award ribbons, and they may have even been on active duty once \"back in '98\", but you ain't a soldier until you've done some soldierin' pal. I'm not talking about wearing your uniform to the restaurant on Memorial Day for a Free lunch or showing your YD at Home Depot to get your 10% discount. I'm talking about working around the clock in inclement weather, 3 days & nights straight, with no sleep, minimal cold food, sweatin' your ass off - while being responsible for the safety and welfare of 50 junior enlisted people, like I've been doing. THEN you will be my \"Equal\". Until then, you are a \"Wannabe\". I knew a Navy Chief who had served 28 years in the Reserves in 1968... A Navy Chief who had NEVER been stationed on a ship. Think about that for a minute. Not Trained, Not Ready, Not Capable ...he had passed all of his Bookwork & Exams, but had NO IDEA what it took to run his Division on a Warship at sea.Just WHO was he supposed to be the equal to? He expected a fat pension for \"Service to his country\" and he had been at home with his family every night of his life. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the MOS/AFSC, I was a 4N1X1 Surgical Tech in the Air Force stationed at a army hospital. When we had 68Whiskey reservists show up they usually had no idea what they were doing, a lot used the excuse \"this isn't my job.\" They had accepted that it was ok not to know their MOS because most drill weekends they were usually hanging out instead of doing surgical procedures or learning to better themselves. If you signed the dotted line you should at least know the bare minimum of your job, im not saying be a resident expert but you should at least be able to do it, know what equipment is, and somewhat know what do to. These people walked into OR's like they had never been there. I also have friends who are Guard/Reserve that do their MOS/AFSC in the civilian sector and they are subject matter experts. They know the ins and outs of their job and their unit is blessed to have them. So yes sometimes we look down on guard/reservists but for me at least its not because they aren't Active duty, its if they can do the job they signed up to do to help the mission. ",

Specialized careers, like anything to do with nukes or Intel, look down on everyone else, with combat troops looking down at them in return. Everyone looks up to the chaplains and whoever is doing the cooking. Everyone looks down on the paper pushers who screw up your pay twice a month. But don't you dare, as a civilian, look down on anyone who has ever taken the oath of enlistment or received a commission. Or as someone who has taken that oath ever leave a fellow military member high and dry. The joking aside, and half of it it is just joking, like when families have their pecking orders, it's one big family. With that weird uncle with a van that shows up once a month. ",

My father in particular noted how poorly a National Guard platoon fared against a squad of Vietnam vets that had come back recently, being among those vets himself. The squad set a simple ambush and sprung it upon the NG soldiers who fell into a panic, and culminated in the radioman for the platoon calling in a simulated CAS mission directly on them. He commented after I had joined and the things I had told him I had been trained on, that the National Guard had gotten far better. Indeed, at the time I had joined, 63% of deployed soldiers to active combat zones were National Guard or Reservists. He was proud of me for volunteering, and highly impressed with how far the NG had come since the 1970\u2019s. And there is definitely something to be said about soldiers that can maintain the standards that regular Army soldiers must meet, while holding down a life and job outside the military sphere. ",

Then they return to civilian life and continue to serve in standby status. Ther is no reason to look down on Reservist because they serve just like regular Military. I was both. I started in the Reserves and then before I went active, switched to the regular Navy. As such I no longer had the \u201cR\u201d designation and I must admit I was glad to not be looked down on by the other regulars. But it is a mistaken notion that they are somehow beneath those in the regular service branch they are serving in. They perform the same duties while active and during their drills. The fact they are willing to be on call at the will of the President says a lot. Thos has been the norm for reservists since 9/11. This means they have to leave their jobs and families in an instant and return to active duty. But they have continued staying current with their respective specialties and deserve the same respect as any other member of the military. ",

            "answer_text": "yes and no - If you are active duty combat arms, you live in the field. When I was active duty, combat battalions went to the field either as a battalion or a company or a platoon every Monday and came back on Thursday night or Friday. Practically every week. If you are combat arms in the Guard or Reserves - you may have done that at one time and you are probably just as knowledgeable and capable, BUT you haven\u2019t worked together as a team as long and as regularly as the active duty teams. You are NOT going to be as quick or as good. There are some exceptions in the combat service support and combat support fields. I was an engineer in the Guard after my active duty time. The battalion I was in - almost every senior NCO was a project manager for some civilian construction company. The NCOs and troops that operated the Hyexes, bulldozers, road graders, etc. They all worked in the civilian world on the same type of equipment every single day. Compared to the active duty counterparts - not even close. The active duty simply doesn\u2019t have as much time on the equipment, money in the budget or projects to do to keep the same level of expertise. I suspect it is the same in some other support fields. So if you are combat arms active duty you are going to look at the reservists and say they aren\u2019t up to speed and if you are combat support or service support then it is possible that you will look at the active duty and say - why aren\u2019t you guys better at this?

Bear in mind that many active duty military don\u2019t make a distinction between \u201creserve\u201d and \u201cnational guard\u201d. In both (the n.g. in particular), the quality can vary widely, from personnel just out of the active-duty side to personnel who have never been on the active duty side. During Desert Shield/Storm/Calm the performance differences tended to fade after 90\u2013180 days. I still remember calling up a national guard unit (and this was typical) to talk to the S-4 (logistics). It took a while to find the person, as the \u201cofficial\u201d S-4 was really doing the S-1 (personnel) duties, the \u201creal\u201d S-4 was \u201cofficially\u201d something else. It was explained to me that they moved the titles around for career progression reason (from the active side) but just kept doing their \u201cactual\u201d jobs - rather than learning their new jobs and positions. Another time I was running and noticed a \u201cclump\u201d of Lt\u2019s hanging around a CSM - like on a street corner. I had never seen that before, it looked pretty unprofessional. I suspect they \u201cgrew out of it\u201d as they were exposed to \u201creal\u201d active duty units. ",

During Desert Storm my Navy Reserve medical unit, (field hospital servicing the Marines), served in the war zone near to the active duty medical unit. The Marines preferred our Reserve medial unit because they said we were nicer and more efficient that the active duty medical unit. As Reservists we were motivated to serve and show the Navy we were worth all the resources they expended on us; the Active duty medical unit was peeved because they were all pulled from a stateside Naval Hospital and sent to the field hospital away from their regular hospital duties, away from their families and were there a lot longer than us. So they had reasons to be peeved. ",

Only group I\u2019ve seen look down on us are infantry, but that's because they're infantry, they've been trained and raised to believe they are the top of the food chain (which for better or worse, combat arms is the tip of the spear for a reason), in which case they don't really look down on reservists because we're reservists but because we weren't infantry. Though I will admit, they loved raining hell on the few reserve and national guard infantry guys we had because they were not full timers anymore. ",

One Saturday morning at Submarine Base Bangor I\u2019m driving up and I see about 40\u201350 Marines standing around.I knew they wern\u2019t Bangor Marines because we were very sharp in cammies and they looked like crap. Also knew they wern\u2019t boots so maybe they were from Marine Barracks Whidbey Island or a Mar Det from a carrier parked at the Bremerton Shipyard doing field ops at Camp Wesley Harris. Asked a dude who they were and he said they were reservist from some landing support company in Tacoma conducting swim qual. Asked him if he knew Numbnuts from boot camp;said Numbnuts stop showing up months earlier and was listed as a deserter. Hated reservist after seeing them for no reason other than they didn\u2019t have to put up with crap day in and day out and some were going to college. Saw some reserve Combat Engineers at K-Bay right before my EAS and hated them too.Two months later I\u2019m in the reserves and attending college. \u201cGo Figure\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "My unit didn\u2019t really work with reservists, but we would see them often in bases near our own. I remember the first time I met a reservists unit. It was kind of a shock to me. All the reservists were aged between 28 years old to 45 years old, running around base, taking down orders, preparing gear and vehicles, just like my team and I were doing all day, except that the majority of us were nineteen years old. Seeing these men who have long finished their military service, leaving their families, work, studies, buisness and life, to guard and serve Israel for 3 weeks every year was astonishing to watch. These guys have everything to lose, and have all been in the worst situations, just to go back to hell once again, and make sure themselves that no threat will ever reach their families. Everything I thought sucked about my service was gone. I had nothing more to complain about. Nothing but respect for these guys. ",

As a reservist when I went in to do my drills, many times the active duty force was not prepared for my arrival and had little for me to do. These drills are called Inactive Duty Training (IDTs) periods so when they didn\u2019t have work for me to do, I found training items that I needed to accomplish. When that happened, I was pretty much useless to the active duty staff. However, personnel shortfalls for needed overseas tours were always evident, so I volunteered to fill many deploying to Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, the Republic of Georgia, and Iraq. I deployed so my supervisors didn\u2019t have to, or they didn\u2019t have to pull someone from the field to deploy. On one deployment I was injured and wasn\u2019t allowed to work for six months while undergoing physical therapy treatment. When I finally returned to my active duty unit, I was told I was not needed anymore (new supervisor) and to find a new job. I quickly found a new job within a new organization where I was utilized more efficiently than at my previous office. From there I deployed to Iraq and was recognized by promotion to Colonel and retired with a Legion of Merit Medal Legion of Merit - Wikipedia. ",

When the Draft Lottery was established those with low numbers could join a Guard unit and not have to worry about being drafted. All that\u2019s changed with the Wars in the Middle East. Almost all of the Guard and Reserve unit have been mobilized and sent to the Middle East to fight.

If you\u2019re not familiar, read some of the Quora comments posted by current and retired Marines. You may find your answer there as well. In general, reservists may not be deemed as \u2018real\u2019 Marines\u2026.because they are in the reserves and not on the front line. However, I think this may have changed a bit when so many reservists were called up during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. This call-up turned them from reservists into active-duty. These reservists were now on the front lines and considered as equal. It\u2019s a prevalent attitude among military personnel, but not one that is shared by ALL military personnel. I think you may find just as many active duty Marines don\u2019t have this attitude as those who do. I guess one way you could look at it is to chalk it up to a \u2018military thing.\u2019 ",

When i was doing training exercises with them they fuked up a lot and were redone. Most only did the basic of what they had too. That\u2019s not enough man because when your out there you need to be able to do and give your all. That\u2019s what going above and beyond is. ",

They are part of our same team, answer to the same chain of command. We may pay close attention to see how they react when the sh*t hits the fan but we also do the same with our Regular Army Compatriots.National Guard was a different matter. They had a chain of command different from ours. Their oath of enlistment was also different from ours. I wouldn't call it looking down on them. It was more like the way a truck driver would look at a store clerk. ",

You simply can't be as good at it as someone who practices daily. The reservist can't help it- they don't set the training schedule, and 5.56mm ammunition costs something like $3 and change for a magazine- there simply isn't enough bullets or money to train every infantry reservist to be a marine corps rifleman. That being said, reservists tend to be able to approach situations outside of the box, and bring lots of external concepts to a problem. ",

The army reserves are a crucial and needed part of life, as the support, backup and comrades of the enlisted soldiers. Anyone who would look down on reservists is a fool. My American friend is a reservist in the army, and enlisted soldiers are quite respectful of her experience, intelligence and expertise.

            "answer_text": "A lot of it depends on the Reservists and the AD people involved. After active duty, I went to grad school, but I transferred to the Reserve component. I figured I could do a year and one annual training exercise, and if I didn't care for it, I could transfer to the inactive Reserves (IRR). I was active duty during Desert Storm, but my division wasn't sent. Then on my first drill weekend, there was a Class A uniform inspection at my new Reserve unit. I literally went from being discharged from duty on Monday to getting my orders to my Reserve unit on Wednesday to reporting for drill Friday night. My new CO said \u201cdon't worry about getting your unit patches changed; just wear your uniform as you would have in your old unit and we\u2019ll get you squared away this weekend.\u201d So I show up for drill, and my Reserve unit had been to Desert Storm and I hadn't; they had received decorations and combat patches for it. That earned them some credibility in my eyes real quick. But they liked that I was fresh off active duty, and they often asked me to conduct a block of common task training on drill weekend; anything would do; NBC operations, field first aid, land navigation. They seemed to feel that I had done it all more recently than they had (maybe so) and could give a good presentation. At least in my experience, there was respect in both directions. ",

Us regular army couldn't believe how casual the officers and 1st Sgt's where kinda made us jealous. They were also not as in practice in fieldcraft as we were. They improved quite a bit in their 2 weeks of active duty though. Never worked with national guard. Our mortar platoon could pull up and be ready to fire in a minute. The reserve platoon was closer to 3 minutes. Still within army standards but understandably slower than regulars. At the end of their 2 weeks down to a minute and 30. I was an expert gunner every time we tested. My squad leader regular gunners were twice as fast as me. None of them could run a plotting board in double the time I could. So I was on the radio and board and the best gunners were on the guns. The reserve guys knew what to do they just didn't practice as much as we did. On the rifle range they were just as good as any regular platoon. Some guys would shoot expert and some not. Everyone qualified though just like us. ",

We are aware that there will be some training short falls, but this isn't a hit on their potential. But, they train one weekend a month, two weeks a year. They usually have a short training run up before deployment, but it still isn't the same. But, usually by the half way point in their deployment, they're up to speed. We do admire them for what they do. It can't be easy to jump from civilian life to military life at the drop of a hat. We also reserve the right to make fun of them. But, if you're not getting made fun of, it means we don't love you. And if you're Army, you're still tougher than the Air Force. ",

And I feel there was a difference between us AD types and the USAR. Overtime the USAR became assigned to specific active units (CAPSTONED) to deploy with that AD unit. Still no one really thought it would happen. Until it did. Desert Shield changed all that. Shock and Awe as the reserves were ordered up in huge numbers. In fact the Army could not sustain itself in the field because so much of the logistics tail had found its way into the reserves. The reserves earned respect. The National Guard too. No one asks if anyone is reserve or active anymore. We all wear the same uniform and take the same risks. ",

Of course one of the problems was the reserves and national guard got very little money from the department of defense and always second rate , old equipment. That had been the case since the immediate post Vietnam War time frame. The public did not support our troops. Not true at least since Operation Desert Storm. Now they get much more money and relative training. First line equipment is being provided. Why ? Because today the members of our guard and reserve are highly motivated, educated and patriotic individuals. The truth of the matter is TODAY we cannot fight any war (even limited wars) without the assistance of the great individuals of our guard and reserves ! ",

Often they are prior service filling out their 6 or 8 year commitment after having served on active duty. Those who stay longer than the mandatory time are committed. They give of their time while holding down full time jobs or working on their educations. Currently we have Reserve and National Guard units pulling tours all over the world, relieving the demands on the active duty forces. The reserves are part of the total package, (Yes, besides my 28 years active duty, I did have 4 years in the Army Reserve while I was in college.) ",

The thing with the military is that doing your job well or if you're one of the best at it, that transcends rank, age, job title every thing, just like in the civilian world, if you're one of the best at your job you're afforded certain luxuries or given more leeway when it comes to pushing boundaries so there are some reservists who are treated like royalty.

They would show up and we would pair them up with an active duty person to help train them. At lunch we would start trying to schedule lunch and find out most of the were missing and being told that they were at a doctors, or dentist appointment. When they got through with there appointments you would find them at the airman, NCO clubs or the Base Exchange. The next time you would see them would be Sunday afternoon wanting their papers signed saying they were there for their two days. 5 years later in the 80s I worked with different reservise units again from all over the country, and it was a different ball game. They would come in and almost take over. They were dedicated, disciplined. Airmen you were proud to serve with. Have been retired for over 23 years and am close with a lot of people still in the Air Force and they tell me they would work with any reserve unit anytime, anywhere. ",

They are a big part of all branches and work to shore short falls in time of war. It it is also a good option after you have served as well.
