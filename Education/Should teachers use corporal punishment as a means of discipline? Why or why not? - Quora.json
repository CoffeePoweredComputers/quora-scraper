            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to answer this question by way of a piece I\u2019ve written that relates to this issue: Can The Paddling of Students Constitute Aggravated Assault? It can, and it does. It depends on the location of the school. At this point in time, it's hard to imagine that relative strangers are still legally permitted to beat children with sticks, boards, or any other weapon for that matter. Of course, I refer to the 18 states in the U.S. that still permit the paddling of students as a form of corporal punishment. Not even the majority of parents who reside in these states hit their children with boards. In legal terms, when an adult is struck with an object, the particular object involved is defined as a 'weapon', and, as such, the crime of 'Assault' becomes defined as 'Aggravated Assault'. Not so for children living in the above mentioned 19 states (mostly located in the South East and 'bible belt' regions of the U.S.). It's been decades since B.F. Skinner conclusively discovered that Negative Reinforcement is inferior to Positive Reinforcement in a learning environment. Yet, we still have 'educated' educators attempting to teach through fear and intimidation. It's hard to claim that teachers are entirely at fault. With no possible way to meet the needs of 25-30 students per classroom, it's no wonder they become amenable to school policies that demand control through force... especially if these same teachers were raised in a spanking environment themselves (a prevalent practice in the above-mentioned regions of the country). As things currently stand, we have adults being considered as the victims of Aggravated Assault as the result of being struck with a weapon (object), while at the same time, we have students who are subjected to the same treatment that is described as 'teaching a lesson'. This circumstance can only be described as a prejudicial double-standard of ludicrous proportions. It should be noted that every socially sophisticated country in the world has banned the practice of paddling students as a form of punishment. It is truly ironic that, of all people, we find educators who remain uneducated with regard to the ineffectiveness of corporal punishment as well as the well-established risks that have been associated with this form of punishment. Furthermore, I wonder if anyone can imagine that children would be likely to retain their natural curiosity, as well as their love of learning when placed in a learning environment that posed a threat to their comfort and well-being?

            "answer_text": "No teachers should not use corporal punishment for several reasons. Violence should never be accepted, and yes corporal punishment towards children is violence. Children learn by constructing knowledge in cooperation, every child, every human, is a psychological system in their own right. These systems can connect in groups, and in that group they can construct new knowledge by communicating. How do you expect free flowing communication in an environment, wherein the children are afraid of being hit by a teacher? The Danish philosopher Loegstrup had several things to say about teaching he said that the teacher should be an authority, but not a authoritarian. The teacher should be an authority by being well prepared and being a good teacher and role model. He also said that every time you interact with another human being, you hold a little piece of that person's life in your hands. Holding a little piece of every pupils life in your hands while teaching, is a big responsibility. Don't ruin it by teaching them that violence is a viable option. ",
