            "answer_text": "Simple answer is no. An MBA programme is more than just watching lectures and completing the work. The peer interaction and learning how to work in teams, present and discover alternative solutions is a large part of an MBA program. However, if you don\u2019t have luxury of time and money to take an additional 1 to 2 years out from your career, an MBA on line can be a good introduction to many of the corporate finance concepts and the financial tools needed to analyse business situations . Certainly, there is no harm, but don\u2019t expect that such a programme is going to open many doors. It is up to you to do that and build the track record that validates your capabilities. ",
