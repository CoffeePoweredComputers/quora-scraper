            "answer_text": "I am afraid You\u2019re giving very little info to properly answer your question. If we\u2019re talking about a strict teacher that does not mean we\u2019re talking about a mean one. Teachers are not solely teachers. They are persons like you with their own character and personality, with their ideas and expectations and all these form the way they teach. A strict teacher could be a great opportunity for growth. A strict teacher could lead you to the best performance of your life and possibly unlock or sharpen skills you considered as not your strongest ones. Unfortunately a strict teaching style could also hinder certain students. The thing is though, that this is a matter on which you have no control over. If we want to be realistic you cannot change your teacher and his teaching style. As in many things in your life you will have to find ways to cope. You\u2019ll need to problem-solve. What will make the situation better? How can you appease the teacher and at the same time gain the most he can offer? Spend a bit more time on your homework for him and make sure it at least close to his standards. Try to establish rapport with him, ask him questions and be engaged in his class. Usually that is the best approach to really demanding teachers. Also keep in mind this: Teachers who are rumored to be \u201cthe strictest in the school\u201d are used to students fearing them and disliking them. Sometimes all it takes is some genuine effort on your side to show him you like him and you enjoy his lesson. That you mean well and you\u2019re actually putting in an effort. Usually this attitude alone is all it gets to make both yours and his/hers life easier. Even if nothing works and you still find yourself struggling go to your school counselor, or your parents, or someone you trust and can hear you out. Do your best and remember that this is yet another valuable lesson of how things will be with many people in your life later on. Not all your bosses will be nice and not all your college professors will care of how much you might struggle. Learn from this and sharpen your coping skills. School is not all about curriculum, it\u2019s about life skills as well. Best of luck ",

            "answer_text": "Much that you find in a teacher's teaching style derives from that teachers' personality and their individual needs. Some teachers become strict out of meanness - but just as often it's a byproduct of how they function in their life - they need order. They feel uncertain when things appear disorderly - which is why they get mad. We get mad when we feel threatened. People/teachers who need order don't get nicer when they perceive things to be getting out of hand. Try to understand this teacher - teachers are people too. And you don't say whether you have other teachers - or just this one teacher - and exactly how this is a problem for you. Some students prefer strict teachers - remarkably.But clearly you don't. If this strict teacher is verbally harassing you - that would be one thing. If you're unable to conform to a long list of rigid rules - that's another thing. If you just don't enjoy being in a rigid environment - that's its own thing. You don't give any clues as to how this is hard for you- you just say that it is hard. It's unlikely that you can switch teachers - but sometimes that's an option. It's far more unlikely than you can change this teacher - that's never an option. The best approach to a strict teacher is to go with the flow - the only thing that can make a strict teacher even more strict is fighting back against their strictness - that's a critical error - don't make it. Conform as best you can - you will not have this teacher for the rest of your life. And find a confidante - it helps to be able to complain to someone. Find someone safe to whom you can vent and then go back the next day and conform. The only way to make a strict teacher a bit less strict is to conform to their expectations. ",
