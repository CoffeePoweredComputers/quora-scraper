            "answer_text": "People learn when (and only when) they want to learn.  That's not as harsh as it sounds. We are social animals, and as such we are, at a fundamental level, hard-wired to want to learn from each other. That's particularly obvious in children, who are like sponges for knowledge; they observe everything and learn at phenomenal rates without any idea that they are actually learning. But even adults are observant for novel things in their environment, and quick to pick up new ideas when they appear. But with adults the situation becomes more complicated, since any new information has to integrate with the well-structured knowledge they already have in their heads. So, the correct conditions for learning involve the following: Exposure to new information: we cannot learn unless we see something we don't already know.The new thing must be salient and engaging: it must stand out as important, interesting, beautiful, horrifying, or otherwise attention-grabbing. We will not look further unless our attention is engaged, and our attention is only engaged when something stands out from the background of stuff we experience every day.Some value or purpose: This could be anything, from an urge to please parents to a fear of failure to a desire for a better career to a mere love of solving puzzles; we won't learn unless we get something out of it on some level.Leisure: learning is a time and energy intensive process, even if we don't feel like it is, so we must have the ability to step back and observe. No one learns under pressure; pressure makes people react according to instinct and habit.Communication and application: we don't really understand what we've learned until we try to apply it or try to explain it to someone else. Odd as it may sound, knowledge is collective rather than personal. If you've read Wittgenstein and his dissection of the notion of a private language, you know what I mean.People learn best when all of those conditions are satisfied. ",

            "answer_text": "Interest. When someone is interested, the topic sparks questions. Unexpected discoveries are fascinating. When someone is interested, they pull in whatever they find that feeds that interest. It's very much like handing a jigsaw puzzle to a puzzle nut. Interest creates a desire to pull it together. Need. (Which will inspire interest.) A need creates specific questions the learner wants answered. So again, they pull in answers and information that seems likely to lead to answers. If your love sent you a jigsaw puzzle with her reply to \"Will you marry me?\", that would drive assembling it. Even if you didn't love puzzles you're need to know would pull it together. Innate skill. It's easier to learn when taking on challenges leads to success. But it isn't success alone that's valuable. If the tasks don't feel challenging, then the successes aren't rewarding. An inherent pattern matching skill would make assembling a jigsaw puzzle a quick challenge that others might need hours to do. A passionate, inspiring enthusiast. (Which will inspire interest.) Anyone who can create an emotional connection between what they love and another person can inspire a desire to know more. It's more fun to do jigsaw puzzles with someone who loves doing them. Their passion is infectious. That feeling can carry on even when they're not there. And way behind: External rewards. (Which inspires interest in getting the reward.) Too often external rewards (like cash or grades) inspires memorization. Memorization rarely leads to understanding, rarely is retained long if not used. Without interest in the subject, the goal of one motivated by rewards is to do as little as possible to get the reward. Being paid or getting a prize for assembling a jigsaw puzzle might get the puzzle done, but there's no guarantee the person will come away with a love of jigsaw puzzles. They're more likely to have a love of the prize. ",
