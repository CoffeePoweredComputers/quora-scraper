            "answer_text": "You cannot remove reservation, only make it irrelevant Reservation caused rifts between communities due to demand-supply gap. However with the advent of newer education opportunities, its getting irrelevant in many places. For eg, once people struggled to get into MBA, whereas today we have an over supply, resulting in closure of many colleges. Same goes for Engineering college as well. Truth is that the Industry knows only IITs and NITs, remaining all colleges are put in same bracket. A Bangalore based company wouldn\u2019t know whether you did your engineering from a Tier I college under Mumbai University or a Tier 3 college under Delhi university. In-fact there are Memes out there deterring people from joining engineering course. Similarly most Arts/Commerce/Science colleges also don\u2019t have much reservation fight. Here also the supply is sufficient. The only place where the reservation causes issues is in the Medical field. This is again due to demand-supply issue. When we have less than 55,000 MBBS seats for a 1.21B country, it is grossly under represented. So if the Government increases the seats/colleges to say 200K seats, things would fall in place within a few years. Who knows even medical cost also might come down. To counter the argument that increasing number of seats would dilute its value. I would say its like giving everyone opportunity. After all everyone has to clear the exams to gain the degree, thus everyone would compete equally. Once cannot decide everything based on Marks. A high scoring Doctor might be unethical, rude, arrogant, while a lower scorer be a great person who listens to patients. On the same case most professors in colleges are highly educated, withi high marks, but many of them are really bad at teaching. So my take is that education should be available for all. Give everyone fair chance. Increase the number of institutes. Govt. should ensure quality of those institutes. ",

            "answer_text": "Short Answer : I agree on the points of what @Aditya (\u0906\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e) has written on this answer and also I believe the same, the reservation policy needs a few reforms in India. Long Answer : The lower class people have been oppressed in the past. They have been considered untouchables and not so worth by the upper class people. I condemn on that for what I haven't done. I fully support reservations to help them cope up with the class struggle they faced. Let's not call it reservation but affirmative actions which accelerates the backward clases without decelerating the growth of the upper class. But in the recent years, I've seen more hate brewing between Brahmins and Dalits. There was a time when Brahmins hated the Dalits because the Brahmins considered the Dalits worthless and low key people but today, the reason has changed, the Brahmins (not all but mostly the conservatives) hates the Dalits because they get high reservation in education and Job Sector. I remember when I was in my XII, I had a friend who was an JEE aspirant and was General and another who was again my friend who was again a JEE aspiran but was a SC category student. Both appeared for the examination, the latter qualified and the former failed despite scoring 3x more marks then the SC student. The General student before the exams used to say, \u201creservations are very good, we exploited them for so many years and now let them take the benefits\u201d And after the result came, \u201cReservations are shit. That guy didn't deserve to qualify the JEE\u201d My friend was not wrong, that guy didn't deserve to qualify JEE. C\u2019mon, he couldn't even solve an Integral of NCERT. I don't say here that my friend was right in hating the SC guy. He was totally wrong. He knew that there was reservations and he need to work hard. He knew he need to score more to qualify instead he scored less and at last out of envy, hated that guy. Now, anyone would feel bad if his friend qualifies for an exam despite scoring less. By this example, I wanted to point out the reason for hatred to spun around. The undeserving takes the place and the deserved ones(will not call deserved, if they would be deserving they would qualify but the one who gets more marks then other) fails to get a seat.  Reservation or affirmative action was put forward by the goverment in order to eradicate the caste discrimination in society. By putting reservation in jobs and education sector improving their status Quo. Now the Daltis says, Discrimination hasn't ended. This implies the current reservation policy hasn't been successful. It has failed. It needs some changes. And when you say about changing it, they cry. Hypocrisy!! The main problem in India with reservation is the lower caste themselves don't want to get promoted. There are two ways to make seem a line longer, either you stretch one line longer thsn the other or the other alternative is to erase the other line and make it short. Our people believes in the latter. They believe the Daltis were harassed for so long and now it's time for Dalit to overrule the generals. But sorry, this mentality wouldn't ensure equality. There are two possibilities - Either you go on for anti establishment, i.e, bring a revolution as in US or Africa, beleive in Guevera and bring up reforms or if we want gradual change then there's a bit of reforms required in the reservation policy.  The leaders who advocate for the Dalits themselves don't want to seem them promoted. What if they get educated and promoted? Who will vote for them then? In India, the reservation policy is nothing but to attract voters. Power Corrupts and it has corrupted the parties be it right or the left. Yesterday I wrote a comment in the Indian leftists space which was not against reservation but in support of modification in reservation. The post mocked the Brahmins and which I didn't liked. As I mentioned, the Dalits don't want upliftment of themselves but downfall of Generals. Equality doesn't come this way. I was called a left wing Brahmins snake and what not. Was this Liberal or a left Idea? The Author wanted to enforce his own idea of left. What the Fish? You write anything of like 5% against reservation, and you're called anti-minority, anti-left, right wing and what not.  But IDGAF to any of your versions of Left. I've read articles, I can analyse them and act accordingly. As Socrates said, I cannot tech anybody anything, I can only make them think. So I don't need anyone's version of Left. I have my own. And I'm proud of it. Don't create Hate. ",
