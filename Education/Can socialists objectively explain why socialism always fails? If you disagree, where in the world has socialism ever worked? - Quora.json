            "answer_text": "What you call socialism, some people accurately refer to as mixed economies. And most advanced nations on Earth have them, featuring such systems as universal healthcare systems which are single-payer, government provided interest-free college loans, or simply partially or fully paid college tuition, state pensions, and welfare systems for the unemployed, disabled, and elderly. All of which are sneered at derisively by people who do not understand economics as \u2018evil socialism that always fails\u2019, even though it works in many dozens of countries. Look up Norway, and see how their budget is balanced, GDP per capita is higher than the USA, they have a trillion dollar sovereign fund, single payer universal healthcare, a generous welfare system, paid college tuition, higher starting wages, crime is lower, the murder rate is far lower, unemployment is lower, and 1 in 6 people in Norway is an immigrant. Norway ranks number 1 or very high in a wide range of lists measuring government performance, way ahead of the USA in many categories. The only refrain or retort I ever hear from right wingers is \u2018we can\u2019t do that here in America, our culture is too different\u2019. Implying there is something inherently inferior in the brains of Americans that prevents them from using math the same way as people in Europe. Which I disagree with. Or, they blame it all on taxes on oil, thinking that proves their argument correct. No, it proves MY argument correct. It proves that the \u2018socialism\u2019 works. As if there\u2019s no natural resources, businesses, trade, or income in the USA that could be taxed. The USA is one of the richest nations on Earth even before you talk about the accumulated wealth of individuals. Again, implying Americans literally cannot do things other nations can do with less. And if they\u2019re still stubbornly clinging to the fantasy that America can\u2019t do it because of oil, turn the page to Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, UK, Iceland, France, Spain, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and get a refresher course on how it is possible to do all of this without being an oil rich nation. And again, suggesting America cannot do it because Norway has oil means that the taxes on oil work. You just don\u2019t want to pay the needed taxes. So while you\u2019re over there fumbling, demanding proof from \u2018socialists\u2019 why socialism always fails (and we prove that what you call socialism does work and you\u2019re making excuses) why don\u2019t you stop asking statement-questions designed to stump the liberal, and learn about what liberals think and why. Maybe if you learned it, you wouldn\u2019t have to ask assumption-laden questions which contain an erroneous premise. You would also have a better retort to my response than \u2018America isn\u2019t Norway\u2019 and \u2018but but but oil profits\u2019. Both of those retorts suck out loud and are little more than rhetorical dodges to begin with. Got anything better than that? And can you think for yourself, instead of shoving far right propaganda in my face and asking me to respond to it? It\u2019s literally too easy a challenge. You could probably come up with something more challenging on your own. They call them think tanks but to be quite honest, they think about as well as a swarm of mosquitoes, and it is all so much annoying, pointless buzzing at this point. All of their arguments just as easily swatted. ",

            "answer_text": "The fallacy here is called bait and switch, also known as the strawman. The basic technique is to try to refute idea X by looking at idea Y and refuting it and then claiming that you\u2019ve refuted X when in fact you didn\u2019t discuss it. The problem with this article is that it repeats the usual ignorant American right wing canard of referring to aspects of the type of economy that existed in the Soviet Union, and then say, \u201cThis shows socialism can\u2019t work.\u201d To quote the cited article: \u201cUnder socialism, incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored totally. A centrally planned economy without market prices or profits, where property is owned by the state, is a system without an effective incentive mechanism to direct economic activity.\u201d This makes two mistakes. First, socialism is not an economy \u201cwhere property is owned by the state\u201d. And, second, it need not be a \u201ccentrally planned economy\u201d. The article basically poses a false dichotomy: \u201cEither a capitalist economy with market and prices\u201d or a state run centrally planned economy. That\u2019s a fallacy of false dichotomy because those aren\u2019t the only two possibilities. Socialism is a contested concept so I will here point out the way that many revolutionary socialists \u2014 especially libertarian socialists \u2014 view it. On our view socialism is about the liberation of workers from being a subordinate, exploited class, a class forced to seek jobs under autocratic workplace regimes \u2014 as under capitalism. So this means a necessary condition of an authentic socialist economy is collective, democratic worker self-management of the industries. That is inconsistent with state ownership and control of the economy. A state is based on corporate-style managerialist hierarchies where the workers are subordinate and must \u201cdo as you\u2019re told.\u201d That is a regime of class oppression, not socialism. Second, the system of social production, to be socialist, must be directly accountable to the masses of people in terms of its effects on them \u2014 what it produces, what environmental effects it has. Capitalism fails on this score since firms engage in systemic cost shifting \u2014 pollution being the most obvious example. But direct social accountability of the production system to the masses is inconsistent with some top down system of statist central planning. Rather the old bureaucrtic-military-police state would need to be broken down and governance re-organized on a more directly democratic way for authentic socialism to exist. The cited article is also mistaken when it suggests a capitalist economy is based on \u201cincentives.\u201d The \u201cincentive\u201d for the working class to submit to the autocratic managerialist regime is: \u201cYou better do what we want or we\u2019ll let you starve.\u201d That\u2019s the capitalist meaning of \u201cincentives\u201d.

            "answer_text": "This is a statement masked as a question: you state that socialism \u201calways fails\u201d without qualifying it and providing criterion for evaluating \u201cfailure\u201d. You also fail to describe what you mean by \u201csocialism\u201d, which is crucial because there are different models of socialism that differ drastically in their institutional design. This lack of qualification essentially renders your question meaningless. Nevertheless I will humor you by providing examples of socialist elements that exist in today\u2019s world which lend credence to the viability of a socialist system. Publicly-owned enterprise: There are highly efficient state-owned enterprises in the economies of Norway, Singapore, formerly in France (before they were privatized) and increasingly in the People\u2019s Republic of China following years of reform. Furthermore, Alaska pays each of its citizens an annual social dividend derived from the public ownership of its natural resources, and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund is used to finance its pension fund. In Singapore\u2019s case, revenue from its government-linked companies is increasingly used to finance social spending.Cooperatives: There are plenty of examples of highly efficient employee-owned cooperatives, the most notable being the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation in Spain. These enterprises are owned by their workers collectively, and some like Mondragon are democratically-managed.Self-management: Many firms are embracing greater flexibility and employee self-management in their organization and recognizing that strictly hierarchical forms of management are becoming increasingly ineffective in a modern knowledge-driven information economy. This is most prevalent in the most innovative sectors of the economy like technology and software development.Open-source software: This is more than just socialistic and is essentially communistic because the concept of ownership is negated by sharing of source code, with everyone contributing voluntarily based on their own abilities and freely taking the output according to their own needs without any need for money, rationing, or compelled labor.While none of these examples constitute socialism by themselves, they do represent examples of \u201cworking\u201d - and by that I mean effective and efficient - processes that could easily be combined to constitute a basic market socialist economy. Thus far political will has prevented such a formation from being implemented. With respect to the more comprehensive notion of socialism as a system that dispenses with the dynamic of the accumulation of capital and the profit system, socialism has not yet existed as the technical preconditions for its emergence have yet to be realized. The feasibility of non-market socialism requires a level of technology which enables real-time inventory management of intermediate inputs on an economy-wide scale and the ability to transmit supply and demand information throughout an economy-wide network at a lower transaction cost than the factor market process of capitalism. Political will is not sufficient for such a system to emerge; socialism is only made possible by advances in technology that make new, non-market forms of resource allocation both feasible and more efficient than extant capitalistic processes. While such a system might be on the verge of technical feasibility, the existing elite and ruling classes are loath to explore any post-capitalist system because such a system eliminates their roles and privileged positions. Political will alone cannot achieve socialism, and the mere fact that a ruling political party has \u201csocialist\u201d in its title doesn\u2019t make a country\u2019s economy socialist. As an example, if a socialist president were elected in the United States, that fact alone would do nothing to alter the actual processes of the American economy and automatically transform the United States into a socialist economy. Countries like the former Soviet Union and the contemporary People\u2019s Republic of China are at most \u201csocialist states\u201d - countries whose official goal is the realization of socialism. Whether or not their respective means of achieving socialism are effective in working toward that goal is an entirely different question altogether; the key point is that disagreeing with their means of achieving socialism or their practical day-to-day policies is entirely different from disagreeing with the goal of having a socialist economy and the desirability of socialism. It is also important to note that the socialist political movement, or socialist state, or a particular socialist party and its actions is not definition of socialism. Socialism is defined as a distinct socioeconomic system. ",

            "answer_text": "You would think that building something like a road, that is financed collectively, and publicly available for free should be possible. And yet humans have been trying for thousands of years, and not a single meter of road could ever be built. Somehow, there is something about governments that just makes them utterly incompetent, no matter what kind of government we are talking about. They pay builders, and follow the correct engineering methods, and try to build roads, and then it just doesn\u2019t work, because socialism.  Obviously the result of socialism It\u2019s a really weird thing to see! There is even a famous scientific experiment about it: Shroedinger\u2019s road. The idea is that you take a construction company, and task them with building a road. And the funding has a 50% chance of being public, and 50% chance of being private. And when the road is finished, it exists in a superposition of working and not working. If you look at the source of the funding, it collapses the wave structure, and the road either works because it was private funding, or doesn't work if it was public funding. The mere act of observation can change reality, isn\u2019t physics interesting? The fundamental law of nature that \u201csocialism doesn\u2019t work\u201d is first credited to Adam Smith, who also invented the idea of trading stuff in 1776.  Sarcasm aside, honestly, it\u2019s weird to me when people claim that it\u2019s completely impossible for public infrastructure or services to exist, and that it always fails. ",

Or its plain trolling which I believe to be against the rules. If that statement is a violation of BNBR then I'll happily withdraw my answer. I'm fully aware of the institutionaliused state of US political ignorance and it is not really fair to blame the OP, but really, the question is so far off the mark it is difficult to give any other honest answer although Unarguably, Socialism is simply the holding and management of of some things in common. That's it. Any amount of nuance and elaboration will not make the basic fact that socialism is intrinsic to human civilisation go away. Every single country in the world, every city, town and village, every town house and country hovel without exception uses socialist systems to make life better for its inhabitants. Socialism has not \u201cfailed\u201d at all, it's all around us and will continue to be there all the time people are capable of agreeing to manage their societies by whatever rules they see fit. And I'm not even going to bother taking that link down point by point, I've dealt with every single straw man from the limited Libertarian repertoire countless times, they chose their song and I'll leave them to it if it makes then happy.

The answer to \u201cwhere in the world has socialism ever worked?\u201d is \u201ceverywhere that there were human beings, for the vast majority of the time that there were human beings\u201d. Long answer For the vast majority of the time that human beings have existed, the statements \u201cThis is my land\u2014you can\u2019t go on it unless I give permission\u201d and even \u201cThis is my food\u2014I don\u2019t have to share it if I don\u2019t want to\u201d would have seemed obviously wrong, indeed probably insane, and certainly dangerous. Human survival required that land be held in common, and that the product of one\u2019s labor be shared. If you had to give this system a name from modern politics, what would you give it? Surely \u2018communism\u2019\u2014or perhaps \u2018anarchism\u2019, since there was nothing resembling a state (the idea we have of \u2018cavemen\u2019 having tribal chieftains or councils of elders is false). But this would, I imagine, come within your definition of \u2018socialism\u2019. So human beings were universally \u2018socialists\u2019 for the vast majority of the time that they have existed. What happened when they abandoned \u2018socialism\u2019? http://www3.gettysburg.edu/~dperry/Class%20Readings%20Scanned%20Documents/Intro/Diamond.PDF \u2018The worst mistake in the history of the human race\u2019 according to (in this case) Guns, Germs and Steel author Jared Diamond. The beginning of slavery, despotism, and (by some definitions of the word) war. So human beings were universally socialist for the vast majority of the time that they existed, and the abandonment of socialism was a catastrophe. \u2018Non-socialism\u2019, this strange system that we have been trying to make work recently, is so impractical that we call a society long-lived and stable if it lasts for a few thousand years, not the minimum of 50,000 years (it depends what you count as a \u2018human being\u2019) that \u2018socialism\u2019 lasted. The premise of the question is not just wrong, but is almost the opposite of the truth. ",

Sure, they will claim that Europe and Scandinavia are socialist, but Europe and Scandinavia don\u2019t meet any definition of socialism that I am familiar with. All of the forms of socialism share one pillar. That is the control of business by government. This control occurs due to ownership by government. That one pillar results in a lot of follow on items and issues. One of these followons is that products are designed not for the marketplace, but for government approval. This is what led to the failures of the ussr and Eastern Europe behind the iron curtain. This didn\u2019t allow the people to generate the wealth necessary to jump start a growing and vibrant economy. This is why socialism and experiments in socialism fail, economics. Economics matter infinitely more than the socialists or the media want to tell people about.

One has to realize that transitioning from one social formation to another isn\u2019t easy and fails many times before succeeding. That is actually the history of capitalism and it\u2019s long and bloody transition from feudalism. So why did Socialism fail in the twentieth century? My opinion is that there really never was socialism yet anywhere. For instance, in the Soviet Union you really had a state capitalist bureaucracy with social programs. This was recognized as such even by people like Stalin despite the west calling it socialism or communism. How to have a successful socialist society would be to eliminate any fundamental processes or accepts of capitalism. Otherwise, whatever you start with will eventually become capitalism. Also, you need a clearly enough worked out socialist alternative to capitalism which has not happened yet. The left does not have a complete theory of that so it spends most of it\u2019s time criticizing capitalism and trying to make it less harsh. ",

This is my particular view on the matter This triggered a specific type of of revisionism, that is, that a pacific coexistence of socialism and capitalism is possible. That this is the case is exemplified by the dissolution of Comintern as a way to unify the front against the threat of fascism, but this was a transient measure, as it was the case with the union of KMT and the CP against the Japanese. But the existential threat posed by the nuclear bomb to any form of government had to be elementally be justified in ideological terms.  Only countries that were either in a very advantaged stage of revolutionary process or those that were really backwards that received help from USSR . This led to may splits, starting with the Soviet-Yugoslav. Thus, the socialist countries were mostly stuck with peoples that were either too poor or too severely damaged by wars and colonialism. The lack of manpower to fight capitalism eventually led to corruption within each of the countries, which thus made socialism to literally bankrupt. Only those who were forcefully isolated could sustain themselves longer, as of 2018, those two being North Korea and Cuba. ",
