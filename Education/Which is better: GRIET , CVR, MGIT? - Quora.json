            "answer_text": "The better college for a better career! In the discussion of which is the better , I\u2019ll put my point being CVRite. Among 900 students those who graduate or step into, every year at CVR, I am one among those. Before choosing which is the best college, I would suggest you rather think this way \u201cif you really wanna go for engineering?\u201d. If you are a dreamer chose engineering to make the world a better place then, CVR becomes a platform for you in plenty ways. Instead, if you are a person chose engineering just to get a degree, CVR is not for you, you may find it tuff to survive at CVR. Let's break it into several features and discuss... What makes an engineering college good? 1.INFRASTRUCTURE 2.OPPORTUNITIES 3.CULTURE 4.PLACEMENTS 5.CURRICULUM 6.SPORTS and ENTERTAINMENT INFRASTRUCTURE : The Infrastructure at the CVR is well sufficiently provided in fact it is over provided. Every department has the required number of computer labs or respective labs. Adding the CVR has APPLE lab, IOT lab which most of the competitors doesn't have. OPPORTUNITIES : The students here have the ample number of opportunities to showcase their talent and to widen their learning, like the technical and cultural fests, hackathons, competitions, contests, projects etc.. CULTURE : The culture here is the pretty much same as any other educational institution. You should respect the professors, fellow students, any other staff. Absolutely NO to RAGGING. The policy here is very simple GIVE RESPECT AND TAKE RESPECT. PLACEMENTS : If you could gather the statistics and analyze it shows the CVR on top for the placements. The respected P.T.O (placement training officer) Vijaya Mair will have all possible ways to get the student placed. The only qualities that placement office expect is manners, sincerity and the attitude of learning. If you attain these qualities you are placed at campus placements. CURRICULUM: The CVR is an autonomous college affiliated to JNTU, where you can find well-structured curriculum. The complete schedule is pre-informed at the beginning of the academic year. You come across two midterms before final exams every semester. SPORTS and ENTERTAINMENT : The CVR has a wonderful ground for CRICKET where every year there are tournaments conducted. Adding the college has basketball, volleyball courts and many indoor games like table tennis, badminton, chess, caroms etc.. I never made use of any of these. Coming to entertainment, the college has many student clubs like theatre, stepping souls(dance), singing, literary etc.. clubs which provide that first chance to showcase their talent for the students and are mentored by skilled faculty each. So, after discussing every feature, on whole there some other special features that CVR solely has, adopting innovative ideas, providing students the projects to automate processes at college that give satisfaction for building working models to the participant students. College has ENTREPRENEUR cell where students with those skills are welcomed to share ideas. CVR proudly showcase their student's talent in every field by inviting their alumni students who excelled in any field as chief guests to their annual celebrations. CVR see the pride in their student's success. Every time you will find ample opportunities, but, it is completely up to you to make fruits out of it.

            "answer_text": "CVR \u2026 I would just quote one example.. Once when my friend had gone to NIT Warangal for a technical fest and went to our HOD as he was absent ( yes this sucks!! but you have to go to your HOD with a leave letter if you were absent and show him/her proofs if demanded) ,then our HOD said \u201cWhy do you waste your time on such fests instead of concentrating on your studies ?\u201d,.. I think that's enough regarding their attitude. And regarding faculty and academics\u2026 Faculty for the first year are extremely bad except one or two They just train you for passing the exams . You would listen \u201cthis is important\u2019\u2019 hundred times a week .. they would be just running behind the syllabus .. labs are not bad. And academics in other colleges .. Academics in almost all the EAMCET colleges are really bad , you would excell only if you work extremely smart and dedicated. MGIT or GRIET.. almost all are same. \u2018Gadhoon ko manufacture karthe hain\u2019 I would suggest you drop an year if you really want to get into IITs or NITs or you have passion towards Engineering..
