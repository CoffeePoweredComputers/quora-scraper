            "answer_text": "Hello my friend, I understand your situation. Few years back when my elder cousin was selected into one of the NITs, even I had that thought. Today I, myself, am a student of NIT Raipur. Well fact is there are several good colleges besides NITs. Definitely IITs are the best. But after IITs, there are BITS Pilani, IIIT Hyderabad and few others among private, Jadavpur University, College of Engineering Pune, ICT Mumbai, NSIT, DTU etc. among the state public and BIT Mesra among semi private, which are good. But if you go with overall idea about tags and others, then NITs are no doubt the second choice among the Indian Engineering aspirants. This is mainly because there are several facilities which NITs and IITs provide that other colleges don't. You will be encouraged to go with your own inventions, innovations, researches and start-ups with the aid of the college and it's facilities. Your professors shall even help you with your work. Besides all these are heavily funded and supported by Government of India. Beside you will get a peer group who will provide you a healthy competition. You shall also have seniors who shall mentor and guide you. You shall have most professors who shall sought out your doubt related to your studies or general queries. Last but not least, the NITs enjoy a special status of \u201cInstitute of National Importance\u201d. This three-word phrase is something that actually support all these works. Now rest is up to you. PS: I really enjoyed the sarcastic answers of my fellow quorans. ",

I have been to NIT Trichy and NIT Warangal for fests, and they do not have good infrastructure - at least from the outside. Now, if your interest in in CSE related fields, the next choice would be IIITs. Otherwise, I would recommend BITs and VIT. MIT comes after the top few NITs. Unfortunately, most people find it difficult to digest the fact that a couple of top private institutes can beat NITs. For those people, Abanish Roy's answer to Why do people deplore VIT so much? Yash Jaiswal's answer to Why do people deplore VIT so much? Dania Faruqui's answer to What is wrong with the Indian education system? These are the perfect replies. Its ultimately your choice - go for NITs cause they have a brand name and alumni (who cares about infrastructure or academics), or go for Private institutes like BITs or VIT. ",

NITs like NIT Trichy NIT Warangal NIT Allahabad NIT Suratkal are even better than lower IIT\u2019s and have very good placements. Some of them have even been able to touch more than a Crore package for their students. Facilities at these NITs are also best among the colleges in India, good hostel, sports, cultural and tech facilities. So you can surely choose from them, but don\u2019t go for very poor ranking NIT\u2019s as they are not so good. Hope you liked it. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it simply can\u2019t be compared. It totally depends on your interests and what you want out of it? In terms of placements and studies generally IITs and NITs are better collages than others. I know some students who got seat in IIT but didn\u2019t get their desired branch. So they came to NIT to pursue their B.tech in desired branch. There are also some examples of students who got into very prestigious NITs but having no interest in branch they got in NIT, they switched into private collage for desired branch. So I think first decide in which branch/area you are interested in? and than collage. As far my knowledge top NITs are better than some IITs and come after top 7\u20138 IITs. Hope this will help!
