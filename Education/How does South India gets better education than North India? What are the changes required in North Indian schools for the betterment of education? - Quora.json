            "answer_text": "Thank u for A2A. I don't know from where u got this awesome information,but as far as I know the north Indian states board is far better and knowledgeable than South Indian states syllabus wise. WB board is the toughest board followed by Odisha and bihar. I have heard UP board is also upto the mark. But have u ever seen the syllabus of Andhra board. Those students who goes to South India to take joint coaching along with schooling they were taught only about joint for 10 months and only 2 months for board exam still they manage to get above 90%. I have people get 90% just by studying one week before exam(obviously they were studying for joint before) Every year so many children go to stydy in South India(I m talking only about schools) do u know why? Because getting marks is a childs play there. I have seen my own classmate who never got more than 75% till class 10 in ICSE got 92% in 12th in Andhra board.Hmmm magic I guess. Many students who didn't get science in my school or in any reputed school they went to South India to study and there not only they got science but also passed out with flying colors(They went to a boarding school and their schedule is pathetic to say the least). If u want u can simply download the board question paper of different boards and compare and decicde for urself. I hope it helps. Thank u. ",
