            "answer_text": "I'll give you a simple solution: don't bother. I'm not kidding. It would be a waste of precious time you could spend brushing up your knowledge in physics, chemistry and maths, so that you could do better in those parts. I personally know people in iiser Kolkata who did not even attempt the biology sections. BUT, just for the added edge, go through your 10th standard biology text book again (9th too if you can.). Brush up those concepts. If you really have a great deal of time on your hands and don't know what else to revise, just pick up the NCERT 11th and 12th standard books and flip through them. That will surely suffice. Cheers! And all the best for the exam! ",
