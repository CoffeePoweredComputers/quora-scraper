            "answer_text": "Hello! I gave my VITEEE last year (2016) . I'm currently a first year student at the university. No, VITEEE is not very difficult. The syllabus in our time was the PCM portion for 12th, and a few 11th chapters. Only basic. You're referring to the right books, but let me tell you the MOST essential book is the previous years solved questions. I personally solved the ENTIRETY of this book, and despite randomly selecting answers to Straight Lines, was able to get a rank of 10k. Since your target is 2.5k, you should probably brush up Maths. You're overdoing Physics a little bit;most of it will be modern physics and that's relatively simple. Maths will have complex numbers and straight lines (the most important chapter IMHO) so do it judiciously. I hope you get in the first category itself, like I did. So good luck! I personally hope you come here. I love this place. Any other questions please feel free to ask. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello I have given my VITEEE in 2013 and got a decent rank to get admission in Electronics and Communication Branch. VIT entrance exam is not really tough but you have to maintain more accuracy while attempting the paper. Since paper is very easy so yes you have to face a tough competition to grab a seat.  Chemistry will definitely help you in scoring good marks because the questions are very basic and intermediate based so strong concepts of NCERT would suffice your requirements. Physics and Mathematics are typical, Complete the tautology, negation , assertion, positive and negative statements portion because questions are generally asked from these topics. Make sure you are good in your basics of 11 and 12 in order to crack VITEEE, its a big exam with around 3 Lacs applicants, so be fast and accurate. All the best!!  ",
