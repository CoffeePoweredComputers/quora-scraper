            "answer_text": "The age of P and Q are in the ratio of 5:3. If after 6 years, their age will be in the ratio of 7:5, what is the present age of P Let the age of P be x and the age of Q be y. As per statement, the ages of P and Q are in the ratio of 5 : 3. Thus x/y = 5/3 Cross multiplication 3x = 5y x = 5y / 3\u2026Eq..1 After 6 years, their age will be in the ratio of 7:5 After 6 years their ages will be x + 6 and y + 6. Their ratio (x + 6) / (y + 6) = 7/5 Cross multiplication 5 (x + 6) = 7 (y + 6) 5x + 30 = 7y + 42 5x - 7y = 42 - 30 5x - 7y = 12 \u2026Eq..2 Putting the value of x from Eq..1 to Eq..2 5x - 7y = 12 5 (5y/3) - 7y = 12 25y/3 - 7y = 12 (25y - 21y) / 3 = 12 Cross multiplication 25y - 21y = 12 \u00d7 3 4y = 36 y = 36/4 y = 9 Thus the age of Q is 9 years Now putting the value of y in Eq..1 to derive value of x x = 5y / 3 x = 5 \u00d7 9 / 3 x = 5 \u00d7 3 x=15 Thus, the present age of P is 15 years. Answer the present age of P is 15 years and present age of Q is 9 years ",

            "answer_text": "We have two variables. We therefore need at least 2 unique equations to get a unique solution for these two variables. The trick is finding these two equations from the given information. The equations we have are: 1.) 5P = 3Q 2.) 7(P + 6)= 5(Q + 6) From Equation 1 we have: 3.) Q = 5/3P From Equation 2 we have: 4.) 7P + 42 = 5Q + 30 Substituting Equation 3 into 4 we have: 5.) 7P + 42 = 5(5/3P) + 30 \u2192 7P - 25/3P = -12 \u2192 -4/3P = -12 \u2192 P = 9 Substituting Equation 5 into 3 we have 6.) Q = (5/3)(9) \u2192 Q = 15 The question only asks for the age of P but so you could have stopped at step 5. ",
