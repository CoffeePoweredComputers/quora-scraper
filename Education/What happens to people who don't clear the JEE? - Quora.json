The problem arises when u start thinking that getting into an IIT is the only option for a better career. You need to understand that it's one of the options and not the only option. There are much more important things in life like your health, peace of mind, your motivation and your confidence on yourself. You should not loose that. Every person is unique in their own way. Stay Well, Study Well! Be onfident and you can achieve anything. ",
