This will keep learners engaged. While teaching online try to make beautiful slides containing multimedia content not only text! Also try to give real life examples wherever possible. I just listed all the points which i think a teacher can consider while trying to teach online. I hope my teachers also read this answer so that me and my classmates don\u2019t have to suffer. ",

Every education expert is suggesting to move in this direction because of the several benefits associated with it. You can ask supplementary questions via the chat box, this makes your classes more lively. Moreover, it can be watched multiple times. So it provides you the flexible schedule. Interaction can be among the students by way of question answers. I have heard that KSG is starting the online batch (KOL) from today itself for the duration of 10 months. Here we can earn our fee back because of the scholarship programme. Jai Hind!! ",

So I would suggest you can include some video in you presentation , can keep a small game session related to your subject like complete the formula , guess the answer which would create a sense of competition among students and would also engage them . Also you can see how other fellow teachers on youtube are teaching and can learn from them .This would surely make your class more engaging and lively . Please upvote if you found it useful :) ",
