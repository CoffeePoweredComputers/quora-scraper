            "answer_text": "There are many obstacles to teaching primary school kids. There are many kids that have sense of entitlement. They expect exceptional grades for mediocre work. They fail to recognize that grades are earned not \u201cgiven\u201d. Cell phones are a major distraction in class. I personally don't understand why a child needs a cell phone. If parents need to contact a child they can call the school! I have been teaching for almost 18 years and have never failed to deliver a message from the office to a student. The evaluation system for teachers is unreasonable. There is not human alive let alone any teacher that can accomplish all of the things this system of evaluation requires of us. I am a dedicated educator but I also have a personal life. I could not possibly accomplish all that is required of me under this system. It basically is designed so that you can not ever perform at that level. If you dont believe me look up any school systems Danialson evaluation rubric and tell me that you could do everything that is listed. No child left behind and standardized tests have all but destroyed our ability to teach what they need to survive and thrive as adulds. Some of us have more then 100 students on any given day. How could we possibly provide any individual support with that many kids. These are just a few of the problems with trying to teach today. Our schools have been turned into \u201cfactories\u201d that churn out kids by the thousands. The system is broken. ",
