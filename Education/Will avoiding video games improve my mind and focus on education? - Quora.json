            "answer_text": "For one, there should definitely be care taken when asking random strangers for life advice. I mean you might get good advice that you may be able to use but people responding on here might also not have any real care or concern for you or your well-being so they might just talk without really thinking through what they\u2019re saying. Since no one responded I\u2019ll give some insight from my life experience that may be helpful. First it would depend on why you\u2019re playing video games and if you stop what will you be doing with that time? If you used playing video games to escape reality(as I once did) then if you remove video games you just have an irritated individual that\u2019ll likely go smoke more pot(something I did a long time ago and don\u2019t do anything or even drink in a really long time). If you played out of boredom then what would you fill that time with? Sports? Friends? Girlfriends/Boyfriends?, New hobby?, Studying more? You see it really depends on why you\u2019re wanting to play games. For the right person stopping games might help him focus better on his education but from my experience the kids like this don\u2019t really have a problem with games or education. It was usually the kids who are addicted to gaming or have made it a hobby that they can\u2019t really control. Try asking people who know you, who\u2019d give you honest advice that isn\u2019t in their best interest to give. Like asking your gaming buddy if you game too much\u2026 he might be biased in his response. Asking your parents if you game too much\u2026 they may also be biased. But since I don\u2019t know you I can\u2019t tell for sure if it\u2019s a problem for you or not. I know it appears to have played a huge role in creating problems in my life.. but there was actually a bigger problem underneath and playing games too much was just the manifestation of that underlying problem. The more I worked on the underlying problem at the root of all of it the more my life has improved and my ability to experience my potential has improved. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Not avoiding video games\u2026but rather seeing the joys of education for yourself personally. Not for marks or certificates, but like the curiosity to know about something a teacher is teaching and how you want to use it\u2026It\u2019s like a thirst for knowledge that doesn\u2019t let you think about anything else, but constantly building on the area the educational institution is giving you an opportunity to\u2026Nothing else keeps you going during the day, except this\u2026But of course, to balance out your other interests, you can do other things\u2026 But just follow creation/consumption ratio is always >=1!! So even if you are learning things, you\u2019ve got to apply it to really make you satisfied with the learning process. It involves you totally. ",
