            "answer_text": "To master organic chemistry your fundamentals should be very strong.From the very start of organic chemistry i.e Nomenclature you have to keep everything in mind if you want to score well in organic chemistry. If you asking for important part of organic chemistry i would say then the most imp. Part is hydrocarbons. This chapter will decide whether you will score good marks or not because this chapter will help you in all other chapters. So make sure that you have to master this chapter. And other chapter that is imp. From the exam point of view is aldehyde and ketones. It is a very big chapter and has many name reactions. See, treat organic chemistry as a whole topic because all chapters are inter related so you can\u2019t skip one and learn other. So try to master your basics(Nomenclature,stereochemistry,hydrocarbons) and you will definitely score good in organic chemistry and that will give you edge over others in the exam. And yes a tip for you if you want to perform well in organic chemistry.Try to make the short notes of each and every chapter you study as it will help you alot while revising as you know organic chemistry is full of name reactions and exceptions. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Before you jump to class 12 organic chemistry, it is important for you to clear your basics about the tools of organic chemistry, isomerisms, nomenclature , breaking of bonds, and formula of compounds. This will be the structural unit for your std 12 Organic Chemistry, when you deal qith chapters such as alkyl and aryl halids, carboxylic acids and so on. So it\u2019s important to go through entire chapter that deals with the basic unit of organic chemistry in std 11. Upvote if it helps. Thank you, All the best. ",
