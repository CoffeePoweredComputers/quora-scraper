            "answer_text": "As a US teacher, I think it should be pointed out that this question is unanswerable at such a general level. Our schooling system is state and locally controlled, and there are as many answers to this question as there are schools. So keep that in mind. I\u2019ll tell you about my experiences teaching in the US South, mostly in small cities and rural communities. Most US students here don\u2019t take the college preparatory curriculum (honors/ AP/ IB). Those college-track classes are challenging and the students who do well in them generally graduate from college successfully. Not all these college-track students earn great grades, and not all of them go on to college, but most earn at least a 4 year degree from a regional or state university. Your very top performers generally do well at more elite universities and in more demanding majors, like sciences, medicine, law, etc. The students who aren\u2019t college-bound are a problematic case. They often say they will go to college (often spelling it \u201ccollage\u201d), but few of them actually ever earn a degree of any kind. Some are probably of low-average intelligence, but by far most of them are simply average, healthy, normal kids who want to pass their classes but aren\u2019t particularly academically oriented otherwise. (Note that some actually belong in the college track but, unfortunately, lack the home support/ stable environment/ mental and emotional stability to persist and succeed there. Sometimes the school succeeds in getting them into that higher track to stay, but not always.) Yes, some students are terribly lazy and won\u2019t do much work despite being quite capable of passing. However, the vast majority of students, lazy or not, are at least \u201caverage\u201d in my experience and their school-refusal behavior typically has nothing to do with their intellectual ability. Sometimes it\u2019s emotional. Sometimes it\u2019s cultural; anti-intellectual attitudes are very common in less affluent American communities, and minority students in particular may carry out their adolescent rebellion by rejecting school-related expectations and academic values. In my community, I\u2019m very different from most of the students I serve and this can be a factor in how much they learn. Then again, what is the connection between their academic program and the hourly-wage jobs they will transition to after graduation? Unlike college-bound students, high GPAs don\u2019t bring them any obvious rewards at all\u2014 there are no hiring preferences for higher GPAs, for instance. Sometimes these students openly say the curriculum doesn\u2019t matter and has nothing to do with their future jobs. They\u2019re wrong about that\u2014 they\u2019re supposed to be voters and parents one day, not just workers, and they need the knowledge. However it\u2019s difficult to convince most adolescents of this. They lack the insight to understand it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, for the most part, the system is pretty well screwed. Bush 2 and his Conservative Christian and Oligarch buddies have pretty well disemboweled any hope of a decent public school system for the next 50 or so years. Think I am joking? Or did you miss the fact that the TEXAS STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION voted 10 to 5 to teach the poor little kids in Texas that these United States, back in the day, was founded on---CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES---.   This is known, in polite circles as propaganda.  So, yeah...decline is a mild version of the really fucked up hodge-podge state by state, city by city crazy-quilt education system we have at the K-12 level.  While it is true there are some really great individual school systems and some totally awesome individual schools out there, as a blanket answer to your blanket question...we have been well and truly fucked by Bush 2 and by the subsequent efforts to undo the rape of the system. An Addition...Mike Kirby commented, in somewhat negative tones, about my statements. Mr. Kirby, from his answer to this question and in his comment to my answer, seems to follow the party line of the current iteration of the GOP and the theocrats that have become their literal bedmates.  In no small measure has the damage to our country of this party line become more apparent, IMHO than in our education system's treatment of two areas...the philosophical and legal underpinnings of the US and the issue of Darwinian natural selection/evolution v \"Intelligent Design\" or whatever it is called.  I don't really have to become embroiled in the evolution issue, since Bill Nye handed Ken Ham his walking papers some months ago. I will direct readers who have open minds, open hearts and open wills to take a look at the article (see the URL below) for a rather interesting look at the issue of whether this is a \"Christian\" nation or not. As you read, keep in mind a couple of items that Mr. Kirby and his theo-political friends are hell-bent on revising--part of the reason for the Revolutionary War was to ensure there would be NO STATE RELIGION like the Church of England.Here is the URL  http://infidels.org/library/modern/farrell_till/myth.html A Second Addition...A Mr. Cole Thornton has weighed in with what appears to be a set of comments that are so vague and disorganized and, truth be told, of such poor scholarship and, dare we say it...spelling...that he in the briefest of moments, literally proves the point that the machinations of Bush 2, on behalf of his oligarch barons  seems to have succeeded to gut the U.S. education system so that only elites get education and proles get sufficient \"larnin'\" to slop hogs. I give you this example. \"An amazingly myopic and inaccurate scree.\" He evidently has some familiarity with the thesaurus and in a quite laughable attempt to sound educated, possibly erudite, he uses scree...an attempt at a derisive slap at his target being just a jumble of words. His lack of insight is quite evident in the next sentence..which is \"Best of luck with your journey of self discovery.\" Two issues...first, the sentence is meaningless in or out of context and self-discovery, in this sense, is hyphenated.   His second \"broadside\" is nonsensical in that it is disjointed, offering little substance and contains spelling errors that someone of erudition or someone working under such a facade would careful insure would not happen.  Mr. Thornton, then, is no more and no less than Mr. Kirby. Likely an arch- Conservative Republican, likely Red State, in thrall of Mr. Limbaugh and the minions of Rupert Murdoch and propably praying to Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann as if they were Conservative Christian Valkyries. I have found these types to be only interested in their version of truth...and adverse to fact. It is instructive to identify them. It is useless to try to converse with them for the reason cited--they are only interested in their truth--not in fact. ",
