            "answer_text": "Dear student, Well, Big no\u2026 you can do a post graduation degree without graduation. Now i would like to tell you about the career options for M.Ed: Master of Education (M Ed) is a post graduate degree course that can be done after completing your B Ed program. As it is obvious, the course is aimed at brushing up your knowledge of methodology of educational research and getting yourself acquainted with social and psychological aspects of teaching and education. Due to unparalleled development in the field of education during the last few decades, the need was felt for such programs and courses, which can fill the void of expertise in this domain. In India, the absence of an M Ed degree renders you ineligible to teach senior secondary classes. A degree of M Ed is also compulsory to get employed as a post graduate teacher\u2026 Following are the some good colleges for you.

For example, most universities require a 2:1 degree in order to do Masters level work. Also, sometimes they may want you to have some teaching experience. However, to answer you question more directly, no you do not need a B.Ed to do a M.Ed. Good luck!! ",
