I have no idea how Black holes exist but I can easily tell you the difference between polyrhythms and polymetrics. I\u2019m not great with how inserting new DNA into plant cells can create an entirely different species but I know almost every capital of every sovereign nation in the world simply because I\u2019ve put the work in. How do you distinguish? Ask them. ",

Just because a person is educated doesn\u2019t mean they cannot be ignorant in the sense of being discourteous or rude. A poorly or incompletely educated person is perfectly capable of of being courteous and respectful. Let\u2019s rephrase the question: How can I quickly distinguish an ignorant British person from one who is not? Simple, as with any other nationality, as soon as they open their mouth and come out with disrespectful rubbish. Or How can I quickly distinguish an educated British person from one who is not? Why? So you can establish your social status? It doesn\u2019t work like that here in the UK, we treat each other with respect, unless you are a twat of course. ",
