            "answer_text": "Yes, I took a 120-hour TEFL course online from International TEFL & TESOL Training! The course has 20 units and you have up to 6 months to work through all of them. The units alternate between teaching skills (lesson planning, classroom management, teaching methodologies, etc.) and English grammar units. After every unit, you have to do a short multiple choice quiz about the course content. It\u2019s quite easy to pass. After you have completed all 20 units, you write an essay about a teaching/ESL related topic and then you graduate and get certified! When you sign up for their 120-hour course with tutor support, you\u2019ll also get a FREE 50-hour course in teaching Business English or teaching Young Learners! I ended up taking both 50-hour courses and found better teaching positions with these specializations! This option is priced at $349; but if you sign up through my link, you can save 20% on their courses: International TEFL & TESOL Training Courses ",

It is not just about knowing your subject, presentation, dealing with questions, etc. It is also about classroom management, safety, control, etc. You can only learn that by doing. ",

I have two daughters that are teachers and i never heard them talking about getting teaching licenses online. You see you need a license in order to teach. So please be careful with getting certificates to teach on the internet. I'm sure they'll take your money, but without a actual license you will not be able to teach. Be careful with internet certificates. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "A very important part of training to be a teacher is student teaching. Ordinarily, one spends a semester visiting schools and learning how schools of different kinds function, and then one spends a semester as a student teacher - all day, every school day, first observing, and then being in charge of a class. Most people find that\u2019s a bare minimum in preparing them to teach. There is now more emphasis than there used to be on time spent in the classroom in preparation, and that\u2019s a good thing.
