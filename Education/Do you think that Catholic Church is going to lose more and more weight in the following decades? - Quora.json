            "answer_text": "I did not hear the pope advising on physical exercise so I doubt it. (Though with Francis I could actually see that one coming). If you mesn loss of members. I unfortunately doubt it. A lot has to be done in terms od education all over the world. And there are still financial incentives to be \u201cChristian\u201d in many countries. In mine I lose about 1,9% of my wage to the church but I could be buried on a Lutheran graveyard. A catholic one if I was catholic. They are cheaper than public ones and someone taking care of the grave is automatically in the contract. So if I didn't want to get incinerated and thrown down the garbage dump (or something similar. I'm gone anyway I don't want anyone to bother with the few specks of dust left of me) it'd be a financial incentive to stay in church an officially be a \u201cChristian\u201d. And with education lacking in many major catholic parts and incentives like that in educated countries it will be a long while. Nobody will believe in god anymore in the west (excluding America, I will not go into a rant right now. Let's just say, I have no hope for America. In ANY regard whatsoever. ) but a large population will still be \u201cChristian\u201d like i am a member at my gym. I'm never there but somehow I'm still a member. I always forget to cancel the subscription. Same way I count as a Netflix user despite Netflix Germany being worthless. Just a subscription I forgot to cancel. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is Yes, in fact not only the catholic church but also every religion will suffer the same. It have happened before and it\u2019s repeating. Black Death (1346 \u2013 1353) dead-est : 75,000,000 \u2013 200,000,000  The black death was the deadliest pandemic recorded in human history. There were mainly three stages in that. Stage I : People being very religious and attending church everyday so that so that God would forgive their sins. That tragically resulted in more infections since the contamination occurring in the church Stage II : People lost confidence in their religion as people were getting infected in a faster pace and god was horribly silent. People starting to doubt the church and it\u2019s administration. Stage III : Social isolation being introduced, meaning that People who are near the out break will stay at home and not get out unless it\u2019s very necessary & People who are rich and could afford will go from densely populated areas to a less populated place. This is basically what will happen in the Covid-19 outbreak. people will most likely lose interest in religion and turn to science for the cure. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably. Catholic Church is losing followers and has very serious problem recruiting new priests for the last century and this is not likely to change in just a few decades. Catholic church is slow and unwilling to change and so struggles to adapt to quickly evolving cultural landscape. When Anglicans can try and fit in modernity with women bishops and gay marriages, when Evangelicals can ride on popular anti-science sentiments and marketing techniques, Catholic church keeps going on with it\u2019s anti-contraception, anti-abortion agenda. It also struggles with internal corruption, as every organisation that huge and old would. I hope the gradual thinning of Catholic church will leave it smaller but better - with less greed and hypocrisy among priests, without a network of child abusers, without connections to oppressive regimes and with individual followers more a bit more dedicated to the core Christian values and less just going to church out of habit.

            "answer_text": "Yes, the Catholic church is continuing to lose members and influence. That trend has been happening for years and it shows no sign of slowing down. The same goes for other christian churches, they are all in decline. According to Pew Research, only 22% of millennials attend church weekly or more. The millenials are currently of childbearing age. Since only 22% of them attend church weekly, that means that only one in five of their kids (Gen Z) are likely to be raised in a church. Of those Gen Z kids raised in a church, many of them will leave it as soon as they can. This means that by the time Gen Z is of childbearing age, vanishingly few of their kids will be raised in a church. By that time christianity may very well be dead for all intents and purposes ",
