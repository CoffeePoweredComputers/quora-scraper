            "answer_text": "Yes, you can finish undergrad and get your bachelor's degree in less than four calendar years. Here's how. (1) Take AP or IB classes in high school, score well on the tests, and you can get college credits. (2) If you can, do \"dual enrollment\" where you take some college classes while in high school. Public Community Colleges are good options for this. Some four year colleges will also permit dual enrollment. (3) If you have unusual life experience, or prior military experience, sit for some of the 33 available CLEP tests. You may get some course credits that way. (4) Plan to stay in your college town and take Summer courses. This is especially worthwhile if you've had to sign a 12-month lease on your living space. (University-affiliated housing may only require a semester or school-year lease agreement.) By actually using the place year round, you're getting full advantage from your rent. (5) If you do a semester abroad, be absolutely certain that all of your credits will count. Some schools do not give full credit for courses taught through other colleges' semester abroad programs. If you already have a lot of transfer credits or credits from testing (AP, IB, or CLEP) your semester abroad credits may not count. Be sure you know how many externally awarded credits you can count towards your diploma. Also be sure you know whether externally awarded credits can count towards your major. Some schools will only allow them to count for area distribution requirements or electives. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Use College Level Examination Program (CLEP) exams to test out of your first 2 years of coursework. Each exam costs $85 and you can sometimes take up to 20 exams that apply to electives in your degree. That cuts your Bachelor\u2019s degree from 4 years into 2 years. You need 120 credits to graduate. You\u2019ve earned 60 credits with CLEP. Your remaining 60 credits (generally the requirements for your major) don\u2019t have to be full time either. Some schools offer summer classes and allow you to bump your schedule. Instead of doing 15 credit hours a semester, and studying for 2 semesters a year, take 18 credits (one extra course) in the fall and winter, and then take 5 courses in the summer. Your degree looks like this: Semester 1 (Sep - Dec): CLEP Exams (60 credits so far)Semester 2 (Jan - Apr): 18 credits (78 credits so far)Summer: 15 credits (93 credits so far)Semester 3: 18 (111 credits so far)Semester 4: 9 credits (120 credits)Because of your summer classes, you end up only needing 3 courses in your final semester. Additional sources of credit include: Prior Learning and RecognitionChallenge Exams (write the exam - if you pass, you get the credit. Some schools use your score on the exam as your letter grade)American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language exams - you can get up to 12 upper-level (3rd year/4th year credits) in a foreign language by passing an exam in a language you\u2019ve self-studiedGood luck.

            "answer_text": "Most U.K. degrees are 3 years. However\u2026. in the U.K., the school A level is equivalent to a US first year of a degree. The A level is the entrance qualification for U.K. universities.You can do a 4 year Masters degree bypassing the Batchelor's degree.You can also do a 4 year sandwich Batchelor's degree, where after the second year you take a year out to study or work overseas. Or work in the U.K. you then complete your 3rd year of study in year 4.Another option is to do the Batchelor\u2019s degree in 2 years, but graduate with the base degree without honours. Courses like a HND are degree equivalent. You can then do diplomas or other qualifications to give you honours degree equivalence. This is a good option if you have difficulty in financing your studies, as you can take time between study to work and earn money.",

Example I took 3 course 4 credits a peace the first block (half a semester) and then 2 4 credit course and 1 3 credit course. That semester I cleared 23 credits.

I graduated in less than three years with a double major and it's not an unreasonable task. But always talk to your college counselor and if you don't have one get one! It saves lots of h headaches later on. Good luck ",

If A-B-C-D must be taken in that order in subsequent semesters, then you need to make sure that you can get each one in the semester you want. ",
