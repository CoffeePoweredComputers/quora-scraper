            "answer_text": "You can wait, but why would you? You should apply during your senior year and then ask to defer your enrollment for a year. Depending on where you're applying, it could be difficult to justify why you waited. If you don't get in where you want to go, apply again. If you're already planning to take a gap year, why not just apply twice if necessary? Also, your school will almost certainly have resources in place to help all the seniors get what they need to get done for their applications. If you wait a year, you will be on your own. It also could be more difficult to get your transcripts sent out. Also, you won't be in the same mindset after a year as you will be in senior year. You will be eager to finish high school and will likely lose momentum after a year\u2026 This isn't a guarantee, of course, but following the herd on this one might be beneficial. Deferring enrollment will definitely be easier, though. I recently was accepted in the Brown University Class of 2023 and decided to defer my enrollment so I could go study Mandarin under NSLI-Y for a year (hence my being in the class of 2024). Everyone at Brown was super helpful in this process, and now I can make the most of my time away from school without worrying about where I will be going to school. Best of luck in your endeavors. By all means, do whatever is best for you. I would just recommend that you apply and then defer rather than wait a year then apply. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes but the best thing to do is to apply directly out of high school get accepted and ten not attend for a year , once you successfully apply and are accepted a school you have x amount of time to actually attend . While I appreciate the idea of a break in school. First best thing to do is get into the school you want and the best chance to do this without actually really doing something of value or military service . Peace Corp a top of the line internship is to apply now get accepted then attend later but I would recommend apply get accepted and then take minimal amount of part time classes particularly your math requirements because math skills fade fast not basic math algebra 2 and below but two and calculus take a certain amount of time into upkeep in order not to forget them and most freshman math labs start between 5 and 6 in the morning followed by the regular lecture and even basic college math does not have practice problems or work time built into the lecture and the grad student running the lab won\u2019t help you if you are not a hot teen girl. So if you are planning college get I to the one you want even if you are not going to immediately attend . While doing your gap year knock out your freshman math requirements ",

            "answer_text": "As others have said, a gap year is totally normal. You can apply and commit to a college before your gap year (so applying during senior year of high school), or you can actually do your applications during your gap year. If you don\u2019t like how it went the first time around, you might even be doing your second round of apps during the gap year. However, you should be careful that you\u2019re still doing something with your time during the year off. There are a lot of programs designed for this (gap years are really popular outside the US), or you could be working (at a normal Joe job, or even as a freelancer\u2014pushing your limits while you can). But, colleges will likely care that you\u2019re using your time productively. If you\u2019re already enrolled somewhere for the next year, proving this may be a provision for them to allow you to take the gap year. If you\u2019re just now applying, they aren\u2019t going to want to accept someone who\u2019s just \u201ctaking time off\u201d without some explanation. ",

It is a good way to make some money and also figure out exactly what you want to study and career path you want to pursue. You have to make sure the college has a provision for late admission. If you take a year to start the whole application process you might not get the school you want and you might not actually follow through and go to college. The longer you take to start the easier it is not to go. ",
