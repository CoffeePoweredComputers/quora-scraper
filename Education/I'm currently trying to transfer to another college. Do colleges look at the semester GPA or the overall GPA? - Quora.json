            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, colleges focus on the cumulative G.P.A. when evaluating transfer students for admission. (This is in contrast to the way they evaluate incoming freshmen, when grades in certain courses matter more than others.) Anyone who reads transcripts for a living knows that a student may face unusual challenges during a particular semester or academic year that can temporarily depress their GPAs without permanently impairing their ability to succeed as strong students. Getting admitted to a particular college doesn\u2019t guarantee admission to all of its programs. If, for example, most of your grades are good but your Biology and/or Chemistry grades are very low, you might not be eligible for a competitive program like Nursing. Some programs will re-evaluate your application TO THAT PROGRAM if you retake the courses while other programs might use only the first grade earned in each of those courses. In the second instance, you would never be eligible for that school\u2019s program, but you might decide to transfer to a different school that has a more flexible policy. If you\u2019re worried about any of the grades in your first school getting in the way of your ability to transfer to another school, ask the advisors at your intended school what their policies are in relation to grades in your intended major (and minor, if you intend to complete one).

            "answer_text": "A2A, Thank You! When I was transferring to a 4-year university after completing my associates degree at a community college, I applied to 3 different colleges. One college wanted all my transcripts for every class taken at the college level (which goes back to the early 1990s) but only really looked at the last 60 hours (if the applicant had that many) to determine admission. Another wanted all transcripts and I don\u2019t know what they based their decision on. The third wanted all transcripts and made a decision based on overall GPA of classes that would transfer into my degree program. I was admitted into all three colleges, though I had to ask for reconsideration with the third one. It was the most difficult of the three to get admitted into and also had the highest state and national ranking for my degree program. I also chose to attend that third university and will be graduating in December. As far as I am aware, every college will look at overall GPA but there are slight variations on what classes and/or credit hours they use to determine that overall GPA. Also, most 4-year universities have a both a minimum and a maximum credit hours rule to transfer. I\u2019m to the point in my degree program that I can\u2019t transfer without having to add additional hours. ",
