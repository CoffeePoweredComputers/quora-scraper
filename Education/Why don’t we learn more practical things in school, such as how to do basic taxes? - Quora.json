            "answer_text": "Greetings, In the United States, it is unlikely for a public school district to instruct students in tax preparation. U.S. Tax Code is in a perpetual state of change, and even seasoned Certified Public Accountants struggle to keep up with the I.R.S. requirements. Launching a new public school curriculum is an expensive proposition that requires paying a committee of educators to vet and adopt instructional materials, and to procure scarce resources to fund the venture, to attract and retain highly-qualified faculty, and then find room in a schedule dominated by S.T.E.M. coursework to offer the new class. Most compellingly, since there is no standardized test to measure student achievement in elective classes, there is no incentive to offer classes in \u201cFinancial Literacy.\u201d Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",

            "answer_text": "Schools are preparing you for succeeding in the world for the rest of your lives. They teach you the tools for teaching yourself when you leave school. There are plenty of books and websites that will teach you how to do your taxes, besides, if you were taught as a high school junior, by the time you were in full-time employment, the system would have changed enough so it would be irrelevant - if you could even remember what you were taught. A very large percentage of people are on PAYE and their employers handle it and individuals only have to fill in their 1040. (I have to fill in 8 forms but it would have been a waste of time to learn how to do it in high school). What are you going to kick off the curriculum to add taxes? This is a good topic for a an economics club, though. ",
