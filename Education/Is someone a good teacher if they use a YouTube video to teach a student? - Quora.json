            "answer_text": "If the you tube video is appropriate to the topic and will engage the students why not use it? There are many fantastic videos and documentaries that can and are used by teachers the world over as part of their teaching programme. Except in exceptional circumstances (such as the lock down due to covid) I would worry if all the teacher was doing was showing you tube videos but as an adjunct to their teacher I see no issue \u2026 and regularly did do so when teaching permanently. Now as a casual teacher I am often asked to show a you tube video to the class/s I am \u2018teaching\u2019. If teaching my subject area I am always given the lee way to use or not use the video but if outside my teaching area I always show what is set by the teacher. ",
