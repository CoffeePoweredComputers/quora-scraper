            "answer_text": "As a parent I understand your worries; the ever increasing cost of education requires us to invest towards our kid\u2019s education from the very beginning, or else they will either have to sacrifice their dreams or strive to conquer them under the burden of heavy student loans. I have covered my daughter\u2019s education under Aegon Life\u2019s Rising Star Insurance Plan and I feel very confident that it will serve its purpose well, when time comes. If you wish to secure your child\u2019s education, all you need to do is follow these four simple steps\u2014 Step 1: Calculate the sum assured according to the inflating rates of education and determine your premium paying capacity; choose your premium value in alignment with the same. Step 2: Fill the application form. Feel free to take help from the company\u2019s Life Advisor. Their guidance will help you a great deal in getting a clear understanding about the whole process. Step 3: A cheque will have to be drawn in the favour of Aegon Life Insurance Co. Ltd. in order to pay for the policy. Step 4: Once you have applied for the policy, wait for a verification call from the Aegon Life call centre. That\u2019s all what I did to get my policy.
