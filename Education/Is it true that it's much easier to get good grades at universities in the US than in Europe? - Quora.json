            "answer_text": "Umm not really. In UK a 2.1 (60%) or above is an excellent grade. First class (70%) is the best you can ever do. No one will be awarded 100% mark. In America (or even A levels), marks are given with the notion that you can achieve near to full marks. So 60% in Cambridge is likely to be 80 percent or so at Harvard - it doesn't mean Harvard is \"easier\", it just means that good grades have different \"names\" in different countries. This is the reason there are degree conversions and people don't simply apply the percentage rule blindly because grades/marks are classed differently in different countries and performing a conversion is the only way to get around the problem because percentages across countries are not comparable.
