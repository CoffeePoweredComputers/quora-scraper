            "answer_text": "May I share a story? This may help. There is a student in third grade known as Milo, who just started school after a fairly eventless summer. He starts third grade in already not great spirits, but quickly grows to like third grade. The teacher he has loves him. One day, the whole class is penalized and misses recess, all except Milo and four other girls. One of the girls not penalized also is favored by the teacher. This girls starts to annoy Milo, when she seems to have a lot in common with him. Meanwhile, Milo finds out his Iranian friend Rahim is moving. In fact, Milo had seen Rahim at his neighbors graduation party. This neighbor is also Iranian, and there is another pretty Iranian girl. Now Milo had officially forgotten about this girl. Milo starts fearing, and possibly hating having so much in common with this girl, and hates it that she has so many privileges that he never gets anymore. Frankly, this girl is very into school, and is good at everything with school. Milo hates feeling outdone, and wishes he could just be accepted as he was, and hates the competition. One day, Milo gets a valentine from this girl, and he discreetly throws it in the garbage. This girl sees it in the recycle bin, and tells a teacher about this. The teacher lets Milo have it. After months of conflict, Milo and his mom are called into the guidance counselor. Now the guidance counselor is nice to Milo, and understands him. Margaret explains to the counselor that she thinks Milo is just jealous. This counselor Mrs. Haubenfeld explains to Mom that Milo maybe experiencing some other frustrations. The mom tells about some other difficulties Milo is experiencing such as changes at the babysitter. Margaret also explains his friend Rahim moving, and being fed fear mongering teachings in Sunday School. At the end of the school year, at his moms request, Milo gives this girl a peace offering, after having a rough year, and hopes of getting along the next year. Milo finds out this girls name is Hope. Now Milo never felt chemistry with this girl, but they had been cordial for the next few years they were in school. Case and point, you should ask yourself why are you jealous. It could be you are not angry with your classmate, but over the system that blatantly favors certain students over others? Or is it something else? ",

            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t say it is bad. But I will say it\u2019s not good for you! You should not be in competition with other students. You don\u2019t explain why you think your teacher has a favorite student so I can only guess you think that child gets more attention than you do. And it probably is good attention or you wouldn\u2019t feel that way. You might try to think about why that child gets more attention, that is, what kind of attention does the child get? And then pay attention to what that child does that is good in the teacher\u2019s opinion and think about whether you also do those things. Remember that a teacher is not \u201cpicking on you\u201d if he/she is correcting things you do that are wrong. That is one of their jobs as teachers to teach children what is right/good to do and what is wrong/bad to do. It also is true that each of us like some people better than others, for many reasons. That will continue to happen as you get older. Each of us usually likes people who think like we do, like the same things to do, listen to us and like us back. And teachers are just like other people. I suggest you focus on what she is teaching you and not whether she likes you or not. ",
