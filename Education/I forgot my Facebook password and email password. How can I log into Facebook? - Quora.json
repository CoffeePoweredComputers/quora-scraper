Your username is your personalized Facebook URL: If you don't know your username, ask a friend to go to your profile and send you the username in the URL.Try entering variations of your name, just in case you signed up using a nickname.If you're asked to enter a friend's name, try a variety of friends if the first friend you try doesn't locate an account. Remember to enter your friend's full name, not just their first name.If indeed you have no access to you email address either, perhaps because you signed up with Facebook using a 10 Minute Mail email address, or something similar, you have a bigger problem, but it's not impossible, if you have set some of your friends to be 'Trusted Contacts\".
