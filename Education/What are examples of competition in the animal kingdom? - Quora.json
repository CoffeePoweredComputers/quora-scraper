            "answer_text": " Roberto Rohan has done well in giving the example of lions and hyenas in Africa, particularly since the two species, because of their mutual hate, are engaged in a never-ending war over food, territory and survival. But worldwide, there are other examples as well, all for the same goals (survival, raising the young, territorial behavior, food): \u2013 Wolves and bears (Eurasia and North America).  Being bigger and much better built, bears typically dominate wolf packs in disputes over carcasses, though a greater number of wolves may be capable of prevailing. In addition, both species kill each other\u2019s young. Fights have typically increased in Yellowstone National Park since 1996, when wolves made a glorious comeback to the area. \u2013 Tigers and crocodiles (southern Asia).  Tigers are among the few big cats to never avoid water; in the process, they are forced to interact with crocodiles, the largest and most notorious of all living reptiles. And that\u2019s why the two predators don\u2019t like each other \u2013 whenever there\u2019s an interaction (either over a kill or any other situation), it\u2019s an all-out war. Consequently, some tigers have been seen to kill crocodiles, and some crocs do kill the striped cats as well. \u2013 Cheetahs, leopards and lions (Africa).  Back in Africa, lions do not solely compete over resources with hyenas, but also with other neighboring predators, like cheetahs and leopards. However, the outcome is much worse for the two spotted cats, because lions are truly jerks (even dicks!) towards their fellow cousins.  Sure enough, all three felines hunt the same prey (wildebeest, zebras, gazelles, antelope\u2026); therefore, they are negatively impacted by each other\u2019s presence \u2013 if given the chance, lions do often steal kills made by leopards and cheetahs; in the process, they use their superior strength and size to intimidate their smaller cousins and force them off their kills, or even kill the spotted cats themselves!  In fact, leopards also displace cheetahs over carcasses, since the leopard does possess a superior strength and a muscular body that heavily contradict the cheetah\u2019s slender body, weak jaws and claws, and lack of brute strength \u2013 these facts render cheetahs virtually incapable of fending off bigger and much better built rivals. \u2013 Bobcats and coyotes (North America).  We are already familiar with the fact that cats and dogs are (sometimes) eternal enemies, and their wild cousins are no different. Sure enough, America\u2019s bobcats do compete for food and territory with numerous other predators, including coyotes, a fact that does result in competitive exclusion, especially in areas where coyote numbers reach an upward trend.  Though some individual bobcats, despite their smaller size, are reported to be brave enough to fend off the canids. \u2013 Snakes and crocodilians (anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere).  It\u2019s a well-known fact: animals do not take kindly to outsiders and rivals, whomever they are, especially when it comes to spanning control over vast stretches of land filled with available food, resulting in intense competition. Such is the case with crocodilians (alligators and crocodiles) and snakes (such as pythons).  As such, the reptiles do engage in a deadly battle for dominance. Usually, the fight\u2019s outcome heavily depends upon the size and strength of our contestants \u2013 sometimes, the odds can be in favor of the python, equipped with its powerful, muscular coils, but only if it was long and big enough; otherwise, luck favors the crocodilian, which will then help itself with a free meal (see below).

            "answer_text": "HELLO! To answer this question, it would be more precise to define what competition means: \u201ca relationship between organisms in which one is harmed when both are trying to use the same resource related to growth, reproduction, or survivability.\u201d Which can happen \u201cbetween organisms of the same species (Intraspecific competition), or between members of different species (Interspecific competition).\u201d Also direct and indirect competition take place: \u201cDirect competition is any time two or more animals fight or have a symbolized confrontation, [\u2026] However, indirect competition is when the two animals do not interact, but the presence of both animals in the same territory causes the competition.\u201d CompetitionCompetition (biology) | Encyclopedia.com  Predator vs PreyInterspecific direct competition | cause: survivability Polar bears vs Walruses   Leopard seals vs Penguins    sorry for the blood, so here you go :)penguin judge, seal feel judged (*not a leopard seal*)  Lioness vs Zebra  Crocodile vs. ________   \u201cI can flyyyyyyyyy!!!\u201d (this croc looks happy)  Sperm whale vs Squid    The Hunger Games: competition for food resourcesInterspecific direct competition | cause: survivability Cheetah vs Hyena    Vulture vs. ________    The Hunger GamesIntraspecific direct competition | cause: survivability Wild dog vs. Wild dog  Vulture vs. Vulture (you get the idea)  Bear vs. Bear (this could also be territorial???)   Interspecific indirect competition | cause: survivability Coral reef vs Fish  \u201cIf those fish feed on the same resources used by the corals, then the fish are in competition for the limited resources. Coral, being more or less anchored to the ocean floor, have little chance of directly attacking the fish. Instead, this would be referred to as an asymmetrical indirect competition. The fish eat as much of the food as they want, and the coral are limited to scraps.\u201d  Let us see who is the real macho who surprises the ladyIntraspecific direct competition | cause: reproductivity (male vs. male) Buck vs. buck  White tailed deer vs. white tailed deer vs. white tailed deer  Flamingo vs. Flamingo  Polar bear vs. Polar bear  Bighorn vs. Bighorn  Ostrich vs. Ostrich  Giraffe vs. Giraffe  Bamo a bajarte el ego (Let\u2019s lower your ego)  Zebra vs. Zebra   Hare vs. Hare   Sage grouse vs. Sage grouse    Kangaroo vs. Kangaroo   Bison vs. Bison    Interspecific indirect competition | cause: reproductivity/survivability Cuckoos   Cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other birds so that the parents of the nest will end up feeding the baby cuckoos, since they are larger.  Race to the shoreInterspecific direct competition | cause: survivability Turtles   When turtles hatch, they run towards the sea, and the birds and crocodiles come out to meet them to eat them.
