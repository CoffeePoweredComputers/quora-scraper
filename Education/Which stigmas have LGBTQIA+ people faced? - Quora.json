            "answer_text": "Bisexual here. Promiscuous A little but not much, I get flirted with a bit by both genders but I don't go putting my dick into anyone that looks my way. Perspective The men think I'm going to touch them up and the women think I'm disgusting. 'Did you fuck him or did he fuck you?\u2019 ok darling let's try this, how open have your legs been the past few months? What do you mean it's different? Disease I must be a walking STD station apparently. Spare in the bedroom No I do not want sex with you and your boyfriend. One night of young and carefree 'memories\u2019 for you and your partner isn't something I want to get roped into. The idea of a cocaine filled drug shag with a stranger and her clearly unattractive heterosexual boyfriend doesn't turn me to mush funny enough. Greedy bastard Straights, gays, drags, three legged transgender monkey with one eye etc. At least one from each group has called me a greedy bastard. Closet It's always the closest gays who stop and say 'no you're not bi, you're definitely gay\u2019. Listen fuckhead, if I was gay or straight I'd say so. I wouldn't lie to myself and others for years. Basically saying something I've known for half of my life is a blatant lie closes myself off to you. Because you are an idiot. First bi then gay First awake then knocked to sleep. Piss off. I don't understand I personally don't take this as a stigma but I will point out that it's mainly gays I meet who cannot grasp the concept of sex with either gender. Elephant in the room Just because I'm here don't act different around me. I'm not going to point my finger and screech because I heard a gay joke. I make more fucking gay jokes than anyone I've ever met and i use more derogatory words in those jokes than my straight friends would be comfortable saying. I've given them a free pass, but they're still apprehensive. Of course I'm not going to go out throwing words around gay bars directed at people, I'm not that stupid. Internalized homophobia I don't watch Ru Paul's Drag Race, attend Gay Pride or wear rainbow spandex whilst listening to Lady Gaga? It must be internalized homophobia. I must hate myself because I feel 'bad' about being me. First off, I'm not. I am unforgivable about being me, there is nothing I need to ask permission or grovel for. Second how fucking dare you run my own thoughts and opinions against some kind of fucking checklist. Lastly if you have an issue with yourself that's your fucking issue. Don't piss on my parade with your fictional fucking gender. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on experience, here\u2019s what Im getting when others started to noticed that I am. These are all truly the perceptions after I confronted them with \u2018what the heck is wrong with u people\u2019: Stupid or cant be smart enough to know what im doing or I cant be fit to be working in engineering because im gay, or it is so damn difficult sometimes to be taken seriously. Then where I fit? Hair Salon? [rolling eye sequence]Sinner - seriously a colleague quoted biblical text one time, in 2017.Might have AIDS or STDs.Therefore - slut, like there\u2019s no way I would do other things than sex in my spare timesI would, at some point in my life, change my sex to become 100% woman, thats why i chose to live in BangkokNot normal. Or mentally ill.One time a girl actually surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re gay?! But you\u2019re not that handsome.\u201dHowever, I do also hear good stigmas Focused & hard worker - well of course, I mean other guys my age who are straight got more on their plates than myself with the family they are buildingTake good care of self very well. Of course.Discipline- well I dont really get this one because even myself seeing gay guys mostly far away from this. Is it because im dominant (lol)",
