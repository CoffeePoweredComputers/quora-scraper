            "answer_text": "Yes, you can register yourself through offline mode. I myself had registered for B.com(A&F) through offline mode only because this course was not available for online registration.(I registered myself in Dec 2016. I don't think things would have chaged much in 4\u20135 months) Contact the IGNOU branch near you, they will provide you with the registration forms and prospectus. Fill the form, attach the demand draft of the required amount and submit it at the branch office near you. ",
