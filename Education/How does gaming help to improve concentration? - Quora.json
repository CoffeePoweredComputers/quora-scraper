            "answer_text": "For this you need two things :1) A game which you absolutely love! , could be related to your favorite genre like cars , racing , strategy or role-playing simulation etc 2) Some free time to play it , even 30 mins a day can work. To-do: So pick your game and start playing , if you're gonna play on phone try CSR racing or clash of clans.  Here's how it works :Every game has the same logic , you start at the beginner level , improvise , upgrade your weapons , move on to higher levels & eventually complete the game , So basically the act of playing consistently with a completely occupied mind and senses can lead to developing concentration gradually. Alternatives: Watch a movie you love!Read a book!the trick is to stay occupied and do one thing at a time & forgetting every other thing.all the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it certainly does but i have heard a lot of people say that it acts as a stress buster too. But, i personally feel that playing some tiering games like the sports games do not help as they are games where you are just doing the same thing again and again with no brain being used. Whereas if you play some agent based/ shooting games where you tend to be alert everytime about the surroundings too does help in increasing concentration levels. These games tend to make you alert while doing some task and at the same time you are playing with total interest which in-turn tends to improve your concentration. It all about the art of doing things that you love to do the most as that is when you put in your total effort which increases your concentration level. So, it\u2019s all about doing things properly and with determination is nothing but concentration. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Very interesting question and I will definitely answer this question. Right from the time you start a game be it vedieo game,mobile,play station or even indoor and outdoor games ,the person playing will never stop untill it is finished and will always try and win the game and finish it. He will put all his efforts, techniques, and follow all winning strategy,focus and he will fully concentrate only on the game till it is over. If lost it does not matter but he will never hesitate to try again again until he wins it over. This he is able to do because of his interest in playing the game and by taking it as a callenge he never quits until he wins it and does it with full concentration, dedication and focus with full confidence on his efforts and strategy and will never ever stop till he wins the game. So coming to my point students please treat your studies also the way you play the game. Henceforth right from you start your studies don't stop till you have finished what it is to be done on that particular subject on that day with full concentration and confidence. Do this daily through out your schooling and college and i am sure you will execel in your studies also. ",

            "answer_text": "Gaming and Concentration are directly proportional.You see when you play any game, you always try to win and move forward. You play until you cross that level.When you play games, you tend to keep your eyes open and try to observe the surroundings(in case of racing games and action games). This observation comes handy to you only if you focus completely and this is concentration. you can then use this in your daily life too but then again you need to focus. ",

            "answer_text": "Chess is the best game I know to work on concentration, but you have to play games long enough. Not sure 5 minute blitz games help I also find some board games take a lot of mental effort and efficient and clear calculation. For example, I play a ton of Race for the Galaxy on the PC, and in spite of knowing the cards, some games play out quite unexpectedly requiring rapid changes to strategy, and fast assessment of options. Even Angry Birds requires some concentration :) ",
