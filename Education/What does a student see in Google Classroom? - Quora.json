            "answer_text": "The student sees the assignments and questions the teacher puts forth to them, including deadlines, if set by the teacher. If the teacher allows, they also see the comments and conversations with other students in the class. After they turn in an assignment to the teacher, and it gets returned to them, they see the teacher\u2019s comments and the grade. If an assignment or a question includes a shared item then they see whatever they\u2019ve been given rights to on that document, video, etc. ",
