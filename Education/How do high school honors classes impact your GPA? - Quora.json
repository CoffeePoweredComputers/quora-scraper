            "answer_text": "While I'm not sure if the system is standardized, this is usually how honors classes work in high school: Your high school likely recognizes that the work and rigor of an honors class is going to be greater than that of a regular class. Because of this, often times students who take an honors class receive a 0.5 GPA point boost in that class. Be attentive, this does not add 0.5 to your overall GPA, just in your honors class. For instance, an A- in a regular class is around a 3.6 GPA for that class. However with the 0.5 honors bump, that grade now becomes around a 4.1, or above a standard A. Overall, honors classes can be beneficial to your GPA, however become more beneficial when you take more than one or two, and you prove your excellence in those subjects (if you intend to get a GPA comfortably above a 4.0). If you're taking one honors class out of your five classes for example, and you get an A in every single class, your cumulative GPA would be a 4.1. This is calculated by summing your GPA for every class (4+4+4+4+4.5) and then dividing by the number of classes (5). ",

            "answer_text": "GPA in the U.S. is based on a 4 point system. The letter grades are A, B, C,D, and F. with an A you get 4 points, with a B - 3, C-2, D-1, F-0..... The higher the grades the higher the points and the better off you are. IF you get all A's then you have a 4.0 gpa. NOW with honors and AP or IB classes, these are more rigorous and academically challenging, Therefore they hold more weight on your gpa. Essentially it gives you an extra point for the class. With honors or AP/IB classes, an A is worth 5 points, a B is 4, C is 3, D is 2, and F is still 0. This means if you have all AP and honors classes and you get straight A's, your gpa will be a 5.0. And since the system is still a 4 point scale. your gpa will be a 5.0 out of 4.0. This is what we call a weighted gpa. when you include the extra points for each honors/AP class.  If you get straight A's and all your classes are AP, then your UNWEIGHTED Gpa is still 4.0. But weighted it is 5.0 So how does it impact your gpa? taking an Honors, AP, or IB class raises your GPA so long as you pass the class. ",

Take as many weighted accelerated/honors/AP/IB classes you can! It also could raise your class rank. Always talk to your counselors about classes and their weights. For instance, 6 of my 7 classes are on a weighted scale, so I have a 4.86 GPA (all As). In my freshman year. I had a 4.71 GPA (5 out of 7 weighted classes). My cumulative is 4.78. I\u2019m aiming for a 5.0 next year. You want to make your GPA really good if you want to go to highly selective institutions. Don\u2019t be too stressed, though. Grades are not everything, although it sounds weird coming from me. I\u2019m working on the same things as you! High school gang :) ",

            "answer_text": "In the United States, a 4.0 GPA system is used so an A is a 4.0. If you take honors or AP classes, they can count as much as a 5.0. So if you have two straight A students from a high school applying to college - one who took honors courses, the other regular course - the honors student will have a 5.0 versus a 4.0. If you mix that in with participation in extracurriculars and other activities beyond the classroom, you have a very competitive applicant. Another thing to consider is that performing \u201cpoorly\u201d on an honors course can do more to hurt your GPA since it is weighted. My understanding is that usually students in danger of getting bad grades in an honors course are often moved out of the course after a marking period. ",

So maybe you\u2019re the valedictorian at your high school under their system, but another kid, who is number 4, actually has a higher GPA under the system being used for whatever school he/she is going to. This is one of the reasons why kid\u2019s obsession with GPA is kind of a joke. Work hard, get good grades, and participate in activities. Don\u2019t worry about GPA. You\u2019ll be fine. ",
