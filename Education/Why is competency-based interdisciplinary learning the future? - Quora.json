            "answer_text": "A recent circular of CBSE announces the theme for the capacity building programs for the year 2020 as Competency-Based Education, and augmenting the thrust towards this shift, the board is initiating corresponding changes in the examination and assessment practices for the year 2020-21 onward. The origin of the concept of CBE evolved out of the several years of research in the mind-brain sciences, learning theory, and research on youth development. Four key principles evolved emphasizing a learner-centered approach rather than a teacher-centered approach to education. The principles stated that: learning is personalized;it is competency-based;takes place anytime, anywhere; andstudents have agency and ownership over their learning.Teachers are merely facilitators to enable transfer of knowledge and skills, and guiding dispositions by creating a positive mindset and encouraging habits of learning. These key principles, when guided by a coherent and rigorous set of educational goals, lead to a deeper learning process with the necessary outcomes to prepare every student for college, career, and civic life. When the education boards pitched for the concept of innovative schools, it was not merely about implementing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), AI (Artificial Intelligence), Robotics or other new-age liberal curricula, but rather the emphasis was on every school sharing the vision and using different techniques to translate the student-centered principles into practice by reaching a high-quality implementation across the four key principles; achieve the goal of college, career and civic success for all students; and focus on building communities of educators with the skills to deliver CBE. The innovative schools, thus, must adopt progressive, creative and innovative educational ideas, formulate high standards for students, staff, and community involvement. They must adopt proven practices to improve student success and close the achievement and opportunity gaps by using multiple approaches to address differential learning styles. Innovative schools provide a high level of experiential learning and they follow the key domains of global competence. Then only, maybe not now but certainly in future we will observe Indian Education System as the most successful education system over all. I hope your query is resolved by now.
