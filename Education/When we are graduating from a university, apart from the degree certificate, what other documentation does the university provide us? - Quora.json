            "answer_text": "In addition to the degree certificate, you will usually get a transcript. This will, as a minimum, list the courses or modules that you studied for your degree and the grades scored in each. Depending on the country, it will also give an overall result, such as a cumulative GPA. If you\u2019re studying in a country that has signed up to the Bologna Process (so all European countries and some others), then you will receive a Diploma Supplement. This includes the information that a transcript provides, but also provides more context about the degree that you have been awarded, such as the language of study, where the degree sits in the country\u2019s national qualifications framework and what further study it would typically give access to.
