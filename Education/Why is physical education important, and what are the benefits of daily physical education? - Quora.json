            "answer_text": "It is important because it makes the geeks realise their place and makes those who don't excel at academia feel better watching the public humiliation of others. It is important because it reminds people who have coordination or other disorders that they are the odd ones out and to be laughed at. It makes the social pecking order necessarily clear, by making team captains pick people for their team. It gives those good at spelling the necessary humbling, despite the fact nobody makes the dyslexic kid read to the class daily or the bad at maths kid do public algebra daily. The ultimate expression of the above is to invite all the parents to see the relative abilities, as in any other subject you might make a geek feel good and nobody in their right mind wants that. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you may mean physical activity. It can certainly help keep your weight down which keeps new clothing costs down. It also strengthens, then keeps mussels stronger. I think most of these are also significant health benefits: more activity almost always help you get better sleep. And doing active things in a group promotes friendships. That is why I still exercise five or more times a week and I am close to 80. ",
