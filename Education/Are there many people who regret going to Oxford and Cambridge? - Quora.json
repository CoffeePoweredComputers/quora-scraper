            "answer_text": "Yes, actually there are. Lots. That is, at least in my course, Mathematics, Cambridge. There are several reasons for this. The level of the course is insanely more difficult than almost any other Maths course in the UK (with a couple of exceptions such as, obviously, Oxford). And this reflects on the grades: an average 2.2 from Cambridge Maths Tripos would be roughly equivalent to an average First in most Universities in terms of skills and effort. This looks bad in CVs, I'm told. Why going to Cambridge and getting a 2.2 when you could be in the top 20 of your year at another Universitiy? Furthermore, the focus of the course is almost entirely academic: even the most \u201creal-life sounding\" courses have a completely theoretical flavor and massively industry-unfriendly. Economics, programming : we do not really have those. Even in terms of networking, corresponding courses in universities such as Imperial or LSE have by far more opportunities for you to get involved with potential employers, non-academic projects and so on. Our course focused mostly on academic networking rather than industrial. So why even bother going to Cambridge? Yeah sure, you have the prestige and all, but I am not convinced that this is enough to counter the significantly lower grade. The real reason is the following: some of us actually like maths. We think they are fun and we think that Cambridge Maths are the most fun ones in the country. We are weird. I know. But we do. We love them. In conclusion: If you do not absolutely adore Maths, stay away from Cambridge's CMS. You do not necessarily need to want to stay in academia - although it\u2019s a huge plus. But you do need to care about the subject deeply. Otherwise you probably have more suitable options. Again, this is just for Mathematics. I don't really remember what was going on with other courses. Edit: paragraph about networking rephrased. See comments. Edit 2: First Paragraph rephrased. ",
