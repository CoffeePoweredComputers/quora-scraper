            "answer_text": "Yes. Nowadays there are very few merit scholarships, practically none: almost all financial aid is need driven. If you already have a scholarship, it can often be transfered. If you have financial aid, more than likely it cannot be transfered but if you were eligible before there is a very good chance we will still be eligible. Nothing like a few phone calls to discuss financial aid possibilities though. Good luck! ",

You and all of your parents will need to fill out the daunting FAFSA (if US) forms and the CSS Profile forms (everyone). NOTE: 85% of those forms or more is for your Parents. Speak with them. Good luck. ",
