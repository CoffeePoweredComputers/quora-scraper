            "answer_text": "The most important thing you can do is get science/technology/engineering degreed. Understand what you are studying.  You can read about past astronauts, but this will be of limited help to you. Many of the past astronauts were pilots and a substantial number will be in the future. Many of these piltos were military or ex-military. You have to decide about this. Learning to fly is one thing, high performance flying is another. Stay healthy. Apply to the Program. Make the Program. You may need to change citizenship.  Work the system for a flight. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey reshma! I am in 12th standard myself and want to become an astrophysicist. Basically you need to know that ISRO is not taking any manned missions in the near future I.e they are not planning to do so. And even if it does plans the first astronauts would be the pilots and people from air force. So you should probably look out for aur force and surely it is not a good option as there is no surity for you to become astronaut. The better option is you go out to study in the foriegn andtry it there. If it is out of budget then you can try get scholarship and or apply for Master's degree after doing undergraduate from here in India. You can pick up any btech or Bsc degree and then apply for foriegn university for Master's. Then you may apply to the associations that hire and make you Into astronauts. There are many such organizations in USA. ",
