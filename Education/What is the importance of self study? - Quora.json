            "answer_text": "The Importance of Self-Study \u201c The world is a University and everyone in it a teacher Makes sure When you woke up in the morning, you go to school\u201d Self-study is important aspect of effective learning. Self-study is one of the most important things not only to qualify for an examination but it is most important to ACQUIRE PRACTICAL APPROACH OF THEORETICAL INFORMATION. One can understand the concept from his point of view, with his own examples rather than any complex example taught by the lecturer. Self-studying is key to success. You are the teacher and you yourself is the student, concepts get cleared when you work it out yourself. And most importantly in the later part of one's education i.e. at the time of career they gains immense confidence because you know theoretical knowledge having practice approach well then that all you have achieved is by your own. Leaning is a process of creating a concrete KNOWLEDGE BASE. Light of concrete knowledgebase automatically boosts the self-confidence of the person. A person having own developed knowledgebase becomes well respected in the society and also he or she is often consulted for pieces of advice by others. Knowledge base is key for decision making and strategy building. This process contains different stages like collection of data, interpretation, analyses, storing, recollection, reorganizing and last to take summarized knowledge which was hidden in that data. In school college days we all were dependent on others i.e. teachers. Above every stage was done by lecturer. We are learning analyses data. Rather we should study about HOW TO ANALYSE DATA to create concrete knowledge. In self-study approach study becomes like research. And knowledge acquired by research is long lasting. One can study different approaches of selected toping, different factors affecting it in a different way. One can study topic from different angles. HUMAN BRAIN IS A MYSTERIOUS ORGAN. It always struggles to form a pattern to cope with new input. So there is need to study same topic in different angle or point of view. Many people count study by hourly basis. Numbers of hours are not important at all when you can actually study for 2 hours with the efficiency of 4 hours slog and there's no point in studying more. Duration doesn't affect one's learning process as much as THE QUALITY OF TIME IS MAINTAINED. In classroom training long classes actually saturate students and they often feel tired and become less receptive. And in such a situation, you can't even take a break and let your brain become receptive again. When you embark on the quest of knowledge through self-study, you develop scientific and logical reasoning as part of the thought process. Instead of listening to others, the individual can use his or her brain to take independent decision. Self-study is the only tool that assists in the development of critical analysis of the situation. Moreover, if you are a professional, you become independent strategic decision maker. With all the benefits being accrued, learning though self-study module is the best way to move forward. It is the only tool that can help to develop modern ideas of liberation and freedom have emanated from self-developed knowledge base. ",

            "answer_text": "With self education, one must manually feed themselves with information. Let\u2019s stress the vital points of self education. This doesn\u2019t imply that one should learn everything on their own, especially from scratch. If you want to learn how to make money online, then you learn from the best and implement their actions and teachings. See how much more convenient and wise that is as compared to learning how to make money on your own. Although such case is plausible, yet time is of the essence. Self-education is without hesitation the most important kind of education there is. Of course, this comes after 18 years of learning all the fundamentals of life. Learning from professors and mentors is the easy part. Most skills and learning is spoon fed directly unto you. Self education requires an absolute will to learn. Going to school or university is mandatory for many fields and skills. There is no option really. Teaching yourself to learn on your own expresses desire, willing, and passion. It is quite hard to fail at something if love and passion are put forth. On the other hand, studying and carrying out tasks about something that brings forth no pleasure or self-satisfaction is, well, the words speak for themselves. Tips To Increase Self Education Awareness Here\u2019s what increases my self education awareness. Meditation \u2013 Known to cure many physical and mental problems or barriers. Increase self-awareness, empathy, love, understanding, and the likes. Decreases stress, useless worries, anxiety, and fear. Good for those who are clueless about their direction in life. Not recommended for super religious fanatics who aren\u2019t opened minded.Exercise \u2013 Has been proven to increase longevity, happiness, and confidence. Increases memory cogitation as well as enhanced memory thinking. Decreases weight, stress, blood pressure, tension, and the likes. Good for people who want to take care of themselves and value their looks. Bad for people who are powerless over food and laziness.Healthy Diet \u2013 The root cause of everything. You become what you eat. Eat junk and garbage then you will look, feel, and think like garbage. Eat what nature made, not man. Your brain, body, tissues, organs, and mind will transform radically depending on what you feed it. Feed yourself with wholeness and goodness, and you shall become whole and good.Mentality \u2013 Your thoughts manifest your reality, a reality that has yet come to past. Everything you touch, feel, see, smell, taste, and the likes are controlled by your brain. You do the things you do because of the brain. The body is just a vessel. A vessel which moves from the thoughts of the mind. This universe is more mental than physical, to a point. When you realize the beauty and truth that this universe holds, you\u2019ll want to explore and discover the unknown and mysteries that lurk in this universe.Work For Love  Everything that you do, do it for love. This topic comes in at #1 for a reason. It\u2019s difficult or miserable to work for something that brings no joy. Even the most influential and wealthiest of the wealthiest have said so. That includes Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jack Ma, Bill Gates, and the likes. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s picking up feces or defending your country. Love what you do, and it will make everything that much easier. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, keep looking. Don\u2019t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\u2019ll know when you find it. \u2013 Steve Jobs Can you be with your spouse if there is no more love? Would you eat half a pound of walnuts a day? No, because love for those thing doesn\u2019t exist anymore or never did. When conditions like so are met, then the obvious gives evident. To be with your other half for eternity, there must be nothing but unconditional and everlasting love. To eat your favorite food every day means you really enjoy its taste. Do you see how demanding it is to work or execute something without passion or love? Sure, it happens every day, but those people do it for food and shelter. Why is happiness one of the most wished for thing in this world? In fact, it\u2019s a dream in which billions would die for, yet happiness comes from within, not without. If you love what you do, then success will come? Not always. The things I do brings no income, yet I\u2019m satisfied and have had my fill. If you love what you do, it becomes more natural, more enjoyable, and you\u2019ll always put forth 100% effort. Working for someone else\u2019s dreams only makes yours more distance. Working for someone else not only brings little to no purpose but how long can you last? How is it that the most influential are able to stick to their company and do the same things day in and day out for years to come? Passion and purpose. What they do brings love and meaning to their life. There is no force greater than love or purpose. We must do what we can to survive. How long has the human race survived for? Isn\u2019t it time to thrive. Do what you\u2019ve always longed for since birth. Live exactly the way you want. Not all of us gets to live to a ripe and joyful age. The road to glory always begins with the most challenging step. Give Double  Elon Musk works almost 100 hours a week, Bill Gates works Sundays, Mark Zuckerburg programmed facebook for 6 years straight, movie/music stars put in at least 80 hours a week. We Americans complain about 40 hours of work a week, not to mention the paid 2-4 weeks of Holidays and vacations. And that is why most of us never amount to any greatness. Work like hell. I mean you just have to put in 80 to 100 hour weeks every week. This improves the odds of success. If other people are putting in 40 hour workweeks and you\u2019re putting in 100 hour workweeks, then even if you\u2019re doing the same thing, you know that you will achieve in four months what it takes them a year to achieve. \u2013 Elon Musk These people taught themselves how to code, built computers, take advantage of the internet, and to help create a better tomorrow. I respect Elon Musk the most because of all the things he\u2019s accomplished or is going to. This guy learned how to build a space ship with self education! Jack Ma knew nothing about the internet, but he taught himself and thousands of Chinese business about the power and usefulness of the internet. Success rarely comes easy. Self education requires more time and knowledge than learning from professors and teachers. You go to college, all the papers and test are laid out before your eyes. With self-learning, such luxuries doesn\u2019t exist. We must open the computer, read books, study anything and everything that there is to study, and all without a second hand. (For the most part) Starting a small business doesn\u2019t take much time. I\u2019ve started 3 small businesses. Anyone can do that. Building a company is a dawning task in which the likes of many shall fail. Even if you love what you do, can you do that for 80 hours a week for years and years? Maybe giving double is just the minimum. Perhaps 100 hours a week is the sweet spot. People who achieve their dreams are the ones that put in the effort and time. It may take 80 hours a week for 20 years to make your dreams a reality. It may take 100 hours a week for 50 years to make your dreams a reality. Some of us are even willing to die for our dreams. Keep learning, educating yourself, and do whatever it takes to win. You\u2019ve never get anywhere with the 4 hour work week or 40 hours. This mentality is for bums and those who want a quick fix. This route brings nothing but false hopes and creates more wasted time. Free Experience  Learning is good, execution is better, but success is the best. Even if one puts in thousands of hours to learn how to speak a new language or start a business (like me) and has no use for it, then it just means free experience. Never take anything as a failure or a mistake. You\u2019ll always gain something valuable from mistakes. Hundreds of new businesses emerge every day and just as many shut down. You can include me in both categories. I\u2019ve learned how to start 4 businesses, speak 4 languages, traveled to 4 countries, and I\u2019m still learning more and more. When teaching yourself how to do these things on your own, it gets exciting, nerve-wracking, anxious, and the likes. However, nothing beats the experience. I\u2019ve lost money in the 6 digits, rarely speak the other 3 languages as of now, and more unfortunate series of events will continue to be apparent in my life. But you know what? I embrace such things with open arms. We must learn, try, and do everything and anything that we can. Learning is practically free and open in this era. Eons ago, such luxuries were only admissible to the privileged. Life is a video-game, to me. The more experience you earn or learn, the easier it is to defeat the bosses. Those bosses are the primary obstacles in your life. Every day people are teaching themselves how to code, speak new languages, become stronger and smarter, and all the endless possibilities that we humans can do. Self education has paved the way for a new generation of geniuses and millions of motivated individuals. We learn, we fail, and we get back up and start all over. What\u2019s the point of doing anything if you don\u2019t learn from it? Experiences add up. How are you able to converse so well today, use tools, learn to cook, and so forth? Was it not because of the countless experiences that we endured over millions of years? We humans have come from 2 wheels and a square box to 2 (or 3) engines that can propel us to new worlds! Who taught us these things? We did. You can never truly fail until you give up 100% Take all the experiences and knowledge from yourself and your neighbors to create a better tomorrow. Haven\u2019t we been doing this since the birth of mankind? Experiences will only make you smarter and better. Don\u2019t think of it as wasted time and resource. Nothing is a waste if one learns how to apply it to another field or use it to their advantage. Some things will require more experiences (failure) than others. This is what the multitude cannot comprehend. Can you imagine how much experience all these wealthy beings had to accumulate before obtaining such status? This is why it is so crucial never to stop learning or trying. More experiences equal more success. Handle Pain  As with all things, a dark side always exists. How much pain can you take? Depends, on the individual. Self education can be lonely, complicated, confusing, boring at times, and after a while, you start to question yourself and reality. Pain is what can make you and/or break you. As stated early, some can't even handle 40 hours of labor. 80 or even 60 hours of labor would be literally hell for them. I believe that your pain threshold is proportionate to your success. Although science can\u2019t prove such things, however, reality does. How many hours, sacrifices, failure, suffering, labor, loneliness, boredom, and the likes have the wealthy experienced. Many, many times more than the so-called average being. Self education will force you to go beyond your god given talent and will. If you studied all the species on earth, including humans. You will realize that only a very few become the alpha, the leader, the most influential. Life takes the easy route. Humans eat what tastes good. Animals prefer to eat and sleep all day. The Sun always rises in the East and sets in the West. It is easy to do what is easy, hint the word. What brings pain and suffering is considered taboo, and most want nothing to do with it. Doing what you love and learning new things every day will bring joy, passion, meaning, and satisfaction, but do not believe for one minute that the opposite cannot arise. Most of us have a breaking point. Learn what works for you and control your emotions and desires. Pain is temporary, it will fade away yet only to reappear again. Self education comes with both good and bad forces. Do not let your suffering and time be in vain. Finish what you begin. You\u2019re already halfway. So if you\u2019ve given 10 years to your research, then in another 10 years, you\u2019d have succeeded (assuming), or you\u2019ll be crying and regretting on how things would have been different in only you had lingered on. Do what works for you. If 40 hours a week seems sufficient, then do that. If 100 hours a week seems like the sweet spot, then do that. We are not Gods. Do not try to test your pain. You will break. Everyone does! Enjoy life, learn new things every day, educate yourself and others, and just live. Learning is fun, not punishment. The more you know, the more you are worth. And in today\u2019s time, a man\u2019s worth is valued by his knowledge and education.
