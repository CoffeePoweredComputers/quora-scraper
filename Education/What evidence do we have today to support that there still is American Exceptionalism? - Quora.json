            "answer_text": "Ah, American exceptionalism. This is one that honestly always feels like a serious expression of nationalist insecurity: we must compare ourselves to other nations and assert that we are better than they are. I can\u2019t help but feel that this is a result of knowing that there are serious deficiencies with the United States, but rather than actually addressing them, we\u2019ll just say \u201cDespite those, we\u2019re still the best!\u201d. If you\u2019re curious as to where the exceptionalism comes in, let\u2019s examine the categories where the United States leads the rest of the world: Military spending. The United States outspends the rest of the world considerably: it contributes nearly 37% of all global \u2018defense\u2019 spending, and spends more than the next seven countries combined. As much as the US likes to tell the rest of the world it is for our defense, the reality is that this guarantees US influence abroad. Absent the ability of the US to project military force anywhere in the world, it could not adequately protect its own interests.On that same topic, the United States is the world\u2019s number one exporter of weapons: roughly 36% of all arms sales are of American-made weapons technology.Number one in Olympic medals obtained: it currently has 2,520 medals in total, but they are second to Norway in the Winter Olympics, pulling in 305 medals compared to Norway\u2019s 368.Incarceration rate: the US has the world\u2019s highest incarceration rate, and imprisons more people than any other country in the world. It currently imprisons 22% of the world\u2019s prisoners, representing 716 people in every 100,000, which is also the highest rate of incarceration. Observe: The US spends more per capita on healthcare of any nation in the world. This is despite the absence of Universal Healthcare, meaning that millions of Americans have little or no access to effective healthcare. The US has the highest national debt of any nation in history, and this is only getting worse: U.S. National Debt Clock : Real Time As noted there, the current nation debt stands at $22.4 trillion dollars. I will note that the US also has the largest GDP of any nation on the planet (at $12.2 trillion dollars), but the debt is such that even if the US devoted an entire year\u2019s GDP to paying down the debt\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be cleared.The US is home to some of the best universities in the world: 6 of the top 10 universities are located in the United States.The US has the highest gold reserve in the world: they currently possess 8,965 metric tons of gold, which is valued at $310.5 billion dollars.The US is currently ranked as the #8 best country in the world, but ranks 17th in Educational Performance, 24th in literacy, with an average life expectancy of 78.89 years (ranking 31st in the world). Ultimately\u2026American Exceptionalism is primarily a nationalistic myth. The US is the world\u2019s most powerful nation in military and economic terms, but that\u2019s also built on an extremely fragile platform - the debt alone is a fair indicator. As far as quality of life indicators are concerned, the US is one of the worst-performing nations among the civilised world. As I said, it spends more per capita on healthcare of any nation in the world, but has millions absent health insurance, and that\u2019s before we consider individual costs (including private insurance costs). That\u2019s really quite incredible - and perhaps attributes to the low average life expectancy. It\u2019s one of the more head-scratching things about the US, in truth: it could be the most exceptional nation in the world in most categories, if it so wished. It has the economic power to fund, well, anything it wants, but the problem is that the US simply doesn\u2019t have the political will to achieve more. Education funding is the highest in the world, but the attainment levels don\u2019t match expenditure. Healthcare would be an easy fix (adopting a system of universal healthcare paid for by taxation, as is used in most of the developed world), and fixing both of those would have a major knock-on effect on every other aspect of American life. Improve attainment and the health of your citizens, and you\u2019ve got a productive workforce that would feed into innovation and boost the economy even beyond current levels. There are tons of other statistics we could take a look at here, but you get the point. The United States isn\u2019t exceptional, but it could be: and that\u2019s where it stands as most remarkable: in that it\u2019s falling far short of the potential it is capable of achieving. I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide the reasons for that. ",

            "answer_text": "Seems your question is looking for some confirmation bias by believers. There is never a lack of confirmation bias if you look for it. So for me, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d of asking if any and every viewpoint can dredge up their own carefully selected \u201cfacts\u201d that help them by convinces by their carefully chosen confirmation bias facts? I view facts like bullets that individuals pick up along the path of life, put in their revolvers and when they choose to, pull the trigger to either assist others to gain a deeper understanding or to try to kill their opponents (confirmation bias is one form of that). My answer to why I believe in American Exceptionalism is because I choose to believe it. I don\u2019t preach/teach it and you are totally free to choose whatever you choose to believe. In fact, no one but me \u201cneeds\u201d to believe in it. If you have any preconceived biases/beliefs on the topic, there\u2019s maybe a 99+% chance you will discard (challenge, mock, condemn, overlook) evidence (fact) that might pull you away from your biases/beliefs. All people do this. The opposite is true, as well. Over 50 years ago I \u201ctook a leap of faith\u201d when I gave Jesus\u2019 teachings control over my beliefs and I do about the same thing with American Exceptionalism. It\u2019s just my choice and I realize that my choices tend to be very utilitarian (what works best from my perspective). If it works, use it. I can\u2019t remember ever feeling justified by a list of facts meant to convince me or others. Example: I choose to believe in the superiority of vanilla as a flavor of ice cream and I never did any rationalizing on the topic (but I did a lot of comparing). So compared to the alternatives, I believe my choices fit me best. That is why I chose virtue and love 50 years ago because they also, fit me best and seem to work best. If they fit you, fine\u2026. if not, that\u2019s your choice of course. I will add in closing that Theological Liberalism was the basis of the founding of America which puts emphasis on individuals being liberated from the coercion of external controls (being released from structures of top down command+control). But as I said, if the reader of this practices a different confirmation bias, they can disagree and I don\u2019t mind others freely choosing different beliefs than I have freely chosen. I hope this helps. ",
