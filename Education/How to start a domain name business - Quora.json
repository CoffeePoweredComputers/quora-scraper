            "answer_text": "Assuming that you mean a Domain Registrar: Build a strong web-hosting and email business. Domain names are a commodity which means that margins are very low - in fact many companies are marketing them as loss-leaders (for the first year at least). It\u2019s the added value products where you make money.Have lots of capital. If you plan to be a first tier registrar (transacting directly with registries) each registry has an up front committent fee. I know that it\u2019s $25,000 for .nz - higher for some international registries. You can avoid this by being a second-tier registrar, buying from a first-tier who has a reseller API (e.g. register.com) - only the wholesale prices are higher, and first tier registrars will undercut you.You need to build a rock-solid commerce website which interfaces with each registry API, a support system etc. and figure a way of encoding the different rules each TLD operates under. 12 years ago, this took two of us a good six months (and we weren\u2019t a startup!) You\u2019ll probably end up getting multiple sets of terms and conditions vetted by your lawyer.You need a good marketing budget, and since you can\u2019t compete with the big guys on price, you need to compete on quality of service, ease of use or other points of difference.Sounding expensive?
