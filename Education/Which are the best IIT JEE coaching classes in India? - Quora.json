            "answer_text": "I am one of those typical mothers who research a lot for their son\u2019s education. My son has great interest towards Science as a subject. It is my dream that one day I find him studying in IIT Bombay, the most premier institute of the country. Recently, I was researching for the best IIT JEE Coaching. He is just going to finish his 10th Board exams so it\u2019s time to find an appropriate coaching for him now. I was going through various Google searches for it. Believe me the search is difficult but I am very clear about my dream for my son so I know that I have to find the best option for him. I will not tell you about my detailed struggle of haggling with google to find best coaching for my son\u2019s IIT preparation. So, long story short, during my research, I saw a video -An Eye Opener for Every IIT JEE Aspirant on YouTube.  You better see the video to know what I am talking about. I am sure if you are serious about child\u2019s IIT attempt, you can definitely spare some 23 min. I know I am argumentative, lawyer\u2019s blood is flowing in my veins. So coming back to eye opener video, it has really been an eye opener in true sense and as a parent, I would agree with Vipin Joshi Sir completely. In such a competitive era, it is really important to be the best of the best. I first believed 4-5 hour IIT coaching system was enough but now I can tell you it won\u2019t be enough for my son, nor for any other JEE student. The present generation is bound with so many distractions and laziness, that it is valid that they spend time in an organized environment which is completely away from all negativities of life. I was wondering if my son would be going through so many excuses also like \u201cNot now, I will prepare tomorrow\u201d as well when he will prepare for JEE, so I got a bit worried. But at Gurukulam, they will follow the method of studying at 6 am in morning which is very effective; I can vouch for that as I used to do that when I was studying law during my time. Being a lawyer, I have the habit of checking everything \u2018thok baja ke\u2019. You need to plan and make use of every minute of your 2 years of JEE preparation, and that\u2019s fair to expect in such a competitive world. I want him to develop the zeal of solving every question and get his concepts clear. Those who are distracted won\u2019t be able to develop such zeal. I am sharing all this with you because I want to be of help to others in the time of 10000 IIT coachings on your head . It\u2019s wonderful when my son will meditate as his focus will improve gazillion times and it will be important for his future also. He will be lucky when he will be with best IIT JEE mentors all the time to reach his goal. If I can\u2019t guide him for IIT JEE preparation personally, then I am actually making sure he gets world class facilities that will ensure best rank in his JEE attempt. I met all these Gurukulam faculties personally also and I bet you will not get better and supportive experts like them and they have such huge experience. All those parents who are planning to send their son or daughter to Kota, I am telling you that suicide hub makes me sick. I cannot imagine my son being there in that crowd. It makes me afraid for my son so I keep avoiding that option and that\u2019s why I found a better option for him. When I see IIT Gurukulam, I see it as a worthful investment as my son\u2019s life will change basically. I want my son to love what he is doing, that is how, he will be the best at what he is doing. IIT Gurukulam looks like a place where he will feel good about doing his IIT JEE preparation. So, I am giving it a chance and I am pretty sure it will work for him. Hope my answer is helpful for all other parents of JEE aspirants. ",

            "answer_text": "Once a wise hermit said \u201cYou can take a horse to the water, but you can\u2019t make him drink.\u201d I attempted JEE (Advanced) twice and cleared the exam both times. Now, let me tell you, JEE aspirants, clearing the cut-off doesn\u2019t earn you a seat in an IIT and even if it does, it may not be the one you have dreamt of. Warning: Be scrupulous about advertisements of coaching centres. The ugly fight between Nitin Jain and FIITJEE and Akash Institute is yet to be resolved. So, what went wrong in the first time? Do I have to blame the coaching institute?  Yes, I would blame my coaching institute to a certain extent. I took coaching from 3 different institutes during my first attempt. The coaching institute I joined in class 11 split into two fragments. Although it was a shock for quite a few of us, later on I found that it\u2019s a common norm in coaching centers of many smaller cities like Udaipur, Kota and Bhubaneswar. It will be hilarious to tell you that \u2018Vidwan\u2019 coaching centre (where I took coaching in my class 11) split to \u2018Amogh Classes\u2019 and then to XYZ (I can\u2019t recall the name), then to \u2018Tesla Classes\u2019 and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the current name of that coaching center. In my second effort, I took coaching in just one institute, FIITJEE South Delhi. In my second attempt, I selected a coaching center that caters to my learning methodology. I didn\u2019t go to Kota because of the huge batch strength. I needed more time to clear doubts. I was a slow learner (compared to others in the batch). I realized that I can learn faster if I have idea about the topic to be taught prior to the class. Unlike my previous coaching institute which provided me with Daily Practice Problems (DPPs) after the class, FIITJEE had a standardized curriculum and the course handouts were provided prior to the lectures. Thus, my class performance improved a lot. But can everyone afford to come to a Tier I or Tier II city for JEE preparations? No. Then what to do in that case? I have written an article which may be of help to you. I have discussed about the various factors that can affect your choice of coaching centers like success rate, finance etc. How To Choose A Coaching Center For IIT? Life is not about the best opportunity, it\u2019s about finding the optimal choice and making the most of it. You have to figure out an optimal way of preparation. You can join the Distance Learning Programs (DLPs) of some nationalized coaching centers. In Delhi and Patna, you can find the xerox copies of the study materials of almost every popular coaching center.In the last 2 years, 4G internet has penetrated into villages as well. You can take leverage of that.Try to clear scholarship exams of some reputed coaching institutes. They give a fair amount of fee waiver. I was fortunate enough to receive 75% tuition fee waiver at FIITJEE.P.S.: JEE is about endurance and your sanity even in the toughest situation. Hence, I mentioned in the first line about the thirsty horse analogy. I have seen toppers of my batch falter on the Judgement Day and couldn\u2019t even get a rank. I have seen students struggling to solve some basic Kinematics problems, fly with success because of their strategy to attempt questions. Not everyone has the luxury to make the best choice, but everyone can certainly make the optimal choice. Good luck with an optimal choice of coaching center! Edit: There are intelligent people who can clear JEE without coaching. I know a few guys. But I am yet to meet someone in the top 1000 who hasn\u2019t taken coaching. May be I haven\u2019t met a lot of people then. I narrated things from my observations. ",
