            "answer_text": "Sam, you know the details of your individual situation. Is the material taught in 11th grade more difficult, or subject matter that makes you uncomfortable? Does your school see Junior and Senior years as a time to up the pace and difficulty of your education? Are you more concerned about your future after you finish high school now that you are a junior? Have there been family, health, social problems that do not allow you to focus on your work as well as you have in the past? Are you depressed? Could you have an issue with some aspect of your health? Could be as simple as needing glasses to some underlying condition that is just now showing? Has anything changed at home ? Unless it is a particular aspect of your school to really increase the difficulty and intensity of classes for junior year, I do not think it is a general thing that happens. It could be a combination of factors\u2014family issues, personal issues, difficult teachers or course work. You need to look at yourself. See if you can make a list of any differences that you see in your study style. *Are you allowing less time for preparation of assignments?? *Are you involved in more activities or relationships that occupy your mind and time? *Are there teachers or classmates that are concerning you? *Are you gaming or watching tv more hours? *Are you asking questions in class or seeking help from your teacher about information that you do not understand? *Are your parents putting more pressure on you to get good grades? *Has your general activity level decreased or increased ? *Have you moved or has there been illness or issues with money in your family? I suggest that after you think through what you may be doing differently, that you meet with your school guidance person, or school psychologist and discuss your concerns. Include your parents in meetings with your school principal/administrator, if you think they need to make some changes or help you with issues. Take care of any physical issues that may keep you from doing your best. Ask if tutoring is applicable. If your parents and teachers see that you are concerned and trying to do something about this, they will more than likely offer to help you. Keep us up to date and continue to ask questions if you need more help. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question, and I\u2019ll answer it from the perspective that you are a student who\u2019s upset to see your normally good grades fall to a level that is barely acceptable. What is normal about this situation is that everyone has setbacks. There are going to be many times in life that things do not go your way, in fact life is all about how you approach adversity and move forward to remedy the situation. Most will take time to overcome, which is why it\u2019s generally best to avoid adverse situations: do well in your job so you do not get asked to leave; get a great education so you can have a career and support yourself; study hard, ask questions, and turn in your best work when it comes to getting good grades. What isn\u2019t normal is to dwell, get depressed, or let the grades define you. It\u2019s time to ask yourself the tough question why you let this happen, correct the issues, and move on. What will make you great moving forward is your ability to move forward. Today, you\u2019re in a situation where it sounds like your overall performance at school is lacking, so you will need to work doubly hard to: A) keep up with new material; B) do what you can to absorb the information you missed. The latter is important because many subjects build upon one another and you\u2019ll likely be behind when you start on the next level. This pattern will continue in most any career and developing the skill to address- and correct issues will make you a highly-valued employee and colleague. We wish you well in your pursuit of success and are confident you\u2019ll turn it around. ",
