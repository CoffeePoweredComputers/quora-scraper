            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t ban anything, except things that are illegal or misleading. I would advise teachers to avoid it, except in the case of critical study. Teaching religion to kids is, in some cases, the same as teaching them \u2018the boogie-man is gonna getcha!\u2019 and that\u2019s abuse. I would not \u2018forbid\u2019 a teacher to do that in the legal sense, but I would expect them to exert good judgement. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there is value in teaching about the existence and nature of religions in general - so teach Buddhism one week, then Islam another, Christianity another - and so forth. But teaching one SPECIFIC religion is ridiculous and basically evil. I grew up and went to school in the UK - where religious teaching used to be REQUIRED. Initially, they did push christianity as \u201cThe One True Religion\u201d - but over the time I was in school, the curriculum was changed to \u201cComparative Religion\u201d - where you learned about a lot of different ones without any one in particular being rammed down your throat as \u201cTRUE\u201d\u2026and that was a much better thing. Religion is a big part of human existence and to just kinda sweep it under the rug is every bit as bad as trying to indoctrinate children into the religion that the country you live in happens to choose for you.
