            "answer_text": "Probably, but the gap is not as big as it appears: The Oxford colleges have smaller endowments per student, however The endowments do not include the value of the land, buildings, or the priceless pieces of art and treasure that the colleges own. This is because it would be impossible to go back 500 years and determine the original cost of these items, and which for accounting purposes have been fully depreciated. If these were out on to the endowment balance sheet at market value, the endowments would be \u00a3100s of millions more.The endowments are not the main source of income supporting teaching at Oxford. Whereas Harvard is a private institution which must be fully self-supporting, Oxford is part funded by the government (15% of income is from government grants, and another 22% from student fees set by the government) part funded by its commercial ventures (commercialisation of its intellectual capital, including income from the Oxford University Press) and part funded by external research funding.",

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, yes. The richest universities in the United States are almost embarrassingly rich. Princeton has an endowment per student of $2.809 million, while Yale has $2.073 million and Harvard $1.736 million respectively. In comparison, Oxford had a total endowment of $5.7 billion[1] which works out to $260,000 per student. Oxford and Cambridge have an edge when it comes to extensive land holdings and art collections, but US Universities are no laggards either. For example, Yale owns about 9,000 acres of forests throughout New England, and Harvard\u2019s Art Museums are nothing to scoff at. Most importantly however, these resources generally can\u2019t be sold to fund the operation of colleges. However, the gulf in wealth becomes smaller when you take into account the fact that the UK government subsidizes higher education at Oxford (and other universities) through a number of measures like teaching grants and fee waivers, which add up to about $12,000 per student per year (excluding any loans). Ultimately, it\u2019s important to view these numbers in context. 99.9% of other universities in the world would kill to get the same resources and funding that Harvard, Yale or Oxford enjoy. When it comes to factors that are core to the mission of a university - teaching and research, both places do similarly exceedingly well. In most research rankings and metrics they aren\u2019t more than 5\u201310 places apart from each other, which makes you wonder: what on earth is Harvard spending all that extra endowment money on?
