She is far better than Malala. Malala just played for publicity. When she and her friends were shot by the Tehrik e Taliban terrorists in Swat valley,she went to London for treatment and never came back to Pakistan. Whereas her friends are still studying in the same school in Swat valley,Pakistan.  Let's talk about Nadia Murad. She received Noble peace prize alongwith Dr. Dennis Mekwege. Nadia Murad Basee Taha (Arabic: \u0646\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0637\u0647\u200e; born 1993) is an Iraqi Yazidi human rights activist who lives in Germany.[3] In 2014 she was kidnapped from her hometown Kocho and held by the Islamic State for three months. After being sold as a sex slave to ISIS fighters and escaping, Nadia Murad became a powerful advocate against sexual violence, particularly as a weapon in conflict. Murad\u2019s advocacy has helped Yazidi survivors of genocide and sexual violence seek justice. Like Murad, the UN Global Goals call for an end to violence against women and children. Yazidi activist Nadia Murad was just awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and $500,000 in prize money for her work campaigning for justice for her community, which has been terrorized by ISIS \u2014 and she\u2019s using every penny of it to fight against sexual violence and trafficking. Murad promised in a press conference on Monday to use 100% of the prize money to support Nadia\u2019s Initiative, the organization she founded, to advocate for victims of genocide and human trafficking and to help communities in need. Now,some more interesting facts about this beautiful and brave lady: Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman who survived horrific abuse at the hands of the Islamic State (IS) militant group, has revealed she is engaged to a fellow Yazidi human rights activist. The 25-year-old said \"the struggle for our people\" brought her together with Abid Shamdeen. The announcement comes days after the fourth anniversary of the IS attack on Ms Murad's village, Kocho. Six of her brothers were killed in the massacre, and she was kidnapped.  Cute couple,aren\u2019t they? Malala has guts to go to Japan,where female literacy is 99%,but she never went to Pakistan where still women are deprived of basic human rights. She is a fake humanist. Nadia is a humanist by deed,not by publicity. Please go to my this answer: Harsha Aditya's answer to What are the most extreme examples of hypocrisy? Thanks for reading. Regards.

            "answer_text": "They are not film stars to like or dislike. They both have gone to the edge of death and returned to the so called \u2018 normal life'. In the case of Malalla she was almost given up for dead but survived, taken to Briton and rest is history. Honestly I used to think and think now also, that she was given undue importance for one incident. There are many girls and boys in Afghanistan and Asia who are subjected physical and mental harassment. But Malala was lucky to come under spot light. Barak Obama was the President of US. There was unrest in Iraq due to the mess created by Bush Jr and his pet pooch Tony Blair.They both had played havoc in the middle East. ISIS had started getting its roots firm. People started hating US and Briton. This had to be remedied. Otherwise this will lead to oil crisis. At this juncture Malala issue came up. She and her family were given residency certificate in Briton. 24x7 security and the Nobel Prize. What more do you need to appease the Arab World?. The case Nadia Murai is different. She belongs to Yezdi tribe which is being harassed by Iraqis. They are the original Parsis who are Indians. Nadia was kidnapped, tortured, humiliated and finally lives in Germany. She got the Novel Prize last year. We have to appreciate and honour the two ladies for their courage and valour. But is that the end?. Why no one talks about Chinese Muslims who are slowly being converted into Communism. I feel there is a lot of politics in awarding the Nobel prize like the Oscar awards. One has to pull the right strings . There is a lady in Nepal, who stopped the trafficking of girls and has started a school and hostel for them. But she will not get the Nobel. Because she belongs to a tiny Hindu Country. What will the super powers get in return.? The best joke is Obama got his Novel Peace prize just after 8 days into Presidency. Now you can understand the scheme of things that manipulate the highest award. In no way I am being dishonest to the two brave women. May be they needed succour in the form of Novel Peace Prize. My point is, that should not be thought as the end of the story . There are millions of girls without proper protection and caught in the clutches of predators. What is the solution for them? ",
