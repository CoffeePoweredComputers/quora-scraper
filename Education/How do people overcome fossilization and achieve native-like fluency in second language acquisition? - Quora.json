            "answer_text": "There are a lot of common misconceptions about fossilization and language development. It's impossible to correct all of them in a post here, but I'll address a few that have been mentioned below. Fossilization is a stage at which a second language speaker seems to cease making progress toward becoming more target-like in his or her use of the language, so a \"learning plateau\" is a reasonable analogy. The comparison wherein \"the L2 learner has his own linguistic system\" that's still influenced by L1 and other things is known as the \"interlanguage.\"  The question researchers cannot conclusively answer is whether or not that \"plateau\" is reversible after a certain point, be it age, fluency level, etc., in order to start making progress again. Different people are motivated by different things, which range from need (to pass a test, to get a job, to watch movies without subtitles, to make friends, etc.) to learning style (preferring to study from texts, liking/disliking impromptu small-talk with people just to practice, preference for/against learning formal rules, and aptitude (is it easy to remember verb conjugations, can you physically hear the difference between /s/ and /th/ or not, etc.) There is no single formula. Finding someone who can correct your errors tactfully and effectively most certainly does not need to be demotivating, depressing or draining what so ever. I'm a very fluent non-native speaker of Spanish, and I actively request that my native speaker (NS) friends correct me when I make a mistake, or use a phrase that sounds funny in their dialect, etc. How else will I learn? It's fascinating to learn little details like that now after so many years. As long as they don't do it in a mocking or condescending way, or at a socially inappropriate time, why wouldn't I want their help? Of course if you correct a beginner every time they try to utter a sentence it could be discouraging - and obnoxious - but everything in moderation. One of the biggest cognitive challenges is whether or not L2 speakers can learn to consciously notice differences between their L2 efforts and the way a NS talks. There are decades of research on this (my own included) and I'll gladly give references if anyone actually cares. Noticing falls into two broad categories. First, the ability to \"notice the gap,\" i.e. hear a NS say a sentence and think, \"Hmm, I understand what he meant but I've never heard that word before; it must mean ___\" or \"I know what he meant but it would not have occurred to me to say it that way; I'll try to remember that for later.\" The second is the ability to \"notice the hole,\" i.e. when the L2 learner is trying to speak/write and realizes that his \"interlanguage\" (see above) lacks a word, sound or structure needed to accurately convey his own thought. If he can seek the input necessary to fill the hole, he has a much stronger chance of acquiring it. The thought processes involved during that moment are holding the forms (or lack thereof) in working memory, and the longer it stays there for further processing, the greater the possibility that it is retained in long-term memory for later use. The NS interlocutor can help promote noticing through corrective feedback (also a subject of decades of research, for which I'm also happy to provide resources if anyone is genuinely interested.) I have been using a variety of strategies for years as a language coach when working with my clients, whether helping IT executives from India and Egypt learn to write more grammatically accurate e-mail or helping priests from Nigeria improve prosodic aspects of their pronunciation (i.e. stress and intonation patterns.) Each person is different. I have found no evidence to support the argument that a person who has fossilized cannot begin to make progress again toward a more targetlike L2 use at least in some areas, with the right motivation, input and effort. The question is only about how much progress, in what areas, in how much time, and through what methods. I hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "To me, fossilization is when an L2 learner has his own linguistic system that is different from that of L1 learners and they are unable to change it. You seem to be asking about a learning plateau, but I'm not sure. I think progress in communicative ability is driven by the need to communicate. If you never need the language, you will make limited progress. This \"need\" is either real, ie. you must use the language regularly, or self-imposed, ie. you are willingly placing yourself in a situation where you can use the language and you actually use those opportunities. As for fossilization per se, I've yet to meet a person who had this sort of problem and who has managed to overcome it. Language is learned over a long period of time and the way a person views the language throughout their acquisition affects how they learn it and whether they believe their skills are either good enough or worth improving. Moreover, most people do not really have the ability or skills to observe their own speech or language critically and to identify the differences between their speech and that of native speakers, and even if they did, changing your habits and correcting your mistakes is a very intensive process few people bother with for any serious period of time. In my opinion, it's best to worry about accuracy right from the start, but this requires a lot of motivation and many will argue that this slows you down and increases your chances of abandoning. If you find yourself in this situation after years of speaking the language, and you want to improve now, even though you didn't before, I suggest you find someone who has the skills and knowledge to detect, analyze and present your most common issues, and start fixing them. Preferably, this person also knows your first language and can predict your mistakes to some degree. It will be demotivating, depressing and draining, but as they say, no pain, no gain. ",

Correcting one's language over and over again or doing endless grammar drills (for example) can make some impact of corrective change on someone's already deeply engrained language structures- but I believe it may be more helpful to develop the language at hand by starting over, in a sense, almost as if he/she is learning the language again for the first time. And in order to do this, it would take some memorization tactics, such as learning whole speeches verbatim, or practicing acting or singing songs- any way that the person has to abandon their current language structures. By derailing the individual from their fossilized structure and developing a new track in one's brain by immersion in focused speech and action, the individual may become more interested (and this is the key!) in the new, more sophisticated and complex way of speaking.

            "answer_text": "People overcome fossilization by following scaffolded learning methods that introduce new input progressively so that you can move from lower to higher levels. Fossilization occurs mainly because you are not learning a language but relearning it. Your first language (L1) reacts against the \"intruder\", creating interferences. The way to overcome it is not simply by being exposed to the language. Even if you engage in a language tandem or go to the country where the language is spoken you won't make progress unless you are exposed and practice new and more challenging input progressively. Otherwise, you may find yourself using the same expressions (fossilization) over and over without learning anything new. You can spend years throwing balls over a net without learning how to play tennis.
