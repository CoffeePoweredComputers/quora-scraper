            "answer_text": "From 2018, the Central Board of Secondary Education has relaxed the passing criteria for Class 10 students. The students need to get a minimum of 33 per cent marks in theory and practical combined to declare pass in the subject. This means there will be no need for them to secure 33 per cent separately in both board exams and internal assessments. However, the board has not revised the passing marks for Class 12 examinations. To pass in Class 12 examinations, one has to clear both theoretical and practical paper separately with minimum 33% marks each. ",
