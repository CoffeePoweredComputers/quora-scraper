            "answer_text": "Campus and college are two words that have become almost synonyms these days. People talk about an educational institution and the physical premises where classes are held in a manner that suggests as if campus and college are one and the same thing. For those who believe they are the same, this description clarifies the differences College    College is a word that conjures images of an institution where education is imparted. By college, it is assumed that one is talking about a place of higher learning where bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees are provided at the end of the completion of courses. The word connotes both the physical environment that includes the building as well as classrooms where professors and lecturers impart knowledge to students in their chosen field of study. Colleges mostly impart degrees in arts, humanities, science and engineering though there are colleges of law and medical studies. Campus  The land on which building of a college lies is called its campus. There are the classrooms, residential complexes, hostels, libraries, canteens etc built over this campus, and when the word campus is used, one is talking about the physical premises only, and there is no mention of the studies or the lectures that are provided by the college. Here, it is to be understood that the word campus is used not exclusively for a college, even a school has its campus and a bank also has its campus. Huge companies are built up in very large areas with many facilities, and the entire building or area is referred to as the campus of the company.  Bullets \u2022 College is a seat of higher learning while the campus is just its physical premises. \u2022 Campus includes all buildings such as parks, libraries, lecture halls, hostels while one does not think of these physical entities when talking about colleges. \u2022 The word campus is not reserved for colleges as it is frequently used for even schools, offices and other complexes. Hospitals have their campuses with residential facilities for residents and pathologies for diagnostic services.  ",
