            "answer_text": "Scholarships are a gift. They are meant to be used. Some countries more than others offer scholarships for students. It is important to take this into consideration while looking at study abroad options. Countries that offer scholarships for international students are US, Canada, New Zealand and Finland to name the top few. That is not to say that the others don\u2019t offer scholarships but it might be fewer. There are different types of scholarships that one can apply for- government and non-government funded scholarships. Other than these most scholarships are merit based. There are also those that are given for music, sports, leadership and community service.  What I have seen is that private universities that are smaller offer a greater amount of scholarships for international students. The advantage of applying for these kind of universities is that the competition for getting these scholarships is not that much and the chances of increasing the amount over the years is more. As a student, what you need to do is take a look at what is required of you in order to meet the criteria that normally is very clearly stated on university websites. Things like academic rigor, grades in 9, 10 and 11, overall percentage/GPA, etc. are normally aspects that are taken into consideration. It might be a bit of work in doing the research but it definitely is worth your time. So whether you need a scholarship or not, if you think you meet the requirements and have put in the effort to do well through school, then go get that gift! You deserve it. ",
