            "answer_text": "It depends on several factors. I increased my SAT score by 90 points through one month\u2019s studying. These are the guidelines I followed. What\u2019s your starting place? If you took challenging math and English courses during the school year, you\u2019re already better prepared and will have an easier time studying. If you didn\u2019t do the stuff on the test in class, you need to work more at trying to understand the methods.How hard are you willing to work? It\u2019s going to take many hours to achieve your SAT goals. Create a study plan and stick to it.Study smart. Don\u2019t start out with doing just random practice problems. If you\u2019re using the textbook, find chapters with content you haven\u2019t mastered yet and read the instructions for how to solve different problems. Then do practice problems.On my first SAT, I had a reading score I was happy with and a math score I was not. I got the Kaplan book and went through each math chapter, reading through the methods and problem-solving skills and then doing the related problems. Each chapter took me 1\u20133 hours and there were 8 chapters. It was a lot, but it was doable. I set a goal of one chapter every 2 days. I sometimes fell short, but ultimately finished before the SAT and achieved my goal. And you can too. ",
