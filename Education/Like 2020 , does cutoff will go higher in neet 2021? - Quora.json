            "answer_text": "Considering the present scenario , we can easily predict that cut off will touch sky even in 2021. But dude, CHILL!!!! Just do your best and work hard for 2021. Even J can't predict cut off for 2021. Some factors affect the cutoff . Level of examination -hard, moderate or easy as this year.Number of students appeared (as I think this year droppers are also going to rise because of high cutoff \ud83e\udd14)See sometimes cutoff is also affected by the group of people scoring a particular range of marks ,for example,this year Allen's one student is scoring full marks 720/720. One girl of Aakash is expecting 720. Sri Chaitanya is expecting more than 10 students scoring 700 . So ,cutoff this is year is also unpredictable in some aspects like if upper group of students scored 620\u2013720 range marks and after than most of the students are expecting 570\u2013590 range then cutoff can be affected . Honestly speaking, don't expect quality from NTA. They have dropped down the level of neet so much that even after scoring good marks you can't expect good rank or even sometimes your dream college. Just work hard,stay positive and in case of doubt, fell free to ask. Do upvote if you liked it. Thankyou \ud83d\ude4f ",

            "answer_text": "So it seems like you're an Neet 2021 aspirant,I guess?,\ud83d\ude01\u2026. So lets come to the point see Neet 2020 question is quite easy level as compare to last 10 or 15 years\u2026so it is not unrealistic that Neet 2020\u2019s cut off will go definitely higher\u2026it really doesn't mean that Neet 2021\u2019s cut off will also go higher.\ud83d\ude12 Otherwise cutoff depends upon the level of question paper and certainly in so many factors like----- Level of question paperNo. Of students given examNo. Of MBBS seats increased in that particular year.(including new colleges started their first session)And many more\u2026but these are the main reasons. So I hope you get my point clearly.Otherwise for this year cut off will go definitely higher but my prediction is not more than 20 marks I guess\u2026But still there are several people getting scared by seeing Some Students getting 720 out of 720\u2026So work Hard buddy\u2026cz competition is getting harder day by day\u2026.and I am not going to add any pics cz I don't know how to do that,if anyone knows pls let me know and Yes All the\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d ",
