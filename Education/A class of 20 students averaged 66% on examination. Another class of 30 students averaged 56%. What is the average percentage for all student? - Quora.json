            "answer_text": "Let's see. 20 students averaged 66%, which is 0.66. Sum of scores / number of students = 0.66 x/20=0.66 Technically, each student could have a score of 0.66. Whether they did or didn't, the sum of their scores is the same as if they did. So, 20 students x 0.66 = the sum of scores, which is 13.2 If the same thing is done for the population of 30 students we can know the sum of all their scores, which, divided by the sum of the students equals the average score for that population of students. The sum of scores / the sum of the students = the average score per student. (((20)(0.66) + (30)(0.56)) / (20+30))\u2022100=x ((13.2+16.8)/50)\u2022100=x (30/50)(100)=x (0.6)(100)=60% Now, if the population of students was not known, and the averages were summed and then divided by 2 the answer would be ((.66+0.56)/2)\u2022100=x (1.22/2)(100)=x (0.61)(100)=61% But this would only be an estimate. However, since the populations are known, the average for the population can be calculated as 60%, not just estimated as 61%. Does this make sense? ",

            "answer_text": "Someone else has already answered this question correctly, so I'll tell you how I did it. This is kind of a cheat answer and will not work most of the time. What would the answer to your question be if both classes had 20 people? It should just be right between 56% and 66%, right? Since both classes take up half of the total students, the answer should just be a straight average of their test scores. However, both classes do not have 20 people. The class that scored 56% has 30 people, 3/5 of the students. So they should have a 3/5 \u201cpull\u201d towards their scores, as opposed to the 1/2 pull described earlier. So what's between 56 and 66, but swayed 3/5 towards the 56 side? 60%. ",
