            "answer_text": "There are many answers to how this could happen and none of them are acceptable. However, there is no good way to change the teacher from the student side. I tried when I was a student and the best I achieved was permission to study for one teacher\u2019s class independently and then take her tests. Her class lectures were so confusing, it was actually easier to get a good grade studying without hearing them. I doubt that most schools would do even that today. The most practical answer is to get help outside of class. There are several choices for doing this. One is an adult professional tutor, they may know the most but will probably also cost the most. Another is a student who took the course with someone else and understands it well. Students often explain things in ways that are clearer to other students than teachers, especially when you are stuck with a weak one. The third choice is a student who got a good grade from your teacher. Not only should they know the subject, they should also be able to help you predict what will be on the exams and how the teacher will grade them. If somebody in the class now is getting good grades without cheating, that would be another possibility if you can study with them. Talk to your counselor (assuming your school has one who is professional) and let them know how frustrated you are. They might be able to help connect you with a student tutor or tell you who is available in your area. The hidden advantage is that they should also be making sure the administration knows if a number of students are struggling with a teacher\u2019s work. It is administration\u2019s job to do something about it. But, it won\u2019t help you if they do. It will take longer than a semester to deal with a teacher who simply doesn\u2019t communicate the content well. Spend way more time than you want with the text, look for a helper who knows the material and possibly how to score higher with this teacher, look on the internet for explanations of the topics you are studying, and work as hard as you would if you needed this information and there was no teacher. Good luck. It is unfair and unfortunate, but you can rise above the situation. Then maybe consider coming back yourself and teaching in way that works well for students? ",

            "answer_text": "When I was at university we had a professor who was constantly rated by the students as being the worst teacher at the institution. At the beginning of each class he would hand out sheets of paper containing a closely typed script and then proceed to read aloud, in a boring monotonous voce, all that was written there in a way that suggested we could not read it for ourselves. Once he had finished reading, he would pack up his things and leave the room without any further discussion or material being presented. Eventually a student delegation was formed to ask the Rector of the university if it was possible to have the professor dismissed as no one could support his attitudes or teaching style any more. I will always remember the professor entering the class room the day after the delegations visit to the Rector. He came in with his head hung low and in a quiet voce apologized to us for causing us so much pain. To our surprise he then asked us for suggestions as to how he could improve. Initially the students were timid in responding, but upon seeing the professor was genuinely interested in improving his teaching technique, a \u201cbrain storming\u201d session began. Soon the discussion had moved onto education and teaching in general. The next time the professor came to lecture us; he did not give us a hand out as was his custom, but simply sat on a chair and began telling us about his last trip to Rome. Within a couple of minutes he had the whole room spell bound. He may have been a terrible lecturer but as a story teller he was second to none! You see the professor taught us Roman history, but until that point no one had realized he was also a skilled archeologist and had participated in many important Roman archeological digs over the years. At the end of lecture the professor gave each of us a fact sheet covering the material of his talk. From then on the professor\u2019s lectors followed the same \u201cfire side\u201d chat formula. Through his story telling ability he had the capacity to take us back in time as if we were living in that period. By the end of the term the professor was voted the best professor at the university. The next term his fame had spread throughout the university and there was intense completion to enter his class. When I look back and remember that professor, I am grateful for what he taught me, and for the fact he did not simply turn his back on us naive students. I also feel a little embarrassed as I was one of the members of the delegation who had gone to complain to the Rector about him and in the process almost lost the best teacher I have ever had.

            "answer_text": "Below is a partial answer, and I hope you consider it empowering. If a teacher is truly unskilled, one must recognize that what you bring to the task of learning affects the outcome as much as the teacher\u2019s skill. Expect to have some teachers who make learning easy or at least enjoyable and some who don\u2019t. I homeschooled my extremely academically advanced child for years, and when I put him in public school at age twelve, he continued to educate himself the way I had raised him to. So, typically, before lessons were taught, he knew much if not all of the content. That\u2019s right. He already knew a lot when he entered school, and then he read most of his textbooks as quickly as possible once he got them\u2014cover to cover. While this is not going to happen for all or even most students, most students have the opportunity to read their textbooks, try problems in the book, watch Youtube lessons, ask for academic mentoring, attend after school tutoring, ask for help from older relatives or friends, and otherwise find ways to learn. Most students also have the opportunity to list questions they still have after studying and ask them in class. My own son skipped honor precalculus in high school because he was already tutoring college students in the college level precalculus. While he was an extreme example of self-teaching, what I will tell you is that the way I homeschooled him was not to sit him down and teach him lessons and give him homework but rather to expose him to rich learning opportunities and ask him questions. That is how he learned to learn on his own. As a private teacher, I recognize that students often need help overcoming learning barriers, and I am very good and helping them. But, I don\u2019t give them the answers or explain everything to them. I mostly ask them questions and tell them only a little bit. They actually are able to answer most of the questions simply be stopping and thinking about it and sometimes researching or doing some kind of problem. Most students, if they take full responsibility for learning a subject, can largely overcome the effects of less effective teaching. While it is the responsibility of the teacher to effectively promote learning and the student to eagerly learn, some teachers do it better than others and some students are better at learning from teachers than others. Make yourself one of the latter, and you\u2019ll likely learn well enough with a marginal teacher and brilliantly under the better teachers. The key to learning when you have less help than seems reasonable is to proactively pursue learning with full determination. What you struggle to learn on your own, you must proactively ask for help without giving up easily. ",

            "answer_text": "I also had a bad teacher during my college years as an Education student. I took up Education - Major in English for 4 years in our provincial university, and I had this female teacher who many of my classmates dislike because she imposed herself to the class as the indomitable top dog! No one would ever taunt her, because even the rowdiest lads in class seemed spineless at her sharp stare. The class I attended with her was Teaching Principles 1. Normally, at the onset of the semester, a student like me harbors high expectations from teachers who are coined \u201cProfessor\u201d bearing extensions on their names like Ph.D, Ed.D, MBA, and many more. This teacher of mine was known for her high academic achievements and during that time, she was a department head in the college of education. When she enters class, she stands 90 degrees erect and her eyebrows rise like upheaving waves at those whom she thinks are unprepared for lecture. Her strict aura would fill the four corners of our room; like a cold fog crawling, blinding, and suffocating if too much. It's really kind of scary when she walks around and inspects our writings during class activities. She\u2019s totally an embodiment of the word stern. Weeks went by and we have already approached midterms week. My classmates and I were talking about what kind of exam she would give us. We hadn\u2019t really felt so pressured in reviewing for an exam like hers. So it came. She went to class and distributed test papers fresh from the photocopier. The moment I glanced on the test paper, I noticed that the choices under the multiple choices type were all terribly close! As if all the items had correct choices under them. In addition, only a small percentage of the items had average difficulty. Most of them: way above average or extreme. Surprisingly, almost all of my classmates had the very same impression on her exam. It was excruciatingly difficult! After an hour of answering a mentally antagonizing exam, we submitted the test papers. Upon receiving the papers, she immediately shuffled and returned them to us. This time, I was holding a my classmate\u2019s paper. We were told to do checking that day and so we did. I faithfully marked exes on each item in the paper in my hand. That caught my honest attention. Almost all of the answers in that paper were terribly wrong! My classmates had the very same reaction as well! To tell you how dreadful the results were, we were 40 in the class, and only two students got scores above 90%. The rest got lower than 85% and even flat 70%! My teacher strongly defended herself against the sharp reactions from my classmates. The reasons she gave for the correct answers were obviously questionable and contestable! To end this story, my classmates tried to impugn her for the flawed and invalid exam she gave. That\u2019s how they dealt with her. But she remained sturdy and at times dreadfully stiff. Criticisms only delighted her and irritated my friends. Nonetheless, it was a sad day for all of us, knowing that almost every one failed in her test. My friends tried everything, but all efforts were squashed since no one in the department could confront her with a more engrossing yet completely authoritative aura. ",

I did this many times in school when a teacher was inadequate. Once, I scored a 100% on a science test everyone else failed. The teacher asked me what I did, and I was honest: \u201cWell, class was boring, so I read the textbook.\u201d Biology is biology is biology. It is more or less the same everywhere. Textbooks cover the same information on cells, DNA, life cycles. My university Biology class was nearly identical to my high school Biology class, or so I felt. Since my college professor in Biology was one of the worst (all Powerpoint, all reading from the slides), I used that time for more productive pursuits, and - you guessed it - read the textbook. I ended up with an A in college Biology despite being absent from the class of a boring professor, because I owned the material and learned it from other resources. Textbooks, Youtube, other teachers nearby, internet websites, and more - why can\u2019t you find your own path to mastering Biology content? ",

During the entire semester, I am rated as the most pathetic teacher, as I talk more practical aspects of the subject rather then the subjective part. Whereas students are more inclined towards rot learning. If I change my way of teaching (which I am willing to, provided I am able to fulfill my obligation towards the subject), I am sure I will not be able to do justice to the course I am teaching. Yet what makes me contended with my way of teaching is that once students pass out and start their professional career, they keep sending me emails and posts on FB, hailing my efforts to teach them, what is really needed to succeed in their professional life. I am on the lookout for wiping out my students\u2019 perception (students in my country usually don\u2019t work until their graduation), that whatever I am trying to make them understand has practical relevance and is certainly going to give them an edge once they are in their profession.

The topic might be presented in a way that isn't interesting but if you ask an interesting question then it might make the process more enjoyable not just for you but everyone else. I had a really boring Spanish teacher so I asked lots of questions and steered the lessons on to topics that I enjoyed. It made it really fun for me and I hope for the rest of the class. It also meant the teacher could use examples that he knew would engage the class because we had talked about them previously. Teaching is a two way street and lessons are often designed with pupils asking questions built in. If nobody talks it is hard to build a relationship or deliver an interesting lesson as your teacher doesn't know you and can't give examples tailored to you to make it more interesting. You have a responsibility for your education as well! Another thing you can do is to make comments that clarify or put a topic into another context. Say you're learning about flowers, you could ask if petals are just leaves wearing makeup. This will provoke a discussion (and if it doesn't then push the question until it does!) and should make the topic more interesting and informative for everyone. ",

If they are still not being helpful, go to someone senior and ask to change teachers (it would be good to have the name of another teacher in mind). Above all, make the process as easy as possible for the school/ college - that way, you will be much more likely to get what you want.

I restrict my use of power points to when I have a particular set of visuals I want to convey and ask my students to print the slides so they don\u2019t have to copy every detail down on the day I give them. I also want my students to speak up when there is a point they don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t like powerpoints because I feel they can stifle class discussion. I can\u2019t always anticipate the order my discussions will go and powerpoints have a determined order to them. ",

If there's a textbook it should explain what she's going over. If someone will lend you their notes, copy them and study those. Last but not least - what's her daily topic? If you can't take any notes other that, write down what topic she covered that day and that night punch it into youtube - some entertaining video will come up and you can pick it up from that. ",

There are almost always other sources for the subject. ",
