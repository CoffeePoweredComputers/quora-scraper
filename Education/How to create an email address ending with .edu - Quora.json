            "answer_text": "To my knowledge unless your university allows you this service, it cannot be done. Reason being that .edu tells people that your email ID belongs to that of some educational institution. You can't just say that you are an institution by your self. Maybe if you start a website like say Khan academy or something, you can use that server and get a .edu email(but im pretty sure that is not your aim, so, yeah. Thanks for A2A! ",

Your college doesn't provide this service it means it doesn't have website with a domain edu neither can you yourself create it for you alone as edu domain will be only allocated to educational institutes as I said earlier.
