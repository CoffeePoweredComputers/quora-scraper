            "answer_text": "I am writing this as someone who has been at the serving end of the school cane as a teacher as well as the receiving end as a student. When I was a student it was commonly used to maintain classroom discipline and after warnings we would be called out to the front of the class for immediate discipline in the form of typically 2 strokes of the cane or strap on the palm of our hand. It was over and done with in seconds and like it or not, it did work. It was not a harsh, brutal beating but a short lived discomfort that made us think. I received it several times myself. The teacher would ensure that you were spoken to again before the end of the day to reassure the student that the punishment was for a specific behaviour and was over and done with and everyone would continue as normal. There was no bad feeling. When I started as a teacher I had decided to try to avoid CP and follow the theory from my teacher education course. The principal told me that if I did not wish to administer the CP myself that the teacher in the class next to mine would do it. I had a grade 4 class and they soon started testing the limits of my patience and I was frequently sending them next door. One day when I had a joint class with the teacher next door and I saw how much better behaved her students were. They seemed happy, she asked them to do things and they just did it. I commented that to her and she told me that she had used CP on the students I had sent to her more times than on her own students. She politely told me that she had only expected to do the CP for me a couple of times until I settled in and that she was not happy about punishing students for other teachers. She asked me if thought CP was effective and I said yes and so she said that I needed to be prepared to administer it myself. She opened her cupboard and gave me a short cane and said after a couple of times using it at the front of the class the kids would see their boundaries and then it would be hardly needed. She asked me to hold out my hand and she gave me a sample of what she used on the kids and it was a sting but not a severe painful blow. It worked, after a couple of times out at the front of the class things settled down. ",

            "answer_text": "I am from the UK but spent a couple of years as a kid in Atlanta, USA while my parents who were teachers where on exchange schemes. CP had long since been banned in the UK but we heard stories about how awful it was. My 1st experience was at elementary school in grade 3 where I spent a year. My parents had told me about them paddling at the school but that I would be OK as I was well behaved. I soon saw that the teacher would call out some misbehaving students before recess and take then outside into the hall with her paddle and we would hear the swats and giggle. When it happened to me I was one of 6 kids she called out. We were milling around in a crowd and she just randomly grabbed a kid, bent them over and gave them 3 swats. I was avoiding being grabbed and almost got away with it when she asked who had not had their swats and she looked at me. I got mine and felt awful. It was not the 1st time for the other kids but it was for me. She must have seen how I looked and knew I was from the UK and she spoke to me in class after. She told to me that it was not an awful thing to get the paddle, it was just a little spank for being naughty and not to feel like a bad person or to be to be upset. I told my mum and she was the same about it and said it was not as awful as the cane they used to give in the UK. Anyway, I managed to get it once more before the end of the year. It did not really hurt, it was more the embarrassment. The next time was on a 2nd visit to the USA when I was 14. In that school they had a points system and I got the number of points to be sent to the office. The lady I saw was so nice, she chatted for what seemed like ages about how I found USA school compared to the UK. I thought I had got away with it when she said that she would give me my paddling and I could get back to class. She brought the secretary in to witness and told her how I was from the UK for year with my parents who were also teachers. I felt so ridiculous bent over at her desk while she gave me 3 swats. When I got back to school in the UK I was asked to give a talk to my class about my experience and I mentioned about them using the paddle (but did not admit to having received it myself) and the class could not believe it.
