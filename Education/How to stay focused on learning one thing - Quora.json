            "answer_text": "Man, did I write this question while sleepwalking? :-) This used to be my situation exactly. So, what should you do? Set up a goal and a deadline. Your goal needs to be specific, skill-oriented (I\u2019ll explain later) and attainable. This will increase your motivation and likelihood of staying on tracks. So, your goal needs to be: a) specific - you need to learn the fundamentals? Ok. What does it mean? Be much more concrete about that. The following point will help you with that: b) skill-oriented - do not focus on \u201clearning the fundamentals of C++\u201d. This is way too general and vague. Instead, make a list of things you should be able to do in a given time horizon. Instead of \u201cI will learn the fundamentals of C++\u201d, plan to \u201cbe able to program a simple calculator in C++ in seven weeks.\u201d Convert anything you are learning to the language of the skills you acquired. Every time you learn something, write it down as if it were on your resume in the Skills section. \u201cCan print \u2018Hello world\u2019\u201d, \u201cCan create the FizzBuzz program\u201d\u2026 This will work wonders for your confidence and motivation - you are way less likely to drop out once you are aware of how much you have learnt! c) attainable - yes, your goal needs to be realistic. A possible reason for your lack of focus is that you simply lose interest in the original thing since it seems so freakin\u2019 difficult. But if you follow my advice, this problem will vanish. You will start with smaller, more practical steps, gradually building up towards your goal. This will ensure you do not get sidetracked. In addition to all these incredibly important points, always bear in mind the reason why you started in the first place. Keep reminding yourself why you started learning in the first place. Make this your mantra. This question really made me think: \u2018been there, done that\u2019 :-) Bonus: my excel diary to track progress in Project Euler  ",
