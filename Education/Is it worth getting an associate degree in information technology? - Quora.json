            "answer_text": "I only have an Associate degree and I\u2019ve made it to being a Systems Engineer for a Healthcare system. However, it has taken me too long (6 yrs) to get here because I did not properly manage my career until recently. My advice to you is: Know what the position you want and what technologies you want to support, engineer or develop.Once you\u2019ve determined that, find various people (peers, instructors, professionals) who are or have held that position and worked on those technologies and ask them how they got there. What would they do differently.Develop a path on how you want to accomplish getting into that ideal position.Network, network, network! In my experience, the IT community anywhere is pretty small and the more you network within it, you will get more help getting the position you want. Nepotism is real and real useful.Personally, I know people who have made it to where I am or further without college or \u201cformal\u201d training. I know people who only have certifications who have made it to where I am or further. I know people who have gone to college with varying degree levels or multiple degrees who have made it to where I am or further. ",
