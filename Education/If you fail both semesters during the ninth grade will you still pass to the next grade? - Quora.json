            "answer_text": "In Los Angeles, yes, all your classes next semester will be tenth grade classes. You will not have enough credits to graduate unless you re-take the ninth grade classes you failed. You may think everything is ok, and that no one will notice you failed ninth grade, but soon, everyone else will be having fun in senior activities, and you will not be allowed to participate because you will not be a REAL senior. Your counselor, dean and one or two assistant principals will be telling you NO every time you want to pretend you are a senior and do stuff with your friends. No grad night, no senior picnic, no yearbook parties for you. When you are a \u201csenior,\u201d you will be spending your extra time taking ninth grade classes, if having a diploma is important to you. The real seniors will be filling out college applications and talking about their future careers. You will be filling out applications for minimum-wage jobs, summer programs or otherwise trying to get caught up, if moving ahead in life is important to you. Your friends will notice that you\u2019re not participating with the REAL seniors, and you will feel small. You will be spending half your time with ninth graders and tenth graders, making up classes. At this age, people really act immature and embarrass themselves with their words and behavior. In a couple of years when you are a junior, you won\u2019t be able to stand ninth graders who don\u2019t have their act together, but you will be at their level. You will also be with other kids who are unmotivated - they don\u2019t care about being anything in life. Maybe you don\u2019t either, but that\u2019s okay. You might meet one or two people who are really seriously trying to get caught up because something terrible happened in ninth grade that stopped them from passing. These people might inspire you. WORDS DON\u2019T TEACH, only life does, so even if you\u2019re reading this you probably don\u2019t believe me about any of it. That\u2019s okay. You just keep on doing you! If you want to break out and really have a LIFE, now is a good time. You have to change something about yourself, your habits, or the way you spend your time, you have to DECIDE you want to be successful. Or not. It\u2019s entirely up to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Reality is the answer depends on your school\u2019s policy (and that of the school board). There\u2019s a concept called \u201csocial promotion\u201d which says that students shouldn\u2019t be failed because it might hurt their itty-bitty feelings. Of course that doesn\u2019t do the student any good and explains why we actually see high school graduates who cannot read or write. At all. But tell us why, if you failed, you think you should be promoted? After all, you don\u2019t know the material you\u2019re supposed to know so if you are promoted to grade 10 how are you going to handle that work. Pretty much guaranteed that you\u2019re going to have problems so you\u2019re likely to be asking the same question at the end of next year - if you\u2019ve failed should you pass to grade 11. And it\u2019s not just yourself that\u2019s being hurt. It\u2019s your classmates - if the teacher has to dumb down the course content so you can handle it the other students are being shortchanged. I should comment that I\u2019m a lot older than you and the idea of social promotion didn\u2019t exist when I was in school. The son of one of my father\u2019s friends spent 6 years in grade one (yes he was that thick). The only reason he got out of that class was that he was transferred to the \u201coccupational\u201d high school - that school taught kids how to do things like pump gas - they actually had a set of gas pumps there and students were shown how to operate them, make change and the like. And there was another \u201ckid\u201d in grade 8 - I use the word \u201ckid\u201d loosely because he was 18. No idea what happened to him but he was still there when I headed off to high school. ",
