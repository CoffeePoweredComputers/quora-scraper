            "answer_text": "As a student who graduated from an American public high school less than a month ago, I feel qualified to answer this. I\u2019ll divide my answer into four parts: academics, clubs/ activities, outside the classroom, and social life. Academics: I live in Texas, and if you believe the rumors you'd probably think that evolution is considered heresy and creationism is shoved down our throats. This is simply not true. My AP biology teacher was very religious, but she was moderate enough to teach us scientific fact. The effectiveness of the American school system largely depends on two things: where you live and what teachers you get. The town I live in is actually known for its excellent public schools, and thus the education I received was better than the norm. Education is mostly left up to the states, and attempts by the national government in the form of a program called common core to standardize education nationwide failed miserably. Luckily, the state of Texas in all its Republican wisdom decided not to adopt the Common Core, and thus my school district was saved from the clutches of mediocrity. Some places across America are sorely lacking in the education department; even so, the individual teachers can do a lot to pick up the slack from the local school district. Good teachers often follow good school districts and vice versa, but there are of course exceptions to this rule. I've had my share of truly wonderful, exceptional teachers, the kind that actually inspire students to learn. However, we shall use my freshman year English teacher as an example of a typical terrible American teacher. Her name was Ms Fuller, and teaching, above all else, was a pain to her. She would be gone at least twice a week, and even when she was in class she just told us to read things and never actually taught us anything. Most of us realized by the third week of school that she got all of her worksheets from the internet, so all it took to answer them was a quick google search of the title, and the key would be right in front of us. The next year, several incoming freshman I knew had her listed as their teacher on their schedule. However, the first day of class, she didn't show up. You see, ms fuller had not been fired, she had quit without informing the school. The actual class schedule varies heavily from school to school. I was in school from 7:25 to 2:55 every day. Our school operated on a 9 block- 45 minutes per class schedule for most of high school. However, my senior year, they decided that having students visit every class every single day was not a good idea. They transitioned to a standard A- B day schedule, where our classes were an hour and a half long and we went to each class only every other day. Which of these systems is better is honestly up to personal preference. Overall, the academic aspect of American high school is anything but consistent, but I can say for certainty that I feel prepared for college. Clubs: One thing American high schools excel at is providing students with a variety of activities that will suit their interests. For example, I was in the marching band, honors band, academic decathlon team, and history UIL team. Marching in particular was the best part of high school for me, although it was a lot of work. Practice was 3 days a week from 3:30 to 7. On Fridays there was usually a football game which would keep us occupied until midnight, and the next morning we would sometimes have all-day competitions. And that's not the mention the month of summer that was dedicated to band camp. It may have been a lot of work, but the experience was extremely rewarding. Even if band isn't your thing, my high school had every conceivable athletic team (even bowling for some reason.) There were also many academic teams for those with sharp minds. It was rare to find a student who wasn't heavily involved in at least one significant after school activity. Even if you're into something our school doesn't provide, forming your own club is relatively easy. When you're not studying, high school will make sure you stay busy with a litany of clubs and teams to choose from. Outside the classroom: The high school experience outside the classroom, everything from the famous American football games to prom is also very important. Most schools encourage school spirit, and it seems half the population shows up to the more important football games. Seriously, if you are ever in the US, especially Texas, try and go to the local high school football game if you can. Homecoming in particular is a special treats to all those involved and in Texas we practice a few... extra traditions, namely the practice of giving mums and garters. How the practice of spending hundreds of dollars on a ribbon infested flashy piece of school spirit got started is beyond me, but if you don't participate you can feel everyone silently judging you. Prom is also a lot of fun, but it's just a better version of the awkward high school dance most people know and despise. The so called \"culture\" of American high school is quite unique and makes attending public school an overall enjoyable experience.  An extreme example of the downright gaudy appearance of some mums. Social life: So between classes, homework, football games and after school practice, what does the average student do in their free time? It is not uncommon for many upperclassmen to have after school jobs; I would estimate the number to be as high as 30%. Other than that, we go to the mall, watch movies, hang out, play video games etc... Popularity is a real, unseen force in high school. I won't go into all the various methods one uses to measure their place in the social hierarchy, but not being popular does not necessarily mean that your life will be miserable in high school. Bullying as it's often portrayed in the media simply doesn't exist. No one is mean to anyone for the sake of being mean. Sure people talk behind each other's backs, but it's rarely for no reason. The social life of any teenager is quite complex, and Americans are no exception. Still, American high school is hardly the cutthroat environment one might believe it to be. ",

            "answer_text": "You need more details. What do you want to know about? The school rules (dress code, etc...)? The coursework? The difficulty of classes / general workload? Extracurricular activities? The social life? Tips for optimizing for college admissions? Something else? Honestly, though, this is pretty unanswerable because public schools vary enormously in quality, student body, resources, social life, etc both across the country and even within a given state. Each school district is funded through local taxes, so a wealthy district will have a drastically different quality of education than a poor one both due to the resources available and the socioeconomic status of the students who go there. Many districts also have test-in schools that select students based on academic ability, which are of course much different from the standard public schools. Then there are private schools, which have an entirely different culture that I know nothing about at all. EDIT with updated question details: Sounds like you are going to a fairly good school with probably a reasonably diverse student body in a fairly populated area. If the academics are good, it probably means that the students are at least somewhat interested in school and therefore being \"smart\" or trying hard at school won't make you a social outcast.  Given that you are only going to be there for a year, and you are joining in your senior year, your social life is going to be hard. The students will have long standing friend groups that will be hard for you to break in to unless you are very outgoing, and many of them will be stressing about college applications during your fall term and then talking about them incessantly during the spring term, so it will be even harder.  High school is very much about fitting in, so everyone has a fairly simple set of descriptors they attach to themselves. Try not to get too caught up in the cliquishness of high school and try to get past the superficiality of many of the students.  Given that you are an international, I suspect that you will be treated as a curiosity for a while, and people will ask you all sorts of questions, many of which you will think think are way too prying, personal, and frankly offensive. They are not trying to be rude, they are just overly curious and don't know any better. Try to be patient with them and explain, if you can, why you find it offensive (if you do). Americans as a whole tend to have fewer conversational taboos, particularly among friends, compared to Asian cultures, so you will probably see this wherever you go here.  Also, as an international, there will be a lot of sayings, references to pop culture etc that you just don't know. Don't be shy about trying to get someone to explain them to you. The ones who do so patiently are going to be good friends, the ones you just mock you for not knowing something that clearly everyone else knows about will not. Getting along with teachers is really easy. Just pay attention, do your work, and generally be polite and courteous and your teachers will like you. There are always some teachers who teach because they enjoy being in power, so figure out who they are and avoid upsetting their delicate sensibilities so that they don't make life hard for you. Note: I have not been in high school for 10 years, and I certainly was not a particularly popular or social person when I was there.  Good luck! ",
