            "answer_text": "A bit of background: I've been teaching Physics and Math at the college level for over 20 years now. I started off as a tutor, and went on to be a Graduate Teaching Assistant. Now I'm a tenured faculty member.  Throughout these years, I've liked the overwhelming majority of my students. I've always admired the way many pushed through their individual comfort levels, and even came to like subjects that used to intimidate them. I've had a student who actually cried when doing her first Physics assignment - but persevered on to complete the much more challenging second semester course with a B.  I've met maybe 10-20 who I was genuinely sorry to see leave - in the sense that I would have liked to have them in another class. Of course, I was really happy for them!! These were the students who were both academically well above average, had lively minds, and were uplifting to be around. These are the students that make my choice of livelihood especially worthwhile. When I was a student, I used to think that being liked by the teacher was only a function of grades (unless someone was REALLY obnoxious or arrogant). But now I realize  it's much more complex than that. In fact, attitude seems to play a bigger part than grades when it comes to a teacher's opinion of a student. Other than for one recent student, it's difficult for me to even recollect any student I've disliked. (In this case, it was mainly because of his entitled attitude in combination with a vastly overrated sense of his own abilities.) In fact, in my 20+ yrs of teaching, he is the ONLY student around whom I lost my temper. (It was strong frustration - I didn't scream at him.) I've never ever disliked a student purely because of their lack of academic ability. My feelings towards someone like that would be of concern;  I've tried to direct them along appropriate paths whenever possible. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been teaching in independent high schools for over 30 years.  I like my students.  I think that if I didn't, I wouldn't have been able to have remained a teacher for so long.  I think that in my entire career there have been fewer than 5 or 6 students that I have not been able to like by the end of the school year. Teenagers are funny, they are serious, they are emotional, they are sensitive, and they are caring.  They generally want to learn.  If they don't, it is my job to help them gain the motivation to do so.  And most importantly, my students are nice.  They say hello and smile when they come into class, and they say goodbye and thank you when they leave.   Any time I come across a student who annoys me, I try to figure out why and how I might overcome the problem.  These students are just kids--they still have a long way to go, and if possible, I need to help them. ",
