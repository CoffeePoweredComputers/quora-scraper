            "answer_text": "Look up a PhD thesis. Or the paper, if you want an abridged version, which comes out of it. The majority of PhD theses could be called \u201ccase studies.\u201d If you want to include data collection, go into the experimental sciences. Don\u2019t dismiss the social sciences (sociology, economics), some of those will probably be the best. One of the huge differences I\u2019ve noticed between a full blown PhD over your typical data scientist is a better understanding in the integration of experimental design, data collection, analysis, and reporting. \u201cData scientists\u201d tend to be too focused on the latter two.

            "answer_text": "On Kaggle and other platforms for hosting data science competitions. A typical data science project involves the following things: Problem understanding and formulationData collection and data transformationModel training and offline evaluationModel deployment and online evaluationYou can learn a lot from data science competitions. Yes, they do mostly focus on the model training and evaluation part, so it\u2019s not possible to cover all the project lifecycle steps with a competition. However, they are still the best source for learning about other steps: the organizers of a competition already went thought the troubles of formulating the problem and collecting the data, so you can just learn from what they did. So, go to Kaggle and read about past competitions. For each competition, find answers to the following questions: What was the problem the organizers wanted to solve?What kind of data they prepared?What were the features, and what was the target?What was the evaluation metric?What did the winners use in their solution?Reading about 10\u201320 competitions and trying to answer these questions will definitely give you a lot of information.
