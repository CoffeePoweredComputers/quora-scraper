            "answer_text": "Are you trying to ask if studying in IB Board helps in cracking SAT? The answer for the above question is \u2018Not entirely\u2019. A lot of questions in SAT deals with high school math. Even the verbal section is not entirely what one studies in IB. But studying IB will give an edge in understanding verbal sections better and it also helps in writing the essay better. IB will help the most in SAT subject tests though, especially the Math and the Sciences. IB will also help in cracking AP tests. SAT general test is a different ball game altogether. It is a different type of test and it tests a student\u2019s aptitude to an extent rather than anything concrete in math and verbal. All the best ",
