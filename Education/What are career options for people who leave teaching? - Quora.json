            "answer_text": "My girlfriend was a teacher for 6 years. Loved it, but it wasn't her passion. She was a theater teacher. We moved to NYC and now she's pursuing theater as a career. She works temp jobs in between gigs. She could easily settle into one of her temp jobs and stay long term, but she just doesn't have any desire to. People these days have multiple careers, and there's no reason teachers are any exception. Besides, teachers have a ton of marketable skills: management, organization, communication, arguably client relations (if you think of students as clients). My girlfriend would make a great project manager for my company, but I don't want her to be my co-worker. We live well together, but we make terrible co-workers. ",
