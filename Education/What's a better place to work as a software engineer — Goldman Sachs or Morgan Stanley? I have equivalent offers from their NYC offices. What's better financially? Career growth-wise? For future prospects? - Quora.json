            "answer_text": "Don't work for Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley if you're a software engineer, because these companies' primary missions are not to create software. (1) Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's primary value (i.e. revenue) -generating employees are the bankers and the salesman/traders. Every other department supports these in some way. Not only does Technology/Human Resources directly support them, but even departments like Private Wealth Management could be seen as ancillary businesses that the firm has simply to be competitive in their primary businesses. (This may change as proprietary trading becomes a bigger portion of banks' profits and algorithms continue to eat the world, but it's still largely true for now.) If you're a banker, they will fly you around the world to advise clients, pay for your dinner when you stay late at the office (which is every night!) and have you think about the business strategy issues facing the leaders of the world's most important companies.If you're a young salesperson, they will have you going out to nice restaurants every night to get drinks with important clients, who are generally older, established people that you likely wouldn't meet professionally at a young age in other lines of work.If you're a trader and you have a sick P&L, you can pretty much do or say whatever you want and have the satisfaction of directly measuring your success or failure every day.These are the environments in which everyone ought to aim to be -- where you are a key member of a team and your skills are central to the team's success. These are in the environments in which you learn, grow and develop. If you do work for Goldman or Morgan, you can count on having a \"good job\" and a \"nice life,\" but that might not be enough -- in spite of everything that I learned there, it wasn't enough for me. Your apartment will have many things in it from Ikea. You won't worry any more about buying songs on iTunes or that x you've always wanted. Every time you have a few minutes away from your Blackberry to check your bank account, it's a little bigger. But you won't be building something. You won't be with the rockstars -- and the rockstars are so much more interesting than the overachieving wallflowers! Instead, come to Silicon Valley, Silicon Alley or a comparable place. We'll be trying to build things for quite a while, so there's plenty of work that needs to get done. Some of these things will not work and some people may laugh at you for helping build them -- this is an unavoidable consequence of doing something new and being on the cutting edge. But some of the other things you build, people will use every day. Some of the other things you build, people will talk about in hushed voices over coffee about how much different life is now that x exists. And this change, this growth is your opportunity. You will get the Ikea furniture and all that good stuff eventually, but it won't matter because it's never been about that. If you believe that you can't get a job at one of these companies or have too many responsibilities to start one yourself, first make sure this self-belief is true. Many self-beliefs are not -- have you ever heard your own voice recorded? There are a lot of companies out there. Go talk to a few more. Then, if you still can't find a role or company that's right for you, roll up your sleeves and re-discover your inner rockstar that got you into programming in the first place. Go to a little more school while you train in Emacs to Eye of the Tiger. Live off of savings for a few months while you build something -- just one small app, just one incredibly focused program, just one small thing -- that is functional, beautiful in every way and makes your life a little bit better. Show this to the people you want to hire you and when they see it they will know immediately what you've known all along -- that they are in the presence of a rockstar who is looking for a flock to soar with. --- I say this having just finished a genuinely fulfilling experience at Goldman, which taught me some really important things and introduced me to some high-caliber people.",
