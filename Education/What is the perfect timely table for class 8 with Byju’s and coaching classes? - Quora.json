As you are packed with two different coaching, make sure to bring out some time for your self study because no amount of coaching can make you understand the subjects unless you don\u2019t read and practice yourself.Take out time for good sleep and proper food. Also give yourself short relaxation breaks. Don\u2019t over burden yourself.",

Why do you have both coaching classes and byjus subscription? Waste of money and time and effort If you ask me If this is a parent asking, then I would recommend you not to put too much pressure on your child. My guess is you are preparing your child for jee/neet. If this a student, then instead of asking this, make your own timetable and make sure not to study a lot because this time will not come again and you might regret it later that you didn't enjoy your life during this time.
