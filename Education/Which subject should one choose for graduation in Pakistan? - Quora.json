            "answer_text": "The best advice that i can offer regarding your career and what you should study is Follow your passion. I know you have heard this a million times in your life but believe me, if you want to excel in your life and career then please study something that makes you excited. You can make a good career out of any degree if you are willing to work with dedication. That being said, some good degrees that you should consider are as following Engineering (engineering is always a good career in a developing country such as Pakistan)Doctor (requires hardwork but well worth it)IT specialist (very lucrative career options)Lawyer ( a good lawyer not the bulk you find sitting outside courts)Chartered Accountant ( very very tough but one of the best paying jobs)These are the few i can recall from top of my head but there are many many more. Try to find something that you are passionate about and you would automatically see yourself excelling in that field. Cheers. ",
