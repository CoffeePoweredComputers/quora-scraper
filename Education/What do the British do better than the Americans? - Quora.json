            "answer_text": "Words.  There are brilliant American speakers and writers, but our culture doesn't swim in language the way British culture does. I've lived in New York and London, and one thing that impressed me about the latter is how all classes of people there are good with words. Not all people of all classes of course, but the general verbal ability of average Britons far exceeds that of their American cousins.  I'm not sure why this is, because England is a much more (overtly) class-based country than America. But while here, in NYC, I can often predict that a college-educated guy will be more verbally skilled than a working-class guy who dropped out of high school, I can't make the same assumption in England. The cockney lorry driver, who never finished school, may do the crossword every day and be able to verbally fence with me and win.  There are some American working-class groups who excel with their own vernaculars, such as inner-city African Americans (thanks partially to the influence of rap), but many Americans are terrible with words. Our culture is more based around images and actions than talking and writing.  Americans often wonder why so many plum roles in Hollywood movies and popular TV shows get cast with British actors, even when the characters they're playing are Americans. As someone who has worked with actors for 30 years, I can explain it. You have to be good with words to be an actor in America, more so now than in the past. Networks like HBO and AMC have primed audiences for verbosity, and British actors are, on average, better at delivering those goods than Americans actors.  Plenty of Brits complain about the decline of language skills in their country. There's some truth to this and a lot of snobbery. Regardless, they're still miles ahead of us. ",
