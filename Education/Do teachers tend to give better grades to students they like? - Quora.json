I assign them the grades they have earned. Law schools in the US use a procedure called blind grading to ensure that students are graded on the quality of the work they produce, without having to worry that their grade can be affected by how well the teacher likes them. Every semester at final exam time, the student is assigned a Blind Grading Number by the law school\u2019s administrative offices. The student signs their final exam with the blind grading number, so the professor has no way of knowing whose exam they\u2019re grading. The professor assigns letter grades on the basis of the blind grading number, turns those grades in to the office, and does not find out who the blind grading numbers belong to until after the final grades have been submitted. Several years ago, a colleague told me a story about something that happened at her law school during the Civil Rights Era. The law school, which will remain nameless, was located in the Deep South. This law school had adopted blind grading largely in response to the concerns of African-American and female students who were concerned that the faculty might be prejudiced against them. The year after the law school adopted blind grading, they conducted a study to see whether blind grading had made any difference. Did the change from traditional grading to a blind grading system have any impact on the grades earned by African-American students? Turns out, it didn\u2019t. Their grades remained the same.Did the change to a blind grading system have any impact on the grades earned by female students? Turns out, it didn\u2019t. Their grades remained the same.But there was one group of students whose grades were impacted by the switch to blind grading. Yankees. The grades of students who had been born north of the Mason-Dixon line improved markedly.",

            "answer_text": "They still have to do the work, to demonstrate the knowledge and skills that the standards require, at the A B C or F level. I taught electives in middle school for two years and high school for two years, youngest aged ten and oldest twenty. If a kid was borderline on a grade overall, I would encourage them to look for missing, unfinished or unpolished work and resubmit it. This I allowed for all students, whether I liked them or not. I told them all throughout the course that it was harder to fail my class than to pass it, and that I knew in the first two weeks that every one of them could get a C or B if they showed up and did the work to show their understanding. Nevertheless, many students did not pass. The most important reason was absence, which was chronic in my school (normally defined as absent for 10% or more of the school days). The sad part was when a kid who was borderline skipped school towards the end of a semester and did not do the latest work and did not have the opportunity to do catch up. I didn\u2019t worry if they had a C, but it did concern me when capable kids did not do the last minute dash to get from F to C and get the half credit for the semester. By that point it was either laziness or a feeling that they could not succeed, and that in turn was driven by poor attendance. If I was a superintendent or principal, I would focus on attendance first, by reintroducing daily homeroom, so that the pattern of attendance and morale was apparent. Churches have discovered that the more people attend, the more they contribute to collections. That\u2019s probably true for school too; the more they attend, the more they subscribe to learning. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes yes, but generally because the students teachers tend to like best are the ones can see are genuinely making an effort and doing their very, very best. Even then, they won\u2019t be bumping a C up to an A. They just might bump a grade that is nearly a B up to a B because they know that that student has put in a hell of a lot more time and effort then the student that breezed their way to an A. So yes, they\u2019ll give better grades to students they like (the ones who are genuinely doing their best) and even then - it\u2019d only be when they\u2019re very close to the grade boundary. ",

I would actually turn your question around and say that students that teachers like tend to earn better grades. And while we try to like all students equally, it is a reality that I am going to have less connection with a kid who spends their time with me fighting what I am trying to get done or adversely affecting the learning of their peers. Certainly it is almost all teacher\u2019s goal to evaluate our students solely on the work that they submit. ",

While perhaps SOME would ignore the standards to give higher grades to students they like more than others, I think MOST try and succeed at being objective. It is the most fair, and in the long run, better for all students. It is pointless to give students higher grades simply because they\u2019re liked better than others if the former don\u2019t demonstrate that they know the material. ",
