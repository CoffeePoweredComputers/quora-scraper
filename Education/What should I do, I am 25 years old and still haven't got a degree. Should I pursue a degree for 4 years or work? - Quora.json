            "answer_text": "If you don't know why you want a specific degree yet, perhaps getting all of the general requirements finished at a community college while you work is an option? We don't have enough information about you to really give specific advice. A degree can be great for many older students. You are not even \u201colder\" yet. Are you single with no kids and no debt? Are you married, the sole adult working and parent to multiple kids? Debt or other obligations is a big factor. Do you have any college courses completed or will it all be new to you after being out of high school for 5 or 6 years? I don't advocate getting a general sort of liberal arts degree just to say that you have one. People can end up with huge student loans and nothing practical to show for it. I do believe that for people who don't want to learned a skilled trade that a college education can improve lifetime earning potential if one gets the correct degree. Think about what career you want and get the knowledge and any skills necessary to pursue that path when choosing a degree program. ",
