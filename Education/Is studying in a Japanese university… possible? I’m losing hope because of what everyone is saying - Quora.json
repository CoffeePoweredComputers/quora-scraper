            "answer_text": "Hi Daniel I don\u2019t know what would it make impossible ? if it\u2019s money that you\u2019re referring to, then I have to tell you that there are many ways to get a scholarship from different organisations. Some of them you can apply for before travelling to Japan like the one provided from the Japanese government, ministry of education better known as MEXT. Even at the your Japanese university there is always a section that is responsible for providing financial support for the students ( ofcourse their scholarship are not as big as MEXT or other organisations that you may apply for after getting enrolled). if it\u2019s the major, Japan has lots of universities and each university is famous for something, for example Waseda university where I am teaching now, is famous for political science, giving the fact that many politicians have graduated from it. Nagoya university is well known for engineering, etc. if it\u2019s the language barrier, There are many courses now that are held in English and no Japanese is required to be enrolled, even the entrance exam is in English. Plus there are Japanese courses that are offered for free once you get enrolled at the university ( it depends on the university though , some universities offer it for free while it\u2019s not at others). I myself have been a student at Japanese universities for a very long time :) I hope this answers your question. Good luck :) ",
