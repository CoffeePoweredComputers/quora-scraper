            "answer_text": "lol, I had the chance to do this, but it was past the deadline so I didn\u2019t make it. I can tell you some of my classmates are unoriginal or just. . . showcasing the spirit of procrastination. 11:59 pm. Sent senior quote!11:59. . . (Okay. I admit I don\u2019t remember all of the 11:59/last-minute senior quotes, but 1/10 of the quotes must of have been about the midnight deadline.)Quotes referencing twins. (Funny, yes, at first. But once you\u2019ve seen one, it doesn\u2019t get funnier.)I\u2019ll take my senior picture later. (Said by someone who doesn\u2019t have their senior pictures taken, lmao.)Now let\u2019s get down to business. Here\u2019s what I would have picked if I wanted to be. . . Pretentious: veni vidi vici (Admit it. There\u2019s nothing like using dead Latin to be pretentious. Same goes for quotes in Latin. Or Shakespearean English.)^Any latin quoteAny quote from All the Places You\u2019ll Go by Dr. Seuss. (Probably borderline cliche at this point.)Hip/Internet Acronyms: ur MCM\u2019s my bae. <3 <3 <3 (No. . . I don\u2019t even want to know or puzzle out your message. In ten years, I doubt you\u2019ll remember what it even means.)Religious: Ruth 1:16-17 (Yes, I picked my favorite quote from the Bible. Don\u2019t shoot me.)Bookish: (\u2018cuse me. I need to go and pull out my old Narnia books. This will take a while. . . Hmm. . . Can\u2019t find them. But quotes come out from those books.)Only My Friends Know What I\u2019m Talking About: Mmmm. . . Chocolate + Textbook + Math = Love + Keys. (Yes. . . I made this up. But I\u2019m pretty sure I could reference something stupid me and my friends did.)Scarred by High School: We lived! We survived! (Yes. There is always one person.)Musical: (Not in the way you think.) High school without the musical. (Must be every year since that movie came out. . . Or maybe it\u2019s just me.)But the high school quote is whatever you want it to be. It\u2019s an expression of yourself and shows a hint of who you are. The photo itself can\u2019t do that. Just make sure to keep it appropriate and remember. . . Whatever you say in the yearbook can\u2019t be erased or unmade. ",
