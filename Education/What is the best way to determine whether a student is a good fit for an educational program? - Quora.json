            "answer_text": "You asked, \u201cWhat is the best way to determine whether a student is a good fit for an educational program?\u201d The most simple and straightforward answer is \u201cPassion.\u201d Does the student have passion for the subject? If the student does not meet the criteria with regard to \u201crequired math classes\u201d or \u201can appropriate predetermined vocabulary,\u201d s/he could still be an excellent fit for the program. That is, there could be things that limited the student that were beyond his or her control. You know, the school did not offer Calculus and that\u2019s why the student did not have it. The student might speak a different language in the home and that is why the vocabulary is limited. But does the student have passion for the subject? Too many allow silly little things that can be overcome to get in the way and too many fail to see the power of passion. Too many students focus on meeting the minimum criteria and fail to become passionate about the subject. Let me give to you a recent example that happened to me. I met a young lady who told me that she wanted to become a Physical Therapist and that she was doing the things that she had to do during her undergraduate years to be able to get into PT school. She went on to tell me that she had to have a minimum of 80 hours of observation to be considered by the school. She did not sound passionate about it either. I asked her why she wanted to be a PT and she said that the money was good, the hours were good and it seemed like an easy job. I suggested to her that she shoot for 1000 hours of meaningful observation since she would be competing against many others who were passionate about being a PT. My comment horrified her and she went on to tell me that she had a check list of things, minimum things that she needed to do to get in the program. She might meet the minimum requirements and some pencil-neck might pick her over the candidate who is passionate but lacked a math class that was not available. If you take a look at those whom we celebrate for their real accomplishments, you will find that they had passion, a driving purpose, and they did not allow things to get in their way. I will take the passionate person any day over the person with a minimum checklist. I am Allen Morris and I approve of this first draft complete with all of its errors and typos. I will not invest my most precious time polishing it when that would not make it all that much better. No, I will invest my time on future projects. I suggest that you do the same. Finish it, and be done with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I think George Tam's answer to What is the best way to determine whether a student is a good fit for an educational program? nails it. I\u2019ll add that as people get older, the responsibility shifts, and it becomes a team effort. The student should also be assessing how the program is working and actively participate. It\u2019s good to note yourself what works and what doesn\u2019t. A caution, however, is that you have to be open to try new approaches. Often, what \u201cworks\u201d for a student in high school doesn\u2019t work so well in college, and again graduate school and/or the working world. As you advance, you are expected to dive deeper and make connections yourself, to apply things you learn to other situations besides the ones you saw in class. Experiment! I notice many students come to college and are frustrated that they can\u2019t read technical material straight through from front to back one time and then succeed. Here\u2019s the thing: no one expects that to work! It\u2019s not a linear process. You read things and engage them, try to figure out what\u2019s going on. Skip parts if some work doesn\u2019t pay off, but come back to them later \u2014 often later material will provide context that helps you understand earlier material. Expect to read technical stuff several times \u2014 it\u2019s normal! As an author, you don\u2019t expect everyone to get everything the first time, but different individuals will get different things on the first pass. So, you make a good table of contents and put in cross references to help people skip around and go back to earlier topics. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to put something down and take a break. The human brain can process things in the background, and often a fresh look a while later or the next day will reveal things you couldn\u2019t see before. Naturally, this doesn\u2019t work if you wait until the last minute. One last item: you have to feel comfortable and welcome in the program. As George Tam says, a supportive environment is very important. What that means for you might be different from what it means for others. ",
