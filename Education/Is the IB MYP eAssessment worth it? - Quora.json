            "answer_text": "Yes. MYP e-Assessment is worth to prepare and attempt as this assessment seeks holistic development of a student. The main aim of IB (International Baccalaureate) education is to develop international mindedness amongst student by inculcating various learner profile attributes and the necessary skills. Formal recognition of achievement for MYP 5 (Grade 10) students is provided by the IB via e-Assessment. MYP e-assessments are criteria based and they focus on student\u2019s understanding and how one can apply his/her knowledge to interpret and analyse the given situations. e-Assessment comprises three strategies for assessing what students know and are able to do:  \u2022 ePortfolios: Certain subjects like language acquisition, arts, design and physical and health education offers e-portfolios. Students need to complete the prescribed tasks based on the Global Context and submit it in the form of a report as a portfolio. \u2022 On-screen examinations: The subjects like language and literature, individuals and societies, sciences, mathematics, and interdisciplinary learning offers on-screen examinations. For each subject, they are supposed to complete the assessment in 2 hours of time. \u2022 Personal Project (PP): This is very important element of MYP. PP is a student-centred and age-appropriate extended project in which students consolidate their learning throughout the Programme. While other e-Assessments are optional for schools, all MYP year 5 students must take part in personal project e-Assessment.  In a nutshell, e-Assessment contributes for a student\u2019s overall development through different strategies of assessments. ",
