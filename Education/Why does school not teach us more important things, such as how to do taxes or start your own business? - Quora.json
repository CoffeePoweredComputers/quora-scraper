            "answer_text": "Schools generally teach general skills, like reading, writing, psychology, economics, history. These are skills that most people will need in most of their lives. Starting a business is a very specific skill. Most people will not need to know this. It also requires the basic skills of reading, writing, psychology. Which class do you want to drop to make room for your class in entrepreneurship. That is the standard answer for the usual question of adding a new class to a school. As a college business instructor, who actually teaches students how to start and run a business, I will go further. Entrepreneurship requires already knowing an entire raft of skills \u2013 marketing, finance, Organizational behavior \u2013 which high school students have not had, and have not had time to learn. Furthermore, starting a business requires a mindset which most high school students Do Not Have. ",

            "answer_text": "School does teach important things, but like most people you think that there is something else that is \u201cmore\u201d important. Personally, I think that a students should know how to read, write and do math at grade level. This is what I think is important. But maybe I am wrong. Perhaps, we should teach kids how to do taxes when they still cannot read. Do you see that this is one of educations major problems. There are major disagreements on what education should be doing. So now education is trying to do everything and they are doing almost none of it well. Students in general are having difficulty in ELA and Math. ",
