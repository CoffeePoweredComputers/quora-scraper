            "answer_text": "Drug education in schools is meant to inform youth the bad side and consequences of using different drugs. The goals of these programs are to show you the physical/medical effects of drug usage with the intent to prevent more youth from succumbing to drug use due to peer pressure. As noble and ambitious as some of these programs are they don\u2019t always work. Drug education in an academic sense can refer to the study of specific prescription drugs that you can only otherwise learn about the nuances of in Pharmacy school. Any sort of education beyond those two would involve learning the intricacies of narcotics trafficking from the source to the user and every stop in the middle. The study of this whole thing itself is a wild journey that involves a wide variety of sources, documents, documentaries, books, etc. I cannot confirm or deny whether colleges offer a course on drug trafficking specifically, but in my experience it has been a topic that political science majors pursue by studying a the varying aspects of the trade with an emphasis on policy decisions and effects.
