Otherwise, you can write a short note explaining why they are absent and when they will be absent with your signature at the bottom. Another alternative is to call the school to excuse an absence. As long as you're on the emergency contact card from the school, you can pull your child from classes whenever you'd like without it counting against your child's grades. This is one condition of an excused absence. ",

Each day at school is important and not being there can make the child feel an outsider to the group when they return. In answer to your query, explain WHY your child can not attend. Legitimate reasons are always acceptable. Perhaps add that you realise this is not what you want but circumstances make it unavoidable. Hope this helps, Paul ",
