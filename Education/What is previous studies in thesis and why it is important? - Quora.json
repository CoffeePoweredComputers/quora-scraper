            "answer_text": "When you embark upon research in a particular field you would anticipate other research organisations and universities too would be working on similar research problems. In order not to repeat someone else\u2019s research and to ensure that your work is ahead of others, you have go through all the available literature in the area of your investigation.This should be given as introduction or as previous studies in your thesis for the sake of completeness to explain the importance of your work. These days such a literature search is easy. All institutions engaged in post graduate and PhD programs are wifi enabled and have access to all member libraries in the world. Students using their ID and password can access the journals which publish research articles in your field. It may be of interest to know that the online facilities now available, did not exist during 70s when I was a student. At IISc library we had a practise of displaying all the latest periodicals on Friday at 11 am and all research students and professors would flock to the library\u2019s new periodicals section. The English translations of Russian Journals (called Doklady) were also available. The German journals would have abstract in English and if pertained to our work we would have it translated from the foreign language section. Later in 80s when I worked in industry research the literature search techniques improved. There were no computers yet in India Neither internet nor fax but only telex ( The new generation may not even be familiar with a telex machines) It had a dialling system like a telephone but connected to a typewriter like system on which one could type and the matter would get typed on the other party\u2019s telex machine to whom you have dialled. And if he typed his reply it would get typed on your machine. Those days there were private players who would offer literature search system on telex. Once subscribed, we would be given a telex number, upon dialling we would be connected to scientific data bases. It would be a two-way interaction. We would type a search word and it would display names of a few journals as a sample. We could use Boolean logic to type multiple words to describe our requirement more precisely. If OK we would ask for an offline print to be mailed to our address. This may have been expensive but companies serious about R and D would engage such services. Now one can imagine how difficult scientific research was during the time of CV Raman with everything going on snail mail. ",

            "answer_text": "If I read you correctly, you are asking why is it important to use previous research studies presented in thesis. These are published theses of previous research that are usually kept in the library in hard and also in soft copies (on-line) at the institution in which the author completed his/her graduate research. These theses have already been examined and the authors have already been awarded their degrees. These are kept as reference literature for interested parties, such as other researchers, scholars, research students and interested parties to use for the latters' research work. Why are they useful references? This can be best illustrated with an example. If you are researching for your Master\u2019s or PhD on an area in the subject of, say Service Management, which is a broad subject. Therefore, you, as a researcher to come after previous researchers, would want to review previous work and also the latest research work done, to see what had already been done on the subject, what are still to be done. That is why researchers often recommend to up and coming researchers to conduct research on the areas they had not done due to limited time and resources, but are deemed important to be done, and thus, to be studied by others. This is to ensure that the gaps in research on the subject are better filled, and a more complete picture on the given subject are made available. But the question is, why a need to go to the original work in a thesis? Can't this be gleaned from literature published in scholarly journals on the subject? The answer is yes, it can be, but a research journal\u2019s article on the subject is at best a short 4000 odd words summary of the research, and a greater details on how the particular research done on the subject are missing. These include the background which prompted the study, the researcher's philosophy, the framing of the research questions, the positing of hypotheses, justifications for the research methodology (sampling and analysis and so on) used, the types of formats in which the data are presented and the way key findings are discussed. These are all valuable insights presented in details for other researchers to glean and from which to learn, which can help with the writing of their own theses. I think that is what previous studies in thesis may mean. ",
