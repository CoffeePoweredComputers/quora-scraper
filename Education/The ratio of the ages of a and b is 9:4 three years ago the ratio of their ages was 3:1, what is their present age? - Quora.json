            "answer_text": "We will not follow any long method, the approach which i am putting in front of you guys let you do it orally. Given ratios: 9:4 & 3:1 Multiply 9:4 with difference of 3 and 1 ie 2 & Multiply 3:1 with difference of 9 and 4 ie 5. [math]{9:4}\u00d72 =\u300b18:8[/math] [math]{3:1}\u00d75 =\u300b15:5[/math] Now, difference of 18 and 15 or 8 and 5 is 3. Take 3R= no of years ago 3R=3=\u300bR=1 Present ages : 18R and 8R ie 18\u00d71 and 8\u00d71 ie 18 and 8 ",
