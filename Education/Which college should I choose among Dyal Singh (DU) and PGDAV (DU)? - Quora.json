As long as you are looking to join course in commerce, join Dyal Singh College. Commerce department of the college is quite good. Department organises seminars and workshops on regular basis for soft skills development and awareness programmes about future academics. Fests organized are also good.Placement cell is also very active. It provides a lot of opportunities for the internships and job placements. Big 4\u2019s like KPMG and E&Y come to recruit students and 30\u201340 students are hired by each. For reference I am sharing Facebook page link Log In or Sign Up to ViewTeachers faculty of the college is very competent with good experience.Infrastructure of the college is better than 90% of all the colleges in DU. it includes big library, spacious classrooms, big grounds with basketball courts etc.One of my friend was in PGDAV and he told me that there college didn't provide them the opportunity for placements in Big 4.
