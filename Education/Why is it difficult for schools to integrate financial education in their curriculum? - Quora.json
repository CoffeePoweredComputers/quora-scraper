            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not difficult for schools to integrate anything into their curricula, however, there are only so many hours in a day (6 at school) and so many topics to cover. Thus, curricula are designed around what the society thinks is most important at the time. As Robert Pattison says, students do learn maths, some of which is related to financial management. If you want to learn financial management, it would be available at post-secondary level in Vocational Education colleges as part of courses in accounting. ",

            "answer_text": "Here in South Australia we have a math stream that does just that. It isn't perfect but it exposes students to taxes, loans, interest, mortgages, annuities and the share market. I got the Australian Taxation Office to send an officer to the school to talk to my classes and they pay a bonus to the school for doing so. The exercise of doing some compound interest calculations and buying and selling shares is popular. Try it. ",
