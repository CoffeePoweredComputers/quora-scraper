            "answer_text": "There is no one set of uniform rules that decide how much students are in charge. Some jr highs have absolutely no school-sponsored activities. All extracurricular sports, all art, all computers, etc., are organized and run by people, often PTA zealots, not part of the school faculty. In these cases, generally speaking, the adults run the whole show. Practice times, exhibition schedules, every last itinerary detail is hammered out by the adults. (These details are decided with J standards and procedures; everyone has a chance to put their two yen in, and then the \u201cexecutive committee\u201d down a plan that supposedly takes all concerns into account.) Other jr high groups are officially sponsored by the school. There are almost always parent support groups, band boosters, and so forth. But one or more faculty members are nominally in charge; the buck stops with them. Sometimes the political push and pull among adults makes for fascinating insights into J social interactions, but the usual non-confrontational rules apply. There is no good way to translate \u201cin your face\u201d into Japanese. (Please offer your ideas if you can think of a good substitute.) High school is a bit of a different game. Most HSs have a mix of school-sponsored and independently offered activities. Some students choose their HS based on whether the soccer team or school band is independently run or not. As a rule, older students are given more autonomy in their groups. HS advisers are often little more than rubber stamps for student decisions and arbiters for disputes among students. The notable exception is with successful sports teams, especially HS baseball. These programs are often successful because they are strictly controlled by a central core group of adults, usually with the head coach firmly enthroned as leader. HS students usually have little to say in these groups; competition for membership is so fierce that it rarely occurs to the students that they might have a say in their own teams\u2019 decisions. I'm not intimately familiar with extracurricular group dynamics after HS, but I strongly suspect more of the same trends. If a group is sponsored by a university, the faculty adviser(s) will probably be even less \u201chands on\u201d than HS groups. Purely student-run groups are just what the name implies: full autonomy by the students. There are some very long traditions with college festivals that suggest histories as colorful as Yale\u2019s Skull and Bones, but even these student-run groups need campus resources for planning meetings and storage of costumes, etc. If you happen to be in Sapporo during early fall, I recommend the student nonsense surrounding the Hokkaid\u014d University Festival. Good music, exotic carnival food, and crazy costumes all add up to a weekend of great fun. There is precious little faculty involvement, AFAIK. ",

            "answer_text": "From what I saw from the Culture Club I partook in, the students were largely in charge. We were the ones buying supplies (getting a refund from the school), arranging meets, and leading mentioned meets. Now I wasn\u2019t the upper echelon of the club, so other than being told where to go at what time, and how to do things once there, I didn\u2019t contribute too much. I did get the impression that some kind of adult supervision worked in the background, though. I don\u2019t know if this was their sole job (in retrospect it probably wasn\u2019t), but an amount of us (not me) were underage at the time, so obviously there would have to be someone at the very least making sure we didn\u2019t act outside our bounds as representatives from the school (a University, btw, which makes me a bit uncertain about high schools). There were talk about some documentation and somesuch needing to be handed in to someone, and we did have a teacher inviting us to a takoyaki party(the godgiven gift to mankind), but whether he was doing it as a teacher or the teacher in charge of our lot I cannot say. But other than some administrative head to keep us overall organised, most things were done by us, yes. ",
