            "answer_text": "I\u2019d strongly suggest you to not leave gmc Bhopal if you happen to get it. Aiims nagpur just became functional last year it\u2019s still new still raw theres just one Batch in there and i think it will take a year or two to completely make into the mainstream aiims out there. Gmc bhopal has been there since ages you\u2019ll be more exposed to the real world in there and i agree that the infrastructure of the new aiims is good and also its a central institute, still bhopal is one the most prestigious and best colleges of central India with a firm established infrastructure. More seniors + more experienced professors + ever increasing patient inflow from all across the state and even from outside. So yep basically just go for Bhopal. Had the question been asked 2\u20133 years down the line my answer would be different. Cheers have a good one let me know what did you get! ",
