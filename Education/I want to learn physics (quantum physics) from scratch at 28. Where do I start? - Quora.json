            "answer_text": "The first thing to do is to spark your interest in quantum physics beyond just a simple liking in it. Make yourself fall in love quantum physics. There is a Youtube Channel called Vsauce, it is owned by a guy who does some good and funny explanations on several topics related to physics, such as: \"What is it like falling into a black hole?\", \"Can we travel faster than the speed of light?\" and stuff like that. It's about how theoretical physics and quantum physics are studied and comprehended.Once you get a good grasp on the fundamental concepts of quantum physics that Michael Stevens (creator of Vsauce) explains so thoroughly, dive into subatomic particles. Quarks, hadrons, baryons, bradyons, luxons, tau neutrinos, gauge bosons, learn them all! They are all so funny and interesting. After that, I would recommend getting a little bit more serious and buying some books on how quantum physics work. Stephen Hawking's \"A brief history of time\" is intended to be read by the average, non-physicist human. Of such, Hawking explains several key concepts of quantum physics in a manner that even the dumbest creature with a brain could understand, let alone us humans. Also, David J. Griffiths' \"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics\" is a very good book, but requires a stable background on calculus, mathematics and basic classical physics knowledge. So before diving into it, refresh your mathematical skills first. After you grasp the basics, then it's all a matter of preference. Buy whatever book you can that contains info about quantum physics, break it down little by little every day and absorb it. It may seem hard at first, because rather than being hard (which is not at all), it's more about being tiring and voluminous. It needs math, deriving formulas, hypothesizing and a lot of logic. There is so much to learn, and that's the best part about it! Just remember that the best things in life are initially hard to obtain, but quite rewarding at the end ;) ",

            "answer_text": "At the very beginning, by acquainting yourself with the pre-requisite mathematical and physics topics that you\u2019ll need to remotely have a chance of understanding it. Start with elementary mathematics texts. If you can master high-school level mathematics that\u2019s a good start. really, you\u2019ll want to have a firm understanding of the fields of elementary algebra, calculus, differential equations, complex analysis. At this point you could begin to read actual introductory textbooks on quantum mechanics. I stress that to really get anywhere with a technical understanding of the subject you should really be mostly reading text books and not popular science texts. Popular science texts are fun and interesting and they will no doubt help foster your interest and provide a backdrop to your formal learning, so in that sense they\u2019r harmless, but they tend to be highly superficial: focus on textbooks if you actually want to make progress. The most effective route possible is to obtain a position at a university/college and study the subject gradually over a period of years. It takes years and years of hard work and study in order to even begin to understand quantum mechanics. It\u2019s a serious undertaking, but if you have a great love for the subject, then your journey will be intensely enjoyable! Fortunately, in today\u2019s world there are plentiful online resources and courses available freely to you with which you can begin approaching the subject. It\u2019s going to be tough, but fun, Good luck! ",
