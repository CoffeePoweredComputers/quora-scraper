            "answer_text": "A lot of responsibilities come up. The key to studying after 21 is chunking. Just study a little bit everyday even if you are in destitute. Given the current environment around us, you will NEED to put in the grind if you are of a good age\u2026 Another thing is that people become more self-aware and so they do not like to do things which they don\u2019t love. If you are doing everything to get to work but still not able to put in the required work, maybe that field is not for you and stop putting in unnecessary effort and find something you might love\u2026. Let me give you my example. I am a CSE student. When I passed my 12th, I went on to study Python for days on end without taking breaks. I was highly passionate at that time. However, if I try to simulate that now, at 21 years of age, it is highly unlikely that it would happen. Because I have now discovered that this is not the field I like to be in and plus, I have more knowledge about the field so spending time on JUST coding seems insignificant to me. So, no matter how hard I try, I won\u2019t be able to study more than 3\u20134 hours\u2026That might sound a lot of hours to you but let me tell you that I studied whole day in the school time. So, technically, my hours have decreased. If I were passionate enough, I have the potential to study 10+ hours with quality focus. So you can see the difference. ",
