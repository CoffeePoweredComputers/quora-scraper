            "answer_text": "One day a customer drove up and told me that another shop was replacing the timing chain on his 302 V8 Ford pickup truck. \u201cOkay, I think to myself, what\u2019s this got to do with me?\u201d Then he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the guy knows what he\u2019s doing\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s had the truck for two weeks and it\u2019s still not fixed, so if I tow it here could you fix it?\u201d \u201cSure, a 302 Ford timing chain is a very common repair\u201d, I said. So, he had the truck towed in and I walked out after the tow truck dropped it and opened the hood. That was the \u201cWhat the hell happened here\u201d moment. The valve covers, intake manifold and the entire front of the engine was completely disassembled. Then he walked around to the bed of the truck and showed me a box full of parts that used to be his engine and some cheese-ball timing gear and chain. \u201cCan you fix it?\u201d, he asked. \u201cSure I can fix it, but why in god\u2019s name were the head bolts removed?\u201d, I asked. He told me the other \u201cmechanic\u201d told him that he \u201cNeeded to take off the cylinder heads to see when the number one piston was at top dead center.\u201d I told him he was lucky that one of the heads didn\u2019t fall off on the way to my shop and then calmed him down and told him I could fix his beloved truck. He just stared at the box full of nuts and bolts and the pile of parts and asked me \u201cDo you know where all this stuff goes?\u201d I told him that if I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be much of a mechanic. So, since the engine was disassembled to this point, I pulled the pan and checked the bearings, replaced the front and rear seals, got a real double roller timing chain and gears and did a valve job, since the heads were already off, and reassembled the engine. I never did find out who the genius mechanic was that was working on his truck, but when he picked it up after I put it all back together again, I recommended that he didn\u2019t take anything to that guy to repair ever again. EDIT: Several of the responses I\u2019ve received believe that the owner was the person that tore the engine apart. He was not. He showed me the receipt where the original \u201cmechanic ?\u201d had received a $200.00 deposit from him to purchase the parts. Cliff, that was the truck owners name, and I became good friends after that, and he was one of the best tile men I\u2019ve ever met. But one thing was certain, he didn\u2019t have a clue about working on an engine, and the only tools he owned were for doing tile work. Super nice guy, excellent tile setter, but not exactly the brightest bulb on the string. He definitely got cheated by the other would be \u201cmechanic\u201d, and to this day, he won\u2019t tell me the guys name. Cliff is just that kind of guy. He will never bad mouth anyone, no matter how bad they are. He lives by the, \u201cIf you can\u2019t say anything nice about someone, then don\u2019t say anything at all rule.\u201d And I, for one, respect him for that. ",

            "answer_text": "I have had so many I don\u2019t even know where to start. I still think that the over all winner had to be a customer that brought his VW in because he couldn\u2019t bleed the brakes. He said he had just replaced all his brake lines, so I didn\u2019t need to look at them, just bleed the brakes for him. This was a massive red flag for me, and as soon as I got his vehicle up on the lift, it was shockingly apparent what his problem was. All his flexible brake lines had been replaced with windshield washer hose, and hose clamps !!! He was furious with me, when I explained why this would not work. He accused me of trying to cheat him, by not bleeding his brakes. I told him, that not only would I not bleed his brakes, but I would turn him for operating a known unsafe vehicle. I don\u2019t know what happened to him, but I never saw him or his VW again, and this was in a fairly small college town, where people do know each other. No doubt he had a PhD in something, but surely it wasn\u2019t in mechanics, or engineering !!! LOL !!! By the way, Law Enforcement here in California doesn\u2019t give a damn about having you report unsafe vehicles. What they want is for you to report any \u201c Smoking \u201c vehicles, so they can fine them for polluting the air !!! Go figure that !!! I mean polluted air will kill you sooner or later, but a vehicle with defective brakes will kill you, and someone else right now !!! The government just doesn\u2019t care, unless there is a dollar sign attached !!! Tim ",
