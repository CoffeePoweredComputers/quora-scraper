Short n sweet introduction Here you choose the first course. From this you may learn, This course includes both PowerPoint videos and Camera videos, in order to make sure that i can deliver the best way of teaching to you. This course includes the easy part, which its good for beginners and the part where its more advanced, and it becomes more difficult, such as level 2 Grammar and vocabulary, then to level 3 and so on. Afterwards you will have to move to course #2 which is on a higher level of education. Its time to learn verbs , and make perfect sentences with no grammar mistakes, so we would like to start with random words, small conversations, until we make sure that we are able to move forward and start making dialog smoothly. English letters/alphabet will help you more to learn, so therefore i have decided to record my videos using both Arabic and English alphabet . You would be able to pronounce the words easily especially at the beginning of the course.

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately there's no shortcuts when it comes to learning Arabic due to the limited learning materials online and different dialects , don't get me wrong there's many free Apps where you can learn some vocabularies and phrases but the problem each one of those Apps teaches you Arabic with only one dialect such as ( Moroccan , Egyptian ) . Not sure how much you know about Arabic language but learning different dialects is almost like learning different languages,unless you are planning to learn the standard Arabic ( almost all Arabs understand it but no one speaks it nowadays , its the TV news and magazine & books language ) . And let say for instance you learned Moroccan Arabic which i don't encourage you to do since most Arabs don't understand it except maybe north african Arabic speakers such as ( Algerians , Tunisians ) you will not be able to communicate with Arabs from Levant ( Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Palestine ) or people from Iraq and the Arabian gulf . So i would suggest you pick a dailect first ( Levantine Arabic would be the best choice since it's clear and easy and most Arabs understand it ) then you need to find a language partner in Website like (i talki ) where you offer teaching your language in exchange for learning Arabic that's would be the easiest free way to do it. The second option is to relocate to one of the countries i mentioned the safest options for now are ( Lebanon and Jordan ) that would cost but it's the most effective way to learn any language . Good luck. ",
