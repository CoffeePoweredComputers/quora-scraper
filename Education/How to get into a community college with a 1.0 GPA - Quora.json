You may need to take some placement tests to see where you need to start in Math and English, but your previous GPA shouldn\u2019t be an issue in most cases. However, you will probably want to figure out why your GPA was so low and address the issues so you don\u2019t continue to get back grades. Almost anyone can get into a community college, but many community colleges will also suspend you for low grades. ",

            "answer_text": "The easiest way is get acceptable standardized test scores. Read the college catalog. Acceptance is usually: be in \u201cX\u201d percentage of the graduating class, get \u201cX\u201d GPA, and/or get \u201cX\u201d score on standardized test. The test can be ACT, SAT, Accuplacer, Compass. The last two are used almost exclusively by US community colleges. It\u2019s a quick computerized test, and it\u2019s possible to study for it. In fact, many community colleges offer free online coaching. They want you to do well. By law, colleges cannot accept US financial aid for students who lack the ability to benefit academically. At community colleges, a 19 ACT score will usually get you admitted unconditionally so that you will not need to take remedial math and English courses. Alternate methods are to start school as a non-degree seeking student (but then you can\u2019t use financial aid; you must pay for class yourself.) Do well in your college classes, transfer to community college. College GPA overrides high school GPA. You have conclusively demonstrated an ability to benefit. If you test well, consider using CLEP to do your work at the Big Three. ",
