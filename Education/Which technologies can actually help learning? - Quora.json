            "answer_text": "I believe it is a really exciting time for learning. There is great technology out there to facilitate learning! Mobile devices are a really great tool to enable learning (iPad, Galaxy tab, etc.) nowadays you can find apps for pretty much any type of knowledge you can think of. This app is a great example of an interactive museum anyone can be excited about:http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Resources/app/Streetmuseum-Londinium/index.htmlIf you don't have access to mobile devices or tablets, content created with traditional eLearning authoring software combined with rich media (videos from youtube, vimeo, photos and graphics from royalty free stock sites like shutterstock and istockphoto) can really deliver powerful learning. In the end, what is important in my opinion is to deliver highly engaging and interactive type of teaching / instruction, one you can relate to. The technology you use can only just enhance that experience, but technology alone will not deliver it! ",
