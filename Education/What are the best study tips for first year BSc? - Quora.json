            "answer_text": "Following are some of the tips given by my teacher which helped me to get a first class in B.Sc. : Quality not Quantity: How many hours you are studying does not matter. What matters is whether you have prepared the topic. It may take 2 hours for you to prepare something while someone might need 4\u20135 hours for that.Understanding Concepts : You need to have a good understanding of the topics. For that you may read various books,follow the lectures of your teacher, or you may watch videos online for that topic and read something online.Quality of Study Materials: This is very important. You have to be aware of what you are reading.Improving English: Many students are from state boards and their English is quite weak. This is the reason of their poor marks despite having sound knowledge of their subjects. Its not that you have to be a Shakespeare; you just have to be able to write simple sentences of your own in English. For improving English, one can read english newspapers,or storybooks, watch english movies,etc and practice speaking with friends. Remember, you should be able to write the answers in your words.Writing Skills: What you do in the whole year,how many hours and books you study- each and everything will be judged by your answer sheet. My advice would be, read 4\u20135 questions and try to write their answers at a time. Then check the answers yourself. You would have a good understanding of your flaws and drawbacks.Time Management: This is the most important part in exams. You may know each and every answer,but you have to write them in that given amount of time. This is a huge problem for many students (including me). The best way to overcome this problem is to take mock tests.Diagrams and Illustrations: These are quite important,especially if you are a biology student. (It depends upon the marks allotted for that question).Specific Answers: During exams,read the question carefully and write specific answers as much as possible , do not exaggerate or repeat. Highlight the \u201ckey words\u201d in the answers. Try to write your anseres point wise.Hope this helps. Thank you for reading. ",
