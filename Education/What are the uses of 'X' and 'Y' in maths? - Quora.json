            "answer_text": "I'm not sure if I'm answering the question you are trying to ask because I don't really understand the question. But here goes ... When we write an equation like [math]y= ax^2 + b[/math] we use the letters a and b to indicate constants, and the letters x and y for variables. It doesn't matter what values we pick for the constants, but once picked they doesn't change as we analyze the equation. But we do talk about variables as taking on lots of different values. We ask things like, \"what value does y have when x is 3?\"  The practice of using letters near the beginning of the alphabet for constants and letters near the end of the alphabet as variables began with (or was at least popularized by) Rene Descartes. This allowed him to write equations like [math]x^2 + y^2 = a^2[/math] This, when plotted on an x-y graph will make a circle with radius a. Descartes is also the guy who came up with the x-y graph system which allowed the world to tie geometry and algebra together. Descartes picked \"x\" for the horizontal axis and \"y\" for the vertical one. And we still use that convention today. ",

            "answer_text": "Short Answer: x comes from a bad Spanish translation of Arabic. Long Answer: The Arab Scholars who invented algebra picked the first letter of their word for \u2018something\u2019 because that\u2019s what\u2019s intuitive: x stands for some number we don\u2019t know. This letter happens to make the \u2018sh\u2019 sound. When the Spanish translated these works years later, they came across this letter but no sound exists in Spanish for \u2018sh\u2019. So they chose tho represent it with the Greek letter \u2018chi\u2019 which makes a \u2018ch\u2019 sound (as in Bach.) Chi looks like an x. So now we\u2019re stuck with x as the standard variable. y comes after x so we use it as the next variable. ",
