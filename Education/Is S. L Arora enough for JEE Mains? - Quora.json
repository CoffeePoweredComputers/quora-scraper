            "answer_text": "There are 2\u20133 different books of S. L. Arora available in the market , having read the theory I can say its good , good illustrations of problems are present but the only drawback is if taken , solved examples are from IIT-JEE/JEE-ADVANCED previous year papers. There different books of SL Arora are available in market , one for theory , another for Numericals problems only and other is for test papers. For JEE-Mains its quite good and but for practice you have to go for other practice packages and many problems-type are outdated.You can try another book ok called Universal Self Scorer for Physics, which I feel its much better for JEE. You can buy it or download it from my answer\u2019s link which I have pasted below. Soham Sil's answer to How can I download universal self scorer for physics in pdf format? You can review it!! Hope this helps!! ",

            "answer_text": "Sl arora is a book that is good for boards level , though it Contains Compeition level questions as well, but they are less in numbers ( around 40% or less are good questions for mains ) . So there is a probabilty That you practice 120 questions from it but mains level questions are less in numbers( being around 40/50 only, so you are still not that prepared for your exam). I have Solved , SL arora in my 11th and trust me,it does not have Conceptual questions as those given in HC Verma and Dc Pandey. You can do HC Verma or Dcp(solved examples and level 1) for mains Thanks ",
