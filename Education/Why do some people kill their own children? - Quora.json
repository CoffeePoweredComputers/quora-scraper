            "answer_text": "Filicide, the act of a parent killing his or her own child is more common than one could imagine. According to Carter Hay, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University, one child is killed by their parent every 3 days in the US. So why does this happen? What\u2019s so broken in today\u2019s society that we fail to protect the innocent child from such a horrific fate. The professionals can talk circles around me about this particular topic and there have been numerous books written about this issue however it is in most cases a record of the event(s) and hypothesis on the cause that's offered. We never hear a headline stating that child services stepped in today to save a child from certain death while in the care of their mother.  This just never happens. I am a single male, divorced, never had children and for what it\u2019s worth here is a hypothetical version of what I see taking place: A woman is born into a family that is dysfunctional on many levels and likely in the lower socio-economic class of society; under privileged, lacking role models and may have been mentally and physically abused by some of those close to her. To survive she learns the ways of the streets and the world early on. People don\u2019t want her for her inherent potential of becoming a great person, just for what she has to offer at the moment. There is no fun in her life, she doesn\u2019t feel loved and hates to look in the mirror for all she sees is a rotten, angry, misunderstood person. The first nice guy that comes along, she sleeps with out of a promise for a better life. She gets pregnant, he leaves or stays, but the child is unexpected, unplanned and unwanted. They try and make the best of it; if he\u2019s still around he strays. It wasn\u2019t his fault that she went and got pregnant. If he is successful in anyway, then he is long gone and she\u2019s is now alone, maybe living with her family that can ill afford to have her there. If her boyfriend stays he\u2019s likely not successful, but he loves her and is sincere, so they try and make a life of it with what little they have.  The baby is born and for the first few months it looks like everything is going to be OK and then everything goes bad, very, very quickly. The bills arrive, never enough diapers, no rest, no peace, no quiet, the good husband or partner starts working late at nights or goes for drinks with the guys; he needs his space. The mother, frustrated, depressed, and hopeless would just like to get out one night with a girlfriend, free of the burden of baby, free of all responsibility for just one night. But she can\u2019t. She\u2019s stuck at home and there is no one to call. Her boyfriend won\u2019t answer his cell phone, she can\u2019t get a sitter, and even if she could, how could she pay? No money, no nothing!  She then decides if she can\u2019t get out once and a while, to be happy, she must make the best of what she has at home. She learns to cook proper meals, paints a room to smarten it up, and takes long walks with the baby to get some exercise and briefly she\u2019s happier with her life. But in the end she is still exhausted and her happiness returns to a meaningless series of strobe-like events that are on as much as they are off, and it numbs her. Now, severe depression sets in, she can\u2019t remember when to wake or rest. The baby gets fed always, for she can\u2019t remember the schedule any longer. She gets dressed for the day, or doesn\u2019t. It makes no difference. The boyfriend is constantly on her about her appearance, the mess in the house, even if it\u2019s spic and span, and he comes and goes like a boarder in his own home. She looks to the calendar one day and sees that it\u2019s May; she thought it was March, angered she rips it from the wall and screams. Falling to her knees, baby crying, she looks around hoping that someone is watching and will come to rescue her, but no one is there. She\u2019s alone, except for the crying, the constant crying.  She composes herself and gets up from the floor and goes to the crib. Her baby stops crying at the sight of her and she reaches in and picks him up. She starts to cry as she holds him tight and rocks him gently back and forth in her arms. Then suddenly her tears stop and then silence all around her. There is a slow, dull ringing in her head as her mind starts disconnecting from her body. The baby becomes doll-like, lifeless and time has passed but she no longer knows how much time. She can\u2019t account for her actions from when she entered the room\u2026 she puts the doll back into the crib and walks to the kitchen. Picking up the phone, she calls the only number that will answer\u2026 \u201cThis is 9-1-1, what is your emergency?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Why would anyone choose to kill their own child? \u201cKill their own child\u201d=infanticide. The link you attached regards abortion laws in Brazil. Therefore your question is seriously misleading. Abortion is today\u2019s most common method for disposing of unwanted pregnancies. Getting rid of unwanted pregnancies is an issue as old as humanity. The easiest method, and historically perhaps the most common, is to allow the fetus to come full term. After\u2014or during\u2014birth, the unwanted infant is disposed of. Today, that is labeled infanticide and considered a crime. Infanticide vs Abortion Infanticide is the crime of killing a child within a year of its birth, or the person who kills a child, especially their own child. The woman in the article did not kill a child after its birth. Nor did she wish to. She wished to prevent the birth of a child before the fetus in her womb grew into a child. This is called abortion. Abortion the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy. If you read the article you linked to your question, you will understand that this woman needed an abortion for personal reasons; she is not going to publish it for the world to know. However, she makes it very obvious that the well-being of her existing family was at stake. Unfortunately, some people choose not to look closely at what happens to women and their unwanted babies after birth. These same people also choose not to see the difference between a fetus and a full-term baby. This chosen ignorance has cost bloodshed of adult humans, of people who were willing to risk their reputations and even their lives to help the helpless. QUESTION: If it is wrong to abort a bit of human tissue that could potentially grow into a human adult, how is it right to kill full-grown and well-educated human adults? Why not take care of the human lives that have already been born? That makes for much less violence and grief on so many levels. ",
