            "answer_text": "That\u2019s because games are fun and easy, they\u2019re designed to be that way and only the ones that successfully do that are able to sell and become popular. Take some game design courses, they\u2019re literally made to be just difficult enough to be rewarding and easy enough to make you feel like you\u2019re the king of the world. Playing games isn\u2019t hard, they pander to your every needs. Studying (and school in general) is designed to be incredibly difficult, it\u2019s designed to filter out the people that wouldn\u2019t be good at their profession. Consider this, someone plays a game, has fun, doesn\u2019t win a lot but still enjoys it, his winning or losing doesn\u2019t impact a whole lot of people. Ten years from now you wouldn\u2019t mind playing games with them right? On the other hand, someone studies to be an engineer but is failing some classes and only barely graduates. Ten years from now, do you want that person to have engineered the car you\u2019re driving or the plane you\u2019re flying on?  When it doesn\u2019t matter how well you do, then it\u2019s easy. I bet your mentality about games would change if you had to be a professional gamer and win all of your games. Imagine if you must get a perfect score or your must win on your game and if you couldn\u2019t do it, you must keep replaying that level or that character until you got it. I imagine games would be a lot less fun. There\u2019s a reason why South Koreans are on every leader board and are insanely good, they\u2019ve combined their insane-study mentality to their gaming as well. Studying would be fun too if you didn\u2019t have to get good grades, you could just read about stuff like \u201cHow to make $1,000 in a day\u201d instead of \u201cThe chemical bonds of hydrogen and it\u2019s reactivity\u201d. If school was easy, everyone would become doctors, engineers, and lawyers no problem, school must be hard for it to be worth anything. Things are hard when you are forced to become good at it, I\u2019m sure studying isn\u2019t hard in pre-school or kindergarten, it only really becomes difficult in high school and beyond. In essence, this is what Seth Godin coined as The Dip. If you haven\u2019t read his book then read it, I swear it will change your life, it changed mine.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because you have a weak mindset. Now don't get mad, it's true, but you can change it! This is coming from the person laying on bed instead of doing a project. So I know how it feels, but do you know what? I know how it feels to get up and go do it anyways. You let yourself give up too quickly. Lacking that discipline to stay long enough. With really anything in life there is a comfort threshold that always makes people feel weak. I teach swimming, and I teach my students about the threshold when we are holding our breath. There is a little discomfort, but you soon realize that it really isn't that bad. You just have to push yourself a little to get past that threshold. Even videogames are a lie to your brain. You keep telling yourself that they are better. Well they don't have to be, you can make your mind enjoy something else with practice. Granted games are a good way to decompress. Start playing some hard modes or dark souls, and you will quickly realize that games are just like anything else. Conversely you can do the opposite of work. You are making it seem like a dark souls level work, when in reality it more than likely is a MegaMan game , you just have to learn the workings! Good luck! ",
