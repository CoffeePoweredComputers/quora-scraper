            "answer_text": "Someone up the educational chain of command with the authority to do so should determine what is expected of the student way before the course syllabus is written and given to the teacher. Teachers should not just arbitrarily design a plan of instruction for their students without first deciding what the student should know. Most instruction is achieved through text books that may or may not cover the desired outcomes. This textbook teaching and testing from the textbook end of chapter test becomes incidental to the specific objectives of the course syllabus. Specific learning outcomes derived from the course syllabus designed by the same someone up the educational chain of command should be what the teacher is teaching. School Administrators that do not require this procedure of teaching from the syllabus are not doing their job. Teachers should not be left on their own to design a course syllabus that may or may not be appropriate for achieving the specific learning outcomes recommended and written by educators in higher authority. CORE curriculums are the only effective way of ensuring that specific courses are properly taught and tested by using syllabuses that are prepared by individuals that have researched what is necessary for proper education throughout all levels of education from kindergarten through 12th grade and send those syllabuses to all schools for teacher use. Therefore, there would be no doubt as to what the teacher should be teaching. Additionally, students would be tested on the same material contained in the course syllabus and test results would reflect what was specifically covered in the mandated course curriculum. This would free teachers from the worry as to whether the CORE course material was covered and if their student test reflected exactly what was contained in this CORE curriculum. ",

I like to record any performances so I can evaluate on the video and instead focus on praise and feedback while in the classroom. ",
