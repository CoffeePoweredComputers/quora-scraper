            "answer_text": "Wow\u2026what a question\u2026 I really like this site\u2026yet most of the questions are so surface leveled\u2026yet this one is to the core. Not only is the question provocative, it strikes home in so many of us who are deaf, as well as those who are Deaf. For me, I am considered Late Daeafened because I lost my hearing when I was 7. I knew English and relished the written language. I grew up Oral, and was forbidden to use ASL. In fact, I did not learn ASL until I was in my late 40\u2019s Those of you who have become deaf at an early age are blessed with a language that others strive for. Just like my grandfather that wished that he could speak English as well as his Irish brotheras\u2026yet they where born her in America and he was born in Ireland. He would never achieve the level of English that his siblings achieved. As well as I will never achieve the level of ASL that those who where born Deaf have achieved. Yet, I have become who I am. I am me\u2026and I believe that I agree who I had become. Hearing, deaf, or otherwise\u2026I feel that I have become an asset to society\u2026I have made the world a better place\u2026.and I love my children..my parents\u2026and my grandchildren. I hope that when I am called to leave this world, I have left it better than when I was received here. ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously no one can provide firsthand knowledge of both these situations. That said, my experience and observations may provide some insight. I\u2019m not deaf but I was born severely hard of hearing. There are various ways to measure hearing but for for this purpose oral comprehension is relevant. In a earring test where someone says words, I understand just about everything if I can see the speaker and 10\u201315% if I can\u2019t. Essentially I see what people say rather than hear what they say. When I was little my parents noticed that I seeemed fine when I looked at them, but was oblivious to anything they said if I wasn\u2019t looking at them. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t until I started school that I was identified as HoH. I acquired language primarily through lipreading, or visual ques rather than aural cues. My brain is wired to process language visually rather than aurally. I\u2019ve had hearing aids in the past, but they don\u2019t help me much. If I don\u2019t see what you say, I don\u2019t know what you said. It doesn\u2019t matter how loud the sound is; it just doesn\u2019t register clearly with me. So. I\u2019m 66 now. I\u2019ve lived that way all my life. In the past 12\u201315 yrs I\u2019ve noticed contemporary start losing their hearing, and wearing hearing aids - far smaller than anything I would wear so their hearing loss is quite mild. The interesting thing is that when these people don\u2019t have their hearing aids they tend to be lost, or constantly asking for something to be repeated, or they simply clam up. For them, language is aural, and when their ears can\u2019t deliver quality sound, their brains can\u2019t process what sound they get. For them, amplification may help a lot. Learning other coping mechanisms like lipreading or signing will be tough - a lot like trying to learn a new language at their age. In a way, these people are struggling to cope in a hearing and aural culture world as I\u2019ve struggled all my life. Their frustration and limitations are similar to what I feel when I\u2019m in a social situation and can\u2019t see what people are saying. I admit to feeling a bit of schadefruede sometimes. Some of those people who struggle today would have been sneering at me and getting others to laugh at me behind my back 20 yrs ago. But now? I\u2019m going to cruise through the rest of life as I have so far (hearingwise) and for them its only going to get worse. All things considered, I would say that being born deaf or HoH is a very different experience from losing hearing later in life. ",
