            "answer_text": "Yes.  Having recently graduated from the University of Sheffield's Executive MBA program, I can personally attest that its been worth it for me financially, socially and personally. If I was to pin my hat on just one thing it would be the social element of an executive program that I valued the most. Spending at least three intense days a month of intense study with a group of mid-senior executives from healthcare, machine tooling, oil and gas, education and IT was fascinating. It was also far more insightful than book study or lectures. Before attending I recommend you speak to the University about the group you'll study with. Find out about what sectors people are coming from and how many year's experience they have. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say there are 3 clear advantages, when you take on an executive/leadership/management program. The 1st is validation - If you are a manager already, you will find that there are quite a few things you will learn on the program that you already do. The difference now is that you get an understanding of why you do them and as a result will start doing them even better!  The 2nd is self confidence - when you make decisions and apply new ideas you do it with a renewed sense of confidence. You not only have the experience you now have consolidated your knowledge in a way that everything connects and is relevant, which in turn will strengthen your resolve and trust in your decisions. Finally the 3rd is broadening your horizons and revitalize! When we have been a manager for so long, dealing with the same product and the same people we sometimes forget there are \"other ways\" to do things, maybe easier ways, maybe innovative ways. In a leadership/management program, you will meet people from other areas of business and will also learn to look at your work from different perspectives. Suddenly your \"product\" will become more interesting and more exciting again! ",
