            "answer_text": "Conveying information about various subjects is what schools mostly do nowadays. Many of them started to pay more attention to the practical part of the education to give them opportunities to prepare for their future careers. This helps them provide the labor market with high-quality workers, who are much more productive while achieving a specific result than those who need moths or years of internships. Moreover, besides preparing good employees, schools try to develop employers and leaders by passing on some efficient skills to prevent career failures. The most significant things that I have learned as a student were the analytical skills, which helped me a lot while making important decisions and in real-life situations. As a student, everyone collides with some obstacles, and finding solutions to the problems and thinking about the next step is vital. Due to some of my teachers, I try to explore the situations from all the possible perspectives and then come to a conclusion. That is what I think many people need today. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally the best thing I learned was to seek the usefulness in everything. No knowledge, no experience goes to waste. So even though admittably there were many times that I felt school doesn't teach anything useful, I realized that it actually does but not everyone has the eyes to see it. School gives you information, which we apply in every aspect of our lives without knowing it. So school taught me innovation and creativity without teaching me innovation and creativity. Hope that makes sense\ud83d\ude05 ",

What we don\u2019t realise is that beneath the surface there's a group of advantageous behavior and mindsets that make that person so successful in magnificence. Not just a few, but an accumulation of many habits that integrate to produce excessive-degree academic performance. Here are 23 conduct of pinnacle students that you can use as suggestions to do higher in school: 1. They don\u2019t continually do all in their homework.
