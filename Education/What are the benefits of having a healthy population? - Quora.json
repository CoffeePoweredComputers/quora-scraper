The original question I saw was \u201cWhat are the benefits of high population?\u201d* This is a VERY different question than \u201cWhat are the benefits of having a healthy population?\u201d and merging these two ideas here is NOT appropriate and doing so an error. Regarding the original question, the benefits of having a high (presumably Human) population depends upon the perspective assumed. If we look at the question from the Human perspective, there are no benefits at all because a high population unburdened by predation just gets higher faster and faster until it crashes. In biology, the crash is as certain as Gravity. If we look at the question from the Earth\u2019s perspective there is great benefit as a past experiment fails and it gets on with its experiments in producing a mechanism of intersteller reproduction. This is what all life seeks, to spread itself and we see that natural selection has found many mechanisms to facilitate this. In some form or another, Earth will spread but we, clearly, will not be the seed carriers. And, a \u201chealthy\u201d Human population, meaning ALL Humans, can never be a \u201chigh\u201d Human population on this so finite Earth. *You were redirected because the question What are the benefits of high population? was merged with this question ",
