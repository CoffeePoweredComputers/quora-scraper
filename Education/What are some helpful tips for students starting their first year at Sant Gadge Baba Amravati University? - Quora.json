            "answer_text": "Your first year of university is, without a doubt, character-building. Of course, this could be either a good thing or a bad thing. So here are some advices for the new noble hearts: Go your own way \u201cMy best tip for the first year of university is not to be afraid of attending events alone. I went to so many gigs on my own to begin with, purely because I hadn\u2019t formed a solid group of friends yet. Get work experience where you can \u201cStart getting real work experience during first year. Internships count! Even if it\u2019s a few hours a week Respect deadlines \u201cDeadlines are deadlines. Some lecturers may be more lenient than others, but it\u2019s a good habit to respect deadlines from day one, and note them in your diary so that you\u2019re prepared.\u201d Develop a regular sleeping pattern \u201cGet into a routine of not sleeping in too much. It\u2019s way too easy to miss those 9am lectures!\u201d Grades do count in first year! \u201cIt\u2019s important to still try hard with your work in first year, even if you only need 40 per cent to pass. Otherwise, you get a massive kick in the teeth when you get to second year and you don\u2019t do as well as you could.\u201d Try a society \u201cJoin every club and society going. It\u2019s a great way to meet lots of different people aside from housemates and coursemates.\u201d Plan ahead \u201cMy top tip for surviving first year would be to plan your week beforehand. This includes meal planning (to cut down cost and waste), scheduling your essay prep, and writing well before the deadline.\u201d If you know, you know\u2026 \u201cHere\u2019s a good tip for saving money: when a new food place opens in your area, they\u2019ll usually want to test out their new menu, so what I\u2019d do is ring them up and say I was willing to test the food and give them feedback for a free dinner. It worked a fair few times.\u201d Start your first year with a smile and don\u2019t try to reinvent yourself too much Above all else, a smile goes a long way. You\u2019ll come off as more approachable and with an open and friendly demeanour. One more thing: be wary of trying too hard to \u201cfit in\u201d. It\u2019s common for first-years to fall in with certain groups and act in ways that don\u2019t necessarily reflect who they are. Make sure that you socialise with people who share your interests and your values. BEST OF LUCK  ",

So don't expect that you are going to study engineering subjects.None of the college guarantee you to give job. There will be off campus placements and you need to prepare by yourself and colleges hardly provide any assistance.Take full advantage of all the resources provided by the college, be it computer, internet, library etc.StudiesYou have to prepare by yourself for the Engg. subjects. Mostly professors don't provide any notes and those notes will be insufficient. So try to prepare notes by yourself by taking it from standard books.Have a long term goal in the mind. If you want to persue MTech, MBA or MS or want to appear for any other competitive exams.

Don't worry to much about future right now. But make sure that you don't fail in any subject at freshman year. Even if you failed in couple of subjects make sure you clear them in next semester as soon as possible. Reason behind this your backlog can endup you with a year gap (aka DC). And if you have one year gap in your engineering, your placement is screwed, because 90 % of companies don't allow DC student for campus recruitment, not even aptitude test.If you are CS/IT student, master at least one programming language. C will be ideal. Don't run behind many lucrative, new technologies at a same time (such as Android, iOS etc.) No company expect you to know them (because such technologies will be taught to you after you get recruited). Focus on algorithms, data structures, be master in it.
