            "answer_text": "It depends on the program. From my experiences with M. A in Development Studies at Chiang Mai University, the program covers a wide range of topics related to development issues such as economic development, regional development, natural resources management, media development, etc during your first semester. It is highly recommended to have a strong background in social science/ sociology before entering to the program. Later, you will get into a deeper topic of your research interests which will be showed in your term paper. From the second semester onwards, you will get deeper to selection topic in development issues and reading class with your prospective advisor and define your thesis topic, get into it for one year before your graduation day, hopefully ontime. After graduation, you can continue your PhD in Development Studies, Human Geography, Social Science, International Development and related field of Developent Studies Or you can be a development worker or social entrepreneur.
