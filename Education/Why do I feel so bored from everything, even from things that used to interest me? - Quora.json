            "answer_text": "Can totally relate to what you said. Some facts:I read this and found it quite useful : Bored to (Beauty) Death? According to Dr. Irving Biederman, a neuroscientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Biederman\u2019s lab has been investigating receptors in the brain that, he proposes, need regular hits of fascination.\u201cYou have a system that\u2019s trying to maintain a certain level of nourishment,\u201d and being bored is a cry for stimulation. Without this stimulation we get dragged down into a boredom spiral, which can put a serious damper on your relationships, happiness quotient, and the way you take care of your health. The explanation involves opioids, a chemical in the brain that gives us pleasure. A new experience will stimulate the release of opioids\u2014a wow. The brain is hardwired to seek out more. The human eye fixates on two points a second, looking for stimulation. \u201cAnything less is boring,\u201d says Biederman.But once you\u2019ve had an experience, some neurons essentially take over the job of responding to that piece of data, freeing neighbor neurons for other tasks. A second or third go round won\u2019t give you the same rich opiod hit. Proposed solution:So now what matters is that for how long do you experience such boredom. If it is for weeks together it might be related to depression as people mentioned already.But if it for a few days , it sounds quite natural. What I do in such cases is to take up activities which did not interest me till now. You have found yourself too not wanting to do some activities in general on normal days when say you were busy with those you get engaged in and like to do.For example, I did not like watching some series and when I get bored of everything around me , I try to go back and watch it. And you won\u2019t believe it appears more interesting than ever before . So try indulging in such activities which were never on your chart before.All the best !! ",

            "answer_text": "There could be numerous reasons for this. A very positive reason is that the things that used to interest you have run their course. For whatever reason, you no longer find them enjoyable. This is a positive one because it\u2019s natural, and also it\u2019s a great time to start building your curiosity and exploring new options, which can be a lot of fun. Another possibility, however, is that your motivations towards your interests has changed. It\u2019s sometimes the case that we love doing something for its own sake for awhile, but when other motivations set in, whether they be monetary rewards or social recognition, we actually get less motivated to do the activity. A final possibility is that your expectations regarding your interests have not been fulfilled. It is very often the case that we expect our interests to be a constant and uninterrupted source of fun and excitement, or we expect them to be easy to achieve, and when they fail those expectations (which they inevitably will) we give up on them. It is possible you have gone through some sort of trauma as well, which I would not feel very confident about commenting on, and I hope some more qualified people can weigh in. ",
