            "answer_text": "Because it was created on a faulty premise and is a large government bureaucracy resistant to change. Certain special interest groups, like the teachers unions fight change. But more importantly, deep down most Americans aren\u2019t willing to change it much either. The school system is very similar to what it was 100 years ago in many ways. We imported it from Prussia in the 1850s, with many of the characteristics we know today: age cohorts, rigid class structures and schedules, professionally trained teachers who led the classroom etc. At first, there was only the early grades, elementary school, and they focused on teaching basic skills like reading, writing and arithmetic. For the three Rs this \u201cshut-up-and-do-as-I-say\u201d approach worked quite well. Everyone should know how to read, write and do arithmetic, so it makes sense to have a standardized process for it. These skills can also be evaluated somewhat well through tests, which can also provide students motivation to improve. With this success, they decided to expand the system and make school have more grades. The problems began when they began adding less practical subjects, like history, science and foreign languages. These subjects can\u2019t be taught as effectively through this system, because they are often more fact-based and less skill-based. Like history for example, requires knowledge of certain facts to do well. So what happens is, students will cram for a test and forgot everything shortly afterward. I\u2019d say this is true for the sciences as well. On foreign languages, true learning requires immersion. Written tests simply aren\u2019t very useful for it so almost no one learns a foreign language through school. There are alternatives to our system in other countries. Strangely enough, Germany, where the system we presently use was invented, offers many vocational options to students who want practical experience. Switzerland has a system like that too, where despite not having many college graduates, it\u2019s one of the richest countries in Europe. Why won\u2019t we change it to be more practical? I think it\u2019s because in America we don\u2019t like the idea of tracking people into certain career path. We believe that everyone should reach for the stars, which in our country means having an academically-oriented high school experience and going to college. And also, no one wants to say \u201cdon\u2019t teach this or that\u201d because it sounds mean or disrespectful to those who teach the subject. Hence, we have a lot of ideas on things that should be taught but not many on what should be cut from the curriculum, which is not a very useful place to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Like JDaniel Richer said. You aren\u2019t learning important stuff\u2190\u2014I\u2019ve experienced that myself. In high school. There\u2019s barely any Certifications(ones that can be quite valuable) to take. Don\u2019t expect the system to be reformed until 2100. A major portion what you are taught can be found online(I\u2019m trying to find a simple answer to paying taxes) High school isn\u2019t an adult place like it\u2019s bragged about in elementary schools\u2019 propaganda, it\u2019s elementary school but for teenagers. Too many courses. Grade 9 and 10 English class were something I did enjoy because it did teach me things. Beyond grade 10 English was boring. In general, too many electives and compulsories. When it came to freshmen, I had to take lots of courses I though I finally escaped from in elementary, BUT NOPE: I had to take English, French, Gym, Geo, Math and Sci) The amount of total courses per semester really dropped student\u2019s motivations(We F****** had it by Senior year) You don\u2019t have control of what your timetable looks like before the year even starts.. I know it\u2019s liability reasons and others. But if you really wanted to treat students like adults. Why snitch their grades every time it gets changed? Not every students\u2019 parents understands that one course has terrible grades because it\u2019s not important and they took it to fill the gap and not every parent is understanding/helpful, I\u2019ve came across students(I\u2019ve experienced this myself) who come to class in a robot/zombie mood because they\u2019ve spent a majority of after school hours in an argument war with their parents(Another reason why students barely talk about home problems with teachers or school staff because the parents will just put on a show when questioned) ",
