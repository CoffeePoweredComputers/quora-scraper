Eligibility: 50 / 60% in Class XII. English is compulsory, Maths is compulsory only in Delhi University. Now the bigger questions are Would you fit into a BBA course? What exactly is a work of BBA graduate? To understand this lets take a case of a hospital. A hospital has a lot of experts i.e. Doctors, Nurses, Surgeons etc. Their roles are well defined. But who ensures that the Hospital operates profitably,  salaries are paid on time,  Employees and customers are satisfied?  This is responsibility of a manager. A manager ensures that all experts work together to achieve Business Objectives. Hence at the top of every organisation the CEO is primarily a Manager not a technical expert. Do you have the drive to run a business? Do you have a dream to become a CEO? If you do then you can become an excellent manager. RegardsManuj AroraEduMentor www.edumentor.co.in ",
