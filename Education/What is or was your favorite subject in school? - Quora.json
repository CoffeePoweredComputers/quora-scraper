            "answer_text": "Creative writing. I would say English is my best subject. Especially when it comes to writing stories or poems. It doesn\u2019t take me long to think of crazy stuff to translate onto my draft. Fingers fly and my envisioned stories slowly formulate upon the screen in front of me. Alas, we don\u2019t creative writing that often. I\u2019m still amazing at it though. It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve only ever gotten an A+ for everything in. I believe a long time ago there was a story about an old large woman who walked into an elevator with a boy. She constantly did this apparently and it always made him unreasonably nervous. After attempting to avoid her he broke his leg falling down the stairs in the darkness. He was forced to take the elevator and for some reason the elevator didn\u2019t stop at the number he pushed which was 9. He lived on the 11th floor, but he wanted to avoid the lady. The elevator stopped at 10, which is where the woman always came into the elevator. She was too fast for him to move out, so he was trapped. She pushed the stop button and turned around laughing. That\u2019s the cliffhanger, I was tasked with writing the rest of the story. Now everybody wrote some Halloween spooky things or they wrote about how he was mentally ill or delusional as the woman was nice. No that wasn\u2019t good enough for me. It was my goal to write something as PG but horrifying as possible. I attempted to make some school friendly semi-Lovecraftian shit. Here\u2019s what I came up with: Martin\u2019s breath seemed to leave him in quick and sharp breaths as the Fat Lady\u2019s laugh became louder. Her laugh turned into a cackle, and her cackle into a satanic sound that can only be described as inhuman shrieking. Her face became as disfigured as her wails, the structure of her once human features melted into an indiscernible mass of gelatin surrounding what was apparently her skull. Martin felt any ounce of courage he had in his body suddenly vanish as he shut his eyes. The wailing of the Fat Lady fell into discord as her voice turned into a deep scream. Martin cried he opened his eyes to the sight of mandibles erupting from the Fat Lady\u2019s mouth. The lights flickered as tortured screaming grew louder with every second. The lights turned off. Martin\u2019s cries and the Fat Lady\u2019s incoherent howls echoed across the elevators increasing size. The lights turned on. Through all of the chaos Martin glanced quickly at the walls of the elevator which were now distant. All that could be seen was the Fat Lady who sprouted black limbs and grew in size. The lights turned off. Martin began to hopelessly bawled for help and the Fat Lady ceaselessly screamed at him. The lights turned on. Martin saw one of the Fat Lady\u2019s sharp pointed limbs strike his chest. He closed his eyes as the flesh-like blade began to hit his chest. Instantly, he yelled, \u201cMAKE IT STOP!\u201d He opened his eyes. He was crumpled up on the floor as he looked around. As his heart beat with the rapidity similar to a man in cardiac arrest. He stood up. The elevator was normal. He looked down at himself, he was 17 again. He was back in the present. He ran his hands through his hair and remembered that 5 years ago on this day, he opened his eyes the exact same way as the Fat Lady vanished. She never returned. He hit button nine on the elevator, which is where he and his Dad moved after Martin complained about being so high up. However, this time the elevator didn\u2019t stop at nine. Martin grew cold as the elevator stopped on floor ten. A large lady walked into the elevator, pushed \u201cStop\u201d on the panel, and smiled inhumanly at Martin while emitting a devilish shriek. This was 7th grade I believe. Needless to say I got an A+. Not because it was good, it was shit, but because everybody else\u2019s sucked. I\u2019m pretty good at English. Except grammar, but fuck grammar. That\u2019s why I downloaded the Grammarly keyboard. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember cozying up on the beanbag chair and reading entire novels in the library as a kid. Immersing myself in the worlds conjured by books captivated me. Reading transported my mind to other kingdoms with animals warriors like Redwall or to dangerous islands like in The Mysterious Benedict Society.  Reading is akin to feeding your brain new information and stories. And these trips to the library satiated my thirst for knowledge. Later, I recall my mom enrolling me in extra English courses over the weekend because she wanted to ensure that I could master the language. I still remember the frigid Saturday mornings spent in the class room listening to phonics and writing in exercise books. These classes caused me to despise writing early on. However, after developing a foundational understanding of English and its mechanics, I realized its value. I saw that writing offers a potent tool of communication, flexible and rich with nuance. Writing enabled me to communicate my thoughts on topics I liked such as books. In elementary school, I enrolled in reading courses where we had online discussions. Here, I refined my ability to convey my ideas and opinions on characters in books. Throughout my childhood, I was blessed to receive a strong humanities education. Wellesley, the town I grew up in, offered one of the strongest English departments among high schools in the state. I also ended up taking additional English classes online to supplement my high school classes. As such, it comes as no surprise that I developed an affinity for reading and writing, thereby making English my favorite subject in school. In college, I\u2019ve continued pursuing English and my peers are often stunned that I choose to do so. \u201cI thought you were into Math and Business,\u201d they would say. In response, I would explain that I\u2019m also getting a math minor and business degree from Wharton to cover my bases. And then they would ask, \u201cBut why an English major in addition to your other studies?\u201d I chose to major in English, concentrate in Finance and Management, and minor in Math to round out my education. Studying finance and management or business if you will is a vocational and applied way of learning. It focuses primarily on \u201creal world\u201d application and equips you with the business skills and knowledge needed to thrive in today\u2019s workplace. English and Math, on the other hand, offers a more theoretical approach to understanding the world. For me, these liberal arts studies provided a nice break from the hustle and bustle of a Wharton education, where most students strut around in suits and hammer out financial models on computers. By studying both applied business and the humanities, I\u2019m giving myself an education with breadth and depth (from my majors and concentrations). Majoring in business alone is insufficient. Students need various frameworks to address the situations that arise from the real world. English does this. As you read more and more books, your brain becomes primed with scenarios that can help you decide how to behave. For instance, The Great Gatsby warns against delusional dream and treating relationships as commodities. From that novel, I\u2019ve learned to treat others well and respect the human differences I see. I\u2019ve also come to value experience more than material goods. Business provides a data driven and experiential approach to understanding how the world works. English provides a theoretical way of unpacking the human condition and guides how we think. They\u2019re both valuable subjects. Throughout my life, however, I\u2019ve found English more enjoyable and I hope you all find some books that illuminate new thoughts for you!  ",
