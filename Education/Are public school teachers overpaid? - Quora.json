            "answer_text": "I guess that depends on who you ask. If you ask someone who doesn\u2019t value public education, they\u2019ll probably say that \u201chigh school never did nothin\u2019 for me\u201d or \u201cteachers are useless\u201d - something like that. Thankfully, most people value teachers and agree that they are underpaid. The problem arises because teachers are paid out of the local town budget, and a raise in teacher pay usually means a rise in your local property tax. This is never a popular event. My first teaching job in the early 90\u2019s paid $15,544. This for a man with a wife and two young children. We were on food stamps. I had to take a second and third job (summer) to make ends meet. I had a bachelors degree; I had to pass the National Teacher Exam (which makes the SAT look like a grade school arithmetic quiz); I had to submit my fingerprints and pass and FBI background check - both of which I had to pay for out of pocket. My fellow graduates (non-education) were making $30K+/year to start. Yes, teachers are underpaid. Especially new teachers. If you stay in teaching, eventually the salary climbs. I live somewhat comfortably now - my bills are paid, I can afford a modest vacation, and there\u2019s a Harley in my garage. The other side of that coin is that teaching can be a very rewarding career, and not all compensation comes in the form of money. ",

            "answer_text": "If you can read this thank a teacher. Where I\u2019m from, you have to have a university degree to apply for teacher education. In 1 or 2 years they will add a B of Education to that degree. Then to advance yourself you spend the first 5 or more years taking summer additional qualifications courses. I have enough courses to qualify for a Doctorate if I was in another field. How much does a Doctor make? College instructors get around $400 for writing course curriculum. I taught as many as 3 different subjects in a semester and wrote for them all and every time the government changed, they decided we needed new curriculum. As for teaching itself, most of the time we take work home as there is not enough time during school hours. Many parents have trouble having their child at home for a day let alone summer vacation. Especially teenagers. We are expected to look after 20 to 30 at a time. We also have to be a social worker, psychologist and maybe a friend to those who need it. All this while trying to be a fair, non-judgemental adult role model. And we have to smile while taking abuse from students, parents and administration. Do you believe we are overpaid? I was getting very tired after 25 years of teaching and knew it was time to retire. Would I do it again. Yes and even for less money because I Touched the Future, I Taught. ",

            "answer_text": "Now that I\u2019ve taken some time to stop laughing, I think I can answer this. I think you meant are public school teachers underpaid, in which case the answer is a resounding yes. Most public school teachers make anywhere from 30\u201350k a year. They spend a good deal of that money buying school supplies for their classrooms because very little if anything is supplied by the school. One argument people have with teachers\u2019 salaries is that they have the summers off, so they don\u2019t actually work that much, but there\u2019s a lot more to a teacher\u2019s job that most people don\u2019t see. The average school day is 8 hours long. Most teachers have to show up an hour before school starts (though many get there even earlier) and can\u2019t leave until an hour after school ends (though many stay even later). Then they go home and grade papers and create lesson plans and fill out paperwork and run data (because the data never ends) and think of ways they can reach that student who just doesn\u2019t seem to get the lessons no matter what you do. Then you have to add in all of the extra meetings and parent teacher conferences. Next add in all after school and extra curricular activities that they sponsor. But that still leaves summer vacation right? You also have to factor in all of the professional development that teachers go to every summer in order to keep their license valid. They\u2019re also getting ready for the new year, planning activities and creating tests and projects and rubrics. Teachers are also back in school two weeks before the students come back. If you ask me, teachers are underpaid. ",

            "answer_text": "If you really think about the term \u2018overpaid\u2019 - it means that it represents a situation when there are few available jobs but a lot of qualified applicants. Thus, they are over paying for that position because they could fill it for less. An underpaid job is when there is a lot of available jobs but very few qualified applicants. Thus they need to pay more to attract more qualified applicants. So with that in mind, you simply need to look at the numbers to see if teachers are over paid or underpaid. In states that really pay teachers little, you see a clear difficulty to get qualified applicants. I email emails every day from companies in Arizona hugging teachers from interest I put on a web sight 10 years ago. They\u2019re so desperate they try with every possible lead- and why? Arizona underplays their teachers. Now they don\u2019t have enough qualified applicants. But New York State pays much more and as a result, it\u2019s a real challenge to get a job in their schools. They overpay in order to boost demand. ",

They are also asked to help individual students to develop their talents, skills and knowledge base so that they can be more productive for themselves, the communities they will work in and the world in general. There simply aren\u2019t many things more important to this for human survival and welfare. The generally low salaries of public school teachers in most parts of the world are evidence of something that few people want to acknowledge. We really don\u2019t value children nearly as much as we claim to. ",

They get abused by students, parents, politicians, shock jocks, the media, and sometimes by their own principals. They work long hours, typically unrecognised hours, and have to put up with the most stupid, bureaucratic demands. ",
