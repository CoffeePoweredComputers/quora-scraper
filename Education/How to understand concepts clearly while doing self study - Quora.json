            "answer_text": "Let's start from the beginning (Example: Understanding Physics) To be able to understand the concept of physics at school, what should you do? Yep, Here I give some tips that might be applied in understanding physics concepts (or other subjects). First of all, you must define 5W + 1H and search for the objectives of the subjects you want to understand. Defining meaningful processes, methods, actions provide definitions. So defining 5W + 1H means you have to look for answers to 5W + 1H material that you want to master. (What, Why, Where, Who, When, How. But usually what is more important is What, Why, and How). In theory, the search for goals means what your goal is to understand the material you want to understand. For example, in one case you really don't understand physics and just entered the world of physics. So what you have to do: You have to think about physics, what is the purpose, why does physics exist, why do people need physics, how does physics work, who invented the theory of physics A, etc. Then find the answer (googling, ask other people, watch videos, etc.). This will encourage you to get an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat Physics is in general, so when you enter the field of physics, you don't confuse what kind of big picture you want to learn. Then you have to look for the purpose of learning physics itself. Example: I study physics to understand why objects can fall, why in Interstellar films the child can be older than his mother, why nuclear can produce energy that is useful for humans, etc. This will make you enter the spirit of the material that you will learn and also so that you focus on the goals that you want to achieve here (keep on track). The next step is to start entering the material. For example, you enter into thermodynamics chapter. All you have to do next: Return to the fundamental things that have been mentioned before, namely: Defining 5W + 1H and Destination Search. It doesn't need to be too much, just pay attention to the title of the sub-section of the book or the event overview. Example: What is thermodynamics, what is the purpose of this chapter taught, why does thermodynamics exist, why do people need thermodynamics, how thermodynamics works. Then you look for the answer, it doesn't need to be deep, but enough at a glance enough answers give an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat will be understood. Next, as you begin to enter several stages of the subchapter in the chapter, you begin to think about the objectives of the Thermodynamics chapter. Examples of general objectives: Oh thermodynamics is used to observe the heat and temperature of a system. Now, this heat will be used to heat the water to steam. Steam will drive the turbine and produce energy. So, thermodynamics is needed to determine how much heat to vaporize water to produce energy. Observe, Understand, and Imagine Phenomena that occur. It is very important to understand the phenomena that occur. The phenomenon is a fact that underlies the existence of physics. If you imagine and understand the phenomenon, it is easier to be able to understand the concept of the material you want to understand. If you are still not imagined and do not understand the phenomena that occur, then invite your friends to have a discussion together, ask the tutor/school teacher, googling, etc. Do it until you understand. Connect with everyday life Is understanding the phenomenon enough? Unfortunately not, some people still do not think well enough about what he understands about the phenomenon that happened. So the best thing you can do is connect the phenomena that occur with your life every day. Do it until you understand. For example, The water phenomenon that has reached the boiling point will turn the water into steam and then it will evaporate upwards. Well, is it quite difficult? Change into a phenomenon that you experience every day, you are boiling water in a pan and then the water starts to appear bubbles (the sign has reached the boiling point) and try to close the pan surface, then a few moments then check the pot lid, if there are water spots then it indicates the water turns into steam and evaporates upwards. Connecting the dots After understanding the physical phenomena in everyday life, the next thing you can do is Connecting the dots. What does it mean? Connecting the dots in short means to integrate the perspective of phenomena that have been studied with other phenomena, so that you can understand the relationship between phenomena and how they can occur. This can improve the concept of thinking a thing so that we can see a phenomenon in one whole unit is not a separate phenomenon and one another. Do it until you understand. You can watch this video if you want to know more: [1] Steve Jobs - Connecting the dots Example: Boiling Water Phenomenon -> Water that has reached the boiling point will evaporate because the phase changes to gas, then another phenomenon occurs here, that is water with a density (density) smaller will rise above the pot so that water with greater density will drop down and approaching the burning hotspot. Water with a small density is water with a warmer temperature. With the example above you can understand the system of water in the pan works on several phenomena that occur, namely water that is hotter (small density) will be carried up so that cooler water (large density) will be carried down. Cold water is more heated (because it approaches the fire) so it becomes hot and lifts up. One day water will reach a uniform temperature, so the water will be evaporated because the heat given is enough to change the phase from liquid to gas. If you are able to reach this stage, congratulations you can understand physics by being integrated and learning concepts in a directed manner. Learning algebra and mathematics Actually, algebra is only used for solving calculations. After understanding the concept, the solution is continued using mathematical algebra. Keep it happy with high curiosity Actually, the most important thing to maintain so that it remains is your psychological aspect. Don't understand the concepts that burden you so you feel lazy and not happy with what you do. But on the contrary, consider understanding physics like finding new science and new facts related to life, sounds cool, right? Also, keep your curiosity high, high curiosity will make you excited and always try to be able to explore all the things that you don't understand. And so, how can you understand the concept of physics better and structured. Now, you can share these tips for your friends who are still confused about how to understand the concept of good learning. That's a lot of explanation from me. Hopefully, it can help in understanding a new concept. Thanks.

            "answer_text": "You may want to try this learning approach, based on my own experience: Whenever you embark on learning new things or concepts, ask yourself mentally: - what is my ultimate application? or what is my goal/objective in this learning pursuit? - what do I need to do in order to grasp it all? These questions put your brain into active learning - and searching - mode. Upon learning, again ask yourself mentally: - what are the key ideas and salient points here? - how can I organise and paraphrase them? Upon exit from learning, again ask yourself mentally: - what can I take away from this learning pursuit, so as to be able to add value/compound/multiply  to my life, in my work, in my business or even for my client(s) - how can I retain/recall them efficiently and effectively in my future assignments or pusuits? If   you are learning a new skill, you may need to know the start point,   endpoint, and the   developmental path of transition points, so that you   can get the   process right from the beginning, on top of understanding   it. Generally,  for skill acquisition, you may often need a mentor or a coach, to  ensure that you are able to sustain the initial execution without  problems. All these tactical initiatives are designed to prime your brain for learning pursuits. One last  point, as a recap: Always think from the perspective of personal relevancy to action. ",

Or it the props (board/ charts/ diagrams) that aid you in learning? Once you find this out, structure your self study in such a way to make most of your need.  You may find a video of your topic of choice (on web), so you can have the same experience of a didactic study even during self study.You can teach yourself...using props like charts, etc. (I once had a room mate who used to sit with a mirror whilst studying because she would need the 'feel' of being taught. I have never tried this, tho. )A good way is the Feynman technique - after you have learnt/ read a concept, teach it to someone else (if there is not anyone else, then act) in the simplest possible way. This way your grasp of it will definitely increase. If you find any inconsistencies then go back and read. Repeat the teaching act.Read aloud (to yourself).Join a good study circle.The circle may not directly contribute to your studies but the environment of studying will surely help.You can also read the same topic from different books/ sources.Every author has a different way of presenting information, this way, you can pick up the best from each and often the result in understanding is more than the parts.Cut out all distractions and find you peak output time. More importantly, don't overwhelm yourself. You will get your own way of learning only by trial and error. Keep it simple. ",

Simplification is done till the last point/fraction is to be done. 2. After having identified those, I understand (by translation in mother tongue, logical validation and verification through textbook) them individually. 3. To put them together and express or think of them in respect of their involvement/relation with each other. 4. To understand it's property, constitution, characteristic and objective. 5. To understand it's function, use and hierarchy in its dimension fitting in the Marco picture(that phenomenon/concept being a part of a bigger picture which completes the picture) of terms as a block fixation. 6. To relate it with an everydayexample/application/device being in use. Relation with applied term clarifies the concept to the point of thoroughness. In case of any clarification or doubt in the above steps, I try to think more, refer to a book, discuss it with fellow friend before taking it up to the teacher. Trying to relate it by the way of schematic similarity also helps. Please feel free to have a detailed discussion be required. ",

In my work place i started learning a new technology using self studying(google) with whatever material i could find regarding that technology. As the technology is in niche demand, i was given a opportunity to teach or train other resources in that. I thought i had all the knowledge required to train people so i took the training as a tranier. Upon my first day, all the concepts that i muggled up suddenly vanished as soon as people started asking WHY. Every single step i taught them there were so many WHY coming from all directions. Somehow i managed to make them  understand but that experience gave me a feedback how to improve. I suggest you to ask you self a WHY everytime you learn something, do some google to get ans to your WHY. Another trick to learn quickly is find someone who is studying what you are studying and teach him/her what you learned.The moment you start teaching you will start feeling great confidence in your self.

            "answer_text": "Basics in Study I would suggest you to ask the question to you self why this particular theorem, law is true. Try to understand what is the main logic behind it. Because when you would start to ask every subject wold become meaningful to you and you wold have the curiosity grown in yourself to learn more this always helps. Read what you LIKE most Actually this may seem very meaningless at first. As, for clearing the yearly and board exam you have to learn everything with the needed time and importance. But  in between this whenever you get time invest it in reading the subject you like. It would make your skills better and make you to study other subjects faster so that you can study that particular subject Participate in competitive exams Participating in competitive exams helps you to learn that subject what it really is and how good you are at that once you come to know that this will consistently push you to work hard and pursue better results and yes, be one of the CHAMPIONS. Read quality books At times books, which are not top class, can't describe the subject easily.  Which makes the students go blur about it and they lose their vigor for study. But quality books makes life \"easy\" as they try to say the main thing about that particular subject . So, reading quality books always helps. Hope It will help you ",

            "answer_text": "Self Study tends to be boring as well as sometimes difficult to manage. A trick that you can use is to break the chapter in to small small topics and then start reading the topic. Do not try to understand each and every thing. Just skim through the content. Once you have gone through the topic, try to implement the W5H principle. What is this topic all about?Where it is used/implemented? Place?When it will be used?Why is it important for you?Who all are involved/affected with it?How this will work or affect?Once you are clear with this W5H questions, close your eyes and try to answer them again. This will help to internalize the topic. It builds connections in your brain.  You can make notes on the same for better revision. Prepare mind maps. Hope this helps.  ",

As you said you fully understand the concepts when teacher explains(this is also common among students), at that time itself write the key words in your own words, that may help you recollect later at the time of self study. As suggested by others here, use your imagination. Imagine and read copying the teacher's vice of tone, hand gesture etc. this is a psychological trick to recollect what you have studied long time ago. If nothing helps just go to Youtube and search for the concept you are trying to study and watch videos. That will definitely help. ",
