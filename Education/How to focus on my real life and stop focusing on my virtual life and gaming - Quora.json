            "answer_text": "It seems you've already answered your question. However, your problem is really one of dopamine, and your sources for it. What do I mean? Well, in your virtual world, the only limits to your ability to succeed is in your ability to play the game and succeed in an algorithm. It is infinite potential, the only real currency for the reward is time. Life isn't so neat. One can pour in vast amounts of time and achieve little or nothing. So the reward in terms of satisfaction for achievement is clearly on the side of the game. What you need is a life hack to find satisfaction in real world outcomes that often seem very small to having a level 100 character in a virtual plane. The way to do this is to alter your thinking and your definition of satisfaction so that you get the same spike in dopamine from the incremental progress one makes in the real world. Set some goals. Make them meaningful and achievable. Then put forth your effort to achieve them. The real challenge with life is that it doesn't already have side quests laid out for you. You literally devise your own dungeon. There are no blocks to mine. There are also no rules for game play. This open-endedness makes getting started really hard for most people. Make it simple. Start by reading a book. Make it a fun one. I recommend Stranger In A Strange Land by Robert Heinlein. It's old. It's thick. It's thought provoking. And it's anything but elementary. Get through it. Then read another one. This is the kind of stuff you were trading in for your virtual achievements. Take up a musical instrument. Start painting. Do something which has no definition of success except for the one you place, and requires time to build skill. You won't have time for gaming and you'll have all the same dopamine satisfaction as before, but with real world skills exchanged for that time. Thanks for asking, I hope you succeed. ",

Dude,If you want to be an professional gamer thats good but if you even by mistakenly ever EVER neglect your studies completely and have no idea what to do when exams nearby,oh boy its gonna be real bad and it will turn out worse LATER . It is gonna hit you back and hit hard. Well the first thing you can do is REALIZE. Well if you realize you mistake and accept it , Its gonna help you now. Someone already said about setting goals and after completion of the goal you can game for a bit but that will work but it depends on the present situation of yours.If your exams are near and if you haven\u2019t started yet then most probably you don\u2019t have time for breaks and games . If you are already sick of gaming , then it is easier for you to get rid of them. uninstall them for a bit and keep your saved profile safe,just for a month or so. Try things that attracts you other than games which you couldn\u2019t do ,because you have to finish the missions.for example - sports , learn the basics from whoever you know if possible.well if you don\u2019t know anyone from the sports you like,then you have internet,learn the basics there.Then join school/college clubs or any community that teaches and play your sports.Most likely there will be challenges (like your games) and you are gonna face real enemies/rivals/other-teams which is far FAR more exciting than any game ever will be.and of course you can make friends there,you might have a team sports or individual ,if team then you are gonna have an entire team of friends .if they are not your friends now ,then you can observe them learn from them ,compete with them and before you know you are gonna have a lot of friends.and somehow you manages to do this kind of stuff , you are gonna have friends,game addiction will be gone ,you are gonna have a real life in your school/college and even outside. and in a month you might have a new field of interest . Choose Anything whatever you like in your real life,and get started with it as soon as possible,try out similar new stuffs that you previously missed , Life will be far more interesting and joyful than it will be ever in a closed room. And hopefully in a year or so ,who knows you might turn out be the person you now want to be. just stop repeating the things for which you think you will regret later on.Choose the life you want to have and have it by any means.

Start small: lets start with getting fit/health, as this will tie into having more energy during the day (maybe help with grades), friends (many fitness activities have social aspects/will cause you to meet people), etc. Find something you enjoy\u2014this is really important. If you hate the activity, it is going to be really hard to maintain motivation. To get started, you could decide you are going to go for a 30 minute walk a couple times a week, and build from there. E.g., for me, I get bored with a lot of weight-lifting activities, and most sports aren\u2019t very appealing to me, but I enjoy martial arts. My wife enjoys kettlebell exercises, but gets bored easily with a lot of other gym stuff. Do you like nature/outdoors? Walking, hiking, jogging, running. If you stick to the same areas you will meet people over time. Parkour, martial arts, running, weight lifting, body weight exercises, sports, hell even live action role playing can get you some exercise. Try a bunch of stuff out and find what you enjoy most (or dislike least) and try sticking with it a few months. The biggest thing though is overcoming the urge to stay as things are. The first step is hard, but it is to get up and go do something. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, I finally find a teenager that s/he wants to quit. I am very happy to learn that from you. At least there is someone out there who wants to take serious actions. So lets get to the point. I am sure you will not die if you keep yourself away from any device that you have played with for an extended period of time. I swear to God that you will not die. if you die you can sue me then. The most important thing here is how to keep yourself away form gaming and then how to plan your time to do anything except gaming.Here are some tips that would help you to start a fight against your self. 1.Lend your device to someone or at least give it to your mom to keep it away form you. 2.Announce your desire to quit the gaming. tell all your friends and family members that you want to do this. This would make you more strong. 3. Plan a back to back schedule and pin it in your room and try to stick with it. Make a list of what you love most except gaming. Try to focus on them 4. If possible, take part in a camping program in summer.Take part in fruitful actions like helping other people in real life. 5. Find some friends who share the same problem with you. Make a promise. 6.Before going to bed, tell yourself how stupid one can be if s/he endangers his real life by immersing himself in virtual life. Think about the consequences. 7.Ask Allah to help you out with the problem. He would listen to you whenever you call Him. 8. Do not do stupid actions like the Chinese teen who cut off his hand to cure his addiction. Chinese teen chops hand off to 'cure' internet addiction 9. There are some centers which are free to call. Find a good one on internet and call them up. ",

The fact that you posed this question means you are self aware, and recognize that this \u2018addiction\u2019 is holding you back? Take small steps. Choose one new thing to implement into your routine/schedule for a week. Reflect on the changes and how it made you feel. For instance, you could challenge yourself to go for a 30 minute walk every day for a week. Phone someone- anyone, your grandparents, an aunt, a cousin, and talk to them. Have a real conversation with a real person. Cook food. Challenge yourself to cook one new recipe every day for a week. Once you have done something new everyday, reflect on the week. Reflect on how you feel. Then try to implement more things, and for longer periods of time. And remember, it is ok to still have your love of virtual gaming/life! Just try to treat it more as a hobby :) Be Well. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Niels! Thanks for asking for support. Your question shows great self-awareness; you can be proud of yourself for that. It\u2019s human nature to gravitate toward things that are the most rewarding, and/or to gravitate away from situations that are distinctly unrewarding. And when I say it\u2019s \u201chuman nature,\u201d I mean the brain physically reinforces that tendency. Search on \u201creward center dopamine\u201d if you want to learn more about that. You mention grades and parents - are they making you feel like you\u2019re not good enough? If you\u2019re feeling at all like a failure IRL, then it\u2019s human nature to avoid those situations. And the online world offers so many ways to create feelings of success. Games do that especially: Every time you score a point, kill a boss, or reach a new level, the reward center in your brain gets another boost that makes you feel good. You know that rush you get when you achieve something in a game? That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. You DO have the power to make the change you\u2019re looking for. The key is to create feelings of success IRL however you can. Start REALLY small, like \u201ctoday I\u2019m going to make my bed\u201d or some easy thing like that. AND THEN DO IT. Every time you make a commitment and follow through on it, the reward center of your brain will get a boost and you\u2019ll feel good. Start with one small thing today; tomorrow, commit to TWO small things and make sure you do them. Gradually add more things. At some point, since you mentioned better grades, start adding new goals that will help you get better grades. Maybe it\u2019s clearing a place to do your homework, for example. Maybe it\u2019s a goal of reading 1 chapter of a book. Maybe it\u2019s \u201ctoday I\u2019m going to do all of my homework before I go online.\u201d THE MOST IMPORTANT PART is that whatever you say you\u2019re going to do, you get it done. The sense of completion & success is what triggers the reward center of your brain to help you feel good. You\u2019ve got this, Niels. I have faith in you. In Loving Service, Christina <3 ",

That is the first step which will steer yourself into changing this aspect in your life, provided you have the determination to take it through. I do not have an idea of your personal circumstances but here are a few tips that might help you: Start small. Every day spend at least an hour (could be lesser) staying completely away from all gadgets which will tempt you into gaming or any such distraction. Slowly increase this time everyday Take a stock of the productivity you achieve when you are away from this habit. Spend time in an activity you love, this could be an outdoor/indoor sport, craft activity, music, reading, gardening or even just sitting idle and brooding. Spend time with nature everyday, even if it is for 10 minutes Practice mindfulness or meditation. They are plenty of resources online but I recommend a real life guru if this is possible. Take support of your loved ones, this could be family or close friends. Good luck! ",

Start by getting at least 30 minutes of fresh air exercise a day. It is best if you can do this with a family member. Run, jog or walk. But get out, and start getting addicted to fresh air exercise. Next, eat meals as a family. This may sound silly, but families that eat meals together are happier and healthier. After that, join a school club (NOT THE GAMING CLUB!) Perhaps unified PE or Drama, where you give back a little at the same time. Or the math club, chess club- heck any club where you use your brain and not your mouse. Become a person of habit- good habits. make your bed every day- that may seem silly, but at the end of the day, you will see a well made bed, Make your bed, shower, wash your clothes, do things that need to be done, and you will find you have less time to wast hanging out online. FInd a passion. For me it flying- really- think about becoming a pilot, or anything that requires a great commitment- play golf, chess, something that requires you to get passionate. Good luck. Now get off Quora and go live life. ",

Now think of some things you could do in the real world during those times. Start small. For example, offer to wash up after dinner. Once that becomes usual (and if you live in a safe neighborhood), see if your family will join you for a walk around the block after you wash up. Similarly, you could offer to pick up a few groceries after school on your way home, or volunteer for a short while at the local pet shelter or some such. Just keep nibbling into your internet time until you feel you have a good balance. ",

Nothing wrong with gaming but the main reason people love gaming nonstop is because the games removes the probability of scenarios that the person cannot control. As a result gaming gives a lot of control and removes real fears and the person gains a sense of fake control over things. Real life is much harder with many obstacles and challenges that a person cannot control easily but real development and growth occurs in the real world versus game simulation. Have realistic view that the real life will challenge you in ways the game can\u2019t and determine if you are up for it. ",
