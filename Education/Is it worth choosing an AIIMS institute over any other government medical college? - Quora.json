            "answer_text": "You have not specified which AIIMS you are referring too . If it\u2019s the Delhi one then that\u2019s the ultimate but since lots of other AlIMS have also come up which may not be at the Delhi level . Govt medical college are then better as you get a lot of patients treatment exposure . AIIMS have a advance medical treatment facilities but since they are very few the load of Patients care is also overloaded . State run govt. medical colleges have also got a good infrastructure and advanced medical treatment facilities and you can have a wonderful exposure for medical treatment in your designated fields, but the seats are very less and the competition levels are very challenging . The best advantage in state medical government colleges is that the number of patients are very high so the doctors would be get s lot of exposure which otherwise is not so in private medical colleges. Your diagnostic skills improve drastically as you interact with a large number of pateients but only who are responsible and ready to put long working hours becomes successful doctors . The only advantage of AIIMS is the name tag and yes advance medical facilities at subsided rates but the influx of patients over here is also high . ",
