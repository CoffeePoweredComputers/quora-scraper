Repeated in neet 2019 neet 2020 and again in neet 2020 phase 2 Its clear that NTA WILL make paper from previous year paper and ncert only Cutoff will be sure 650 or even higher in Neet 2021 Because even paper level remain same the no of dropper below 600 is going to increase this year 600 -20k. To 500- 90k so many students going to drop as neet is only 6months away We have seen how 498 scoring candidate in 2019 claimed to scored 701 this year 2020 330 to 680 200 to 655 200 to 620 So never underestimate anyone Next year rank will be decided on basis of Date of birth or even this year \ud83d\ude14 Edit 1 after neet result as expected i am too neet aspirant 2021 Edit 2 hope paper level should be of AIIMS or neet 2016 Other wise it will be more horrific then 2020 \ud83d\ude16 ",
