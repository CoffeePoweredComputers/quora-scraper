            "answer_text": "It depends on how fast you learn, and what kind of program you are taking.  If you are in a program that offers CBE (Competency Based Education) learning, it can go faster if you have many of the competencies and can prove so in an assessment.  If a degree at a \"traditional\" school takes 152 credit hours, and (most commonly) one course = 3-4 credits, and you can handle 5 courses per semester, that means 15 - 16 credits per semester.  You can extrapolate from there - and of course if you continue in the summer session you can multiply the 15-16 by 3 (sessions per year) instead of 4.  Lastly, 152 credit hours should not take more or less time when it is online vs. face to face.  It is a myth that online courses can be faster, or easier, unless it is a special program that is accelerated in some way (as in the CBE example I gave.) ",
