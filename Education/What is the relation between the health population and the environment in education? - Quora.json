            "answer_text": "We seem to have a translation error making some confusion. Do you mean \u201chealth of population\u201d? Air pollution from fossil fuels kills about a million people worldwide, and sends about 100 million people to doctors or hospitals every year for non-fatal respiratory problems. This affects people very differently. Some people can breathe filthy air for their entire long lives, and others get sick and die at an early age from the same air. The economic cost of this pollution is greater than the cost of replacing all fossil fuels with renewable wind and solar power. Electricity is already cheaper than gasoline, and electric heat pumps are cheaper to own and operate than furnaces fueled with natural gas, propane or heating oil. This wasn\u2019t true just a few years ago. The cost of wind and solar generation from utility scale farms has dropped, and all of the end-use technologies have become more efficient. I don\u2019t know how your question is intended to relate to education, but they don\u2019t seem to teach this stuff in schools. However, in most of the world, the electricity industry is a competitive environment where cost rules. So we\u2019re going to have a conversion. It still needs to be a fast conversion for the sake of limiting climate change, even if some people don\u2019t care about those million deaths and 100 million doctor calls. If it was taught in schools we\u2019d be welcoming the advent of cheap abundant renewable power instead of arguing about it as if it were something bad. ",
