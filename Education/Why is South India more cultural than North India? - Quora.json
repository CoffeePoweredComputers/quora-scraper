            "answer_text": "Edit : previously i wrote this answer for \u201d why south indians are culturally stronger than north india \u201c hope you understand that Bro.. what are you talking abt\u2026 Being a South Indian i am saying this.. Culture wise you have more respect abt it than we have. We have more missionaries converting our people here just by looking at what we had, and they succeeded. You believe and respect god more than us and you really respect , i mean it. We dont respect god as much as you north do You struggled a lot by invaders and reconstructed your pride, our politicians and religious baston on destroying the values and temples. We prefer caste politics and jobs more than protecting our language and culture. There is no balance. Tamil people think they protect culture and language but they also enjoy movies where our culture is made of fun of. Andhra and malayali people like to convert for money or innocence and missionaries succeeded well here. Karnataka people think only one thing bangalore and water. We forgot how to respect culture that includes our food, our language, our skin colour , our epic history ,our pride of architecture,etc. Come to south you wil see business every where. Be it a temple , be it school or be it a restaurant. Our south indian culture is just alive because you see we are bit colourful in movies but not in reality. Sorry for saying this but it's all true. Believe me I am a telugu guy and been to kerala many times, living in tamilnadu. If anybody is angry for reading this then they should stop believing media and study some history and converse with their grandparents abt how they respected it. Also one more point , this disgracing of culture started since congress times only. And we all got fooled by congress since independence (call it like that) by hearing freebies and fuss. And they divided us successfully . Jai hind ",

            "answer_text": "In South India you will find many temples of Shiva and Vishnu. There were saints who preached towards God mainly Alwars ( Vishnu ) and Nayanars( Shiva saints). Further they pray Lord Ganesh and Karthikayen. There roots towards God fearing and abiding in scriptures. There is family tradition where elder brother and sister in law are viewed as Mother and father. Bonding is good. Historically they are also good traders and deft at war. There proof that Tamilnadu used have business with Romans, Vietnam, Bali. This is good for older generation . Younger generations are tit for tat. They do not fit into shoes of elders. Saint Thyagraja was who composed many devotional songs with music. Then there is Bharat Natyam , expressive of 9 emotions subtly. Rhythm and Songs it is performed. Thanjur painting etc. Saints of Shiva have solved mystery of life. That we are none other than That if you drop your \u2018 I'. With such deep understanding they are cultured sans young millenians.
