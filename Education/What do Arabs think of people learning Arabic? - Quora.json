            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not Arab, but I have studied Arabic for a long time, in emany different countries. I would say that overall, Arabs are impressed with and very encouraging to anyone who studies Arabic. Or that's what they tell me, anyway. If they think otherwise, they have hidden it quite well! Arabic certainly gets the most positive reaction of all the languages I've studied and used (Greek is maybe second; Dutch is total opposite end of the spectrum). But\u2026.response varies a lot according to the country and the circumstances of the people you're talking to. Egyptians are, hands down, the most positive, in my experience. People are delighted, and very quick to give little lessons. Sometimes to a ridiculous degree, and sometimes the attention can be wearing. You can't just casually slip into Arabic\u2014-the conversation always goes to \u201c\"Oh wow! Where did you learn?\u201d etc. In Beirut, by contrast, pretty much no one cared that I was studying Arabic, and I had to go out of the city to find people to speak to. Same in Dubai, but even more magnified, as it's a small portion of the population that actually speaks Arabic, and people are very cosmopolitan and blas\u00e9. Morocco is the other place I studied, and I found a generally positive reception there. People were encouraging, and would often switch to standard Arabic when I didn't understand dialect. I have occasionally run up against some suspicion, like I must be a spy or something. Especially in Beirut (long history of spies there, so it's understandable). And I've had people really look at me weird when I write, because I guess that seems like a whole other level of knowledge. But overall, I have to thank Arabs for their positive response\u2014-it's why I've kept studying Arabic so long! ",
