            "answer_text": "Hello! Self study is nothing but studying in the way you feel comfortable. Usually, this is just like studying the text book, writing notes on your own. Self study is cultivated based on one's interest.Self study from my view, not only includes note book and a pen, it is all about referring many other books about the same topic, watching animated videos ,so that one can understand it so well (which Idid in my early years). I remember hearing that studying in the text book improves our memory more than doing it with that of the note book, and I think that is why they are colourful. Thank you!!! ",
