            "answer_text": "I have no idea, but I might guess that statistically, it might look like it. It's not about discrimination, it's about minimizing risk. From the perspective of a faculty member (different for an entire department as a whole), we have to invest valuable slots on a single person based on limited knowledge, in the hopes of being able to do great research with them for many years. It is in the faculty's interests to minimize risk. That risk may include a variety of things: 1. international students from lesser known schools vs domestic schools where you know all the letter writers2. students with undergrad degrees outside the PhD major (risk of holes in background)3. older students who have had a previous career (risk is not in age, but in prior experiences making them less teachable than 20 year olds). If your application pool is large enough and filled with lots of top students with none of the risk factors, why would you reach out to the higher risk groups? That's why some of the top CS departments have fewer international populations, because they can already get all the top students from better known domestic department they know really well.  It's all about reducing risk. ",

When you get a PhD the faculty are putting some of their limited professional life into your PhD process. To make this worthwhile to them you need to be a publishing research colleague for a number of years. Hopefully even a co-author. I know that this may seem unfair, but there it is. I have had it described to me as giving your \"life-force\" to another person. Don't expect anyone at any university to ever tell you this because it is never talked about outside the clubroom. ",
