            "answer_text": "You can even change your school in Standard 12, in some cases, though it is hard shifting. And if you want to repeat Standard 11, you can. There are absolutely no restrictions on it, as such. The only issue is that you'll lose a year and incur double fees expenditure. But then, there are times, when we ought to fulfill a greater purpose. So, at times like that, it is worth to change your school, even if you have to repeat a year. I could have advised better, if you could have told me the reasons of arriving at such a decision. Good luck! :) ",

But even this should be avoided. Usually students don't give importance to 11th class and they end up losing themselves at the end of year. One get enough opportunities and time to make up for the same in 12th class. Wasting time should be avoided. ",
