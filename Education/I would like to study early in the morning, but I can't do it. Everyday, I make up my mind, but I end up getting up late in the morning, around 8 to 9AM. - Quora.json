            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I have success The first step getting up early is deciding that you need to.Fortunately for you, step one is complete. Unfortunately, the vital element of your mind controlling your behaviour at that critical moment is not your concious mind, but the subconcious one. This is the reason you see no progress in your endeavor to wake up early regardless of your determination the previous night. Now, you cannot conciously control the subconcious part of your mind (logically).But, you can trick it. See, your subconcious mind likes standards, it likes routines. It even tries to spot patterns in otherwise random distribution of objects. So if you can trick your subconcious mind to shift into a state of wakefullness at a particular time of your choosing, you will automatically find yourself out of bed at that particular time.Here's how. At some point in the day, prepare yourself and your room for sleep. Set an alarm for 10-15 mins later in the day. Now this is the key part: Make sure it has a distinctive part/tune that arrives after 20/30 seconds that you can recognize. (Think a rock 'n roll riff/ dubstep drop; whatever floats your boat). Now, darken your room, wear your night-clothes, and lie down for a while. Get as close as you can to sleep.And when that alarm rings, practice getting up to that particular beat/song. Do this a few times a day for a week. After that, try it on an actual morning. I was absolutely shocked with the results of this experiment. In two weeks time, I was able to get out of bed IMMEDIATELY, at whatever time I chose.(Just make sure that once you get out of bed, you don't go back in. Go wash your face, stretch, anything really.)  It may seem utterly silly at first, and your parents will laugh at you/scold you for wasting time, but it will be more useful than you can imagine. P.S.  If you actually try this, I'd love some feedback on how it went, what your experience was, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. A couple things not yet mentioned;  If you are a student, it could be true that you are of a youthful age. If this is true, you may be find that as you age, this becomes easier for you without trying. Hormones make teenagers and youth more prone to sleeping in and staying up, but this changes with age. Seniors are known to sleep less, and to rise earlier naturally. So, it will get easier!If all this trouble is for studying, try this; study right after class whenever you can - it helps retain what you got in lecture....and use mnemonics and two column notes and all those good tricks.Do not drink Mountain Dew, Energy Drinks etc. Eventually they burn you out and deplete your body's ability to deal with stress.Try eating a few cherries, a banana or a sweet potato last thing at night to get a better rest. (Don't eat a cheeseburger or a big dish of curry)Students often have smallish rooms - with a computer, TV and game console, smart phone, phone charger, wifi router, etcetera. This means sleeping near to a lot of electrical charges, positive ions, and small lights. Do yourself a favour, turn off and unplug whatever you don't need, when not in use. Keep it really dark. Get to bed BEFORE midnight. It is not just about how much you sleep but WHEN. If you are not sleeping by midnight, you won't replenish your melatonin hormone and you won't get as rested from the sleep you get. Circadian rythyms. If you are really interested in resetting your internal clock, try a couple nights camping under the stars.Speaking of rythyms, sleep cycles can work with or against you. Getting 6 hours of sleep may actually feel better than getting 7. So would 7.5! That's because a full sleep cycle, through theta, delta wave, REM etc takes about 90 minutes, so YOU WANT MULTIPLES OF 90 minutes of sleep.In order to be ready to wake up when the alarm goes off, in other words, in order to wake up feeling rested/refreshed, one must have gone through a complete sleep cycle, not be waking up in the middle of one, or else = groggy! There is an app for that! Try Sleep Cycle Alarm clock.",
