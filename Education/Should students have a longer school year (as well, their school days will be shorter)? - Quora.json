            "answer_text": "No. If anything, I feel like the school year should be shorter with more breaks. I work in Japan, which has largely 12 month schooling. There are little breaks here and there, but there is no break at the end of the school year. This just means that the school years run together without any rest, stopping point, or feeling of accomplishment. The only change between one grade to the next is that you are in a different classroom. In Canada, under a 10 month school year, there was a world of differences between school years. Every September was a fresh start with a hard break in between. I helped give a sense of accomplishment to each year. One huge problem with a lack of breaks, whether it is just recess or a summer vacation, is that students burn out, get fidgety, and start to get frustrated and aggressive. It actually takes more work to teach kinds the longer you keep them in one place. Cutting out vacation time makes it harder for students to absorb what they have learned because there is no down time. Again using an example from Japan, I feel like my students are about to riot every time I tell them about Canadian summer vacation, and see how increasingly exhausted and disobedient and disruptive students get as the years drag by. Now, surely someone will bring up that nonsense about how students forget X percent of what they learned. This is completely false and underscores a problem with education. Students forget facts that they memorized by rote, not information they actually learned. If a student actually learns and understand the content they are given in school, they aren\u2019t going to forget it over summer vacation because they already understand the deeper meaning. What they will forget is lists of dates and empty facts that they never actually learned or understood in the first place. There is a world of difference between learning about and engaging with history and memorizing names and dates for a test, and it\u2019s the latter that students are forgetting because they never learned it in the first place.
