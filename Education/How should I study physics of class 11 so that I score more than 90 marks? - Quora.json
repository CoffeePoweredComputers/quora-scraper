            "answer_text": "As u know that in physics paper of cbse u have both theory questions with problem based questions . U can follow SL Arora if u want , its a very good book , u can develop ur concepts , u can refer to you tube videos very helpful , go through the theory text of the book , go through the derivations very well so that u can remember the way of approaching the final formula along with some of the intermediate formulas that u get in getting the final result . After going through the theory , now solve the problems given in Sl Arora after each topic along with it solve the very short and short questions, long questions given at the end of each chapter , than u solve ncert intext and exercise problems . Never ever try to skip the theory portions becoz major part of ur question will be either derivation , theory linked problems , graphs which u can approach easily if u go through the theory properly . Since it will be a subjective paper make a habit of writing all the steps of derivations , formulas required to solve the given problem should be mentioned in ur answer sheet , proper graph and diagrams if necessary , it will fetch good marks . Hope it would help . ",

            "answer_text": "Class 11th physics is basic and very important First read notes then solve questions based on that topic if you have problem in theory part then read any book but books so read that topic that you don't understand. Solve all the Ncert questions. You're in 11th and you have time to build your concept so you can solve H C VERMA (your own choice) But practice questions for competitive exams if not today then after 12th you also want to crack neet or jee like exam so you have time and use it from now I know it take time but you have to understand what I'm saying. Best of luck ",
