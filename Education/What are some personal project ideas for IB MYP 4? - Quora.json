            "answer_text": "For my Personal project idea I did an Electric ATV, also known as an Electric all-terrain-vehicle, the only reason I chose this idea was because I take ATV riding as a hobby. There were multiple people who did different things like writing a book, a song, spreading awareness on stress, art, they all did something that they loved to do and had knowledge of. My suggestion is to do something you\u2019re good at or you know about it, don\u2019t do something similar to your friends because they\u2019re doing it, do something you love and have knowledge of. I got a 5 in personal project but that was only because I messed up my report, the product doesn\u2019t really matter; it is all about the report. If your product comes out bad than wohooo! you have more to write in your report which is good and if it comes out good then the same thing applies (Reflect, why was it bad? why was it good?). ",

            "answer_text": "(I\u2019m now in IBDP2) I got a 5 in my PP (which in my class was about top 10%? highest achiever got a 6 and that was only one person\u2026.) which apparently now, is considered easy to get. How do I know? Let\u2019s just say that the year below me (which is now in IBDP1) had 6 students who got a 7 (but some did work their butt\u2019s off). First off, choose something that you personally enjoy. It could be about any topic but as long as it interests you, you can guarantee a pass. If you enjoy fitness, write a book about it. If you like cooking, create recipes which you have tried out and which other people enjoy. If you like dancing, create a dance routine for a music video. If you like programming, create scripts or an HTML website (what I did). As long as you find it interesting and don\u2019t mind writing a long report about it then you should be fine. The report is what you get graded on so make sure whatever you do, it is concrete enough to tell the reader that you have sufficiently answered your research question. Good luck and have fun! ",
