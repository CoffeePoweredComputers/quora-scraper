Both are in UPBoth belong to ChauhansInfrastructure is amazing in both of themThey are same in terms of exam pattern or Job opportunities. In my time lucknow people were asked to come to Noida for placements.Crowd in both of them are above standard. Simply putting anyone with money get admission in any of them.Amity does bring lots of companies during placements. People are hired in bulk. Most of them will be service based companies offering package between 3\u20137 lakhs for engineering folks.So, if ease of attending job interviews is the priority then yes, Noida; however, if that is not the case then none of the campuses are different.
