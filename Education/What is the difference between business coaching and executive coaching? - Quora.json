            "answer_text": "Hello, Great question, especially since people occasionally tend to mix those two up. To be fair, these types of coaching are relatively similar and share a lot of common ground, but both business and executive coaches have their own separate areas of expertise. What is Business Coaching? \u201cA business coach brings processes, tools, and concepts to help facilitate team and organizational growth.\u201d Business coaching is a professional relationship between a coach (a business expert) and a client (an individual or a group), where the primary goal is achieving measurable business results. By setting clear objectives, the business coaches help clients grow their business, improve performance and achieve organizational advancement. What is Executive Coaching? \u201cAn executive coach helps individuals unlock their own leadership potential by increasing self-awareness and improving their effectiveness as a leader.\u201d Executive coaching is a relationship between a coach and a client (an individual or a group), where the primary goal is improving performance, instigating personal growth and developing leadership impact. The executive coaches help clients develop and improve their leadership, management, social and soft skills. Let\u2019s take a quick look at the main difference between these two coaching types. Business coaches As the name says, a business coach specifically focuses on business-related coaching. He/She works with an individual (presumably a business owner) or a group of people, to achieve desired objectives and goals which are defined at the beginning of the coaching project.  Executive coaches An executive coach concentrates on working with clients on their personal development. The main focus is on reaching client's self-awareness, setting up goals, delivering growth objectives, developing leadership skills, and increasing productivity.  Regardless of what coaches in both niches are doing, they have one thing in common - they help their clients to grow, organize and improve their business. I hope now you have a clearer picture of what the difference between business and executive coaching is. Hopefully, you\u2019ll now be able to choose the coach that best suits your needs. In the end, the easiest way to determine which type of coaching you need is to ask yourself the following question: \u201cDo I need a business strategy coach or a personal development coach?\u201d The answer will definitely influence your decision. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Coaching is coaching. Any coach can do any form of coaching, and depending on the niche they brand themselves based on the segment they want to focus on. Example: If someone wants to work with Leaders at work, they brand themselves as Leadership and Executive Coach. If someone wants to work with people on wellness goals, they call themselves wellness coaches, if someone wants to focus on general life issues/goals, they brand themselves as Life Coach, if someone wants to brand themselves as Sports Peak Performance Coach, they generally would focus on mind related aspects of athletes. If someone wants to work with Entrepreneurs/Business Owners, they brand themselves as Business Coach/Entrepreneur Coach. Having said that everything is connected, and a coach under Wellness Coaching can coach an Executive in an organisation for Wellness related aspects, or vice versa, an Executive Coach working with an executive can work on wellness related issues, or life related general issues. Generally, Business Coaches will work with Entrepreneurs/Business Owners to facilitate their growth. If they are designing strategies for the clients or creating business plans then they are not operating as Business Coaches, they are operating as Business Consultants, giving their suggestions. Executive Coaches can be working with Leaders/Executives in an organisation towards Organizational goals, or can be working towards becoming a better leader, and working on self goals to operate in a better manner in the organisation. There is so much confusion for a person who is exploring coaching and coaching niches, and sometimes their understanding gets so corrupted by reading content on internet which is written by half baked experts. Any form of coaching (Leadership, Business, Life, Peak Performance, Executive) is not telling client what to do, client has all the resources to find their own answers. ",
