            "answer_text": "Hi Thehzin, At the cost of sounding blunt, its too early to rate yourself as above average, when your competition at this stage if largely limited to students in your school/state since you have not even appeared for class 12th. Let time decide thatGetting into Shahid Sukhdev College of Business Studies, probably the best ranked BMS college in the country can be as much, if not more challenging that getting into many engineering colleges. So, don\u2019t demean BMS program over Engineering, if you have any thoughts of doing soIf your interest is engineering, pursue it. Don\u2019t switch to BMS studies, unless your academic interest changes. Getting into BMS right now makes sense only if you have decided to pursue MBA in future & don\u2019t wish to join engineering/medicine, in spite of your science background (Which is perfectly ok). I have met many BMS graduates, way smarter & intelligent that many engineersYour smartness will be further tested when you compete with CAT/GMAT/MS aspirants who wish to get into top b-schools/engineering programs in India and abroad, irrespective of whether you do engineering or BMS. So, you have way to go before your brilliance is truly tested.As of now, just make an informed decision about your academic stream & keep working for next 2\u20133 years at a time. All the best",

If you like the field, then you should go for it don't let the opinions of ignorant people outside effect your career choices. ",
