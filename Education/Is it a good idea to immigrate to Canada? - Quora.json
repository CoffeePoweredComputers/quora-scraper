            "answer_text": " Its not worth it! There are more cons than pros of migrating to Canada. Even the pros are overrated. Apparently the pros are: Free healthcare: Really? What about the ridiculous tax rates which go into funding the \u201cfree\u201d healthcare. You are much better off in a country where you pay lower taxes and pay for healthcare yourself.Safe country: Really? You might live longer in a war torn country. If your heating breaks down in the middle of winter in Canada, you wont live for more than 20 minutes, i\u2019m sure about it.Nice & friendly people: Really? Most people I have come across are grossly insecure and xenophobic and use \u201cniceness\u201d to cover it up.Developed Country with many amenities: In reality, Canada is not a \u201ccountry\u201d technically. It is a very large piece of cold, unlivable land with lots of timber, oil and natural gas. Large multinational corporations have been set up by the queen to exploit these resources and the people (employees) are treated like slaves. Trust me, if your manager give you a bad reference, your life is pretty much over.Multi cultural and ethnic diversity: Maybe only at McDonald's where most immigrants are forced to work. Most white collar jobs are dominated by Irish people.The cons are: Notoriously corrupt job market: You are supposed to run around asking complete strangers(who are lucky to be employed) to help you find a job. They call it \u201cnetworking\u201d. Common sense dictates the recruiters are supposed to READ your resume and select you for your experience and your qualifications. But recruiters here hire only people they know so that they able to collect a return favor some day in the future. They call it \u201cgetting your foot in the door\u201d. The whole process is based on referral and it does not matter at all how much you know, what you studied or what your skills are. The whole recruitment industry in Canada stinks of nepotism, corruption and unprofessional hiring practices. High rents, insurance and cost of food: Dairy, meat, vegetables, bread and everything else is very expensive. It is difficult to eat a decent meal on budget. Car insurance costs a lot, and rents are high, even in most inaccessible suburbs. You will most likely end up friendless, jobless and poor if you migrate to Canada ",

            "answer_text": "I have immigrated to Canada and currently live in Toronto. I feel kind of qualified to answer this question. The fact is, you will not find everything nice in a country - in your country or in any other country. Open your eyes, you will find many things good out there in your country too. It is worth remembering that life is pretty much short spanned; you are going to spend a part of it to get your footing firm in a foreign country, if you choose to immigrate. If you are already in a good position there in your country, and you have a decent earning, bright future, good friends and relatives; you have your loving parents alive, then it is not worth coming here for a greener pasture. Because these are also significant components of a happier and successful life you have to consider. Though you might become \u2018successful\u2019 after immigrating to a foreign country, you\u2019ll seriously miss all these things later in your life. I have known people engulfed in frustration despite having achieved all the \u2018successes\u2019 in a foreign country, realizing that they are missing a lot of things which are only available in their country of origin despite having a lot of problems existing there. There are people who give excuse that for children\u2019s education they should immigrate to Canada. But that is not a reason strong enough for immigration to a different country. You could give them good education out there too, though competitive; they could take the decision of their lives themselves later - whether to stay at home or to immigrate. We should keep the option for them open, not controlled. I have seen those who come on student visa here in North America are generally more successful; they are hard working, more pragmatic, go more for postgraduate studies than those who are born to immigrant parents, or came at a very young age here; even in the professional lives their achievements are outstanding. But if you are struggling there in your country, then it is worth coming to Canada. It is way better to struggle here than to struggle in your country because the government here is always with you in your struggle. There is world class health care system here in Canada for free, and education too. You don\u2019t need to save money for your emergency treatments, nor for children\u2019s education as in your country; benevolent government here takes care of everything. Sometimes, amusingly I say that Canada is the country for the poor, but our countries of origin (subcontinent) are the country for the riches; if you are rich then only you have everything to live there reasonably, comfortably. When you land in Canada for the first time as an immigrant you will be amazed seeing how nice and fast this immigration officers here are; they give you a warm welcome with a warm smile; you feel the difference especially if you are coming from the subcontinent where public offices are just a place of horror- public servants there in fact are the kings, they are reluctant even to talk to you, misbehave with you; your files there need kickback to get kicked off. Initial times here you might feel struggling because you\u2019ll be looking for jobs, and job searching is always boring. Despite all these anxieties you\u2019ll enjoy your stay here; it\u2019s a beautiful country- so green everywhere, infrastructure are so beautifully planned- everywhere there is a touch of competent, sincere hands. Wherever you go your works are instantly done without any hassle. Skilled professionals in the field of IT, programming, computer, and accounting get employment quickly, but there are other fields as well where immigrants get quick employment. Government has made all possible avenues to help and assimilate the new immigrants; there are government funded employment agencies you should get enrolled there. They\u2019ll teach you Canadian culture, work environment ethics and English communications, resume writing skills etc. It is worth enrolling there. You need to be calculative in all of your steps forward. Some people, being frustrated of getting a job compatible to their education and previous profession start doing odd jobs which you should try to avoid. Government has invested so much for education, especially for the immigrants that you should take all these advantages out of it. You can take student loan that is good for your tuition and sustenance and continue study which is way better than doing odd jobs. Engineers must think of getting their P.E certifications as soon as possible which would increase their chance of getting employed. I know many of my friends, after taking three/four degrees were only able to get suitable jobs. Three of my friends completed their PhD when nearing 60, and got teaching jobs. Please think again and again if you ever think of starting a business just after coming here, unless it is related to your previous profession, and you have lot of experience in it. I know some of my friends ended up losing everything in the business; afterwards they all went to universities, now they are doing jobs in their respective professions. So, life is not all smooth- anywhere, everywhere; it is only up to you where you choose to carry on your struggle for survival. But I tell you, true taste of life rests in facing the reality, not to escape from it. EDIT: If you think you are talented, I have different suggestion for you. God has given you talent, but nothing comes from God free except with mounting responsibility. So, you have got to think for others more than yourself. So, you may go to the developed countries to take education in your chosen field; stay there for some time, gain experience, develop your potentials, and then go back to your country. Your country needs you; you will get the best opportunity to serve humanity there. True, you could enjoy a cool life, posh house, luxury cars here, but at the end you will find all these achievements are not worth it, rather frustrating. Because you have learned a new definition of success; have your talent and potential been used for the service of humanity? I am mentioning three names below worth knowing; they are all from Bangladesh. Dr. Muhammad Yunus completed his PhD at a US university and got teaching job there. He could have lived a peaceful, lazy life in luxury and opulence like other Professors there. But he had something else in his mind. So, he opted to go back to his poverty-stricken country to work for the poor. He won Nobel Peace prize in 2006; he now travels to all over the world to give motivational speeches. He is an example for those who are talented and confident- the right way to spend one\u2019s talent and potential.  . Sir Fazle Hasan Abed and Dr. Jafrullah Chowdhury came to UK for higher studies and then opted to go back to Bangladesh for similar reason- to serve their country, serve humanity. They are also two famous personalities in Bangladesh, and globally. Please google if you want to know more about them. ",
