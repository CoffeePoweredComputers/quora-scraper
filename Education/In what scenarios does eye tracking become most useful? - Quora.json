            "answer_text": "Eye-tracking field is, in my opinion, a very broad research theme. In a very short way, you can simply describe as a technology to show and study gaze behavior, both qualitatively (e.g. gaze-direction) and quantitatively (e.g. number and duration of a fixation). There are a lot of research involving eye-tracking, and I think that one of the main statement could be that \u201c if I track your gaze-behavior, I could know more about your cognitive processing\u201d. Why? The gaze-behavior is mainly composed by two eye movements: fixations and saccades. Saccades are fast movement that, together with head movement, allow to reach a cue or a target in the scene (e.g. a signal, a car, a dog, a cat etc.). Fixations are \u201cstable\u201d movement that occurs between saccades, and are relatively long. By fixations, brain can access to visual information and compute them (instead, during saccade movement, there isn\u2019t such elaboration: a process called \u201csaccadic suppression\u201d occurs). There are two very important assumptions in psychology regarding fixations: immediacy assumption: the fixation place shows what you\u2019re computing (in other words, where you\u2019re looking is the visual information that you\u2019re computing);eye-mind assumption: fixation time shows the duration of the underlying cognitive process.So, according to these assumptions, if I can study where you\u2019re looking (immediacy assumption) and how much time you\u2019re looking for a stimulus (eye-mind assumption), I can study the underlying cognitive process. One of the most-studied psychological topic, thanks to eye-tracking technology, is attention. There are many ways to measure attention, but it is possible to say that scanning with the eyes provides the most natural strategy to effectively search the stimulus array (McSorley & Findlay, 2001) and so, to study attention (and also other cognitive processes!). Now, replying your question, there are a lot of scenarios where eye-tracking could be very useful: think about marketing research, for example! When you enter in a market, where is located your first fixation? In the upper shelf or in the lower one? You\u2019re first fixation is for the red or the green packaging? Are your fixations longer for a clean package or for a plenty-of-words package? There are also other uses (see here for some), but probably marketing research is the most-known (and also the most potential profit-making) one! Personally, I\u2019m using eye-tracking to study perceptual and cognitive processes in sport (see here for some examples regarding what I mean) I hope you enjoy my answer, have a good day!

            "answer_text": "Well, in a lot of actually. The feasibility of eye-tracking varies across as per the industries and various segments. To discuss a few Medical FieldIt is the most growing industry as of today and eye tracking is about to change the way diagnosis will be done. Today various research have proved the application of eye-tracking in the diagnosis of the diseases like Schizophrenia, Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Your eye movements tell a lot about you and all this can be decoded by the proper use of eye-tracking technology. Gaming industryTo know how a customer perceives a particular game can be analyzed through eye-tracking. It helps in getting insights about the focus areas while playing and where there is a requirement of improvement. Retail market researchThis is the most demanded industry of eye-tracking as of today. FMCG companies are shelling out a hefty amount to know the shopping behavior of their potential customers in order to increase the sales of the products. Preventive measuresEye-tracking can prove useful in various preventive measures. For example- in the case of studying the driving pattern in accident-prone areas helps to understand the gaze behavior of drivers and necessary steps can be taken towards the safety measures. Above mentioned use cases clearly depicts the utility of eye-tracking in today\u2019s scenario. There are many other uses cases where eye-tracking technology can be useful. From the Tobii to eye link, each company is trying to grab the market of this segment. With the growing number of eye-tracking companies, there will be a need for the assisting technologies to minimize the efforts and increase the accuracy. Smartgaze is one such solution, with its AI they help in increasing the accuracy and getting the desired results ",
