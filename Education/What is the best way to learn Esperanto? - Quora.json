            "answer_text": "Given that you speak English, probably the best place to start is the Esperanto course at duolingo.com. It takes a few dozen hours to complete, and has a basic spaced repetition system (which is good for efficient memorization). We\u2019ve used it to help people get through the basics, and you speak passably enough to communicate once you\u2019ve finished it. It takes a few months to finish, which varies widely based on how much time you put in per day (at least 10\u201315 minutes is essential). Once you have learned the basics, you have to start using Esperanto to communicate. You can\u2019t achieve real fluency from memorization alone; you have to communicate ideas using Esperanto as the medium. You can read, write, speak, and listen. You might try: Watching Youtube videos in Esperanto. There are a few Esperanto channels. There\u2019s enough content to keep you busy, though it\u2019s not always very polished.Finding a local Esperanto club (or starting one). This is perhaps the single most useful thing you can do; just show up and start talking. You can make some good friends while learning how to speak.Reading books in Esperanto. There are thousands of them, and several online sites that specialize in selling Esperanto books. The market for these books can be a bit old-fashioned; the web sites sometimes require you to make a phone call to place an order.Reading and posting in online Esperanto forums.Chatting on an Esperanto IRC channel.And so on. You can use Google Translate to look up vocabulary (be warned: it\u2019s not very good, so don\u2019t trust it completely). But to get started, you should do an Esperanto course, and Duolingo is the best I know of (I\u2019m aware of lernu.net, mentioned in another answer; it is fine, but I much preferred Duolingo). ",

            "answer_text": "What is the best way to learn Esperanto? Obviously the best way would be to learn it from your brothers and sisters or kids about the same age when you are a little kid yourself. However for Esperanto this seems kind of a waste as most people learned it when they were bored and teenagers and already spoke a couple of languages. I\u2019d say the traditional forms of learning Esperanto are good and effective enough. Maybe it could expand to multiplayer online games but I do not know of any using it. ",
