            "answer_text": "To answer this we essentially adopt the explanation given by Stember\u2019s \u201cAdvancing Social Sciences\u201d Intradisciplinary : Working within one single discipline say mathematics,statistics,corrporate finance Crossdisciplinary;Looking or evaluating one discipline from the perspective of another Multidisciplinary: Involves a set of people from several separate disciplines working together ,with each exploiting his/her own domain knowledge Interdisciplinary: Involves an integration of knowledge and techniques/methods sourced from different disciplines with a synthesis of approaches. Transdisciplinary unity of intellectual schools of thought far ahead of the disciplinary perspectives. It is quite important to take into account the inherent friction between the disciplines and that makes distinguishing disciplines both simple and immeasurably tough!(Check Refsum Jensenius blog)! Disciplinarities: intra, cross, multi, inter, trans ",
