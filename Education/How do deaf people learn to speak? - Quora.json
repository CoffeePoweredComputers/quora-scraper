            "answer_text": "That is very hard question. Really hard to answer! I am born Deaf. However, I didn\u2019t attain early language development at an earlier age, thus I don\u2019t have language acquisition till the age of 5 years old. Hence, I never get the concept of sounds meaning at all. It remains a \u2018mystery\u2019 to me. I can hear sounds with hearing aids but such an ability to interpret and comprehend sounds is totally a different topic, which is why I have a hard time understanding speech sounds. I use lip-reading strategy. With the help of the speech therapist, I practice the verbal techniques, understanding the throat and tongue techniques. Even though, I never have attained the sound comprehension so far. It is mainly from people's feedbacks what is wrong and right way to speak so that I keep training over the years. Speech therapist taught me how to pronounce words like tongue movements, throat vibrations hence I don't have to rely on sounds' perception anymore. Also I was raised in hearing world that encourage me to speak with confidence. Even though I can't hear -interpret- the structure of sounds (due to my profound hearing loss of 120dB) , I can speak as much as accurate. I just started learning American Sign Language 4 years ago (not because I can't speak but to expand my horizons to Deaf culture) and it's super easy and beautiful language. I'm bilingual - American sign language and English currently. ",

Most of this was denial\u2026yet I also think it was because I was able to lip read so well. I have had many, Many, MANY hours of therapy that really helped. My peers, my co-workers, and my employees also helped me by correcting me when I said a word wrong. Today, in my 50\u2019s, I still say words wrong, use the wrong words in a sentence and names\u2026lets just not go there! LOL. I could not have done it without a huge base of wonderful people helping me every step of the way. Although today I see myself as Deaf\u2026is was less than 10 years ago that I would have totally ran from that title, even though I was totally deaf. So to answer your question\u2026Friends, family, education, therapy, and a HUGE strong will enabled me to have a voice to stand behind. ",

            "answer_text": "How are some deaf people who have been deaf their whole learn to talk? Sound is not a requirement for language. Signed languages are every bit as much fully fledged languages as voiced languages are. The only difference is whether you use your mouth and vocal cords, or whether you use your hands, arms, and face. Deaf people who are exposed to their local signed languages early pick up language pretty much the same way that hearing people who are exposed to their local voiced languages do. And in fact, young children who grow up with a signed language can speak at a much younger age than children who grow up with a voiced language. Apparently we gain control of our manual articulators earlier than we gain control of our oral articulators. But you were probably asking about how well deaf-from-birth people master voiced languages. That varies greatly, depending on how much time (and possibly money) their parents wanted to spend. ",
