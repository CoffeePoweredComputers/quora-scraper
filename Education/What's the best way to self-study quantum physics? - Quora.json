            "answer_text": "Hello. As someone who enjoys physics, I'd love to pass on some good resources and structure to people on their own self-learning journey. Firstly, a rigorous course in Algebra and Calculus us the first place to start. A good mathematical background is necessary to be able to formulate relationships between quantities in nature and find patterns, which is the heart of all of the sciences. Next, if you haven't already had one, take a course in mechanical physics. Brilliant.org, Khan academy, and countless other websites offer great resources to practice and learn physics. After that, learning Electromagnetism is necessary. This builds the \u201cclassical physics\u201d background before jumping into the quantum world. There are countless books and lectures online. Now, if you really want to thoroughly understand quantum mechanics, taking differential equations and linear algebra courses would be the next logical step. For this, Brilliant.org and MIT's open courseware lectures on linear algebra are indispensable. Finally, it's time for quantum mechanics. The book that I've found to be the best for any student who struggles with college courses on it (or self-learners) is a book by Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman called \u201cThe Theoretical Minimum: What you Need to Know Before doing Quantum Mechanics.\u201d Outside of that, there are countless conceptual videos made by some great people on YouTube. I'd check those out because they're just fun to watch and offer a neat insight to the field without all of the complicated language. ",

After reading that (mainly Part-I), if you want to get familier with Dirac notations, you can also follow Principles of Quantum Mechanics by R.
