            "answer_text": "I\u2019m responding to you from Finland and as you might know our setup is totally different from the one in the USA. In my experience the answer to this question is simply NO. This comes purely from the fact that private schools are not really an option in Finland and still we are doing well.Finland is performing well in many international measurements and surveys. Finland was recently voted the happiest country on earth. We have a handful of private schools in the country but our success brings on the high-quality and great public educations system. We like to see everyone as equals, with equal rights and possibilities. Your upbringing, social status, sum on your bank account, religion nor ethnicity etc. should not hinder you from a top-level education. A good education is and has to be your birth right right ( at least in Finland it is). From a national economics point of view, when you realize that education is actually about the future prosperity and securing the competitiveness of your country then a solid strong and good education lays the foundation for all this. It\u2019s a long-term investment though and the payback time is 30\u201350 yrs. All this said private schools can do a job as good as any other form of school. It\u2019s more about the pedagogy used that matter. I am however a bit concerned over the ethical and moral problems connected with private schools. Doesn\u2019t that lead us down a path where some people get a great education and some not so great? If that happens then this can also lead into a segregation in the country over time. ",

            "answer_text": "On the whole, yes. Of course attitude, hard work, character and social skills are big factors, but those who attend a private school gain a huge advantage over those in public schools. Private schools will help the student to gain better grades for various reasons, but mostly the expectations of students, teachers and parents. Most private schools will also have an extensive extra curricular program including academic clubs that will benefit their future employ-ability (e.g. debating society, drama society, politics society, maths club, etc...), not to mention the competitions (both internally and externally) that they will be involved in. Teachers and parents also have the expectation that the students will go to university (probably a top university). They will draw on their links to coach the students to get into those universities (e.g. exam and interview practice). Many school draw on their parents and ex-students contacts for work experience opportunities which will also give the students contacts for future work as well. Above all, private school breed confidence into their students (which sadly is also often mixed with arrogance and snobbery). This alone will take them far and give them all the advantages. Here's a good article about privilege and the advantages it gives you:This Teacher Taught His Class A Powerful Lesson About Privilege Obviously there are other factors, but I've covered most of the broad strokes.  Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "A more successful career is not necessarily the primary result of private school education. The days of defined college and career paths resulting from private schools have long since past. Career success comes from all corners of education. Rather than particular college and career paths private schools now focus on producing a quality, engaged alumnus. College and good job are parts of this. But, school goals and the research shows that the outstanding, or differentiating piece of a private, or boarding school, education is community involvement. Beyond, their work and degree, the area in which private school alumni seem to have a leg up is community involvement. Private school alumni seem to be disproportionately engaged in their communities. They\u2019re politically active, they hold leadership and planning positions. They shape public discourse and solutions. From what we know (right now), this is the big difference in private school education outcomes. ",

I have also known people from my public school that have gone on to have successful careers. And vice versa. A family friend of mine sent his kids to a public school\u2026and he\u2019s a neurosurgeon. However, private schools offer a good education, safety, active alumni network, and students from the same financial backgrounds. On the contrary, public schools offer many opportunities that many private schools don\u2019t have. Both types of schools offer education, either way. Your upbringing doesn\u2019t define your success. ",

In underfunded private schools your child won't receive all the opportunities they otherwise could in public. Opportunities such as scholarships, a proper curriculum, tutoring,sports,band,rotc, theater. My advice if you are looking at private make sure colleges accept the diploma.there are alot of private schools who say there diplomas are accredited but colleges and even the military will not accept them.
