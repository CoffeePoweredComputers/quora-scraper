            "answer_text": "Would you care to elaborate what you mean with \u201cI noticed that some high school teachers like to push their liberal ideas on students\u201d? I am quite familiar with liberalism as an ideology, that is not what I am asking you, I am asking you specifically what it is about in the situation that makes you feel that the teachers are doing this. Have you noticed some concervative teachers do the same thing? My experience is that some, not all, students sometimes confuse the teachers\u2019s teachings in the subject with the teachers\u2019s political views. For example, if the subject is unemployment and/or poverty, which public decisions have to be made to help the people who is suffering from said problem? One side might argue that the solution lay in lowering taxes for companies, by lowering taxes the employers get more resources to expand and employ more people etc. This is from one perspective. A different perspective might say that you should lower the income taxes for low-income households in combination with increasing social security, targeting the effected people directly. My point is, offering these possible solutions (which are way more complex than I intend to include in my answer) to the students, the teacher is not \u201cpushing\u201d their political ideology on the students. The teacher is simply trying to illuminate the complexity of the issue in question. I am not familiar with the school curriculum in the U.S. as I live and teach in Sweden, therefore I could not comment on what to expect from teachers based on the teachers ethics that operate in Sweden. However, I would say that the teachers job is to present different perspectives to their students, no matter which field they work within. We live in a complex world, therefore there is no single simple answer to the problems we face, therefore we have to face it from different perspectives in order to see the larger picture. ",

            "answer_text": "It should not be the role of the teacher to \u201cpush\u201d any specific ideology, but rather, to explain different ideologies so that each student has the ability to critically think for himself or herself and arrive at a conclusion that is informed by truthful information. The classroom should always be a space that is dedicated to safe discourse on any ideology. If we are not teaching students how to communicate about issues in a civilized and thoughtful way, I am not sure where else this is supposed to happen. I certainly have seen some students react to information that opposes their own views as an effort to \u201cpush\u201d an agenda of some kind. This should not be the case either in the delivery of the teacher or the receiving of the student. Education should be fostering conversation and research about divergent ideologies so that we are helping to create a society where disagreements can be discussed without fear of reprisal or resorting to violence (which includes emotional violence, not just physical). \u201cAgree with me or you will get a bad grade\u201d should never be an assumption made by the student due to the environment that has been created by the teacher. However, a student must also be open-minded enough to complete assignments and form arguments that may not agree with their own views. Assigning students a task that has them arguing for the \u201cother side\u201d is a very enlightening and educational exercise that often brings much higher learning than a simple recitation of data.
