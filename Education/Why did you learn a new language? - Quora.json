            "answer_text": "Assuming this is a question on why I personally decided to learn a new language\u2026 I have always been bilingual. I speak both American English and Mandarin Chinese fluently. I never \u2018learned\u2019 Korean.. at least not by traditional methods. I became obsessed with Korean entertainment around 3 years ago. I naturally picked up on a lot of common phrases and words, and was able to learn the writing system (Hangeul) quite quickly. Knowing how to read in Korean only speeded up the rate at which I was learning the language. Currently, I am able to understand about 80% of conversational Korean. I am currently actively learning German, Cantonese Chinese, and Spanish. I am actually half Cantonese, but never needed to know the language before. I went to Hong Kong about half a year ago on vacation and absolutely loved it there. Although I will most likely not live there, I do know that I will be visiting often (and won\u2019t have my parents to help me translate everything and order food). I am also not learning Cantonese traditionally. I use podcasts and dramas. This method works pretty well for me since I already speak Mandarin, and there are quite a few words that are similar enough for me to generally understand what is being said. Unlike many other people, I have never disliked the way German sounds. I, in fact, found it quite soothing and interesting. My interest in German probably sparked from watching The Sound of Music way too many times as a child. (I practically memorized the script.) This was also coupled with my love for music (which, yes, includes Classical music) and the fact that I have been learning to play the piano since I was young. I decided that \u2018visiting Austria\u2019 deserved a place on my Bucket List, and as a joke, my mother said that I \u201cshould learn German to make the trip easier\u201d. I did end up learning a few phrases in German first, just for fun, and realized that I love this language a lot more than I thought I did. My Bucket List has changed a little, though. It has replaced \u2018visiting Austria\u2019 with \u2018visiting Austria and Germany\u2019. I am learning Spanish through my school. In all honesty, I do not have a strong love for this language, and am only taking the class because it is a more practical choice over French. However, I have since learned to appreciate the language and culture a lot more, and have picked up a lot more than I originally thought I would. I plan, and hope to learn a few more languages once I have a greater understanding of the languages I am currently learning. These languages are Finnish, French, Japanese, Latin and Greek. ",

            "answer_text": "Because every time I study another language, I learn about another part of me, a part inside my brain that I'd never \"met\" before.  No, I don't have multiple (?) personality (?) disorder (?), but there's a qualitatively different way of thinking about the world, and reacting to it, in each language.  English makes it easy to sound smart- just compare unabridged (comprehensive) dictionaries of English and any other language.  Spanish makes it easy to avoid responsibility (Se me olvido.)  Russian makes it very easy to be precise about moving (14 verbs of motion multiplied by dozens of directional prefixes, nearly double that with determinate vs indeterminate forms, nearly double that with perfective vs imperfective forms).  Japanese makes it easy to show both respect and contempt- who needs to swear when you can put someone on a pedestal and others in their place just by saying \"OK\".  French makes it easy to dither, or seem like you're dithering to deceive others (and you thought the subjunctive was useless??).  Chinese makes it easy to be very agreeable or very disagreeable.  My mental jury is still out on Hindi, and that's why I continue to study it. If you've ever read a novel in (English) translation, then gone back to read that novel in the original language, you'll understand how translation is both an art and a craft.  (BTW, this second reading is an excellent study strategy all by itself for intermediate or advanced students)  Most of us would read Dostoevsky to learn from Dostoevsky, but there are historical lessons from Garnet, linguistic lessons from Pevear and Volokhonsky, stylistic lessons from McDuff and even political lessons from Magarshack.  It's more than a little trite to say that it's better to read something in the original- no one has enough time in this life to learn French just to read Flaubert.  But for those who have learned a second language well enough to read it in long prose, there are real gems of insight among different translators.  If a translation is a B&W version of the color original, there are bits of \"I-Max sense-around\" additions hiding among the better translations. ",
