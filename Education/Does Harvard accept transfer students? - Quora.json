            "answer_text": "Does Harvard accept transfer students? Transferring into Harvard is the hardest way to get in. A valedictorian from a top high school during regular admissions has about a 4.5% chance of admission but transfer admissions are far fewer. Harvard admitted 2024 students for the incoming freshman class but in any year they won\u2019t have any spaces for transfer into the sophomore class unless one or more students die or leave, and that doesn\u2019t happen very often. In 2017, 1553 students applied as transfers, and only 1% were admitted. If they do have a space or can make one, this is the type of student who has a chance: Let\u2019s suppose your name was Yo Yo Ma, and you were the top cellist in the country, performing solo in orchestras around the world, and you had a good record in your years studying at Juilliard and Columbia. They did indeed admit Yo Yo Ma.  From Wikipedia:  You\u2019d also have a pretty good chance if your name were Andrew Hatch and you were a star football quarterback AND baseball pitcher and had just earned a championship ring at LSU. Of course it helps that Hatch had been previously admitted to Harvard before transferring to LSU, but transferred back after they won the championship.  Quarterback Returns to Harvard With a Championship Ring Of course if you\u2019re just an average student\u2026 or even a 4.0 student at some state school or community college but without world-class accomplishments, your time and money would be better spent applying somewhere else; it\u2019s simply not going to happen.

            "answer_text": "Yes, and here\u2019s the link: http://ttps://college.harvard.edu/admissions/application-process/transferring-harvard-college If you can\u2019t read this page, the basic information is here: \u201cTo be eligible to transfer, you must have completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college and not have completed more than two years total in college. You must complete at least two full years of study at Harvard. Once a student has completed more than two years total of college at another institution, regardless of courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission.\u201d \u201cHarvard accepts transfer applicants for fall admission only. You may apply through the Common Application, Coalition Application, or Universal College Application. The deadline for all transfer application &financial aid materials is March 1.\u201d If you are seriously interested in attending Harvard as a transfer student, I would strongly recommend you consult this page yourself and follow all the instructions to the letter. In addition, I found this information by typing \u201cHarvard Admissions Transfer\u201d into my search engine window. To be a successful Harvard student, you need to be able to do online research yourself. Here\u2019s a clue to help. Put \u201cquotation marks\u201d around the words that are significant to your search. That will reduce the amount of material that comes up for your answer and makes it more likely that the relevant material will appear first. ",

For example if you have been at MIT and are changing your life ambitions, or you have been at Stanford and now there are severe illness in a parent and need to be nearby. Plus you would need grades at the level of those accepted out of high school. ",
