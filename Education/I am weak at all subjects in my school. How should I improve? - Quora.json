            "answer_text": "First of all, you might be good in things your classmates are not. But maybe you just don't perform good in the corresponding tests. Maybe you are good at things not offered in school. School is somehow like that:  So maybe you are not an ape and stick good to these tasks. On the other hand you can try to improve your skills in the way your teachers expect. What about your friends? Can they support you to become better? That's what I often offered to my class mates. We learned together with the result that we all god better marks.  It's the same as with nearly everything: Practise and you will improve. In best case develop passion for your subjects. This eases up everything.  Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, even I thought I was weak in studies and even I think like that even now. I'm trying to get over it. Well, let me explain. Nobody is smart or dumb in this world. It all depends on the situations they have faced in life. Coming to your situation, it's not about intelligence, it's about hardwork. How much effort are you putting ? List out your stronger and weaker areas. There could be a situation like you are weak in a subject just because you don't like tht subject. I used to think I'm weak in maths till my 6th standard. But when I started liking it, I came to know I was actually good at it. I never got less than 90 till my 10th standard. So, my point is, don't think about coming first or results of others. You definitely aren't the worst guy on the planet. Sometimes it so happens that you feel you are working hard but you actually aren't. Check your efforts and constantly try to improve your grade. Today should be better than yesterday and so on. Good luck ! ",
