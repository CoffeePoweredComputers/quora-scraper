            "answer_text": "Whiteboards are inherently interactive - are they not? We write and erase ideas, words, diagrams - for all in the room to see and participate with. Further analogue interactions would include the use of magnets to pin examples onto the space and similarly move them around at will. Electronic interactions may include projectors onto the wall which may bring video, audio and participation from people beyond the room. Finally, there are whiteboard apps such as these - which also have merit. Personally, I believe that we, as humans, work better together with physical aids and prompts. And as whiteboards require no training or batteries - we instinctively know how to utilise them. For electronic versions, we may adapt to use these in time. Hope that helps.
