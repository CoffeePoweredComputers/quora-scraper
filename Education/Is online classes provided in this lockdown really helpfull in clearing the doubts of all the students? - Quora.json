            "answer_text": "Hi. I\u2019m actually not sure that I understand your question, so let me answer a couple of my own that may cover what you are asking. Does online ed have a chance of being effective? The short answer is yes. To elaborate some, there are limitations, of course. It requires a good bit of responsibility and self-motivation on both the teacher and learner sides. It can be great for older students (high school, maybe some 7th and 8th graders) who need to learn how to teach themselves as an adult skill. Does the lockdown help students to feel safer and more secure? I don\u2019t know; I hope so. Being in touch with another adult is supposed to help students to see another point of view, from someone who is well-educated, compassionate and personally invested in their lives. Plus, if students need help, they can reach out to us. Are students actually able to learn in this environment? I teach English, which I admit is approached much differently from the theater and performing arts, the sciences and the maths. So, it probably depends on the subject, the motivation of the kids, the skill of the teacher. It\u2019s a time for kids and teachers to practice this new skill. As a professional I am required from time to time to watch a video and take a test afterwards in order to progress in my job. So, it is a necessary skill. If you are a student trying to be successful in online lessons, realize that we are all doing the best we can in much less than ideal conditions. I teach seniors. Their last few months of school, in which they had prom, graduation, yearbooks, plus those last life lessons we wanted to teach them, are all cut short or eliminated. It\u2019s not a great plan. It\u2019s just the only one we have right now. \ud83d\udc9b ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are lot of difference between offline and online classes. In offline classes we get below adones Physical touchEye contactDisciplineCompetitive environmentSpend less time and get more outcomeGroup activity to keep engaged everyoneAll the above is mandatory, but if you just want to learn things or clear your doubt then online classes are as good as offline classes. I think after lockdown, parents and student will prefer taking online coaching classes but nothing will replace school. ",
