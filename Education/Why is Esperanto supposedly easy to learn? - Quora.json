            "answer_text": "Well, to begin with, Esperanto was created having that in mind. It was intended to be more easy to learn than ethnic languages. At least for people from the Occidental World, because in those times (1887) Europe and the european languages were considered the important ones. Well: it consists of only 16 grammar rules, the vocabulary has its source mainly in languages derived from the latin, and if possible, internationally used and recognized words; the pronuntiation of the vowels accepts the usual 5, with no nuances (that is, everything like \u201ca\u201d is accepted as \u201ca\u201d, and so on). The verbs are all regular. It is easy to recognize the function of a word in a sentence, because every word that ends with \u201co\u201d functions as a substantive, every word ending with \u201ca\u201d is and adjective, every word ending with \u201ce\u201d funcions as an adverb, etc. Esperanto speakers always try to use the more understandable wording and expressions, trying to be as clear as possible. Difficculties: some consonants are difficcult, depending of the native tongue and background of the speaker. For instance, we spanish speakers find difficcult to spell \u201c\u0135\u201d, \u201c\u011d\u201d, \u201c\u015d\u201d. Non-westerners have difficculties with the structure of sentences, because the structure of their natives tongues is different. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several reasons: There are not a lot of grammar rulesEsperanto is a language without irregularitiesYou can build new words with existing roots, which really usefulWord order isn\u2019t strict, mi man\u011das kukon, kukon mi man\u011das, mi kukon man\u011das, man\u011das kukon mi, these all mean the same thing, I eat cakeWords are pronounced how they are written. Although there are special characters, \u0109,\u011d, \u0125, \u015d, \u0135, \u016d. You can get a gboard keyboard for Esperanto on your keyboard, there are other things you can get to type the special characters on computers. If you really can\u2019t, you can always use cx, hx, gx, sx, jx, ux.I\u2019m still working on learning more Esperanto, but there is content I can find. There are thousands of Wikipedia articles I can use if I want to practice specific topics, for example If I want to learn how to talk about trumpets, I can go to the page about trumpets. Evildea is a youtuber who makes videos in Esperanto. There is music and books in Esperanto. You can use lernu.net , duolingo(available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and french and Chinese are coming soon)",
