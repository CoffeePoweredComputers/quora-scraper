            "answer_text": "A student that I work with says that in her school, all teachers must allow retests if you do not do well on an exam.  I have seen how this works in her math class.  First, you only qualify if your homework has all been turned in on time. Then, if you do not do well on an exam, you must take that exam home and do all the work over that you got wrong. (they go over it in class, but this is when your proves that you understood that lesson.)  If you get 100% on that redo--and only if you get 100%--you are allowed to take a new test on the same material, and the second grade is substituted for the first I have really been impressed with how much this encourages students to work hard to master material. Also, if they care about their grade, they have to keep up with homework, so it encourages conscientiousness. The second grade is invariably higher than the first, and because it is a straight substitution, they are not penalized for having taken longer than other students to learn the work; if they are willing to put in extra effort to learn the subject, they have a chance to get a good grade. I have seen how much this inspires students to put in extra hours to master the work . FOr students who are a little slower than others to pick up on concepts, the system is a godsend.  And in the end their test grade really does reflect the best they can do, which is the goal, right?   I think it's an awesome balance between \"we need to have grades\" and \"the goal is to get kids to learn\" ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite grading system is mastery. It does not apply to most classroom situations, yet it is the one criteria that applies to most things in actual practice. In mastery, the learner works at the individual's own pace to absorb, understand, and be able to utilize a segment of material. When that segment is mastered, the learner moves to the next sequential segment. The \u201cevaluation\" is a non-judgmental statement of the most recent level mastered - so an absolute beginner working on the first segment, would be at 0.0 for that evaluation. Once the first level was completed, 0.1 would be earned. A learner might be at different levels for different subjects. A precocious speller might begin at 2.5, and be at 1.2 for comprehension, have a computational skill of 3.1 and a logical functioning at 1.0, be speaking birth language at 7.5 and second language at 7.0, be playing violin at 8.5 and at 10.5 for rendering perspective. Such a system requires much from teachers and faculty in designing the system, and gives the individual a great deal of satisfaction, confidence, and self- motivation in learning. ",
