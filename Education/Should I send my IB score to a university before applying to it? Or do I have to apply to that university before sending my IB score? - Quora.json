            "answer_text": "Students apply by mid of 12th / senior grade. You will be applying with predicted grades. You need to share this, along with your application, to each of the college you apply. When IBDP results are announced, before the deadline given by the college, you have to send the official scores through IBO, directly to the college, that you desire to attend. Final grades should be more aligned to the predicted grades. Too much of deviation may be leading to colleges rescinding your admission. This is a grey area and how much deviation is accepted will have to be validated with the college admission help desk directly. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there! It depends on what university and their procedure. For American colleges/universities, I recommend applying and submitting the scores to schools you\u2019ve been accepted to since the admission decisions are released typically between March-June. For UK universities, I suggest applying and then requesting that IBO sends your scores when they are available. I\u2019m not too sure about other countries. Hope this helps! ",
