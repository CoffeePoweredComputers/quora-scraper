            "answer_text": "Yes. But it\u2019s something u need to pour your heart into\u2026In the end you\u2019ll always end up learning something new n interesting (obviously scoring too). So it\u2019s a win-win anyways! Just sit on your table. Tell yourself you can do it.(About study,If you don\u2019t study that topic today you\u2019ll have to do it some other day..So why not right now?? And be done with it) Take you NCERT N begin\u2026 GOC Here you\u2019ll learn about Nomenclature (tell yourself the importance of that topic like here , without nomenclature you cannot study anything in Organic Chemistry ) Then comes isomerism Moving on to Reaction Mechanism( you must know how reactions proceed in order to understand them right? Like how electrons move when the bonds are formed and broken in a chemical reaction) Then come to Electron Displacement Effects ( here you will learn the effects of displacement of electrons in terms of Inductive effect, Electromeric Effect , Hyperconjugation , Resonance /Mesomeric Effect, Aromatic Effect and the change in the properties of organic compounds due to all the above effects) Finally coming to Methods of purification of organic compounds (Now let me tell you,just read it once.. Don\u2019t spend much time on this topic) Hydrocarbons It is divided into 4 parts Alkane Alkane Alkyne and Aromatic Hydrocarbons In all these 4 parts u have to study Structure and HybridisationNomenclatureIsomerismPreparationPhysical properties andChemical Properties(Donot skip mechanisms, they let u imagine how the reaction actually happens) Finally,Coming to \u2026 Environmental Chemistry Now just read it like a Quora answer\u2026 Just for the sake of getting to know ,how things work in our day to day lives. Finally ending up knowing why do we actually have to study Chemistry\u2026.(Climax) Also make notes n scratch n scribble n repeat if u want to study organic.. N make yourself some fair notes for a quick revision on the go ,after u have completely gone through the NCERT. All the Best , hope this helps ",

In general organic chemistry some topics like Reasons for Large Number of Organic CompoundsGeneral Characteristics of Organic CompoundsDifferent Classification of Organic CompoundsIUPAC nomenclatureFission of covalent bondDifferent attacking reagentsDifferent reaction intermediatesInductive Effect, Electromeric Effect, hyperconjugation, resonance effectIsomerismThis are like very important topics of general organic chemistry. For Hydrocarbons just study the preparation and different reactions of Alkanes , Alkenes and alkynes Mug up all the name reaction given in ncert. Hope my answer helps you . Thank you. ",

Also in 2 days you can do some named reactions which are asked in your school\u2019s exam , which you can analyse by going through the previous years question papers. ",
