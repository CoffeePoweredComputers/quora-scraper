            "answer_text": "I had this student who goofed off all the time, and this is what I did (in order) a) took her outside to talk to her b) sent her to the office c) contacted her mom d) told her to knock it off repeatedly e) sent her outside f) tried to get her attention by being humorous g) started getting frustrated and being short with her Nothing changed her goofing off, not even one bit. Im not mad at her though\u2026 I was the same way in high school, and I will tell you with personal experience that there was nothing a teacher could do to make me understand or care that I was being disruptive. But this isn't even the point. I GOT IN TROUBLE for doing those things. You see, this student registered a complaint and the administration had to investigate. She never saw any disciplinary action. Thats right. Nothing. Our school doesn't even do detention for goofing off. The administrator interviewed her to see why she was misbehaving and this is what she said: a) He took me outside and bullied me. I was all alone and scared. I didn't even do anything wrong b) he sent me to the office while I was doing my work on an important project. I didn't even get to finish because I was in the office the whole time, and thats why I'm failing. c) (mom supports student) d) he's always embarrassing me in front of my friends e) how am I supposed to pass the class when Im outside all the time? f) he says weird things that he thinks are funny, but they make me uncomfortable. g) he is unapproachable when I need help, he just snaps at me and sends me back to my seat. When you were reading these complaints, did you say to yourself \u201cwell, there is always some truth to everything. That teacher sounds like a jerk.\u201d If you gave *this* student that credibility, when all she was doing was being a complete asshole in my class, then there is your answer. I let students goof off in class because there is nothing the administration is going to do that amounts to anything except for giving me a hard time for trying to correct the action. Inside the classroom, the current idea is that I need to provide love, care and understanding for the student to promote positive self-image and provide the support necessary to lift that student up and give her the opportunity to self-correct and develop the confidence she needs to succeed academically. Im someone who takes his job very seriously and tends to not argue with whatever my boss is telling me. If they tell me to love and nurture, then I will love and nurture. The big wigs tell me that current research shows discipline is mostly ineffective. They are the experts. Im not going to argue with the premise. Unfortunately, to a student that is annoyed by goofing off this is going to be very frustrating. My intervention is by nature going to look differently to the rest of the class, and to add insult to injury it will also look as though that student is getting preferential treatment. Does it work? Who knows? It probably wont show any results within the confines of one school year, but maybe it does eventually. It doesn't matter anyway, a massive part of todays society adheres to the idea that you get more flies with honey. Ironically, I credit the old school system of action/consequence with turning my life around. No, not the current soft approach of \u201cnatural consequences.\u201d I got every \u201cartificial consequence\u201d imaginable: detention, harassed by cops, fired from jobs and smacked around by my mom. None of these things exist anymore in todays society. I am thoroughly convinced that we are doing these kids a disservice by being so lenient and customer service like in their treatment. But the bottom line is that YOU dont goof off. You will be more successful and thats really what matters. Don't worry about the kids goofing off, and focus on ignoring them now, because they will be your co-workers tomorrow. ",

            "answer_text": "I am so glad you asked that question! \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d I heard this whining on occasion. \u201cWhy do I have to do my work? You never make Johnny do his!\u201d When I was busy teaching, I didn\u2019t have time for anymore of an answer than \u201cLife\u2019s not fair\u2014get over it and get on with it.\u201d It\u2019s not a very satisfactory answer, I know. So now I\u2019ll give you the straight poop. There are several possible reasons I\u2019m not getting onto Johnny right this moment. For example, I may know that Johnny\u2019s dad was just sentenced to 20 years in prison and he\u2019s having trouble dealing with it. His way of acting out his fear and insecurity is goofing off. He\u2019s not causing a ruckus\u2014he\u2019s just not on task. And I\u2019m not going to go off on him, belittling him for not concentrating on poetry by John Milton. Perhaps that IEP I have for Johnny shows he\u2019s been diagnosed with ADHD, and sometimes he forgets to take his meds. Is his behavior going to improve because I yell at him? Nope, noppity nope. Maybe I\u2019m not correcting his behavior at that particular moment because I\u2019m having to correct YOURS. I\u2019ll get to Johnny\u2014give me a second, OK? There\u2019s one final possible reason I\u2019m letting ol\u2019 Johnny slack off: for the moment, anyway, I\u2019ve given up on him. He\u2019s not worth my energy. Sometimes kids decide they\u2019re not going to be successful. I cannot change their minds. In fact, my nagging and wheedling generally produce an entrenchment of their attitudes. As long as Johnny isn\u2019t disrupting others, he can play with Opus\u2019s turnip twaddler for all I care. I\u2019ve got 29 other students who\u2019ve decided they want to be successful. When Johnny changes his mind, I\u2019ll be there for him. Johnny has every right to choose not to learn. He does not, however, have the right to disturb others who are choosing to learn. That\u2019s where the line must be drawn. If Johnny\u2019s behavior is disruptive, a responsible teacher will remove him. I generally sent kids to the hall. Be glad your teacher is holding your feet to the fire. It means you don\u2019t have a tragedy unfolding in your life; it means you don\u2019t have an IEP she has to monitor; it means she\u2019ll get around to Johnny in a minute; it mean she cares about you and respects your decision to learn.
