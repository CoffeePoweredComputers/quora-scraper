            "answer_text": "I grew up and was in high school from 1966\u20131970. I have literally NEVER seen a single movie that reminded me of my own high school years. Yes, there were cliques. Yes, there were bullies. Yes, there were jocks and nerds and preppies\u2014but they overlapped, and were not really like any of the fictional cliques I knew of! For example, we did have a clique mostly consisting of girls who were \u201cpopular\u201d and consisted of girls who were a little better off financially and might be cheerleaders, etc. But even though they hung out and socialized mostly among themselves, they weren\u2019t bullies and did not go out of their way to pick on those who were loners. In fact, most of them were really nice kind girls. There were a couple of girls who were bullies\u2014my own nemesis was a girl whose father was a colonel in the Air Force. She thought herself as a big deal and went out of her way to pick on me\u2014but she was never popular. The day that she finally goaded me into an actual fight (in the lunchroom), I was cheered when I got to class, because nobody liked her. I had my own little clique\u2014myself, two girls I knew from my neighborhood who were younger than me, and their two boyfriends. But they all had separate cliques in their own years as well. I was accepted by certain other cliques as well, though not as an insider. I was in debate club, and we were a separate clique\u2014even though one of the girls and one of the boys were in the \u201chippie\u201d clique, and others were guys who were jocks or girls in the \u201cpopular\u201d group. In other words, the social groups at my high school were much more fluid and diverse than anything I\u2019ve ever seen in a \u201chigh school movie\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "The movie that reminds me most of my high school years, and I\u2019m about to date myself, is The Breakfast Club. I was one of those misfits, never really fitting into any particular group. The uncertainty about life and your place in it and trying to figure out where you belong are, in my opinion, hard concepts, and any wrong turn has the potential for imminent catastrophe or stage setting for future catastrophe or at least, unhappiness. This movie was the embodiment of my experience in high school. My character wasn\u2019t in the movie. She would have been the biracial chick whose body filled out too early and spent a lot of time deciding whether the advances made by boys were real or based on her widening hips, small waist, and breasts that a 13-year-old doesn\u2019t know what to do with. She would\u2019ve gotten detention for either smoking in the bathroom or getting caught with a boy somewhere she had no business being. She wasn\u2019t Allison Reynolds, played by Ally Sheedy, as she wasn\u2019t dark and goth and afraid of her own personality. But she would also have shown up for detention because she had nothing better to do. She definitely wasn\u2019t Claire Standish, Molly Ringwald\u2019s character. She didn\u2019t wear, let alone own, any pearls, and while she was the natural-born leader of her own small group of misfits, she wasn\u2019t uppity, nor did she come from a home in a good zip code. But she also would have longed for connection and would have done something as cool as giving up an expensive earring for the bad boy. And of course, my character wasn\u2019t in the movie because, ironically, no black characters had earned detention apparent. Anyway, even though I\u2019m not represented in The Breakfast Club, it brings me right back to big hair, parachute pants, and popped Izod collars. I wouldn\u2019t change it. ",
