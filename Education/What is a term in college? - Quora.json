            "answer_text": "There are two kinds of terms, depending on the college: semesters and quarters. Quarters roughly correspond to the season of the year (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer), and a normal school year runs from September to June (some variations apply). Quarters typically run 10\u201312 weeks and about 33 hours of class time (for a single class). By contrast, there are two semesters per year, typically Fall and Spring. These run around 14\u201317 weeks depending on the school and about 45 to 48 hours of class time (for a single class). Most colleges have summer terms with a shortened schedule and the same number of in-class hours. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a division of the academic year. The exact length of a term depends on whether the school is using semesters, trimesters, or quarters. In a semester system, one term is about 16 weeks. In a trimester system, one term is about 13 weeks, and summer term is treated differently. Quarters are typically 10\u201312 weeks. ",
