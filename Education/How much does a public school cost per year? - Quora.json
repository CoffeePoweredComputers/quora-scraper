            "answer_text": "I took on the challenge of establishing a private school once. Believe it or not it was much easier than you would think. I discovered that there has to be lots of research involved in the preparatory or planning stage of this endeavor. Since private schools are funded entirely by student tuition, it becomes a very competitive situation. I discovered that many factors had to be considered before opening the school. The primary factor is in determining student tuition. This was essential in the overall budget necessary to sustain a viable functioning school. The minimum overhead cost including teacher salaries/insurance, administrative cost (Headmaster salary plus clerical) building rent with utilities, and other incidental cost had to be considered. Once the minimum cost to run the school on a daily basis is considered, you then decide how much tuition to charge each student. Since tuition is different from school to school, a realistic and competitive tuition must be assessed. This is where the number of student enrolled must be considered. If projected enrollment doesn\u2019t get the needed tuition, then the school is a no go. Our school failed after two years because our budgetary necessities required a student enrollment of 200 and we never got more than 60. In order to keep the school viable, teachers agreed to work for minimum wage. To answer your question, tuition cost varies from school to school. Ours was set at $1900.00 per student emester  which was competitive, however it only offered the minimum requirements for graduation. There were no athletic department or meals offered on campus. We anticipated offering these services at a later time, but with an enrollment of 60 students such was not the case. There are monetary factors that work against private schools that are hard to overcome. Parents of students that pay for private tuition are already paying for education through local taxes. Therefore, parents who send their students to a private school are being charged twice for their students education. With my experience as both a private school administrator and public school high school principal, it is my opinion that private schools cannot compete with the services offered by public schools. I am sure that that is not the case for private schools that are sponsored by mega churches who have unlimited resources. Teachers by and large, prefer teaching at private schools since many of these students come out of homes that value an education. Traditionally however, private school teachers are paid less than their public school counterparts. Also, in some cases private school teachers are not required to have the same teacher certification as their public school counterparts. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you are asking about a k-12 school (?). If you live in the zoned district, it costs nothing more than your property taxes. If you want to send the kids outside of the district and the school agrees, expect to pay your property taxes *plus* up to $20,000 per year. BTW, many states also have cyber options which are sometimes free\u2026 ",
