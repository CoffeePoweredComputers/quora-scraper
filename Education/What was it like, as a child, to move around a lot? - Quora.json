            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. *heavy sigh* Moving around was on one hand, horrible and on the other hand, wonderful. I did not have friends that lasted longer than a few months at a time. We moved every six months to a year and I went to twenty three different schools before I finally graduated. No, we were not military. My father sold computer systems to world governments and large corporations. To set up a new system would take that long and then it was off to the next installation. He made a lot of money doing this during the 60\u2019s as it was a new innovation for most companies. The computers were so large they filled rooms but there you have it. So, the first move was when I was three years old to Dayton, OH and I remember just a little bit about it. The second time I was four, Rome, NY and again, other than Niagara Falls, I don\u2019t remember much. Memory started with Kindergarten in St. Paul, MN. The move to the kindergarten in Washington DC was when I realized that I was not able to keep friends but other kids were. We moved to Silver Spring, MD and there we stayed for three lovely years and I made friends, learned to read, visited every single one of the patriotic buildings multiple times as friends and family from St. Louis would come to visit. I have seen the constitution, walked the hallowed halls of Congress, toured the White House, fished in Chesapeake Bay, walked all the way to the top of the Washington Monument more times than I ever wanted to, etc. I know Washington DC like th back of my hand. I spent weeks wandering the Smithsonian.. all of it. This was wonderful to me. And then President Kennedy was assassinated and all that childish innocence ended. The Vietnam War was live in living color on the news. And we had to leave all our friends behind because the next place was Huntsville, AL. You see, there was this space program called NASA and they used the computers that Dad sold. There I made friends, learned about racism first hand. Watched the Civil Rights Movement and even more innocence was lost. I was wary about making friends because I didn\u2019t know how long we\u2019d be there. I started making shallow friends when we moved to Dayton, OH, again because I didn\u2019t want to hurt when we moved again and by 8, I knew we would be moving again. The only real friends I kept were my cousins in St. Louis that I saw three times a year. This was not a good way to grow up. No one I know shared the things that I shared and the only witness to it was my brother and he died at 23. My grandchildren tell me that I have the best stories. I\u2019m the grandparent they want to interview for the school project. I have been to all the museums. I\u2019ve been to all the battlefields - Revolutionary War to the Civil War. I\u2019ve lived North and I\u2019ve lived South. When I take a \u201cwhere do you live by how you speak\u201d quiz, I am always left with \u201c?\u201d. I\u2019ve lived in England. I lived in New Orleans, LA during the Summer of Love. I\u2019ve lived but I lived alone. I would NEVER and I do mean NEVER submit a child to this. It was the loneliest way to grow up and while I did get to see special places, see political events that happened up close and personal and meet people that you just usually don\u2019t get to meet, like astronauts, etc. I didn\u2019t get to make bonds with other people my age and losing my school over and over again is like people dying. You will never ever get it back. My husband, strangely, actually knew me as a child. I was friends with his sister for one single year when I was 14. He told me his family never forgot me and they did recognize me when he brought me to meet them. His mother showed me a photo of the young me and his sister. It was the strangest feeling, someone knowing the child me. I was 42 when I met him again. He and his family are, seriously, the only people I know from my childhood that aren\u2019t family. It makes me truly value friendship and I understand how vital it is. Most folks just take it for granted, but I would trade all the important places and people if I could only have had one friend to hold and cherish through it all. But no.. moving around destroys ties. ",
