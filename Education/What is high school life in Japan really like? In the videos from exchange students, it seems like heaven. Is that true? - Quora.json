            "answer_text": "Of course it is not heaven. It\u2019s still high school! First of all, people post the best stuff. It\u2019s well known that social media is mostly a collection of sanitized, whitewashed stuff pretending to be real life. They often want to show their friends back home what a special experience they are having, and brag a little. (Except when it is an exaggerated, \u201ceverything is terrible\u201d version\u2026.) I\u2019d say high school in Japan has two sides. First of all, lessons can be quite boring, composed mostly of the teacher lecturing and students taking notes. Separately, the students are working towards college admissions, which is like a separate course of study, in parallel to regular school, and usually involves going to a private tutoring/prep school for 2\u20134 hours, several evenings every week. College prep comprises mainly cramming and drilling of all their regular school curriculum, repeating stuff already covered in school and surging ahead to cover and drill all the final year\u2019s content several months before the end of the school year. This is because college admission usually requires comprehensive exams covering almost all of the high school curriculum. This is called \u201cexamination hell\u201d, because it is very demanding and very stressful. (So much so that most families will not take a vacation, and many will not even go out to eat for a year before their child\u2019s exams, so s/he will not be distracted!) Second, there is a lot of freedom for the teenagers, as they typically manage their own club/interest group activities after lessons (could be 2\u20134 hours x 2\u20136 days/week), are often let out early, have little homework, and are able to roam far and wide using public transportation. This is how kids stay (relatively) sane. In the case of kids going to Japan, often they are Japanophiles before they go, and the exoticness (meaning differentness from their home country) of Japan can make them really excited. Since they don\u2019t worry about Japanese college admissions, they can just enjoy the freedom and fun. I know a German who came to Japan as an exchange student in high school. He was excited by Japanese pop culture (manga, anime, etc), and figured that a year in Japan would be full of exotic experiences. He found that there was a lot of struggle involved. First of all, being \u201cthe new kid\u201d is difficult, even within the same country. On top of that, language is a huge barrier. He didn\u2019t know much Japanese, and Japanese are generally not great at English, so he was bored during classes and had trouble making friends. (His shy personality was also a barrier.) He joined a club at school, an excellent opportunity to make friends, but found that they were very serious about their craft (breakdancing, in this case), and he was less committed/motivated to it. There were other factors involved besides school, but at any rate, he gave up and went home 3 months or so early. So it can be difficult for exchange students. (This phenomenon, involving homesickness, etc, is well-researched, so Google for more information.) ",

            "answer_text": "This was my impression based on my time working as an English teacher in Japanese high schools.  First off there is a very wide range in Japanese high schools. High schools aren't compulsory in Japan like they are in the US and they aren't based on location (that much). All schools have entrance exams and they can very widely on what they're like. Some are elite schools for college bound kids, some are for athletes, some are for kids with interest in foreign studies, some are for engineering/tech stuff, some are preps for trade schools, etc. etc. etc. So the kind of experience you'll get varies greatly depending on the school you end up at. As for how much fun it is to be a Japanese student, that depends. They're using to be a saying \"High School is Hell, College is Disneyland\". The thought process was that the entrance exams for college are really hard and kids had to study like hell both in high school and out to do well enough on the exams to get into good colleges, but once they were in to college things were easy. That isn't as true as it used to be, as colleges have become more strict, but it's still somewhat true. So traditionally Japanese High Schools haven't been that fun as far as studying goes. Also as Ryota said Clubs are very different in Japan. Most Japanese students choose one club when they're in high school and that club is there only club for all their years of high school and it's very strict. Many of my students didn't have holidays almost at all because the practice for their clubs was year round. And this wasn't just for people who wanted to pursue athletics as a career in the future or for teams with aspirations of playing for a national championship. This was many of my students. It teaches a lot and you learn great teamwork and discipline and comraderie, but it certainly didn't look fun to me from my American perspective. Based on my experience I'm not a big fan of Japanese high schools. I'd prefer my kids to go to an American High School than a Japanese one. That doesn't mean that Japanese schools are necessarily bad, they just provide a much more academic focused and strict experience, much different than the laid back fun time I remember from my high school years. And many of my students were still happy and enjoyed high school. So while it's not really accurate to call it heaven, it's not hell either. ",
