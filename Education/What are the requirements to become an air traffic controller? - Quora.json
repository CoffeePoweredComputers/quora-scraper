            "answer_text": "In the USA, to be a civilian controller with the FAA you need three years of general (progressively responsible) full-time work experience. Pretty much any \u201creal\u201d job experience will qualify you. You can substitute a 4-year college/university degree (any field) for this work experience. Going to college/university for the sole purpose of becoming a controller is, in my opinion, a waste of time and money. ",
