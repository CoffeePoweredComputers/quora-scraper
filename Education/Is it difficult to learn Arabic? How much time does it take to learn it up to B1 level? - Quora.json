            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult, but it does take time and effort. Arabic grammar isn\u2019t particularly complex or hard to master. The biggest things for English speakers are: (1) Arabic has a different alphabet. While the alphabet isn\u2019t hard to learn, it does take time to be able to recognize words instinctively without having to sound them out and (2) Arabic shares very few cognates with English. This means that every word you learn is a new word and can\u2019t be figured instinctively because it looks or sounds like a similar English word. These are not obstacles that cannot be overcome but they do make Arabic slightly harder than it would be based on just grammar alone. ",
