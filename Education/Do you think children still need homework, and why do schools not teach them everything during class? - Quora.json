            "answer_text": "No I don\u2019t. Homework can be, and often is, just a district or school requirement, and is given with little thought. What students need should be put into the time constraint of a school day. If it can\u2019t be done then too much is being asked. Now ideally your students will take it upon their selves to do the homework they need without being told. Another thing about homework is teachers have to grade it. Think about it. You have 6 classes with, 30 kids in each class. If given homework twice a week, as I used to have to do, you will have potentially, 360 pieces of homework to grade. It can become a nightmare. I think homework is unnecessary, as is so many other things required of teachers and students by many school systems. ",

            "answer_text": "The following is my opinion based on my experience as a student at school, at university, as a teacher and the lectures I\u2019ve attended where I was taught how the brain learns. First let me define what, in my view, the purpose of homework is. The purpose of homework is either to prepare the student for the material they are about to learn or to make them use the material they just learned to solve some problems so they can truly keep that knowledge. If we\u2019re going to talk about learning, truly learning something, we\u2019re talking about doing the same thing repeatedly, again and again, in different ways, to solve different problems. This means that depending on the topic and the number of lessons you have with that specific group in a week, it would take you at least twice as long to learn something if you didn\u2019t give any homework. In addition, homework should be done not right after or right before the lesson, but in between, spaced out so that the brain thinks this information is necessary, insulating the connections between neurons for easy and fast information retrieval in the future. If you don\u2019t do this, learn and revise repetitively, you\u2019re not going to learn it and keep it. A typical lesson is 45 minutes.This includes taking down who is present, who is absent, explaining new concepts, explaining old concepts, answering questions, asking questions, a surprise quiz, taking notes, doing exercises. Now, if I will be discussing a new topic, I will ask them to read the chapter - that\u2019s about 10\u201315 minutes. Reading is good for you, it relaxes, it helps with vocabulary and the more you read, the faster you become - I am helping them by giving them reading, in many subjects and not just my own. There\u2019s no point in having them read during the lesson while I just stand there and wait - if I\u2019m already there, we should be doing the parts that they need me for. And if we can\u2019t solve the last problem or two, I might leave them for them to do at home with the purpose of revision and cementing what they know. Nothing is \u201cjust because\u201d. A child does not need to participate in so many extra-curricular activities that they don\u2019t have time to do the most important one - learn how the world works. If you don\u2019t have time for school, you need to look at your daily curriculum. When I was in high school, I left home at 8 am and got back at 8 pm and my grades were good enough to get me into university. It is irresponsible of parents to park their children\u2019s days so full that they can\u2019t calmly do everything necessary and then blame it on homework. Of course, I don\u2019t know every teacher\u2019s motivation, so I\u2019m fairly certain there are teachers out there who give homework \u201cjust because\u201d, without taking into account the homework load the kids already have or how much time is required. However, this is not how I do it and I am opposed to abolishing homework. One can\u2019t expect to get a university degree without hard work, and at university, you will get homework. Getting homework earlier teaches students how to handle it, what works and what doesn\u2019t and how to handle stress better. One can\u2019t expect students to have it as easy as possible until it gets serious and then get all of the stress. Taking all things that cause stress out of the equation is as detrimental to our ability to cope with it as is getting rid of all microbes to our immune systems. So, in short - there\u2019s no point in doing things during class that students can do themselves without my help, we should be doing things they need me for. Homework helps you truly learn and there\u2019s no way around it. Abolishing homework that is reasonably thought out and takes into account other subjects and time in a day is comparable to removing all microbes from around children. ",

            "answer_text": "The teacher has the children for about 30 hours per week. The teacher\u2019s time is divided by 30 to 40 or more students. That is not much time devoted to one student per day. Children are restless, and it is difficult to keep their attention. There is a reason why elementary schools have more than one recess built into their day. The parent has the child for the remaining 138 hours per week. College and law students do not learn everything in class. Children learn even less during school. Teachers are constantly being told to raise standards, demand more, have the children do better on tests. The truth is, the teachers are not given the time nor the resources to meet the demands placed upon them. Homework is an opportunity for the child to learn and demonstrate proficiency in the subject. It is also an opportunity for the child\u2019s greatest role model, their parent to help them learn. ",

            "answer_text": "When does a transfer of knowledge take place?  The above statement ring true. We, teachers, want students to actively learn, and not just remember what they were taught. Remember, in a class of 40 students, some of the students may be daydreaming, not paying attention, drawing pictures, playing games, interested in the dreamy boy/ girl in the class etc.  And how do teachers ensure that students are learning each and every day? By checking the work of the students, of course! We give homework because homework tells us how much the student had learned and if they can apply what they were taught. Trust us, it is easier for teachers not to give homework. For each homework they assigned to a class, teachers have to spend time marking, correcting, recording and guiding students on common mistakes for 40 students. Teachers are willing to take on the additional load because they care about students\u2019 learning and progress. From the students\u2019 homework, you can tell the following: Who lacks the discipline to do homework and needs some discipline in the form of detention?Who is struggling with the lesson?Which questions stump most of the class?Does the class understand the lesson and is able to apply what they had learnt for the homework assignment?Identity who are not learning and problems / misconceptions in learning. Usually based on homework and assessments, I will decide who is required to come for remedial lessons so that they can catch up with the class. We, teachers, give homework because it allows us to ensure that the student is learning and applying what they had learnt in class. Homework helps students to apply what they had learnt, and allow teachers to keep track of students\u2019 progress. ",

Pretending to listen to a teacher in a boisterous class and hiding behind other students on team projects are not ways to get Mastery. Until one actually tries, on their own, to actually do the work, they will at best become, perhaps, somewhat familiar with the material. Struggling to set up the problem, making sense of the facts, realizing what the \u2018it\u2019 is that was just a new word a few minutes ago has now been transformed into a new human capability. Familiarity isn\u2019t worth much in a world where everything is available online. But knowing how, when, why to do the work- that is how humans add value. When students are in school they have the perfect time to become their highest and best selves- if only we give them that chance and require their best. I remain unconvinced that the teaching that schools claim to do is very highly correlated with the learning that might happen. If teaching really was a thing, why every student would be an \u201cA\u201d student. But they\u2019re not. Some students learn. Others don\u2019t. Both were \u2018taught.\u2019 Students get mastery by doing the work, not having it recited to them. ",

Especially in math. There is no way you give enough time to practice during school. It is just a reality. I am NOT a fan of homework and I rarely give it. That said, it certainly has its place but it needs to be relevant and short enough to not take over lives. ",

It can be fun work, but it always takes effort on the student\u2019s part. If you want to make that effort during class it will have to be many times more intense in order to be as effective as homework. ",

The advantages of having homework are: Teaching accountability.Exercising self study skills which will improve self confidence and self image: \"I can do it.\" Or \"I did it.\"Reinforcing what has been learned in class. Repetition and drilling cause the material to \"sink in.\"Structuring the day for children.An opportunity to express their individuality by doing projects, researching their favorite topic/s, writing creatively, putting together and producing a final project and more.Hope you find my perspective helpful. Good luck! ",
