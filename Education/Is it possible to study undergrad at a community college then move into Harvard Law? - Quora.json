            "answer_text": "Starting at a CC will not harm your chances at Harvard Law. The reason for that is that you will need to transfer from the CC to a university to complete your Bachelor\u2019s degree. Then you will apply to Harvard Law. We generally recommend that a student stay at a CC as long as possible, preferably finishing an Associates degree, before transferring. Studies have shown that students who finish an Associates then transfer to a university tend to do better than those who transferred earlier and even those who started at the university and never went to the CC. In addition to smaller classes taught by instructors instead of researchers or grad students, you will save thousands of dollars. ",

            "answer_text": "First, there is an assumption that you will be admitted to Harvard Law School either way. You will have great competition any way you do it. You will be in competition from the other Ivies, other high ranked schools, and legacies. They have a 15.7% acceptance rate, but you better have super high LSAT\u2019s, and a very high GPA. The LSAT\u2019s that seem to be accepted are in the mid- high 170\u2019s.with high GPA\u2019s. So they don\u2019t give data on the school the applicant attended but the LSAT\u2019s are in the 99 percentile. ",
