            "answer_text": "Distance education or distance learning is the education of students who may not always be physically present at a school. Traditionally, this usually involved correspondence courses wherein the student corresponded with the school via post. Today, it involves online education. While the exact start time of distance education is under debate, the earliest modern form can be traced back to Europe in the early 1800s. The earliest courses were pre-designed materials that would be mailed through the postal service to learners who could not attend universities either because of geography or the high cost of tuition and board. These early courses were called correspondence courses. In these early courses, there were no opportunities for direct interaction, such as face-to-face meetings or instruction. The student would send an order form in the mail and receive a set of printed course materials. The student would review materials and return assignments in the mail, which the teacher would grade. At the end of the course, the student would take an examination and return the results via post. This provided no opportunities for students to ask questions about assignments or have a discussion with their teacher as it would have taken days or weeks to correspond. ",
