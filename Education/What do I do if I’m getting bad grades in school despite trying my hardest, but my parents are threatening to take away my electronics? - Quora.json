            "answer_text": "You can start by voluntarily cutting down on the time you spend on your electronics, in case they really are interfering with your schoolwork. This can be tough because there\u2019s an addictive quality to social media, gaming, etc., but it\u2019s better to bite the bullet and cut down than have your electronics taken away completely. Be sure to let your parents know you are voluntarily cutting down on your electronics time so they can see you\u2019re making an effort. Make sure they see you studying and doing homework. They\u2019re less likely to take drastic action if they see you taking positive steps to resolve your issues. See how that works out, and if you\u2019re still having trouble in school, ask your parents if they will help you find and pay for tutoring or remedial classes in the subjects you\u2019re struggling with. You might also look for videos online that explain more about those subjects and might be more interesting than your teacher\u2019s instruction. Just be sure to avoid social media and other online distractions while you\u2019re looking for instructional videos. Your parents will probably want to help you all they can, if you show you\u2019re making a sincere effort. No one wants their child to experience failure. They are on your side and want you to be successful in life. Remember that! ",

            "answer_text": "The first step is why you are not succeeding despite trying your best. Talk with your teachers. They must see you trying your best and failing, so ask what they think is going on. Ask them to refer you for an evaluation from the school psychologist. Maybe you have ADD or a specific learning disability. You don\u2019t deserve to be punished if you are trying the best you can. ",

Your electronics are obviously not the problem here. Tutoring and support are obviously going to be the key ",
